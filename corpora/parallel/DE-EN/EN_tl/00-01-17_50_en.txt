Commissioner, Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Koch for his excellent report, which I do not have a great deal to add to.
I would like to take the opportunity just to point out that the transport of dangerous goods continues to cause major problems, not just in India, where I have just come from, but also within the EU.
We only have to think of the serious accident in the Mont Blanc Tunnel about a year ago, not to mention the one in the Tauern Tunnel.
We observe that there is always a possibility of major problems of this kind occurring where nature gives rise to troublesome phenomena such as mist, storms or cold weather, particularly in the narrow Alpine passes.
In general, I would urge that the transport of dangerous goods is transferred more to rail.
In this context, when planning future railway tracks or motorways, a preventative approach should be taken and the appropriate long-term solution built into the process early on.
I would remind you of the Brenner base tunnel, which has not been touched on even indirectly.
While I am on the subject, I would also like to point out that transport problems are one of the key issues facing the EU and call on the Commission to give due attention to this.
We need to have much more probing and vigorous debate on cutting-down on transport, heavy rail traffic, road pricing and railway privatisation, with a view to improving functionality.
Considering that enlargement towards the East will create a few more problems, then it becomes clear to us all that the future credibility of the EU will depend on whether, and in what manner, we succeed in sorting out the transport situation.
