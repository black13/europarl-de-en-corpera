Mr President, Commissioner, you are right, Commissioner, to bring pressure to bear on those Member States who have failed to transpose the flora and fauna directive, and that includes the Member State I come from.
You are right to do so because demands are being made on our natural habitats, and we must transpose these Natura 2000 regions at long last.
However, if that happens then of course we will have a huge need for LIFE-Natura funding, because of course we will also have to finance conservation measures in these areas, which are ultimately to be designated, and that at a time when we cannot even stabilise the things we have achieved with LIFE I and LIFE II.
Given this situation, i.e. that flora and fauna areas now have to be transposed with a vengeance, we will definitely need more money for LIFE as well.
This brings me on to the subject of the Council, which is a past master when it comes to decisions on expenditure, particularly in the sphere of foreign policy, which we then have to find the money for in our budget.
I need only mention the aid for Bosnia - we are cutting back on all fronts there.
On the other hand, the Council refuses to take a more long-term view and increase the LIFE budget by what is in fact a derisory amount in the context of the overall budget, for an area which, when all is said and done, is all about us creating sustainable development.
I cannot fathom this at all and expressly call upon all my fellow MEPs to support Mrs Lienemann' s motion on raising the funding to EUR 850 million.
