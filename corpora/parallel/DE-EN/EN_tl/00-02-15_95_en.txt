Mr President, my concern at this point is to highlight certain aspects, totally neglected in yesterday' s debate, of the LEADER+ programme which, hopefully, will soon be up and running.
However, first I should like to take this opportunity to express my full support for the focal points of the Commission' s new programme.
That applies in particular to the integrated, multisectoral approach which is gaining ground in the agricultural sector and which is highlighted time and again by national agricultural ministers in the Member States.
And greater emphasis on environmental protection in connection with rural areas in general is extremely important for the future of all of us.
Referring to farmers as the guardians of the countryside best expresses the preferred direction of future agricultural policy, and, of course, its transposition.
I also take it as a good sign that, thanks to one of the most fundamental changes to the LEADER+ programme, all rural areas and hence 80% of the total area of the European Union and 25% of the people in the 15 Member States will be able to benefit from the programme.
However, the total sum for the six-year period has been pitched low, too low, at EUR
2 020 million.
In addition, and this is what concerns me most, still no provision has been made for initiatives geared to mountain areas.
Parliament refers in the LEADER+ programme to the sparsely-populated areas of northern Europe, but not to the often equally thinly-populated and hence less favoured mountain areas.
Thank you for your attention.
