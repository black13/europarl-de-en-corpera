Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.
