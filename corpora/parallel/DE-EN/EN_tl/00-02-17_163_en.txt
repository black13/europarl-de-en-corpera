Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Tisza and Danube Rivers are currently experiencing an environmental disaster on a huge scale.
Living organisms in these rivers have been destroyed over many hundreds of kilometres and the drinking water for thousands of people is under threat.
The environmental disaster itself is bad enough but, to make matters worse, companies, politicians and the media in Romania have sought to deny and prevent news about this incident getting out.
When I read that assertions are being made to the effect that this is a conspiracy on the part of their Hungarian neighbours, I realise that now is the time for the European Parliament to make it clear to Romania in no uncertain terms that this is not the way we want to behave towards each other in Europe, or how we want to solve problems.
That is not how it works!
One has to consider the problems, establish the causes and do everything possible to prevent them from recurring.
As I see it, two things have happened here: firstly an international company has been negligent.
If this large vat of cyanide had only a flimsy protective covering then in no way does that accord with the environmental standards we have in Europe and other parts of the world.
Secondly, there are major loopholes in the environmental protection legislation in a country that is in the process of applying to join the European Union.
Three things need to be done: the European Union must deliver technical and financial aid with all haste, so as to combat this contamination.
This episode has shown that not only do we need rapid reaction forces in the military sense, we also need them for civil disasters.
Secondly, we also need to assist the Romanians in drafting new environmental legislation and standards.
Thirdly, we need a liability system for environmental damage.
This case demonstrates that environmental protection is part of the acquis communautaire and is one of the conditions of entry to our European Union.
