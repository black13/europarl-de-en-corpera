Mr President, the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability, which was put forward several days ago - on 9 February to be precise - cites the tanker accident that contaminated and poisoned the French coast
as the most recent incident in the series of environmental disasters caused by human beings.
Only a few days later we are able to add another terrible environmental disaster to the list.
These episodes always spring from the same sources, namely inadequate technology and also maximisation of profit, which is evidently prized more highly than the well-being of the environment, and of course the health and well-being of human beings.
Someone has already mentioned, in this connection, how vital it is for the European Union to provide both technical and financial aid.
However we must also make it clear to Romania that it cannot wriggle out of this, but must work hard at fulfilling the acquis communautaire.
In addition, I believe it is imperative that we draft and implement a directive on comprehensive environmental liability within the European Union with all speed.
