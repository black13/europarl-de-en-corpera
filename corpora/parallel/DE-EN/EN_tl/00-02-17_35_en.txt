Mr President, alarmed as I am at the prejudgement issued by 14 Member States, I maintain that the planned agreement can only signify a first step in the right direction.
The fact that we have laboured for years on this issue shows how difficult it is to see our work germinate community-wide, which is what we need so badly.
There is no doubt that we only be able to combat organised crime in a constructive and efficient manner if we take action at Community level.
The criminal has a natural headstart and this must be curtailed.
In this respect, the Di Pietro report has special significance, and I fully agree with Mr Schulz there, which is most unusual.
However I must also concur with the rapporteur when he states that this Council text does not make the grade in terms of offering a solution.
It is not homogeneous and nor is it systematic enough.
However, I believe that it could be substantially improved with the aid of amendments and I feel that in this case a little is more than nothing at all.
