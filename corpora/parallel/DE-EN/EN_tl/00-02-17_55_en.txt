Madam President, Amendments Nos 22 and 24 refer to the fact that the MEDA programme still applies to Cyprus and Malta.
This is unquestionably the case.
However, since we are concerned here with a regulation that is directly connected with the accession strategy, we ought not to get it mixed up with the MEDA programme in terms of the legal aspects.
But, by way of a compromise, and so as to provide a safeguard, I would recommend that the following sentence in the two amendments: 'knowing that Malta and Cyprus will participate in the MEDA-facility in the foreseen way' be added as a recital.
If the movers of the motion are in agreement with this, then I would recommend that the House votes on it and adopts it.
This would provide an elegant solution to the problem.
