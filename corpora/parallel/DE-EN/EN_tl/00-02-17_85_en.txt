- The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, presented an impressive programme yesterday and elucidated it with additional comments.
We are still talking declarations of intent, which must be followed up with deeds.
The commitment displayed by the President of the Commission gives us no reason to believe, at the present time, that these deeds might fail to materialise.
We are also in the President' s debt for adopting an appropriate stance in relation to what is going on the home political front in Austria.
Mind you, although I tried to follow his speech attentively yesterday, I may have missed something.
The President has recently set out his position vis-Ã -vis Austria in connection with the safeguarding of EU fundamental values.
However, I did not hear anything said about the happenings in Spain: not only have there been no happenings of this kind in Austria, I can tell you for sure that there will not be any in the future, indeed it would be unthinkable in a democratic Austria.
