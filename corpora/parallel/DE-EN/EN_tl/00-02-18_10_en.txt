Mr President, I abstained on the excellent report by Mr Viceconte even though it contains some excellent ideas and Bavaria, which I represent here, is one of the most attractive tourist regions in the European Union.
I warmly invite you to spend holidays in Bavaria and neighbouring Austria as often as you can.
But apart from that I wanted to say that I do not like the centralist approach adopted in the Commission' s communication.
I believe we need more decentralisation, more regionalism and less bureaucratic and centralist decision-making, especially in tourism policy.
That is why we should not get drawn into a centralist EU tourism policy.
