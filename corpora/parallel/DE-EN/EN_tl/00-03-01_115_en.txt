Mr President, although affronted by the fact that 14 Member States have prejudged Austria, I will now take a stance on the Katiforis report.
There is still a lack of optimism and also confidence in Europe, which we need if we are to think at all seriously in terms of positive economic development.
The reasons for this, as far as I am concerned, are manifold.
In Europe we have taxation systems that impede performance.
The average level of income tax is over 50% in Europe.
The very brave step taken by the Reagan administration in the 80s showed how a dramatic reduction in the level of taxation, from 70% to 28% that is, was able to stabilise the USA' s budget with lasting effect.
And the tax revenue from top earners did not fall when this reduction took place, rather the reverse happened.
In 1984, tax revenue from top earners actually rose from 17.6%, the level it was at in 1980, to 25.6%.
We in Europe should also find the courage to introduce a low-level taxation system.
Alongside this reason, however, other significant reasons lie behind the fact that economic development in Europe is not proceeding apace.
The barrage of legislation in Europe, coupled with over-complicated laws, has produced so much red tape that, in the end, it takes 11 weeks in effect to set up a company in Europe while it takes 10 days in the USA.
Surveys carried out at European universities have shown that 60% of students intend to seek work in the public sector and only 40% in the private sector.
We need more competition in Europe, particularly where the new technologies are concerned, so that objectives such as full employment and growth can be secured and sustained.
