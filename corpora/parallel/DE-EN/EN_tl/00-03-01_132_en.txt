Mr President, the first common regulations in the fisheries sector were adopted as early as 1970.
Over the years, the Commission has provided the Council and Parliament with a steady stream of communications on the market situation for fisheries products.
The object of the exercise was to debate the future prospects of a sustainable European fisheries policy, or rather, to redetermine the content, with regard to production, trade, marketing and various other spheres.
I can only make brief mention here of key words such as competition, security of production, quality of production, and others.
The report, which I endorse, also leads one to form the conclusion that the Commission is still a very long way off the realisation of its goal, that of developing a sustainable fisheries policy.
Several Articles and proposed amendments refer to the difficulties that have not yet been resolved.
The implementing regulation will clear a few matters up.
I also support all those evaluations that refer to the fact that the 265 000 fishermen working in the EC, who often live in remote coastal areas and who work and secure an income on the bottom rung of Objective 1 Regions, are not sufficiently well-prepared for the establishment of a common EU internal market, in view of the opening up of the world trade market.
I would also like to draw your attention at this point to the structural problems in pond management, and to the question of how it relates to agriculture.
Since I am unable to go into the current grey area in greater detail, I would propose that we use a new fisheries policy to make clear decisions in this regard as well.
