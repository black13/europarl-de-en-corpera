Mr Fischler, firstly a few comments on some of your answers.
We should come back to the Attwooll report again in the Committee on Fisheries.
I believe there have been some misunderstandings here, for example, where the database is concerned.
Mr President, in discussing the Hudghton report, we have now come to an issue that is very sensitive to my mind, for it relates to health.
At the same time, it is of vital significance in the true sense of the word, for as we have heard, diseases can endanger the stocks of many aquaculture enterprises overnight.
We are a long way off having this under control.
This report is about a disease termed infectious salmon anaemia.
Although, as we have heard, there is no direct threat to human health, we all know that consumers react quickly, and often extremely badly in such situations, particularly in my country.
The ultimate consequence of this is job losses.
It is not just the Scottish delegates that have a sad tale to tell there.
When a fish disease of this kind breaks out, the consequences are enormous.
There was a premature fish harvest on account of the disease, which led to the collapse of the Community market, with corresponding repercussions throughout the Union.
It is therefore in the interests of the Community to combat diseases of this kind.
This proposal is heading in the right direction in this respect.
I particularly welcome the flexible arrangements, i.e. the fact that a cautious approach is to be taken and enterprises are only to be shut down when this is truly justified.
We must not throw the baby out with the bath water!
At the same time, I must stress that this is only a step in the right direction.
There is still much to do and to this end, I urge the Council and the Commission to take up further measures; in particular, to create incentives for research into a vaccine, and what is more, for research into the origins and causes of fish diseases of this kind.
