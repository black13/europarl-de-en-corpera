Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Committee on Fisheries, and above all you, Mr Gallagher, for your report, and also for the deliberations that have taken place in committee.
I am able to reassure you that there are in fact no problems as far as the proposal is concerned, and I hope that the Community will soon be in a position, following Parliament' s adoption of the proposal, to fulfil its international obligations pertaining to bluefin tuna.
Regarding the criticism that has been voiced here in relation to the proposals that are still to come, I would like to remind you that the Commission is, after all, relatively new to the ICCAT, and has in fact only been a full member since 1998.
However, we will make every available effort to discuss any proposals the Commission still has to make, to communicate them to Parliament and, in addition, to speed up the decision-making process and the discussion with the Member States.
