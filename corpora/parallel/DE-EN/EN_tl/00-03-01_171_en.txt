Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Fisheries has worked very hard indeed to produce a balanced report.
Some people say in all seriousness that the decline in fishery stocks is caused solely by fishing.
That is wrong of course and it also diverts attention from objective statements.
I therefore call upon all parties involved to take account of the other factors causing reduced stocks as well, be they pollution, climate change, industrial activities, sea traffic etc.
Once again there has been an environmental tragedy off the coast of Europe, namely the sinking of the Erika off Brittany.
A combination of the aforementioned factors and inadequate supervisory measures at European level are the primary causes of a debilitated marine environment.
Fishing is an economic activity.
If we want a strong fisheries sector then we need to have stocks to catch and a perfect environment for fish to reproduce in.
The EU must develop conditions that will create a balance between environmental considerations and all other interests.
That is why we completely oppose one-sided measures that attack and weaken the fisheries sector.
It is wrong to ignore the technical and environmental realities.
Does it really make sense to equip boats less than twelve metres in length with a satellite control device?
Does it make sense to bias our efforts in favour of promoting coastal fishing although it is neither particularly environmentally-friendly nor capable of being monitored to an adequate degree?
These are just a few of the many questions raised by the Committee on Fisheries.
These examples show that it is simple enough to talk about fishing and the environment from a theoretical standpoint.
However, it is far less easy to come up with constructive measures based on the principle of sustainable stocks management.
We need even more wind in our sails here!
