Madam President, I would like to thank President Prodi for his clear exposition of the reform objectives.
We have made it clear in the course of the debates that we have been having in the past few weeks, in particular with Commissioner Kinnock - and in saying this I am taking up what Mr Cox said - that we cannot endorse the wholesale scrapping of independent financial control.
Decentralisation, yes, but we certainly require independent financial control, i.e. a unit in the individual Directorates-General which are, however, directly subordinate to the Financial Controller.
To do otherwise would be to make one and the same body responsible for authorisation and financial control.
We have spelt this out again and again, and also made it very clear in Mr Van Hulten' s report of 19 January, in paragraphs 10 and 11 to be precise.
Now so far I have not had sight of the White Paper and I would like to ask you Mr Kinnock: does it reflect our position?
I have a question concerning ex-ante control, which is still to be carried out where necessary, and on an independent basis at that.
I understood Mr Prodi to say - or I believe I understood him to say - that this ex-ante control will not take place as a matter of course, but neither will it be scrapped wholesale either, and the independence of financial control will be preserved.
Is this reflected in the White Paper?
I will read it with a great deal of interest and very attentively, but perhaps you could give me an idea now as to how these matters have been dealt with in the White Paper.
The question of transitional periods is worrying us.
The expression "soft law" has been bandied about but there is no such thing.
There is neither soft nor hard law.
There is only law, and no transitional period should be written into this reform, since this would lead to legal uncertainty.
