Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner Patten, the most recent steps taken by the Council on the European security and defence policy front are, to my mind, in flagrant contravention of the principle of democratic control with regard to military operations.
Whilst the three new committees are up and running as of today, the question of parliamentary control remains completely unclear and open.
The Portuguese presidency has already conceded this, whereas you, Mr Solana, have not said so much as one word about it.
We therefore demand extensive involvement for the European Parliament in matters of security when it comes to widening the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference.
The second way in which the Sintra meeting fell short was that although there are now efficient military decision-making structures, the concept of non-military crisis management is still completely nebulous.
However, the ability of the European Union to undertake non-military crisis prevention takes precedence in our view.
In other words: it takes precedence in terms of the sequence of events and European intervention, but also in terms of the provision of resources.
Hence, this is precisely the area where any increase in funding in the sphere of non-military capabilities must be concentrated.
Again, this is something you made no mention of whatsoever today, Mr Solana.
If you allocate 0.7% of national budgets for military armaments, then I wonder if it would not make a great deal more sense to earmark 10% of the EU budget for conflict prevention.
For then we would be able to save the 0.7% from the national budgets which is allocated for military purposes, and this is, of course, a much more significant amount.
