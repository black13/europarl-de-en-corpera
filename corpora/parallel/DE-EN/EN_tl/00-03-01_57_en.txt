Mr President, High Representative for the CFSP, Commissioner Patten, on behalf of my Group I would like to address one particular area alone, which falls both within the remit of the High Representative and that of the Commissioner, i.e. Turkey' s candidacy for accession to the European Union.
My Group was unanimous in its support for the decision reached in Helsinki to afford Turkey an option for accession with the proviso that this country, like any other candidate, must fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria.
My Group attaches great importance to the fact that Turkey is being encouraged to fulfil these criteria.
We have been concerned of late about the political developments taking place in Turkey, the arrest of the three mayors for example.
That is not moving towards fulfilment of the criteria; on the contrary, it constitutes a move in the opposite direction.
Hence my questions, Mr Solana, which could equally well be addressed to Commissioner Patten: how, and according to what timetable, is Turkey to be brought up to EU standards following the Helsinki decision?
Is there a list of tasks and a concrete schedule, in accordance with which, little by little, Turkey is to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria, notably the political criteria?
And what supervisory and monitoring instruments have been put in place, both by the Council and, more importantly, by the Commission, with a view to overseeing this process of criteria fulfilment?
