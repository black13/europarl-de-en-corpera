Mr President, you may be familiar with the saying: "you can say what you like on paper" .
The same applies to human rights: they are often formulated and written down, yet still they are not upheld in many areas.
Therefore, I have nothing but criticism for many such documents when it comes to women' s rights.
In principle, I believe that, as in other areas, it is only possible to reach solutions in the sphere of women' s policy on the basis of partnership and mutual understanding.
Women' s policy should not be formulated in such a way that it is as if women are working against men, rather women and men must join forces in order to seek and arrive at socio-political solutions.
Turning now to the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities: demands are being made to the effect that a balanced distribution of men and women within the EU institutions should be guaranteed.
Does that mean that a regulation on quotas is to be introduced?
Although a woman, I myself am against quotas, for I do not want to be a token woman.
Rather, I want to be assessed on the basis of my performance and not on the basis of my gender.
I know from experience that many women share this view.
