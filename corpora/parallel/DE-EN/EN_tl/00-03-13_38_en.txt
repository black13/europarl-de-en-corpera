Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly concerned about the information and knowledge society which is supposed to be promoted during the Portuguese Presidency.
Anyone who, at a time of mergers and rationalisation, wheels out the jobs argument to legitimise new technology needs above all to be clear about one thing: a just distribution of all the forms of work necessary to society can never be brought about by new technology alone.
To achieve that, we first need an initiative to redistribute work by radically cutting working time and sharing out the work of reproduction differently.
These proposals are not new but they are becoming more topical.
Why?
Because so far the debate on the information society has completely ignored the fact that only an elite with good technical training benefits from it!
To prevent a repeat of the promise of prosperity for all thanks to technology, but without any change to social structures, we need a debate on power and the distribution of resources.
Or have industrialisation, nuclear power and biotechnology led to greater justice in the past?
One important point is unfortunately missing completely from the debate, despite the fact that this House is otherwise so fond of consumer protection and mentions it so often.
The right to data protection does not appear in the Euro Paper nor is it part of the current debate on e-commerce.
I wonder what has happened to it!
Or has the evidence recently supplied of the 'Echelon' global bugging system already been forgotten?
If we wish to remain credible in developing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights then the fundamental right to privacy must of course be included in each of our individual programmes, in particular where new technologies are concerned.
