Before we resume the sitting I should like to make a comment which I always make at night sittings, but since faces change there are many people here who are not yet familiar with this.
I should like to request that you contribute to the sitting's reaching a speedy conclusion by keeping to the speaking times.
There are three reasons for this.
The first is the old party rule: the later the evening, the more rowdy the guests.
That does not apply to the plenary.
The second is that the people sitting behind the glass screens - the interpreters - also want to go home.
The third reason is that, as well as the interpreters, there are many others behind the scenes who have to work until the end of the sitting to ensure that, for example, the Minutes are ready for tomorrow.
So please, keep to the speaking times and we will make good progress!
