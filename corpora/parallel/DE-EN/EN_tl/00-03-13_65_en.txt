Mr President, this is a particularly important regulation given that it can no longer be said that 'we are destroying the environment' - we have done this for long enough already - instead it is now almost true to say that 'the environment is destroying us' !
It is now our task to counteract this.
In the industrialised countries, significant initiatives are being taken to preserve and protect the environment.
In the developing countries, however, intensive work still needs to be done on designing appropriate policies, strategies and projects to prevent further destruction and to care for the environment.
Measures need to be implemented which, for instance, take account of the consequences of developing countries being integrated into the global economy.
Nigeria can once again serve as an example here, as oil drilling there is causing commensurate environmental damage.
Here too, education and training measures need to be supported in order, in the end, to help people to help themselves.
The content of the regulation must therefore be supported in full, although the budget proposed by the Council is not sufficient by far.
That is why I should like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour, in particular, of Amendment No 11, so that at least reasonable financial provision is made, even if this falls well below the amount for previous initiatives and is still only around EUR 13 million a year.
Even at this early stage a considerable increase needs to be considered for when the Treaty or the regulation is revised.
