Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, safety on our roads is of great concern to us all.
Given the ever increasing volume of traffic on Europe's roads I am at pains to emphasise the need for vehicles to meet the highest possible technical roadworthiness standards, but also the need to take environmental aspects into account.
Although - and I should like to say this most emphatically - it is also necessary, if the directive is not only to pay lip service to these ideals, for it to be applied by the Member States and invested with appropriate penalties.
The best directive will be ineffective in everyday life if it does not provide any penalties for non-compliance or violations.
I therefore support the amendments providing for guilty parties to be punished, because the operation of motor vehicles, which in principle presents a risk and entails a potential danger to people, must be supervised properly and with the necessary care and expertise.
In any case we must prevent this from being dealt with thoughtlessly, precisely because this is about a directive which provides for rules not only for heavy goods vehicles but also for commercial vehicles carrying people.
Time and again we are all severely shaken when there are major accidents which are due purely to technical defects.
Because of this I am glad that the report is not actually controversial and that Parliament is once again proving to be the driving force in the debate about traffic safety on Europe's roads.
My particular thanks go to all those who work with such dedication in this field in the committee, in the Commission and in the Council.
