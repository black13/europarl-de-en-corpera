Mr President, I believe it is absolutely right to comment that we do not need additional competences where taxation is concerned, but what we do need to do, in my view, is consider how we can develop the various topics more effectively.
To quote but one example: the country of origin principle in matters of VAT.
Would it not be possible to start by making adjustments to the current VAT systems, so that harmonisation systems can be implemented more efficiently at European level?
Or another example: double taxation, which causes so many problems.
My question is this: will the Commission' s work programme include a schedule for this, or how do you intend to proceed?
