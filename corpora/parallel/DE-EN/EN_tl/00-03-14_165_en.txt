Mr President, Mrs Karamanou, firstly, as I am sure you are aware, my colleague Mrs Wallstr√∂m paid a visit to Romania and Hungary and was able to get an idea of the scale of the disaster at first hand.
She also reached agreement with the competent ministers of these countries on setting up a task force to handle these issues.
The key issues to be addressed by this international task force have already been established.
As far as the financial aspect is concerned, the Commission is in the process of looking into which funds could be made available for an emergency aid package.
In addition, the PHARE and ISPA programmes are of course available in principle, which brings us to the question - to be answered in conjunction with the States concerned - as to how much money could be employed from these two funds.
