Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is unable to give a concrete answer to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s question, at the current stage of negotiations.
To be able to calculate and determine the costs that enlargement will place on the agricultural sector, we would need to have a fairly precise idea of the following: a) when will the various countries join the EU? b) how many countries will join the EU at this time and in what order? c) what conditions will these countries join under?
For example, what transitional arrangements will there be?
Since not one of these three parameters has been established yet, and this is in fact the point of the enlargement negotiations, any estimate would be purely speculative at present, and we do not believe there is any point in that.
