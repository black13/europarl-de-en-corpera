Mr President, the LEADER I programme in Greece, which ran from 1993 to 1996, was fully implemented and the funding earmarked for this - EUR 104 million in total, EUR 52 million of which was contributed by the Community - was paid out in full.
The success rate of LEADER I in Greece also proved satisfactory, in view of the programme' s innovative and even-handed approach.
The LEADER II programme started in 1996 and will run to 2001, if one includes payment of the outstanding amounts.
Up until the end of last year, 1999 that is, the funding for the programme - which totalled EUR 364 million, the Community contribution being EUR 168 million - was completely tied up, but, as one might expect, had not yet been fully paid out.
However, since, as I have already said, the payments can still be made in the year 2000, i.e. this year, and also next year, it will not be possible to gain a full picture of how implementation of LEADER II is going in Greece, and what effects it is having, until the beginning of the year 2002.
Nevertheless, if the information we have received to date is anything to go by, the Commission has no cause to criticise the LEADER programme in Greece.
