Mr President, we have not yet given up on the goal of a common European label, at least that is my interpretation of the common position.
The eco-label may have suffered thus far from a lack of acceptance, but a working plan which allows for coordination with the national labels can only increase acceptance.
Our proposal in committee to automatically award the eco-label to products and services which already carry national labels and which satisfy the requirements of the European label did not, unfortunately, achieve a majority.
It would have afforded the opportunity to disseminate the European label even more quickly and effectively.
An important issue is the involvement of non-governmental organisations and associations.
It is essential that expert opinion and protection of consumer interests have some influence on the awarding process.
This can only benefit the status and merit of what the label stands for in terms of ecology and the consumer.
The aim of our amendments is to increase the participation of associations.
There is much to be said on the question of fees.
We need to introduce a system which covers the costs and it is therefore not right at this stage to fix maximum fees, which would seem premature until such time as we know the actual costs involved.
In this regard I would disagree with Mr Schnellhardt because it seems to me that even though the well-known national labels do give rise to costs, suppliers are still happy to acquire them.
It is right, however, that there should be a cost reduction for SMEs and for products from developing countries.
Overall, we must succeed in establishing the European label in Member States which do not have their own label.
If the common label has a function at present, it is that of filling the environmental label gaps in Europe.
The path which we are taking is the correct one, but a recognised common European label is not yet in sight and a major effort is required in this area.
