Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, The President of the Commission has proclaimed this to be the decisive year and I would urge you, Mr President, to use this as an opportunity to put the relationship between the Commission and the Member States on a new footing.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
Hitherto, this meant that in fulfilling this role, the Commission placed special emphasis on the rights of the Community, and rightly so.
But the unwritten rights of the Member States are there in the background of the Treaties and I believe it is high time that the Commission came to see itself more as the guardian of the rights of the Member States in the course of its work.
I would urge you, Mr President of the Commission, to also become the advocate for the rights of the Member States, for what frustrates us on occasions about the way the Commission works, is its attempt, under the pressure of getting things done, to lay claim to certain rights.
We must bear in mind that in future, more must be done to uphold the rights of the Member States.
This is pre-requisite to Europe' s gaining acceptance.
One example of this is the Federal Republic of Germany' s being composed of federal states, with the Länder having original rights.
They must also be recognised by the Commission.
It is difficult to imagine us amending the Treaty without the consent of Germany' s Länder, for example.
Therefore, Mr President, please cast yourself in the role of advocate for the rights of the Member States.
Accordingly, we demand a catalogue of competences that clearly distinguishes between the rights of the Community and those that reside with the Member States.
The Commission would gain a great deal of support amongst the citizens of Europe if it was to follow this course, and we urge it to do so in the strongest terms.
