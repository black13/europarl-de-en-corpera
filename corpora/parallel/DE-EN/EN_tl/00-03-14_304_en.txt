Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to your address very carefully, but I have not fully understood it.
I will read the communication from the Commission very carefully, but perhaps you can help me to understand matters.
Are you of the opinion that the Commission can block entire approvals for plans, or is it just payment of funds for individual projects?
That was not at all clear.
Let me say two or three things.
Firstly, I think that Community law must be seen as a whole.
Community law provides that if a Member State fails to implement legislation, or implements it incorrectly, the State will be brought to justice.
You should do that!
You should not try to achieve through the back door, through the non-payment of money, what you are unable to achieve through legal action and orderly process.
This is something which I do not think is quite right.
If you are saying that Member States are contravening Community law, breaching Community law, then bring these Member States to justice!
But to fail to do this in favour of the back-door approach of trying to stop the payment of money in order to indirectly force the hand of the Member States is something that I quite simply consider to be wrong and even cowardly!
Secondly, Commissioner, the Structural Funds are not given out to damage the countryside.
They are given out to create jobs and to kick-start the regions.
We must not therefore, in order to achieve another objective, obstruct or abandon the original aim of supporting disadvantaged areas.
What is more, it should not be the case that one Commissioner sets himself up as some sort of Supreme Commissioner who can then dictate to the other.
None of us want anything for the environment to be left undone.
But it isn' t on, Mr President, Commissioner, that regions might suffer because Member States are failing in their duties!
Here too we must watch out!
