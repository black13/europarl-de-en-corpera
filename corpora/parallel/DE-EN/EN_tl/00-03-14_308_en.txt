Mr President, Commissioner, implementation of the flora-fauna-habitats directive is causing quite a stir in many regions and also running into major difficulties.
Vaguely formulated application criteria are also the cause of the nine-year plus delay in implementation.
In my home region, a dialogue was begun prior to identification of the FFH sites.
The process brought the following problems to light in particular.
Small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises are experiencing a restriction in the utilisation and cultivation of arable and grazing land as a result of the directive.
This means indirectly a reduction in the value of this land.
In municipal areas the directive in its current form is leading to the obstruction of important infrastructure measures.
The threat of withholding Structural Funds in the event of non-implementation is an attempt by the Commission to put pressure on the Member States and is undoubtedly the wrong approach since stopping the payment of Structural Funds due to non-implementation also carries the risk that on-going projects may be jeopardised, thereby stopping or jeopardising the economic development of a region in general.
Without any doubt, this cannot be in the interests of the Commission.
It would be sensible to re-examine and revise Directive 9243 to provide more certainty and clarity.
Citizens have the right to know the consequences which they can expect.
Before notifying a site an owner must know which conservation objectives will be achieved using which measures.
For this reason, I ask that you support the amendment which I have tabled jointly with Mr Schnellhardt.
