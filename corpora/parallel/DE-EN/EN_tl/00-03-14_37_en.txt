Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, you should look to the right!
We could easily imagine that we were not in Parliament, but taking part in a board meeting of a large company.
That would make you the chairman of the board, so to speak, who has just presented a sound work report and draft.
Allow me to address a few comments to you, in your position as chairman of the board, on the subject of your fellow board members, as it were!
Like Brian Simpson, I consider your Vice-President, Mrs Palacio, to be doing a marvellous job.
In December, she succeeded in great style, working together with the Finnish Presidency, in opening the railway system.
She is also working very hard on something you, Mr President, brought up back in July last year, namely the issue of an effective European air traffic control system.
So far so good.
Mr Barnier' s proposals are equally impressive, for there has been excellent cooperation between Mr Barnier and Parliament on INTERREG and URBAN.
Mind you, we have yet to talk to him about ISPA.
Mr Simpson has already raised the question as to how we are to link our preparations for enlargement with transport policy, not to mention structural policy.
That is an important issue.
And so, Mr chairman of the board, I would say send these two board members our best wishes and congratulations, but tell one of the others that we are not satisfied with him.
Mr Liikanen that is.
For his approach to tourism policy is unacceptable and does not befit someone of board member calibre.
When one considers that more people are employed in the tourism sector than in the entire agricultural sector, and that tourism makes a greater contribution to growth than does agriculture, then Mr Liikanen' s decision not to put any new, strategic initiatives forward for tourism policy is scandalous.
Mr President of the Commission, please tell Mr Liikanen from us that he must do his homework!
We need a sound tourism policy for the Union.
