Madam President, Mr Pirker has not spoken on the agenda.
Clever as he is, he has taken cover under a point of order to give a short, two-and-a-half minute speech as to what we must forgive him for as an Austrian who also comes from Carinthia.
I should like it recorded that what Mr Pirker has said had nothing to do with the agenda.
I call on the President of the Council on behalf of my Group to continue to be as vigilant and critical of racism and xenophobia as you have demonstrated here, in whatever capacity.
