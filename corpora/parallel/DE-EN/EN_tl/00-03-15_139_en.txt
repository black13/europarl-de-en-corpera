Madam President, allow me briefly to correct what the President-in-Office of the Council said.
Two heads of government, Mr President-in-Office, have already been reprimanded by their parliaments for the steps which they initiated against Austria.
You therefore had no right to speak on behalf of their countries; on the contrary, you obviously spoke as the head of a socialist party.
At most, Mr President-in-Office, you can therefore only speak of twelve countries.
