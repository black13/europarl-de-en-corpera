Madam President, I seldom make use of these rules but I must do so now for the record.
During the debate, Mr Gollnisch, a member of the French extreme right, attacked me personally.
I should like to state the following for the record: I have nothing to take back as regards my statement that the extreme right is abusing this House for rabble-rousing purposes.
Mr Gollnisch stated for my benefit during his speech that his family, and these were his words, would never accept fascism.
That is where Mr Gollnisch clearly differs from his family, because he himself accepts fascism or, to put it plainly, he is a fascist.
Thirdly, I should like to state for the record that the fact that such speeches are given here fills me with consternation, as does the fact, which I ascertained from his loud applause, that Caudillos Le Pen is still allowed to sit in this House, despite the fact that he has already lost his eligibility for office on account of his prize fighting activities in the French election campaign.
