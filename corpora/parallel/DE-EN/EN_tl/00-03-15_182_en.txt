Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you expressly for stating during question time that Austria has not been found guilty of violating Articles 6 and 7 and that, in the case of Austria, it is a preventive sentence.
My question relates to the ad hoc decision by the Prime Minister concerning bilateral sanctions taken without consulting the foreign secretaries of the governments and parliaments of the states of Europe.
All the European Union institutions were bypassed and presented with a fait accompli.
Hence my question: what will happen in the future if we disregard the case of Austria now?
Will the national Prime Ministers of the countries of Europe pass judgement in future?
Will a majority of eight votes suffice or will a different majority be needed?
In what way do the European Council and the European institutions lose power and the potential to formulate policy as a result?
Is this a question of new competition between the European institutions and the national states?
