Mr President, I should like to follow on from what Mrs Lulling has just said.
I should like to say that Mr Haarder has made an exemplary effort to bring about a consensus.
As a result, his report was far better than all the previous reports.
However, I and a majority in my Group voted against the report because points 52 - 56 contain quite controversial social policy requirements which may well be supported by the left wing of this House but which have nothing to do with human rights.
The German constitution offers marriage and the family special protection and that has nothing to do with the violation of human rights.
On the contrary, it is a guarantee of human rights.
Marriage and the family form the basis for human rights, as does the right to life.
I therefore believe that these points should have been left out of the human rights report.
If they had, the House would have voted unanimously in favour of this human rights report because, apart from that, Mr Haarder has presented an exemplary piece of work.
