Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that Russia' s international standing has been seriously damaged by the Chechen war.
A full investigation of human rights violations involving international observers is also in Russia' s political interests.
Except that the Russian government does not appear to be totally convinced of the fact.
How else are we to interpret the fact that the UN envoy Mary Robinson was not granted access to Grozny and the filtration camps.
The agreement which has now been brokered with Mr Kalamanov by the human rights envoy of the Council of Europe, Gil Robles, is a step in the right direction.
But it will only continue to be credible if the two Council of Europe envoys really can work independently and move freely and independently around the country.
We reject and shall not accept any unilateral interpretation of the agreement by the Russian government.
If it should come to the point that the Russian government fails to keep to this agreement, the Member States of the European Union must bring intergovernmental proceedings against Russia before the European Court of Human Rights and ensure that there is an international investigation of the human rights violations, and I cannot but support Mr Paasilinna.
We too are required to put a halt to the expulsion of refugees in our countries, as the German government has done.
We too are required to grant Chechens political asylum in our countries.
It would make a great deal of sense if the proposals by the German government were adopted by all the Member States.
