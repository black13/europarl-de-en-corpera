Mr President.
Over a year ago, in February 1999, there was hope for new relations between India and Pakistan.
In the Lahore declaration, both presidents confirmed their determination to comply with the 1972 Simla agreement.
Unfortunately, the Lahore process came to a standstill during the clash over Kargil between May and July 1999.
The latest development in Kashmir is worrying.
We condemn the continuing human rights violations, the religious fanaticism, the sabotage and the terrorism.
The cause lies in activities by rebels who are operating across the border, across the line of control from the Pakistani side and systematically attacking unarmed civilians.
India has repeatedly accused the government and Islamabad of backing the guerrillas with technical and military know-how.
Border crossings have to be prevented along a 700 km stretch of country which is hard to monitor.
The political and military situation needs to be further stabilised in order to create a climate for bilateral talks.
The Indian government has already declared that it is prepared to resume negotiations, provided that the demarcation line is strictly adhered to and fundamentalist tendencies are checked.
When US President Clinton visits South-East Asia at the end of March - James Elles referred to this - and if we are to visit India in April as the SAARC delegation of the European Parliament, then the subject of Kashmir will need to go to the top of the agenda.
We must work on achieving a rapprochement between the two neighbouring states, the Islamic state of Pakistan and the multinational state of India.
It is up to Commissioner Patten and the high representative of the Council, Mr Solana, to ensure that the European Union has a chance to distinguish itself as a successful international mediator in conflict situations.
