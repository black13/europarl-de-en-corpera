Mr President, I should like to give a very brief explanation on behalf of the Austrian delegation of Socialists.
We voted in favour of this report because we believe that, a few statements notwithstanding, it is a good report, and I find the way in which parts of this report have been described during the explanations of vote totally unjustified.
We abstained on point 10.
We would have preferred a statement in keeping with the European Parliament' s resolution on Austria.
But as this point was accepted nonetheless, we voted in favour of the report on account of its fundamentally positive thrust.
