Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I understand what is being asked here.
But what I have to say to you is this: take a look around the House, it has already voted, with its feet!
The members have already left!
We cannot work seriously if we follow the procedure which you have suggested, Mr President; nor can we do so if we work here with random majorities.
Now more members may have left from one group than from other and that may well distort the vote on the Ludford report.
Even the rapporteur does not want that.
For the rest, we can still vote at 5.30 this evening.
That is quite in order.
I think we should work here with a properly-ordered procedure.
We have already overrun by 45 minutes.
I suggest that we vote this evening.
