Mr President, I am sorry but I asked for the floor at the start.
Two specific points.
First, I wanted to vote for, not against proposed amendment 24.
Secondly, I should like to say that there is a rule here, that it is standard practice to vote up to 1.30 p.m. on Thursdays and to leave the rest until 6.00 p.m., after the urgent votes.
We have done so for years and we can be flexible one way or the other pretty much as we please.
Perhaps all the members should be reminded of that.
Members are supposed to work here through to Friday, so that we can use the afternoons to see our visitors.
