Mr President, perhaps I can be of help here.
The rapporteur has stated that she agrees with your suggestion, i.e. with the President' s suggestion.
Allow me to recapitulate: the President said that we are to vote at 5.30 this evening on whether or not to postpone the vote until the next plenary session.
Please let us proceed thus.
Sarah Ludford has stated that she agrees with that.
So, we vote at 5.30 p.m. on postponing the Ludford report to the next plenary session.
That is my motion.
