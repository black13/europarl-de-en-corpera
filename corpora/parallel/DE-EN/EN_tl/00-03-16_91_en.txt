Mr President, I voted for the report despite many misgivings because it included Mrs Morgan' s excellent proposed amendment on minority languages and cultures.
I would also like to have seen support for Mr Vidal' s proposal.
But I think that we have taken an important step here towards greater protection of minorities traditionally present in the European Union.
We cannot keep setting criteria for candidate countries which we fail to meet ourselves.
