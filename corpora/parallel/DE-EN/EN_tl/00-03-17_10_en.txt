Mr President, I do not have any comment to make on the Minutes, but I do want to say something about the European Parliament' s information services.
I do not know whether I have picked the right moment to say this.
It does not concern the Minutes, but relates to something else.
Can I go ahead?
Right then, a fellow MEP has just given me the session news about the debate we had yesterday on the Ludford report, and I am disappointed to note that it makes no mention of the statement I made on behalf of our Group.
I would ask the parliamentary services to look into why it was left out.
