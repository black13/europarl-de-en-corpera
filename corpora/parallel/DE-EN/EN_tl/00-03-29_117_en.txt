Mr President, unfortunately the action plans of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration hardly do justice to the task in hand.
If you read the action plans carefully, you will see that most space is devoted to measures to combat illegal immigration.
This is not the only problem, however.
No consideration is given to development policy or foreign policy measures to deal with the reasons which make people flee and emigrate from these regions.
Although the High Level Working Group itself has concluded that human rights violations are an important reason why people flee, too little account of this is taken in the action plans.
Let us look at the situation in Iraq.
Clearly it is not easy at present to make suitable proposals for Iraq which might have some chance of being implemented, given the current political situation.
The same applies in Afghanistan, where one is uncertain as to whom one should even start discussions with.
Whom should we urge to respect human rights?
The way in which the High Level Working Group was set up and operates also gives cause for criticism.
The European Parliament was consulted on neither the appointments to the group nor the crisis regions selected.
This modus operandi is unacceptable.
Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar' s report is highly critical of the work of the High Level Working Group.
The report now gives us the opportunity to develop a new basis on which to evaluate the work of the High Level Working Group and my group therefore supports the rapporteur.
