Mr President, securing the future has always been a difficult issue, irrespective of whether it takes the form of a White Paper, deregulation, partnership or structural adjustment.
It is the financial situation which dictates future development.
The major topics are correctly positioned in the main report, but the report lacks content.
Fighting unemployment through economic growth is the greatest challenge facing Europe.
The Lisbon Summit announced the direction to be taken up to the year 2010.
We must therefore expect future intergovernmental conferences to substantiate how this is to be done.
Farmers and cooperatives expect the European Commission to reduce the amount of red tape in the agricultural economy and adopt budgetary guidelines based on calculation, reliability and progressive structures.
The Berlin resolutions set out agricultural policy up to the year 2006.
Farmers and politicians fought hard for this position.
If a premature review should be necessary, because the social analysis uses different standards, then let it only be in comparison with facts and figures, and let us retain what was successful, i.e. reliability, rather than dismantling Agenda 2000 piece by piece until what is left is hardly recognisable.
The ink was barely dry on the budget 2000 when Mrs Schreyer demanded a financial review and financial perspective for the priorities, together with action on negative expenditure.
Unless these funds are channelled back into the agricultural budget, Agenda 2000 will be jeopardised, especially as further technical inconsistencies are to be expected.
This is a policy based on rough estimates and founded on pure observation.
Of course, the Balkans must be reconstructed but, overall, in a spirit of social solidarity.
Then, and I am convinced of this, the farmers and cooperatives will also make their contribution.
