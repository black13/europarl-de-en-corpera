Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Mr Liikanen said at the Commission hearings that we will be around 1.2 million jobs short in the e-commerce sector by the year 2002.
Providing the quantities and quality needed therefore represents a real challenge.
Commissioner Schreyer, I should like to ask you if you can really tell us which budgetary lines create, maintain or destroy factories and/or jobs?
Is there in fact a valuation which we can use as a starting point to say which budgetary lines support the creation of new jobs?
Does DG IV have any scientific studies or papers on the subject?
If we have a budgetary procedure, can we then establish if the main priority which we have now set at European level has been achieved, and where new jobs are being created or where new jobs are being destroyed?
Today in question time I asked the Commission how many jobs are lost if manufacturing plants making products which cannot be exported because they are banned in Europe are closed down.
Commissioner Byrne quite rightly said that, as far as he was concerned, public health took priority.
This morning we discussed environmental protection.
Then it was said that environmental protection took priority.
I think we should find an objective procedure which safeguards new jobs.
We can only do so if there is proper representation of the confederations of industry, especially confederations of small enterprises employing up to 10 people.
I think that this sector should receive far more support in the future, including at European level, because this is where jobs are created, this is where new products are invented and where the future is shaped.
I think that also represents an opportunity in relation to the enlargement of the EU.
We must endeavour above all to include small enterprises.
That is an important function and social dialogue is needed here.
I would be pleased to see new initiatives in this area.
