Mr President, in principle we must welcome the fact that the Mediterranean area is again being seen more as a partner of the European Union.
I think the inclusion of Libya is crucial.
Libya in particular has a great deal of catching up to do in telecommunications now that the embargo has been lifted.
I visited Libya a month ago and found the people, especially the young, to be open-minded and most interested in Europe.
It was clear from talks with the rector of the university and students that the long-term embargo has left many young people traumatised by a feeling of powerlessness and being distanced from the north.
I think that now we must all do everything we can to prove to the people in all the Mediterranean countries that we recognise them as equal partners and offer them assistance, both in order to restore their trust in us as well as to solve their economic and social problems.
This will certainly be in the interest of both sides.
