Mr President, excuse me if I am a bit hoarse, but I have a cold.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested a split vote on this amendment.
I think that the first part of the amendment is uncontroversial, but there is a linguistic problem in the second part.
I think it is a translation-related problem.
It was the intention of the European People' s Party not to open a new debate but merely to re-confirm what Parliament had already decided recently, for example in the context of the Fifth Framework Programme on Research or in that of the Tannert report on the specific Framework Programme on Research.
It is therefore important for us to adapt the German language version to the wording also chosen for the Fifth Framework Programme on Research.
In this case, the English text is the original, and the German should read 'verbrauchende Embryonenforschung' , which are the words also decided upon by Parliament for the Framework Programme on Research.
It is not, therefore, a question of tightening up Parliament' s position but of emphasising what we have already decided.
The German must therefore read 'verbrauchende Embryonenforschung' .
