Mr President, firstly I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, for this excellent and extensive report.
However, as she herself did, I would like to point out a few problems which, in our opinion, are still important and which need to be remedied.
The allocation criteria, which are based on the average number of asylum applicants and recognised refugees and the nature of the projects, are perhaps not adequate to achieve a fair distribution of the burden.
In practice, the countries which take in the greatest number of refugees will probably receive the most funds.
Insofar as it goes that is okay, but it should not mean that the other EU States go short and, ultimately, that the refugees in these states, who are not particularly numerous, should be the ones to miss out on the benefits.
We must also deal with the actual money to be allocated, which must be in proportion to the stated objectives.
Financing must be ensured up to 2004.
So far, the balance sheet has not made any clear statement for the period after 2001.
If we can resolve this issue, then we should do so.
Only in this way can the European Refugee Fund be used sensibly and efficiently.
