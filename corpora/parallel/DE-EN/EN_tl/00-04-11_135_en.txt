Mr President, Commissioner.
I concur with Mrs Maij-Weggen' s question.
I have taken part in several election observation exercises and, according to the principle of "do good and be seen to do good" , we, and I do not mean just I, have often remarked that visibility was often lacking.
Now I am all in favour of our continuing to work together with the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
However, it is a poor show that we, the European Union bear all the costs, as is often the case, and yet nobody even notices that the European Parliament is present to observe the elections.
I think that we should take reasonable account of visibility in this context.
Secondly, Commissioner, I should like to ask you when you intend to have at least the basic structure of your rapid reaction facility up and running, because it is also important for Parliament' s work?
What sort of timetable should we be working towards?
Thirdly, Commissioner, not all, but many crises to which we must react can be prevented.
Are you satisfied with the state and development of crisis prevention or do you want to couple crisis prevention to the rapid reaction facility?
