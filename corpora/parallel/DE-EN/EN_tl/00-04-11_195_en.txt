The honourable Member is right; it is in fact fundamental if the Union' s reputation is to be enhanced that both the time lag which I mentioned between promises, to call a spade a spade, and specific contracts must be reduced and payments must be made when invoices, i.e. substantiated payment applications are filed.
Of course benchmarking means that no more than 60 days should lapse and, as I said, more and more payments are being settled within this period.
Of course the aim is to have few, if any exceptions.
