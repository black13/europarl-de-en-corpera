Mr President, tomorrow' s vote will be a litmus test of Parliament' s responsibility and credibility.
The main point, for us, is liability and compulsory insurance.
If genetic engineering is as risk-free as the industry and Mr Liese insist, then why is there such huge resistance to strict liability?
We too want general environmental liability, but we know that no provision is made for the corresponding liability for genetic technology or for general liability in the Commission proposal, which is why we have proposed compromise Amendment No 45, containing just that.
Anything else would amount to
hiding behind a long-term policy of wait-and-see and endless prevarication.
It is ridiculous to say that all we are asking is that the Commission should do this by the year 2001.
What will happen if it does not do so?
What will happen if horizontal environmental liability does not properly cover the area of genetic technology or, Mrs Wallstr√∂m, as you suggest, only covers the Natura 2000 areas?
The second main point for us is the ban on antibiotic-resistant genes.
We need a clear ban here.
I cannot understand, Mr Bowe, why you said that we will take a softer line tomorrow.
Is that your sop to the genetic engineering industry?
I think that it is quite clear - as scientific studies have proven - that more and more human pathogens are becoming resistant and it would be a disaster if antibiotics were to be permanently lost as a form of treatment.
My last point concerns genetic contamination.
I think that we need a clear commitment here on the part of the Member States and I hope that tomorrow' s vote will send out a clear signal on environmental and consumer protection and that tomorrow will not be a black day in the history of environmental and consumer protection.
