Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has proven its far-sightedness on this matter and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs from the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Agriculture for their work.
They have approached the issue with the same consistency demonstrated by the European Parliament.
Allow me to refresh your memory: compulsory registration has applied for a long time, because Regulation No 820/97 entered into force on 1 January 2000.
The postponement adopted is not lawful.
The European Parliament has filed charges against the Council because the postponement was not within the Council' s discretion.
Nor did the Commission come up smelling of roses here.
It was the Commission which proposed this seemingly elegant but legally dubious procedure.
If nothing is done, compulsory labelling will enter into force on 1 September 2000.
The Commission is therefore urged to accept the European Parliament' s proposals in this codecision process by 1 September.
We have tried in our suit to ensure that no equally elegant attempt will be made to implement an extension on 1 September - and I hope that we shall succeed in putting a stop to this.
If we cannot agree on Parliament' s proposals by 1 September, then the old regulation with the compulsory system will enter into force.
I therefore hope that you will implement Parliament' s reasonable proposals and that you will give up your plan to postpone this once again until the year 2003.
It will confuse our citizens and will certainly meet with decisive resistance here in Parliament.
