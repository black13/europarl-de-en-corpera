Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking everyone who has worked so constructively on this report.
The compulsory registration system for bovine animals due to enter into force is the sine qua non for a reasonable beef labelling system.
As a farmer, I am concerned that every consumer should be able to trace where his schnitzel has come from.
All farmers are proud of the quality of their products and it is therefore in the farmers' interests for everyone to know whom they have to thank for their extremely safe and healthy food.
Such a system must be practicable if it is to achieve its objective.
We must take account of how the procedures will be applied in practice.
Because of the varying topography of Europe, its farmers must apply different working and production methods.
Take the example of summer pasturing in the Alps.
As you know, every spring a total of 400 000 cattle are driven on to the Alps in Italy, Austria and Germany, where they remain for the summer, i.e. for about three months.
Consideration must be given to the pasturing lists which are already in use and which take account of this situation in order to avoid forcing additional unnecessary administrative costs on farmers.
As we have said, traceability must be guaranteed in all cases.
But the regulation must be adapted to actual and local circumstances if it is to be seen as anything other than EU harassment, which merely triggers abuse and if it is to gain acceptance among the people.
I therefore hope that proposed Amendment No 19 to Article 7(1) second indent will be adopted by the entire House.
It has already been adopted by the Committee on the Environment and in the Committee on Agriculture.
