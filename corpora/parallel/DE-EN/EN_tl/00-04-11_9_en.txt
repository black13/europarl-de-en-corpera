Mr President, I have a request; every member has a very precise timetable.
We agree on a great number of deadlines in the citizens' interest.
Today, yet again, the sitting has been brought forward, this time to 8.30 a.m.
I think it would be conducive to greater overall efficiency if we stuck to a basic programme and stopped changing arrangements at short notice.
Thank you for your understanding.
