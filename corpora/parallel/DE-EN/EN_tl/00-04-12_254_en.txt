Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all in favour of securing future financing for pensions, having an equitable and stable inter-generation compact, and creating a workable, clearly defined three-pillar model that increases the individual' s range of options and supports the mobility of employees.
All of us here say "yes" to minimum rules because they increase mobility.
We are all in favour of having clear minimum rules alongside supervisory rules.
However we do not agree - and this is a matter of regret to me - on what we mean by supplementary company pensions.
We are not in agreement on whether supplementary company pensions supplement the first or the third pillar.
We do not agree on the opportunities employees should have to participate.
There is a reason for this.
The reason is that each of our countries has a different system, although we have the same headings: we have different tax provisions, different levels of performance, different cultures and a lack of mobility.
I will therefore tell you what I think: I am in favour of having a single market for financial services and liberalising the market, but, when it comes to supplementary company pensions, protective mechanisms must be put in place for employees, and the social market economy must be stimulated.
Therefore I also advocate that the supplementary pension packages, which include biometric risks, should offer special advantages to those entitled to benefits and to society as a whole, and that they should therefore receive preferential treatment, whilst allowing people to retain the option of choosing one of the others, because what I do not want is for those who are mobile to be socially worse off than those who stay at home.
