Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, As someone who has become involved in politics through student, youth and educational work, I am delighted that the "Youth" action programme is making an important contribution to fostering a knowledge-based culture within Europe.
We welcome the exchange programme because it reinforces mutual trust between the young people of different countries and encourages mutual tolerance, and a willingness to cooperate and show solidarity.
What goes on in the heads of young people of today has a special resonance for the future development and functioning of the European Union and European consciousness.
I would like to concentrate on two Articles in particular: firstly Article 4 (2), because it refers to the fact that our overriding concern must be to ensure that when young people apply to the programmes they do not encounter any form of discrimination.
Then there is Article 2(1), because it states that participation in cross-border exchange programmes within the Community will further young people' s understanding of Europe' s common core values, thereby increasing respect for human rights and stepping up the fight against racism.
I am emphasising these two aspects because, as Mrs Pack has already said, the sanctions against Austria are having most impact on cultural organisations, and the educational and scientific spheres, as well as on scientific cooperation.
This contradiction illustrates how un-European and discriminatory these sanctions are, and how much they conflict with the Community of law and values.
We endorse the "Youth" action programme and reject the uncalled-for sanctions against Austria!
