Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to inform you of the Committee' s key demand.
It is about extending codecision to all aspects of agricultural policy, which is something that still remains to be done.
The Treaty of Amsterdam led to a strengthening of the European Parliament' s powers, inter alia by extending codecision to various policy areas.
However when it comes to agriculture, it is only when health policy and public health are under discussion that Parliament has codecision rights, as per Article 152, for the core area remains outside the codecision procedure.
There is no justification for this in our eyes.
The common agricultural policy is the most long-established and evolved Community policy.
It is absolutely vital, particularly as we are talking about a huge budget (which actually accounts for half of the European Parliament' s total budget) for the European Parliament to make full use of its supervisory powers and its powers in the legislative sphere.
It should also be pointed out in this context that we are not in competition with the national parliaments.
They no longer have any decision-making powers where agricultural policy is concerned either, for this is a policy that is decided on purely by the executive - the Council that is - in the form of legislative acts.
Hence this is not about a clash between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, it is about making this policy subject to parliamentary control in the first place.
I call upon all my fellow delegates to do everything they can to persuade their respective governments to have codecision extended to agricultural policy at this Intergovernmental Conference.
I would like to thank those who will be representing the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference, as I know they will pursue our concerns with great vigour.
