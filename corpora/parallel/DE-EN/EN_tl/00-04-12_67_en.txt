Mr President, I understand perfectly that it is an honour for us to receive a distinguished guest of state.
However, I would ask you, when the Bureau next meets, to address the question as to whether it is a constructive use of time to interrupt a vote that we need a qualified majority for and for which there are only seven or eight proposed amendments.
I would urge you to address this matter in the Bureau.
