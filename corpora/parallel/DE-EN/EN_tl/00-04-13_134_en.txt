Mr President, Parliament has been dealing with the situation in and around Chechnya for some time.
We have followed with concern developments in the fundamentalist Islamic forces' attempts to split Chechnya away from the Russian Federation.
We are categorically opposed to any form of terrorism and we support the fight against terrorism in every country in the world.
I believe that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country is an inviolable and fundamental principle.
However, for several months a war has been raging in Chechnya which none of these arguments can justify.
I spent over six years of my life in Russia and have very close ties with that country.
So I feel it all the more that Russia is totally overreacting in its use of military force in the Chechen conflict.
I find it totally unacceptable that we are witnessing violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian army.
It is a matter of deep regret and profound concern to me that militaristic thinking has now again taken hold in Russia.
It has long been recognised that military might never permanently resolves any conflict, and this needs to be remembered now.
It is high time that this war ended and that a political solution to this conflict was found, no matter how difficult and complicated that might be.
Furthermore, an enormous effort is required to restore this devastated region for the people who have lost all their possessions in the war and to make it habitable once again.
In the long term, this is the only way to remove this focus of conflict.
My Group supports this motion for a resolution, and we consider it essential that this Parliament, in conjunction with the members of the Russian Duma, should seek means of restoring peace in Chechnya without delay.
