Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy needs to be based not only on fundamental moral values and principles, but also on success in achieving its aims and objectives, and this should not be confused with opportunism.
I therefore support everything that has been said here about condemning the barbaric war being waged by Russia, which is a war that recalls the darkest days of the Soviet Union.
What we want to see is a new Russia, not a seamless transition from the Soviet Union, but a new Russia.
To my mind, it very much remains to be seen whether the new President Putin can guarantee this, certainly on the basis of what we have seen so far.
So there is no alternative to condemning this war and saying that although we certainly condemn terrorism we regard Russia' s reaction as being totally disproportionate, inappropriate and unacceptable.
That is what we should condemn.
But we should not fool ourselves into imagining that in this case we simultaneously want to achieve something important for peace in Europe and throughout the world as whole, that is to say a dialogue with Russia and ultimately a partnership with Russia.
Unfortunately, Russia is only accepting this in words, not in deeds.
That is why I think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists.
It is the job of the Council Presidency and the Commission, whilst at the same time defending moral values and condemning this war, to endeavour to ensure that we support those forces which are all too poorly represented in Russia, but who nevertheless wish to pursue a European path, a path towards a European partnership, a partnership with the European Union.
This is the formula we need: condemnation of the war and a visit by the delegation, after which we must take whatever steps are necessary.
And if those steps have to be harsh ones, then we should, in full awareness of the facts, not shrink back from taking them.
