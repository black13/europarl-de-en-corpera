Mr President, as you are calling on each Member in his own language, perhaps you could address me in Bavarian!
Eight years ago I was rapporteur on Tibet.
In 1992, I presented a motion for a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the European Parliament.
It is with some dismay that I have realised today that eight years later the same motion for a resolution could be presented on the same grounds, lamenting the same poor, nay appalling, conditions in Tibet.
The Tibetans' human rights are being trampled upon and their cultural and spiritual heritage is being threatened with complete extinction, especially in Tibet itself.
Nature and the environment are being polluted and damaged to an extent never seen before.
Millions of Tibetans have no human rights, let alone civil rights.
Above all, they have no right of assembly, no freedom of association, and no right to freely practise their religion.
For this reason we are calling on the Chinese Government as a matter of the greatest urgency to seek a political solution for Tibet through discussions with Tibet' s political and religious leaders, on the basis of the proposal made by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.
Mr Mann has made it unnecessary for me to reiterate this.
But I would like to stress this point: if a people is prepared to fight for its autonomous status without questioning borders and without separatist tendencies, then we should really be supporting them, as they are setting an example for our own European Union model!
