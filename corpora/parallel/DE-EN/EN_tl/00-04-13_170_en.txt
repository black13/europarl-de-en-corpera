Mr President, my Group firmly supports this resolution.
We owe a debt of gratitude to the USA for defeating two totalitarian regimes, for defeating national socialism and communism, and for establishing democracy and the rule of law throughout our continent.
Nevertheless, the existence of the death penalty in the USA means that they could not join either the Council of Europe or the European Union.
That means that we should tell even such an important partner as this one, in no uncertain terms, that they should finally abolish the death penalty at individual state level and all the more so at federal level.
The American election campaign could provide a unique opportunity to send a strong message about this.
Sad to say, just the opposite has happened, and the candidates are vying with each other in a populist way on this issue.
However, we believe that the Atlantic Alliance is founded on democracy and the rule of law, so that the right to life should form the centrepiece of the legal system in both the USA and in Europe.
That is why we want to state unequivocally in our Charter of Fundamental Rights that we support the right to life and that we are opposed to a culture of death as typified by the death penalty.
