Mr President, thank you very much for letting me speak for the second time today.
The recent presidential elections, which not only observed all democratic norms but also marked the end of the 50-year rule of the Kuomintang, secured the presidency for Mr Chen Shui-bian.
The newly elected President reflects Taiwan' s democratic maturity.
This makes the behaviour of the People' s Republic of China all the more worrying for us, as before, during and after the democratic elections in Taiwan the Republic did not cease to make in some cases totally unacceptable threats towards its little brother.
I realise, of course, that the People' s Republic of China does not understand the word democracy.
Nevertheless, there is no need for them to start panicking just because democratic elections are taking place in a neighbouring state.
Unfortunately, democracy is not infectious!
