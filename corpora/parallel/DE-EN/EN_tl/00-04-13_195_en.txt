Mr President, there is a drafting error in Paragraph 2 of this resolution.
I would like to propose - and this is in fact correct in the German version - that we should forward this resolution to the High Representative for the CFSP.
But it then continues: "forward this resolution ... and the governments of the Member States" .
I would like to propose an oral amendment so that it reads "and the governments of the Member States, of the United States and of Iraq" .
