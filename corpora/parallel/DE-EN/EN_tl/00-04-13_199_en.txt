Mr President, this morning we had a debate on whether or not, in future, the House should meet in plenary on Fridays.
A possible justification cited in favour of change was that the agenda is generally relatively uninteresting and that something should be done about this.
For that reason, and in order to establish whether a quorum is guaranteed on Thursday afternoon when there is an interesting agenda and very important votes, I request that you establish the quorum.
