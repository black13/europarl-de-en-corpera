Mr President, I think it is terribly sad that when we are about to take such important votes some people are trying to obstruct this.
I have heard that some Parliamentary staff worked until 4 a.m. so that we could vote on the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report.
I would like to sincerely thank those staff on behalf of my Group, and, I hope, on behalf of all of us.
They work very conscientiously and we should be just as conscientious when it comes to voting!
(Loud applause)
