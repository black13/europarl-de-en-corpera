Mr President, I rise to speak about the vote on the Chechen resolution.
During the debate and also during the efforts to agree on a compromise amendment, it emerged that there is a large majority who are of the same view as regards policy and substance.
It can only be a matter of tactics if, at this stage, having adopted six resolutions already, we say the same thing, or virtually the same thing, once again without any serious debate with the Council and with the Commission.
For this reason I would like to make this appeal to Members in the other groups: first of all, let us send the joint delegation to Chechnya.
Everyone has agreed to this specific proposal.
And then, when the delegation has returned, we can hold a major debate on Chechnya in conjunction with the Council and the Commission, and at the end of that debate .....
(The President cut the speaker off)
