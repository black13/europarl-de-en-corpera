Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must put an end to the tug of war over a system that complies with the WTO Agreement.
The EU has not exactly covered itself in glory in this almost endless debate.
I respect the Member States' efforts to protect their banana producers against a considerable loss of income, but such considerations cannot justify persistently refusing to comply with agreements under international law.
It should be our objective to create a market organisation consistent with the WTO dispute settlement body' s proposals as soon as possible, chiefly in the interests of companies which, because of the introduction of the COM in bananas, have been forced to accept financial losses which have threatened their very existence.
This is also in the interests of those who have been hit by the punitive tariffs imposed by the United States.
No one should underestimate the adverse impact of export restrictions of this kind on the economies of export-oriented countries, and above all on related jobs.
This is an area where some Member States are indulging in protectionism at the expense of others.
We pay subsidies to banana producers, we have to grapple with punitive tariffs, and we have to pay excessive banana prices in our supermarkets.
Those Member States who want to continue with these restrictions have to recognise that they are partly to blame for the current situation, because they have quite simply forgotten to make structural changes in the field of banana production.
The lack of competitiveness of EU banana production cannot be allowed to justify a refusal to accept uniform and non-discriminatory access to the European market.
