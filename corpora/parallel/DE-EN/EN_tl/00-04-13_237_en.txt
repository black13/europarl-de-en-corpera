Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Amendment No 39 by mistake.
In fact I reject it for the following reasons: this amendment is based on the assumption that neither the Commission report nor the European Parliament' s Kuckelkorn report give any impetus towards structural reforms in the Member States of the European Union as regards reforming retirement pensions.
The opposite is true of course.
Right now there is a considerable need for reform in Member States' retirement pension systems.
I therefore believe that any impetus given by the European Union and by the European Parliament will assist debate in the Member States, where we still have more questions than answers.
