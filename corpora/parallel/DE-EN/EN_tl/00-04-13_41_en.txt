Madam President, I would like to make some brief comments on the four amendments before us.
My general view is that such a broad-based compromise, that has the support of the four largest groups in this House, should not be called into question again by amendments.
However, assuming that the compromise - and I would once again like to express my sincere thanks to all those involved in achieving it - remains unchanged in other respects, I would ask you to vote for Amendment No 1 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, because it includes a sensible addition.
However, I must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 3, because in terms of content they would have too great an impact on the overall compromise.
I also have to reject Amendment No 5.
I think that it is legally unacceptable, because it sets aside the clear provisions of Rule 161 of our own Rules of Procedure.
The amendment is essentially about a vote on the explanatory statement in my report.
As far as I know this would set a precedent which every Member of this House would be justified in referring to in future.
The President has accepted Amendment No 5, and out of respect for the authority of her position, I accept this decision.
