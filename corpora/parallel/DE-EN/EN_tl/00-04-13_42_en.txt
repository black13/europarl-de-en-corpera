Madam President, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, Chairman of the Socialist Group, also directed a comment to me.
Last Monday we did indeed have a wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the admissibility of this question, and on whether, as chair of the committee, I should make use of Rule 161.
Almost every member of the committee spoke on this.
I myself have several times looked into the connection between the resolution, as it now appears in the compromise, and the explanatory statement, which reflects the rapporteur' s position and is her responsibility.
I established the connection, and I said in the clearest terms that the language in the explanatory statement before us is very harsh.
Nevertheless, I do not think I should comment on the style and choice of words in a censorious way, because I would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement.
As I see it, there is a factual connection and I therefore decided not to reject this explanatory statement and informed the committee accordingly.
