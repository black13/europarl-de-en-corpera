Madam President, we have an amendment before us which allegedly sums up the substance of two observations by the Court of Auditors very concisely.
If you think it is necessary, I can read out the full wording of these observations, although personally I would prefer not to.
I just wish to say that I am opposed to this amendment, because I really do not think it serves any useful purpose for us to include tendentious summaries of official documents in our parliamentary documents, even if said summaries are tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
