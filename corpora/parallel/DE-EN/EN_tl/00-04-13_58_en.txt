Madam President, we will not, of course, withdraw this point, because it is at the heart of our amendment.
This is about calling on the administration to present an action plan by 15 May describing exactly how improvements can be made.
We do not want a list of measures, that can come later.
There is nothing contradictory at all about this.
We are talking about a concrete action plan setting out how quite specific improvements in procurement, buildings and human resources policy can be achieved, and I call on the House to vote for this.
