Madam President, this amendment has been tabled under the Rules of Procedure and it should be voted on accordingly.
If it is rejected, we can then switch to the rules suggested by Mr Corbett.
That is the simplest approach.
Let us have a vote on the amendment, and if it is rejected, we can proceed as Mr Corbett has suggested.
