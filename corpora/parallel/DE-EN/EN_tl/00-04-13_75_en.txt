Madam President, I have the highest regard for Elmar Brok, but in this case he is mistaken.
The only point of the compromise amendment was to add the word "continuing" in English or "anhaltend" in German to "serious" , which is "schwerwiegend" in the German version.
That is the old text.
We have not agreed on the four-fifths majority, so it is just too late for this now.
We cannot split this again now.
