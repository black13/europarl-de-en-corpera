Mr President, I voted for the Dimitrakopoulos report, although I do have some reservations about it.
The Dimitrakopoulos report does not go far enough for me in terms of EU federalisation and integration.
I believe that we should go much further, and move more determinedly, towards federalisation and away from nation states, towards the regions and the peoples of Europe.
I hope, even if the omens for this Intergovernmental Conference are not the best, that there may still be an opening here or there.
I am enough of a realist to know that this is a gradual process.
That is why I voted for this report and I hope that we will take many more such steps in the near future.
