Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Daul and Mrs Lulling that, in debates on the Rules of Procedure, you must always bear in mind that there are also tactical and strategic aims coming into play.
It is no different for you than for those colleagues who tried what they did.
For the first time this morning I joined in the request for the quorum to be established.
I am a supporter of Strasbourg and a supporter of Fridays.
However, I am of the opinion that those who wish to ensure that the work of Parliament continues to be carried out should also be present.
I therefore thought to myself that a warning shot was in order; what then happened I thought went too far and I did not want to fall into line because I thought that it was about Strasbourg and Fridays.
For that reason, I did not go along with it any further.
But the fact that those delegates did what they did you have to grant them.
You then have to respond accordingly.
The Rules of Procedure, and I would like to pay my respect to the President here, were sensibly interpreted this morning with great composure and great calm.
Matters proceeded as was established.
The votes which were carried out are proper votes.
They are no less valid because only a few delegates participated.
I consider that, by exhorting our colleagues, and also the Groups, to be present, we should try to rescue these Friday debates and these Friday votes and to bring about a positive outcome.
