Mr President, I too would like to congratulate you on the way in which you have conducted this difficult session and I would just like to say something factual to my colleague, Mr Meijer.
I have been in this House for 21 years in all, although only 6 of those as a parliamentarian.
I have taken part in every Friday session for 21 years, even when I had another job and was not a delegate.
In this regard, I would also like to thank the staff who work so exceptionally on Fridays.
However, irrespective of that, I would like to say that I have repeatedly seen such attempts over these 21 years.
For this reason we introduced a quorum for determining the quorum because we wanted to rescue Fridays.
That is how all this came about.
However, I would like to say to Mr Meijer that at some point it was also decided that we would pass legislative resolutions from Tuesday to Thursday and not on Fridays, for which the quorum is not prescribed as compulsory, when we would deal with issues which are not controversial so that resolutions which are not controversial, but important nevertheless, can be passed.
That was the consensus, and this consensus was reached here.
Perhaps it is a healthy shock and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is perhaps right.
But I would ask you to clearly understand that Friday was never intended for legislative resolutions.
These resolutions are not legislative.
They are, however, important and they are consensual.
We should therefore be able to pass them peacefully and in a dignified manner, and that is why, at the end of the day, we have passed them peacefully and in a dignified manner.
