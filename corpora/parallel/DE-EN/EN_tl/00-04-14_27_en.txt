Mr President, two points on the Rules of Procedure: the first is that I would ask you, the chair, not just to look to the left, but to kindly look to the right also to see if anyone here wishes to speak.
My second point is an appeal to the delegates.
The point which is currently on the agenda, night flights, gives us the chance to carry out a roll-call vote.
If you want that, and I consider it very reasonable, we should carry out this vote.
