Mr President, in the heated debate on the matter of the quorum I did not get a chance to speak before about my motion for the Rules of Procedure.
Yesterday, there was a question from Mr MacCormick on the postponement of the vote on the COM for bananas.
I share the concerns of Mr MacCormick.
We requested the postponement so that we could remain involved as a Parliament in the communication process with the United States within the WTO.
Had we voted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, we would no longer have been involved.
That is how it was, Mr MacCormick - he is no longer here.
I would like this to be recorded.
It is to do with the fact that we as a Parliament no longer have the right to codecision in the agricultural sector and so we had to choose this path.
