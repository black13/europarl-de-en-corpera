Mr President, I would like to ask a question, tongue-in-cheek, in the style of Loriot.
Where are they then?
Where are they then, those who say that we should do proper work here, who are always putting the question about the quorum and, when we are doing the real work here, are absent?
Where are these 32 and more who stood up before and who will stand up again, but who now, when we are discussing matters, are no longer here?
I would really like to know what kind of nonsense this is?
