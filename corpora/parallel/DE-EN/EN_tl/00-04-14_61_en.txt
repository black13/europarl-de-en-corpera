Mr President, Commissioner, your comments this morning on both subjects showed that we need not only rapid data highways, but also efficient air transport in Europe to remain competitive.
It is obvious that this will lead, in our densely populated States, to increasing noise pollution for citizens.
I support all those who have stated here that solutions can only be found jointly.
I come from the region around the Cologne-Bonn airport, an extremely densely populated region.
We have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens.
Every major attempt was simply answered by the companies with the announcement that they would switch to another airport.
The airports of Li√®ge and Maastricht are within a radius of almost 200 km.
The companies are really not bothered about where they start and land their cargo planes, in particular.
For this reason, I would like to urgently request that we find joint solutions which achieve both objectives: a competitive airline industry in Europe and adequate noise protection for our citizens in the vicinity of airports.
However, I have surmised, Commissioner, from the Commission' s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met.
Firstly, it is obvious from the report that there is still no common method for calculating aircraft noise and, secondly, there is still no common method for monitoring basic data.
I therefore come to my request: you have proposed specific measures to the Commission in your report.
You have also set deadlines: the year 2001 for expiry of the old specification on noise emissions for old aircraft equipment.
You have announced a strategy, which I welcome, for how the burden on particularly busy airports can be eased on the basis of objective data.
However, you have not set any deadline for this.
My request to the Commission is that, together with the regions, you set deadlines, in the interests of both the companies and the citizens affected, which we can all work towards in a team effort.
