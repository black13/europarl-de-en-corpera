Mr President, firstly I would like to ask you to determine an exact figure and to carry out an electronic check during the roll-call vote so that we know who is here and who is not.
Secondly, I would like to say that I share the concern of my colleagues who want to upgrade Fridays.
I am always here as a member of the so-called "Friday Club".
I also want to upgrade Fridays, but through work and not through sabotage.
