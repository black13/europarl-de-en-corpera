Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution and I am glad that those behind the sabotage which, from 9 o' clock this morning, prevented us from carrying out our work properly and voting are no longer present to turn this Parliament into an undignified circus.
Imagine if other citizens were to go about their work in the same way as those delegates who think that they have a four-day week here, even though the five-day week for the plenary meeting was agreed in Strasbourg.
This Parliament has actually agreed, and I also say this to the delegates over there who want a democratic vote, that Friday will be a session day in Strasbourg.
It is indeed a strange concept of democracy, and this also applies to the others who instigated this circus, if the opponents of Strasbourg are now using genuinely dirty tricks to sabotage Fridays.
I was a Member of this Parliament 35 years ago and in all my time I have never seen such abuse of the Rules.
One really should expect delegates to respect a democratic decision reached by majority, such as that concerning our session calendar, even if it does not suit them.
But they are bad losers and they really do not care that they have prevented important resolutions being taken for the citizens of the EU and, in particular, those who are starving in Ethiopia.
This latter point is especially grave and reprehensible.
I hope that those who instigated this procedural circus will be punished by the voters.
In the interest of forest owners, including in my own State where, to be fair, the last storm disaster was not as devastating as here, for example, in Alsace, I hope that measures will be taken by the EU, as proposed here, in order, above all, to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises going under ....
