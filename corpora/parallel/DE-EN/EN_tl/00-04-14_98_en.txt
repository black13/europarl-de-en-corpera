Mr President, I would like to support what Mr Daul has just said.
For me also the timber trade is something of great importance, but then our aid to Ethiopia is equally important.
For this reason I would like, and I attach great importance to this since you did not previously allow me to speak again when Mrs Buitenweg falsely quoted me, once more to clearly ask: where are those who this morning arranged this whole theatre?
Why are they not here now at the end of the session, proving that the work of Parliament is genuinely important to them?
That is the real question.
