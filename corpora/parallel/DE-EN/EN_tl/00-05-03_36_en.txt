Madam President, you came, Mrs Schreyer, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, you presented your arguments there, and you were met with respect.
However, I would like to make one comment and then put a question to you.
You say there was an increase in the agricultural sector and that this increase would be curtailed.
The fact that the percentage rise is so high is a result of the cuts in appropriations that were decided earlier in Berlin.
In fact, these appropriations are urgently needed!
I think we must not give the impression that we can keep using the agriculture budget as a kind of bottomless pit whenever we are short of money in other areas.
That is why I now ask you: do we not need to shift appropriations that might not be needed in export policy to the line for the integrated development of rural areas?
We need substantial funds there, because enlargement, with the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries, will generate enormous problems in these rural areas.
