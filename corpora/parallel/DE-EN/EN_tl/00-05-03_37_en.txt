Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I fully and wholeheartedly support your commitment to the development of rural areas.
And that will also be very, very clearly reflected in the proposal I will be submitting to the Commission next week for Budget 2001.
It proposes that next year we increase the appropriations to assist rural areas by 10% compared with this year, and that will quite clearly constitute the largest increase in the draft budget.
I can assure you that the Commission did not approach the question of how to finance this new priority, this new task, by looking for some kind of bottomless pit; it simply took a very practical decision for the years 2001 and 2002.
