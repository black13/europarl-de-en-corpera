Madam President, Commissioner, I can be brief because, in the end, all the questions have been along the same lines.
We have heard that the figure of EUR 1.8 billion was decided on in Berlin.
Today, as you said, EUR 1.4 billion has been decided on, and we keep hearing about the EUR 300 million reallocated from the agriculture budget, i.e. the 2001-2002 agricultural sector.
Commissioner, you had the opportunity to tell us about this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but my question is quite simply this: how do I then explain why the farming community is so agitated?
When you state here today that we are saving a great deal of money thanks to the exchange rate mechanisms, when you and Commissioner Fischler say at the same time that we can save money in the organisation of the sugar market, then surely the reason the farming community is agitated must be that this information has not been properly conveyed to them, that the agricultural associations did not understand it properly!
Or must we always and, on principle, begin with an exchange of blows when it comes to politics?
I would therefore be very happy if we really could allay the concerns of farmers; at the moment, however, that does not seem to be the case!
