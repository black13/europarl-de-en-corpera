Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, let me assure you that I have worked very hard with agricultural associations and lobbies over the course of the last few weeks to discuss and explain the Commission' s proposal.
As I have announced, I will be submitting the budget 2001 proposal to the Commission next week.
This will clarify the fact that there will be a sharp increase in agricultural appropriations, in line with the decisions taken in Berlin.
I therefore believe that, based on the actual figures, we can make it clear that the farming community need have no fears and that the important decisions taken in Berlin, particularly in relation to direct income subsidies for farmers, are not affected by the Commission' s decision.
