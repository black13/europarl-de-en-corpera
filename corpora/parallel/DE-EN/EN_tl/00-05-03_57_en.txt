Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the two rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs Sbarbati, have already explained, both the competent committee and the Committee on Budgets wholeheartedly endorsed the Brenner project, a project that came at the top of the Essen list of priorities.
However, the original project did not set out a list of priorities, a major shortcoming.
I therefore consider it essential for the Commission to accept the points laid down in this report, and which have been explained by the rapporteur, as they stand.
The Brenner Pass covers a region that includes three countries and, as such, it is a very environmentally sensitive area to which we need to devote particular attention.
At present, 1.2 million lorries cross the Brenner Pass every year.
The growth in the transport of goods far exceeds earlier rates of increase.
The free movement of persons, one of the freedoms in the European Union, cannot be achieved properly either.
Good Friday saw extremely lengthy tailbacks on the Brenner Pass.
We, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Swoboda and I - as pointed out in the explanatory statement of this motion in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - tabled a motion in which we justified this initiative as being a means of achieving an innovative model and approach to project development.
It breaks new ground and can set an example to the European Union.
Under the Prodi government, the Italian legislature had already considered the possibility of cross-financing road - i.e. road tolls - and rail transport and indeed approved it.
I believe that can act as a further model and pave the way to an innovative approach.
That is an absolute must, especially in an environmentally sensitive area, and I hope the Commission will exhibit the necessary sensitivity.
