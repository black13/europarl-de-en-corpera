Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are serious problems with seven of the transport projects decided upon by the Essen Council.
Like the rapporteur, I am disturbed about this.
One of these projects is the extension of the north-south link, and in particular the Brenner base-level tunnel.
Through this project the European Union could demonstrate that it is not just paying lip service to the idea of shifting transit transport from road to rail.
This is an opportunity to reduce the environmental burden on the region concerned and its population.
Moreover, this project will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Union as a whole.
Unfortunately, however, there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation.
The subsidiary of the Austrian Brenner Railway Company and the Italian Railways, which is supposed to complete the project planning within a period of eighteen months, was only set up at the end of last year.
This means that, more than five years after Essen, there are still no concrete plans on the table.
The people of the region cannot understand that.
For it is they who have to live with the ever-growing avalanche of traffic.
The existing rules, under which a maximum of 10% of the total investment can be funded by the Union, are quite simply inadequate and unfair for projects that have enormous implications for the future of the European economy as a whole.
Member States that will benefit from the completion of the Brenner base-level tunnel cannot shrug off their responsibility and leave it entirely to the countries directly concerned, like Germany, Austria and Italy, to shoulder the financial burden.
In the end, that kind of attitude has nothing to do with solidarity.
