Mr President, Commissioner, let me add a few comments to what has been said today about the Brenner base-level tunnel, most of which I more or less support.
The Brenner is a particularly good example of the problems besetting trans-European transport today.
Transport by rail, at least to the south of the Brenner, is not operating and the international link is not operating either.
That is why we have such major problems today and if we also need a base-level tunnel because of these mistakes and problems I would suggest that we approach the matter with great sensitivity, and that we proceed with care, for this is a project for centuries to come.
If we do decide to undertake it, we need to choose the environmentally cleanest, economically soundest option, as well as the most functional option.
That is why I have tabled a minor amendment to paragraph 7.
Perhaps we do not need another study, but we should weigh things up properly and select the best project.
I have put one of these projects before the Transport Committee.
There are few better or equally good ones.
We must choose the best because our transport policy, and therefore the EU, will also be measured by this small project.
