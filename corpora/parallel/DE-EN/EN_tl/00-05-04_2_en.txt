Mr President, I would like to make a correction to my statement on the EC/Switzerland agreement, because since 1 May this year, Mr JÃ¶rg Haider has been neither a member of the government nor the leader of Austria' s Freedom Party.
As such, the grounds for the sanctions imposed by the 14+1 on one Member State should be rescinded immediately.
