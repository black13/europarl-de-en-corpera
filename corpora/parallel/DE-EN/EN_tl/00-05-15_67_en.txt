Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.
Commissioner, you mentioned the controls which will need to be carried out in connection with the processing premium, and these must indeed take place.
Now if you combine our proposal to double the aid per hectare when proof is furnished with the proof for the processing aid, which also has to be provided, and if you join these two things together - of course this is not elaborated upon in the report - then the controls which need to be carried out for both kinds of premium are guaranteed and farmers do not lose out.
If you implement your scheme, as proposed, you will be depriving European flax and hemp growers of land and that has nothing to do with controls.
