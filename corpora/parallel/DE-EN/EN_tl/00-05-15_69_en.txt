Perhaps I will begin with the second question, which was asked by the rapporteur.
If I have correctly understood what this is about, you are referring first and foremost to the so-called newcomer quotas.
In this regard, I have said that we are prepared to accept a quota of this kind.
I now turn to the first question, which was asked by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
I am sorry, but what you are proposing is still based on an assumption, namely that this check is carried out.
It is simply the case that the current system is not working and that is why I believe we have no choice but to change it.
And so I do not want us to turn the system completely on its head.
If we go back partly to the old system again then I do not see how we can make it work and why it should work any better than it has in the past.
