Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, working time policy - as we can see once again - is not economic policy, it is health and safety at work policy.
When used preventively, it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money.
I have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in 1993, especially as the Commission and Parliament did not want any derogations even then.
Seven million workers were affected and specific sectors, such as the mobile worker sector, have been subject to ruinous competition over recent years, especially in Germany.
It is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough, Mr Crowley, to use tachographs or other technical aids.
One does not exclude the other.
We also need a framework directive, because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now.
They had no rules, they were not covered by a collective agreement, they were exploited and some also engaged in self-exploitation.
We know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems.
Parliament has shown sufficient flexibility; Mrs Smet highlighted our legislative maturity.
I think, Mrs Smet, you have proven that we can also fight.
The results are acceptable.
I am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to.
But the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the Council.
I hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am counting on constructive competition between the Member States to see which State will be the first to implement the proposals from Parliament and the Commission.
