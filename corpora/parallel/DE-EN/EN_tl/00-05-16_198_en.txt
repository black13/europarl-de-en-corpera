Mr President, Mr Bonde, we have met each other face to face here before, and I personally am having to exercise a great deal of self-control in order to maintain the necessary degree of decorum in the House.
The legal acts which we are talking about here are legal acts passed by the Council, by Parliament, by the Commission and by all the Community institutions.
You, as a member of the most important legislative institution of the European Union know full well that these legal acts have not been numbered consecutively.
I do not know of a single Member State of the European Union whose laws are numbered consecutively.
Even the laws in your country - and I have taken the trouble of finding out - are not numbered consecutively.
If you think that Commission officials are well employed if I sit them down and tell them to spend a week counting the legal acts issued since 1955, then let me tell you that I do not.
I have no intention of arranging for them to be counted.
The information which I have given you is as accurate as possible: i.e. that candidate countries are sent all, I repeat all the legal acts of the European Union without exception.
I am curious to know how it helps if I tell you that this figure is 21334 or 21425.
If you want, you sit down and do it.
You can find the entire Community acquis on-line on the Celex website here in Parliament.
You tell your employees to count these legal acts, because I shall not tell mine to do so.
