Mr President, Commissioner, the acquis is, of course, an important basis for accession.
Can you tell us how acquis screening is proceeding in your view?
With which candidate countries has most progress been made?
Which chapters have been completed?
Chancellor Schr√∂der recently stated in a press conference that the first admissions will probably be in 2002.
How do you assess the scenario if the legal inventory is completed in optimum time?
What do you think is the earliest possible date for accession if optimum use is made of all deadlines and options?
