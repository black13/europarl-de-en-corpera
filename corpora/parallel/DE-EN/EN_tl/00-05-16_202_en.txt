Madam, what you wish to engage in now is a hypothetical discussion.
This discussion was held in the first half of the 1990s and it culminated in resolutions of which you are aware, which were discussed on several occasions in Parliament and which can no longer be made retroactive, namely the resolution of the European Councils of Copenhagen, Essen and Luxembourg to prepare the Central and Eastern European Countries and Cyprus and Malta for full membership.
There is no point today in debating whether or not there might have been an alternative.
In any case, it is my recollection that the candidates were not satisfied with anything less.
They would not have accepted less and would have seen it as discrimination, meaning that, in Luxembourg in 1997, there was no longer any realistic alternative to the resolution taken in any case.
There is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should depart from this objective of full membership.
If there were, I would know about it.
But there is not.
All 12 countries with which we are negotiating are seriously working towards the goal of full membership and I urgently advise you against opening a debate on changing the fundamental objectives of enlargement now that the process has begun.
The candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust.
