Mr President, Mrs MÃ¼ller, I assume that you know that accession negotiations take the form of a state conference at which the Member States, not the Commission, negotiate and I am not therefore entitled to divulge the content of negotiations which have not yet been completed.
I would gladly do so, but I am not allowed to.
However, I can still answer the question, because the Commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised.
First, the Commission takes the view that transition periods should only be considered during the enlargement process if the aim of enlargement cannot otherwise be achieved within the required time or by the required date.
Transition periods must be very, very limited in both scope and duration, especially where the internal market is at stake.
You must know that every transition period, irrespective of whom it benefits, suspends the internal market for that area.
And if a large number of transition periods are agreed, then we can forget the whole idea of the internal market for years to come.
That cannot be the meaning of enlargement.
The question which you actually want answered is the question of how we can prepare for the problems which will arise in certain border regions following enlargement.
The region which you come from and the region which I come from are just such regions.
I have discussed this matter on many occasions in your country, as you know, and so I can be brief.
I think that there may well be transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, which is the really difficult question.
But we have not yet reached that point.
In the area of the free movement of services, which will lead to stiffer competition in border regions, I think that we need to start preparing an action programme right now, particularly so that small and medium-sized enterprises in border regions will be capable of adapting to and withstanding this new competition.
