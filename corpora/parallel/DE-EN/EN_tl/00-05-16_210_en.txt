Mr President, to be honest, the underlying question was how many legal acts does the European Union have.
Now I am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country.
I really cannot see the connection between these two questions, except that both relate to enlargement.
However, if you take the view that there is a connection, then I am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so.
All the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready.
It is only now being drafted and its legal status has not yet been recognised.
I know no better than you if this Charter will become part of the Treaty or if it will be no more than a solemn declaration.
If this Charter should become part of the Treaty, it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the details of this Charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned.
We must also report in the progress reports - as you will have noticed - as to whether a country is complying with the Copenhagen criteria.
That basically answers the questions, because the political criteria of Copenhagen basically cover everything which will appear in this Charter of Fundamental Rights and these questions have also been answered in relation to Lithuania and will be answered in the next progress report on Lithuania.
