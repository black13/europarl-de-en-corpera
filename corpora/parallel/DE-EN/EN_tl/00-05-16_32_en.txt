Mr President, I am somewhat surprised because this report was duly and unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I would have expected such matters to be clarified in committee, rather than here in plenary.
The report has been available for some time and I therefore see no reason why we cannot debate and vote on it.
Secondly, I would be obliged if Mr Dell'Alba could tell me what he means by saying that I have blocked documents for weeks.
I fail to understand Mr Dell'Alba' s choice of words and assertion and I would welcome an explanation.
