Madam President, the following problem has arisen in connection with the report by Mrs Schierhuber now being put to the vote: the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European United Left filed a motion for a split vote on a number of points.
However, for some technical reason, the services did not receive it.
Now we have the following problem: either you now allow an oral motion for a split vote on the article in question during the voting procedure and we vote today or, if that is not possible, then I move that we postpone the vote until tomorrow.
The services have, however, said that we have a tightly-packed voting programme tomorrow, so that it would perhaps make sense to vote today.
We would be happy to vote.
The vote is not the problem, the problem is that you did not receive the motion for a split vote in time.
