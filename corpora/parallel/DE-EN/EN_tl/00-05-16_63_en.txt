Madam President, I am sorry that the Socialists' voting list was not received by the services in time.
I should like to state unequivocally that I personally, as rapporteur, have no problem in accepting this split vote, even during today' s vote, and it would be good if we could vote today because, as you know, the Council of Agricultural Ministers is meeting today and tomorrow and it would be good if the agricultural ministers knew what we had decided here.
Unfortunately, if we vote tomorrow, it will be too late.
