Mrs Schierhuber, the Commission has not changed its opinion.
The Commission presented this proposal as the outcome of experience in past years.
We discussed a report on the fight against fraud on a previous occasion and that has a direct bearing on this.
I can only repeat that, if the question of the division of land is again discussed in the Council - and this was an important issue in the Committee on Agriculture - then the Commission is of course open to suggestions.
However, as the Commissioner for the budget, I am bound to say that a solution must be found which does not affect the budget.
