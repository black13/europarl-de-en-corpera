Madam President, exactly the same applies to this second decision as what you said for the first decision.
Two proposed amendments in this second file are of fundamental importance to the Committee on Agriculture, namely Amendments Nos 28 and 29.
I therefore again ask the Commission if it has perhaps revised its opinion here.
