Mr President, I am in favour, although I take the view that it is not quite as urgent as the Council makes out.
However, it would be an insult to the people of Montenegro if we rejected this urgency today.
Montenegro is in great danger, especially from Belgrade, and I think we should send out this signal.
However, we should wait until the Commission finally tells us where it intends to find the money.
It cannot take it away from Bosnia.
It cannot take it away from Kosovo.
It needs to tell us where it intends to find the money and if we reach a decision on this today, we must carry out an evaluation half way through and say what has happened to the money and where the second tranche is to come from.
