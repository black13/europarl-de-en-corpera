My vote is intended to support the rapporteur' s efforts but prevent the proposed reduction in the monthly increments for cereals.
The European Council stated clearly in its resolutions following the Berlin summit that the monthly increments should be maintained at the current 1 euro per tonne and frozen at this level for the entire period, i.e. from 2000 to 2006.
The planned reduction in the monthly increments would therefore clearly be breaking our promise to the farmers.
Given the worrying economic situation of the rural population, further erosion of their income is unjustifiable.
The income of people working in farming has fallen by a total of nearly 10% in real terms since 1996.
A reduction in the monthly increments would further exacerbate the economic situation of farmers.
