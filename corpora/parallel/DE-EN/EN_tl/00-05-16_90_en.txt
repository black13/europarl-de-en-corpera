Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs Schierhuber' s report.
I consider proposed Amendments Nos 28 and 29 to be particularly important.
She rightly points out that any limitation on maximum quantities must correlate with actual processing capacities.
Introducing national maximum quantities as proposed by the Commission would create a system which fails to take account of national processing capacities.
The 50 tonne per annum limitation would exclude many Member States from cultivation in advance.
The aim must be to develop a flexible system which also takes account of regional sales potential, thereby allowing all Member States to cultivate on an equal footing.
