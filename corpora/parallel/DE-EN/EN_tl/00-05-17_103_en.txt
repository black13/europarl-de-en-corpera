Mr President, the debate has certainly shown the PPE-DE Group that we do not make things easy for ourselves, and that, at the end of the day, although the assessments are similar, different conclusions may be reached.
However, I would like to begin by congratulating the Greek government on the outstanding results it has achieved in the course of the last year as regards public debt and inflation.
But it is the current situation that we need to consider.
It is certainly true that by the very nature of its national economy, Greece is not destined to be the driving force, the big market within the euro zone.
Turning now to the question of inflation: Mr Goebbels, I hope - I do not know if I understood you correctly this morning - that the low inflation rate you referred to is here to stay.
We will have a struggle on our hands.
However, this is the first accession to the euro zone.
Unlike the beginning, when Italy and Belgium also failed to make the reference values, we must now take care, in the light of enlargement eastwards, not to create new reference values, and allow this to become a never ending story.
But that is precisely the problem it seems we are going to have to face.
The important thing is to reach a decision today that will boost political confidence in the euro.
In other words, we need to ensure that, in future, the markets believe that these are economic objectives and criteria and not political decisions.
The CSU (Christian Social Union) is proposing to vote against the motion today, which does not mean that it is saying 'no' to Greece and to the euro, rather it disagrees with the timing and hopes to be able to admit Greece next year.
The ECB itself raised the issue of 'sustainability' .
It is precisely this view - i.e. deferral of the decision for a year, so as to allow the local economy to stabilise - that could send out a signal, both to the Member States of the euro zone and to the financial markets.
