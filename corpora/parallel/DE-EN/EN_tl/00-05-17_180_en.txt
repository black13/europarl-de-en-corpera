Mr President, the WTO deals primarily with issues pertaining to the opening up of markets.
For example, there is a discussion on-going at the moment about China, and whether our European manufacturers are to have access to the textile market as well.
It is a market worth billions and could create many new jobs here in Europe, particularly when one considers that the only possession many Chinese have to their name is a pair of trousers.
The cultural question I would most like to hear answered though, is this: how are we proposing to handle the language issue in future?
France pursues a very independent policy where the French language is concerned.
Do you see any evidence of similar tendencies on the part of the Germans, Spanish or Portuguese?
Are we going to take an even-handed approach in this respect or will we form an assessment on a country-by-country basis, taking into account the respective size of population?
