Mr President, the European economic locomotive is not really picking up steam.
Unemployment levels in Europe are too high, particularly as the more vulnerable members of society, i.e. young people, women and the long-term unemployed, are affected.
In addition to launching a technical offensive in economic terms within the Union, for example, by setting up highways of information and focusing on research and development expenditure, it is of paramount importance to step up investment by approximately 10%, so as to secure growth and bring unemployment levels down.
We must carry on heavily promoting the establishment and continued operation of small- and medium-sized enterprises, by improving access to foreign capital, dismantling bureaucratic hurdles, reducing the burden of taxation and also offering free business advice.
However, we must also reform our administrative systems.
The Union should therefore adopt a directive on administrative simplification, requiring the Member States to only adopt logistical legislation that can be implemented swiftly and easily by the citizens, and which is simple and also comprehensible to them.
