Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to extend my most sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, for this report, and, incidentally, to the Commission, for the document they have presented us with.
In the short time available, I have just two comments to make: I would like to take up what Mr RÃ¼big had to say about youth.
People the length and breadth of the country complain that we do not have enough engineers.
Young people are no longer going to university to study natural sciences.
Where I come from, a survey was carried out in order to ascertain why this should be.
This had surprising results.
We had always believed that young people are no longer choosing to study the natural sciences or engineering at university because the job prospects are so poor.
This is not the case.
They do not study physics and chemistry because they are no fun.
In a society that prizes having fun so highly, it is evidently extremely important for things to be fun.
We are evidently failing to make the material attractive to people and suited to the lifestyles they have these days.
They are from a different generation to mine.
Therefore, I advocate that we bear this in mind when we find ourselves talking in such scholarly terms about the next generation.
The second proposal I would just like to make is as follows: we are discussing the European research area.
We are going to enlarge the European Union, marvellous!
Indeed all these States are already taking part in the fifth research framework programme at the present time, and they will also participate in the sixth.
I would therefore recommend involving the Parliamentarians and Ministers for Research of these countries in the preparation for the sixth research framework programme as well.
I would envisage doing this here in the European Parliament - the French expression is assises de recherche - so that we can have a joint discussion about the guidelines for the sixth research framework programme.
