Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is evident from the debate and the report that we are taking an optimistic attitude to this report, because of the forecasts and the upturn in the European economy since the summer of 1999.
However, we are also level-headed and determined in our approach.
We are being level-headed about the prospects, deficits and external value of the euro, and are determined to overcome the deficit vis-Ã -vis the United States as swiftly and as soon as possible.
The deficit stems from the fact that we have a lower level of growth, higher unemployment, lower investment levels, less research and development activity, a slower rate of turnover and a low average income.
This is what has led us to draw up a plan comprising a variety of objectives and necessary measures, such as accelerated growth with no capacity bottlenecks or inflationary pressure, preserving price stability in other words, careful wage development, stepping up our efforts in research and development and a further reduction of deficits and debts.
We need to continue to pursue structural reform measures, and to do so with courage and determination, and to continue liberalisation, thus reducing the level of state ownership.
We need to direct our efforts at creating new jobs, i.e. we need to support the new economy, and we must make the transition to the knowledge-based economy, which can be ascribed to the fact that we need competition when it comes to getting into telecommunications technology in education, training and research.
If we go down this path, then, for the first time in years, there is a chance that we could return to full employment in Europe, and that is our goal.
