Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the message of the Lisbon Summit was clear and unambiguous: it put the spotlight back on the people as the architects of economic success.
That is the key concept: a knowledge-based economy in which each and every individual is able to develop his or her talents.
It is also central to the combination of innovation and social participation that we intend to use to mobilise society' s full potential and overall assets, so as to achieve full employment again.
It is the task of the economic policy guidelines to convert this noble aim into concrete policy.
However, the Commission' s recommendations are to be found wanting in this respect.
All too often, they are fainthearted and wedded to outmoded ideas, when what they should be doing is developing an outline for a promising new form of policy mix.
That is why it is necessary for these guidelines to be improved on, and what we need most of all, in future, is for a joint spring report to be drafted which is capable of properly combining sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion.
This must also have a noticeable effect on practical politics.
This will have certain consequences, in two areas in particular.
Sustainable economic growth of 3% or more requires a dramatic increase in investment, particularly in environmentally friendly sectors.
This applies both to the private and the public sectors.
The Commission has a decision to make in this respect.
It cannot simultaneously pursue the Lisbon objectives and put the case for a policy of overall tax reductions and expenditure cuts!
