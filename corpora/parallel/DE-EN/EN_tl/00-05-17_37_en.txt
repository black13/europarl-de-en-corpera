Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as far as we are concerned, it is clear that the targets laid down in the Stability Pact constitute the definitive guiding principle for economic policy in the euro zone.
That is why this report is so important, and in the light of the rapporteur' s reference in his explanatory statement to the fact that Greece' s programme is not dealt with in detail in his document as it will form the subject of a special report, then, on behalf of my Group, I am bound to say that it will be too late for the special report as far as we are concerned, because matters are not being handled as they were during the debate on the candidate countries two years ago in 1998.
We also adopted the convergence reports in April of that year, and held the accession debate in May.
Since the next item on the agenda is a debate on Greece' s membership of the euro zone, and we are to take a decision on it tomorrow, our Group has tabled several amendments, so as to enable us to be even-handed in our approach.
This is why I would very briefly like to go into the fact that Greece has not yet completely fulfilled the criteria pertaining to public debt, and that the sustainability requirement, which we set great store by, as far as the inflation rate is concerned at any rate, is viewed by the ECB, as well as the Commission and ourselves, with some concern.
Hence we would emphasise that whilst we welcome Greece' s participation in the EMS since 18 May 1998, and its achievements, the criteria must be applied in full to all candidate countries.
We have noted that, according to reports by the Commission and the ECB, Greece is currently fulfilling the convergence criteria, - when they are given a liberal interpretation, as happened in 1998 too - although one cannot help but have some doubts on the sustainability front.
This relates to the inflation criterion and we would demand a further reduction in the level of debt and the implementation of a programme.
We are also calling for a concrete action plan to further privatise Greek state enterprise and implement the single market.
