Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by apologising for the fact that our Austrian Finance Minister was unable, during the previous election period, to achieve the targets set by the Council in March 1998.
However, it is very clear from this report that other Member States besides Austria failed to adhere to all aspects of the Council regulation in question.
Our current Finance Minister, Mr Grasser, had to work under pressure of time when compiling Budget 2000, and it is this budget that fulfilled significant criteria of the Council regulation, the measures pertaining to pensions for example.
The Member States' efforts to overhaul their budgets will only prove successful if there is a clear reduction in the taxation and social contribution burden within the EU.
It was, and still is, a serious mistake to maintain that high taxation and social contribution levels guarantee high tax receipts at the same time.
The opposite is true.
Japan and the USA are living proof of the fact that countries with low rates of taxation can be successful.
The tax burden in the USA averages 30%, as compared with 46% in the Union, and the USA has a budget surplus in excess of USD 250 billion at present.
