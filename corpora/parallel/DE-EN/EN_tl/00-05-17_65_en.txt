Madam President, the way in which the Buitenweg report is being handled is completely unacceptable, and this has far less to do with the report itself than the actual procedure we are adopting.
In fact there is an arrangement within the European Parliament that when reports are only voted on for the first time during a committee meeting here in Strasbourg, they do not then feature on the agenda in that same part-session.
That is the usual arrangement.
Now a decision was obviously taken last Thursday, in the Conference of Presidents - at which I was represented as I could not be there in person - to deviate from this rule, but only to do so if all translations were present and correct by 7.00 p.m. yesterday evening, as I understand it.
The translations were not all present and correct by yesterday evening, and it is impossible to table amendments for certain languages if the report is not available in these languages.
Hence I would strongly recommend that we do not continue the discussion here now, but that the Groups consult with each other this afternoon on how they wish to proceed with the report, and that we then reach a decision first thing tomorrow morning.
One thing I would stress, however, is that it will not be acceptable in future, to discuss reports here and, if applicable, vote on them, if a) if the reports have only been decided on in committee that same week, and b) the translations are not available either.
This does not do justice to the dignity of Parliament and I object to a procedure of this kind.
