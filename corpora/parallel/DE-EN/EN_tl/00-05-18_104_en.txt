Mr President, as the rapporteur rightly mentions in the second point in his report, budget consolidation must be given the highest priority at present.
We can only increase the confidence of the public and, above all, of the financial markets in the euro by means of consistent budgetary discipline.
I say all this bearing in mind that the euro yesterday sank near to its historic low of 3 May.
The rapporteur was unable to include the stability programme which has now been presented by the Austrian Government in his report.
I would therefore like to point out that the new government is determined to overcome the problems that the previous government left behind.
The old government led by the Social Democrats certainly did not bequeath it an easy task.
However, all the commitments in the Stability Pact should now be fully met for the year 2000.
