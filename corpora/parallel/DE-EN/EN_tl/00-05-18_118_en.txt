Mr President, the vote on Sellafield was a first for the European Parliament.
I think it is the first time that the European Parliament has spoken in favour of uniform safety standards for nuclear power stations.
I believe that the Council should, as a matter of urgency, and before the first accessions take place, resolve to draw up and implement such safety standards.
