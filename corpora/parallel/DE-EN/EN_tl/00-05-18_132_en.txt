Mr President, although I voted for the report, I would like the following point to be minuted.
Coordination of European research activity must not result in competition between research institutes disappearing.
The limits on communitarisation imposed by the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be kept in mind.
The standardisation of rights concerning intangible assets has already proved its value in the case of trademark law and copyright.
The present system for filing patent applications obliges the applicant to file a patent application separately in each Member State, which inevitably results in an undesirable fragmentation of the European market.
The logical conclusion is therefore to create a Community patent.
Decision makers at national level will have to be sufficiently far-sighted if this ambitious project is to succeed.
The competitiveness of the entire European Union must be taken into account when research contracts are being awarded.
