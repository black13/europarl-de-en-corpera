Mr President, thank you for welcoming the members of local government who are the very people who will have to implement what we decide here.
But first of all, we have to do our work.
I would like to point out that the amendments mentioned by Baroness Ludford are still not available in all languages this afternoon.
Before we proceed to the vote, would you please get the Sittings Service to establish whether the 24-hour deadline applies here and whether or not we have to defer this until tomorrow?
I am not trying to start a debate on this subject now, but I would like you to clarify this once and for all, because there has been a lot of confusion here today.
