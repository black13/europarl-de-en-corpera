Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dismayed as I am about the way the 14 Member States have prejudged Austria, I particularly welcome the Commission proposal.
It goes without saying that the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin should be applied.
There is no place for discrimination on these grounds in a modern society.
However, it is possible to overshoot the mark, even in the case of such an uncontroversial issue.
The reversal of the burden of proof proposed by the Commission would mean imposing an intolerable burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular, as they would in future have to keep a record of every job interview, so that in serious cases they would be able to provide proof.
Arrangements like this do not result in greater understanding for the victims of discrimination.
Quite the opposite - it actually harms the cause.
The precision of the impact assessment form annexed to the Commission proposal is totally dependent on the use of the phrase "without apparent difficulty" .
The wording is as follows: "identical rules have already been applied without apparent difficulty" .
