Mr President, Commissioner, we must be very careful as Europeans about taking issue with separatist movements of the kind being discussed here.
I say that because many of the borders involved in these great island kingdoms - the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia - are purely and simply colonial borders that we drew artificially to suit our own political and economic interests and which destroyed historical structures.
To that extent, we are responsible for many of the conflicts in this region.
That does not mean that it is not up to us Europeans to ensure that these structures do not disintegrate, with all the dangers that would imply.
We should not put ourselves on a pedestal.
We have to recognise that we bear a lot of the responsibility for these developments.
Nevertheless, it is, of course, our task to create peace and stability in this area, and in particular to take action against all those criminals who, on a political pretext, have, in the most appalling way, kidnapped and maltreated innocent tourists who are citizens of the European Union.
There can be no political justification for ill-treating people as is happening there.
We therefore appeal to these criminals to release these citizens of the European Union and all the hostages immediately, and we give our full support to Mr Solana and everyone else trying to help to bring this hostage crisis to an end.
We should also take this hostage crisis as a warning to us to stop ignoring these parts of the world or simply pursuing our own economic interests there.
Instead, we should be helping to create stable and peaceful conditions there, because these areas of conflict are like open wounds that we ourselves have often inflicted in the past in these regions.
