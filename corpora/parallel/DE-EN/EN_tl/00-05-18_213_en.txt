Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for this opportunity to talk about Iran again today.
The reform process in Iran is at risk.
Even before the newly elected reform parliament has been able to meet, there has been a menacing intensification of the power struggle in Iran.
We are dismayed at the manipulative reporting of the conference held by the Heinrich BÃ¶ll Foundation in Berlin, and we are deeply concerned about the arrests of journalists and critical intellectuals in the wake of this conference.
We are also concerned about the ban on all pro-reform newspapers and magazines published in Iran.
We call on the Iranian authorities to immediately release the conference participants and journalists who have been arrested, and to cancel all warrants of arrest issued in this connection, to lift the ban on the prohibited newspapers and magazines and, last but by no means least, to respect the political will of the Iranian people, which was so remarkably expressed in the election results.
We call on the Council, the Member States and the Commission to support these demands on Iran and to make respect for human rights a prerequisite for further cooperation with Iran.
