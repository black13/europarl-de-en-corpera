Madam President, as one political group chairman has spoken, as is his right of course, I would also like to briefly make our Group' s position clear.
The person in question holds political views most of which I find loathsome.
But there are legal systems in the European Union and I would always defend the rights of all Members of the European Parliament under those legal systems.
If legal proceedings are being taken against a Member of this House in a Member State, then we should await the outcome of those proceedings before we can make a final decision here.
Mr Hänsch, if my information is correct, and I have not had a chance to talk to you about this, but I say this with all due respect to our former President, Klaus Hänsch, then our former President specifically made the same point in relation to the Tapie case, that is to say that we should await the outcome of the appeal procedure before we reach a decision here.
What was right then cannot be wrong now.
We must respect the rights of every individual Member of this House, whatever his political views are.
My Group will always argue for that, even if the Members involved belong to other groups.
We will defend these rights with equal vigour, because they are our common rights.
If we violate the law, we can say goodbye to the European Union.
That is why we respect and defend the law - no matter who it applies to.
(Applause)
