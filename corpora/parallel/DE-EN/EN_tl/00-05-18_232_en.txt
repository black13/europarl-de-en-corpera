Mr President, I quite understand that you want to avoid a long debate now, but I do not think it was clear when we decided on this this morning that the urgencieswould simply go by the board.
If that had been the case, some Members might have voted differently.
This House should certainly not get into the habit of letting subjects which have been on the agenda since the beginning of the week go by the board.
We were going to discuss Guatemala.
MPs from Guatemala have been with us the whole week, and we are trying to convince them to improve their democracy and their respect for human rights.
I do not think we will be setting a very good example if we then fail to even discuss this issue!
