Mr President, I rise to make a point about the vote: it would be quite possible to challenge this vote either because of non-observance of the 24-hour deadline, or, possibly, because of the quorum position.
I do not want to do this, but I would like to ask Mrs Buitenweg and her friends to call a truce tomorrow and to refrain from their sabotage tactics in this House!
