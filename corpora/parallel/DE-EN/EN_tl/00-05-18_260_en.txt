Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mrs Karamanou for cooperating in such a straightforward and excellent way.
I know that we all had to work very quickly on this document, and at that time she was under additional pressure because of commitments at national level.
She has already mentioned very many points, and I would just like to say that, as regards content, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was in agreement, as it was with the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
We only differed on a formal detail.
On behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, we are also requesting that this Initiative of the Republic of Finland should be withdrawn.
I am certain that it was very well intended, but it has not been thought through sufficiently.
Legally speaking, it has thrown up more questions than it has supplied explanations.
I would like to add a few important points.
An initiative of this kind should not mean that people can just be shipped back and forth within our territory.
Furthermore, as Mrs Karamanou has just said, this represents a programme singularly lacking in solidarity between the Member States.
With regard to readmission agreements, they should not be used as a possible way of twisting the arms of countries in receipt of development aid by saying that they will only receive development aid and funds or cooperation if they also sign readmission agreements.
This is bordering on blackmail.
Last but not least, I would like to say that the readmission of persons illegally residing in our territory is another problem that can only be solved jointly, by working together to fight the root causes and to finally address the issues of integration and asylum in cooperation.
