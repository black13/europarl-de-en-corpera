Madam President, I am sorry I need to ask to speak again, but we cannot vote on anything at all here today, because we have clear and proper procedures.
If we refer a matter to a committee, then we must have a basis for doing so, that is to say we need a document defining that referral.
We do not have such a document.
That is why I urge you not to hold a vote on this matter now in any way whatsoever.
