Madam President, the first thing I wish to say is that I think it would be unworthy of the European Parliament to be at loggerheads over this issue.
We should not be presenting the public with a spectacle of that kind.
My second point is that you decided, on the basis of Rule 7(4), to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
That is your right.
However, if I have understood correctly, we do not have a proposal from the Legal Affairs Committee as a basis for a vote, but you did ask the Committee on Legal Affairs for its opinion.
There is a legal problem here that only you can clear up.
I have in mind the difference between Article 12 of the Act on the election of Members by direct universal suffrage and Rule 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure.
There is a discrepancy here.
My advice is that we need to clear up this discrepancy.
That is your task, Madam President.
There is nothing we can vote on until you have cleared this up with the Committee on Legal Affairs.
(Applause)My advice is therefore that we should not hold a vote today, but that we should await your decision, Madam President.
(Applause)
