Mr Poettering, the law affecting any given issue is subject to interpretation.
I believe that the position adopted by Mr Cox - who formed a strategic majority with you in order to have Mrs Fontaine elected - is a compromise that makes it possible for everyone here to vote for a report on racism with their head held high.
Opinions may be divided about Austria, but when it comes to making it clear what our position is on racism in Europe, we should not get bogged down in a formal debate as we did just now, we should make it plain that we are clear-thinking people.
So I appeal to you to accept Mr Cox' s compromise so we can proceed with the debate with our heads held high.
Please, I beg you!
