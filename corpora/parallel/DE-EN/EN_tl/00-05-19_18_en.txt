Madam President, due to the absence of two dozen Members and the request for the quorum which we would have established without any difficulty, our Group yesterday chose to refrain from preventing the Buitenweg report from being put to the vote when this would have been quite possible.
According to the agenda, the vote should have taken place today since the amendments were not put to the House in time yesterday.
I appealed to the House to act fairly.
I would urge the Members dealing with this matter to declare a moratorium.
We are about to take up the matter of enhancing the status of Fridays.
Of course, the best way to do this would have been by voting on this important report today.
However, I believe Mrs Buitenweg cannot attend today' s sitting.
In any event, we must nevertheless enhance the status of Fridays.
Our Group is in the process of taking appropriate precautionary action.
I would urge you to let us work fairly and to stop deliberately disrupting our work.
