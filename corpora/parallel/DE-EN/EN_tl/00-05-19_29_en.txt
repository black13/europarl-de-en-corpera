Madam President, this is a very complicated process as Mrs Karamanou has already explained.
I would therefore urge you to allow me to very briefly explain the process once again.
I have also agreed to do this with the member of the PPE Group who works as a coordinator in our committee, since the PPE has proposed two amendments, although only for the legislative resolution.
The text of the resolution itself should be rejected.
However, I would urge a vote to be taken on the legislative resolution, together with both amendments, in which it is pointed out that we invite the Council to put forward a new draft text.
The present text should therefore be rejected and the Council invited in the legislative resolution to submit a new text.
It therefore comes down to the rather unusual process of the text which is actually to be voted on being rejected, but a vote then having to be taken on the legislative resolution.
I would urge that this rather remarkable procedure be carried out.
It gives us the chance to obtain a new text.
