Mr President, I have, of course, voted for Mr Langen' s excellent report, and I congratulate him on his work and also on his report.
Both the public and ourselves are obviously pleased with the simplifications he has explained so clearly.
I would like for this to be the case in other areas as well.
You know that I am a great advocate of Parliament' s seat in Strasbourg and I have also regretted all the fuss again made this morning by those who wanted to prevent us from voting today, because they simply want to ruin the Friday sittings in Strasbourg and for everything to be concentrated in Brussels.
And these centralists are also, of course, setting their sights on Luxembourg - as a by-product so to speak - for Parliament' s Secretariat.
Certainly, I must also say that this does not always make things easy for France to defend Strasbourg as a parliamentary seat.
One of my groups of visitors found this out again on their way here this morning.
Their bus was stopped by the French police under the pretext that the driver would not have a French driving licence.
This particular company has transported thousands of my visitors here in the past ten years.
What is going on here then?
I must say that these visitors wonder, naturally, whether this is what Europe is all about.
Moreover, the French police do not seem to have heard of credit cards yet.
The visitors had to pool their French francs together to pay the horrendous FRF 5 000 fine.
This cannot be right, Mr President!
I will, of course, check ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
