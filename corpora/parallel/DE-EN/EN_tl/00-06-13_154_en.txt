Mr President, I too would like to join previous speakers in extending sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, for this report had to deal with two important subject areas, and has managed to strike an excellent balance between them.
We need competition if we are to have any chance at all of creating the necessary conditions for the information society.
At the same time, however, we want to afford EU citizens equal and secure access to these IT facilities.
This report demonstrates this in the form of important points.
I would like to touch on four of them.
Firstly, the report emphasises the need to separate regulation from infrastructure and content.
This is absolutely essential if we are to secure not just a stronger market, but also greater diversity of information for citizens in the future.
Secondly, this report is in favour of using open standards and the common interface to secure access for all citizens to the information society and to enable them to participate in it from a technological point of view.
Thirdly, accordingly, it is both right and logical to use must carry rules to secure transmission opportunities for public service broadcasters under the terms of the content of their task.
Fourthly and finally, I would like to point out that what we need to do now is to analyse very carefully, on the basis of this report, what conclusions we should draw if we are to secure a broadly-based right to information for all citizens in the future.
I hope there will be sound cooperation between the Commission and Parliament at the forthcoming discussions on the new directive, and also on the 'Television without Frontiers' Directive.
