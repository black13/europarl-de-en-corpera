Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to something that has happened since our last part-session.
The German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, made a speech about the future of European unification at the beginning of May.
Although some of the passages in this speech may have been contentious, it was important in as much as it provided food for thought as to how unification is to be accomplished with 25 or 30 Member States.
The reaction of Mr Chevènement, the French Minister for the Interior, was all the more astounding.
What he said in essence was that anyone advocating a European federation or European constitution must have failed to process our experiences under National Socialism properly.
I consider this to be a faux pas of the kind that should meet with protest on the part of the European Parliament.
Mr Chevènement endeavoured to qualify his statement, but what he did in essence was to repeat it, thereby reiterating the thrust of his argument.
We parliamentarians have repeatedly pronounced ourselves in favour of a European constitution and a federal Europe - from Spinelli to Herman through to the most recent reports.
I therefore feel that Mr Chevènement' s statement is an insult to Parliament' s work.
I call upon you to duly register the European Parliament' s protest.
