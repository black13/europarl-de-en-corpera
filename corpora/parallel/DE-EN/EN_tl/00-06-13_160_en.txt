Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to offer heartfelt congratulations to Mr van Velzen.
First of all, I would like to say that everything Wim van Velzen tackles turns out well, and his report is highly principled in its responsible treatment of the issue, which he makes his own.
The communications industry is having an increasingly influential effect on our lives.
It has an impact on the economy, the information society, global competition, Europe' s position in the world and employment.
However, the communications industry also has an effect on democracy because it enables more and more people to participate in the democratic process.
It increases the transparency of political activity.
We must continue the privatisation programme.
Competition led to price reductions, rapid innovation and diversity of supply.
The organisation principle underlying the social market economy demands liberalisation and competition on the one hand and necessary rules on the other, so as to be able to do justice to a sense of social responsibility.
A great deal has been said.
I should like to add just three points by way of conclusion.
Communication also means information.
I therefore call upon the European Parliament and the Commission to step up the involvement of all public bodies in their information campaigns and to enlighten them about the new media.
Secondly, I call upon all public bodies to get themselves an e-mail address, to acquire their own homepage, to own an SMS mobile phone, and to involve the constituency media in their communication by using the new media.
I urge the European Parliament and all national parliaments to establish a file containing all the e-mail addresses of all the public bodies, because we should not just be drawing up framework directives, but actually making use of them as public bodies.
