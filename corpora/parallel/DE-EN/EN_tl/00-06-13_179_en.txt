Mr President, I would like to clarify something in connection with Amendment No 10, tabled by Mr van Velzen, Mrs Ridruejo and Mr Chichester.
In the German text it says in the fourth line: "... considers it important to clarify the following concepts" .
Now I recall that this very sentence was the object of debate in the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, drafted by Mrs Ridruejo.
We agreed on the sentence: "...considers it to be important to reinforce" , not "clarify" .
I just wanted to clarify whether this is a translation error or has something crept in that should not be there?
Could this be clarified please?
There is a second point I would like to raise.
I will own up to the fact that I have omitted to table a motion for a split vote, on behalf of my group.
However, if it were to be possible to apply for a split vote for Amendment No 8, then I would do so orally herewith, because although the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance endorses the first half of the amendment, it most definitely does not endorse the second part!
If you cannot accept a split vote then we will have no choice but to reject the entire amendment.
