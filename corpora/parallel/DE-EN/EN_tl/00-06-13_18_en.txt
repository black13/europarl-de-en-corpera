Madam President, we are indebted to Mr Leinen for reminding us about this incident.
However, I would expressly like to thank you for taking the stance you did, in your own name as our President.
I would like you to know that you have our full and unequivocal support, and that we owe you a debt of gratitude.
Incidentally, we should refrain from entering into debate on this issue at present.
