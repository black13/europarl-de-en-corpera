Madam President, perestroika and glasnost used to signify change in a rigid structure.
I think there are times when we could use a little more perestroika and glasnost in the structures of our administration, particularly where the Joint Research Centre is concerned.
A report was compiled in 1998 investigating the Joint Research Centre.
This report also contains remarks regarding the nuclear sector, ranging from the question of whether the personnel are qualified to whether our own European safety standards are being observed.
The ghost of this report haunts our corridors precisely because it has not been published.
That is not the way to go about things.
If our aim is to develop a strategy for handling nuclear material then we must lay all our cards on the table.
People could not therefore be more justified in demanding that the aforementioned 1998 report at last be published, and that it be made clear what lessons were drawn from it as regards the handling of nuclear material at the Joint Research Centre.
We are indeed prepared, on the basis of a clear analysis and a clear inventory, to develop a strategy aimed at the degradation of dangerous waste accumulated over the years.
But first we must have clarity.
Glasnost and perestroika are what we need when it comes to handling nuclear material in our own installations.
