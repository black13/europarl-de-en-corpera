Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are going to talk about topicality then all I can say is that you cannot get more topical than Kosovo and Serbia.
The Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have just got back from a joint trip to Kosovo.
While we were there we promised that we would do our best to adopt a motion of this kind this week.
I urge the honourable members to support this motion for a resolution.
We must bring pressure to bear on Serbia, and also on the Albanians in Kosovo, so as to make them put things to rights.
We can only do this using the modest means at our disposal, namely a motion for a resolution.
The Balkans region is a little nearer to us than Fiji as matters stand, and if it is money we are worried about then I am bound to say that we are footing the bill rather a lot in Kosovo!
