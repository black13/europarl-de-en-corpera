Madam President, there are two reasons as to why we are not debating the Venezuela issue.
Firstly, there is the respect we have for our own Rules of Procedure.
We are no longer in earnest about these debates on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, nor is our attitude to be taken seriously.
We decided in the AFET committee that we would adhere strictly to Rule 50 and Annex 3 of our Rules of Procedure, according to which an issue of this kind, i.e. an event that happened months ago, can no longer be dealt with as an urgent procedure, even if it is, of course, very important.
Secondly, demands are made in this motion that have been neither considered nor discussed in budgetary terms.
Hence we are calling for this issue to be withdrawn and replaced by an issue that is genuinely urgent and highly topical, i.e. the attempted coup in Paraguay and the arrest of the former rebel General Oviedo.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
