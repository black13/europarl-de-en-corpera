Mr President, I welcome the Commission' s initiative because I feel that the old directive on the regulation of tobacco products in Europe is out-of-date.
Several years ago, we dealt with the BSE crisis here in Europe and left no stone unturned in terms of health and consumer policy.
We brought about a great deal of change, and rightly so.
When you consider how much was spent in connection with BSE, it is shocking to note how lacking in courage the European Union is when it comes to actually doing something for health on the tobacco front.
There are four or five key points at issue here, to my mind.
We must reflect on the subsidisation of tobacco growing in Europe.
We must pluck up the courage to do more to promote transparency where health policy is concerned.
We must provide the citizens with more information, which is not a matter of whether the logo should cover 15% or 45% of the surface area of the packet, but of bringing about a change of mentality in society.
I believe it is vital that we do all we can to get the message across to young people that they must not take up smoking.
God knows, at my age it probably does not matter if I carry on smoking or not.
But our children must not start smoking.
That is what this directive should aim to achieve.
It is absolutely scandalous that we are subsidising the tobacco industry.
We allocate enormous sums of money for the production of tobacco that we in Europe should not smoke on account of a pathetic set of standards.
We are going one step forwards and two steps back.
What we must aim to do is to help farmers not to grow tobacco.
Supporting non-production, that is the goal.
I would like to see less tobacco overall in Europe.
Permit me to say a few words about the legal basis.
It is not for me to decide who is right.
Nor is it for this House to decide.
Let the courts decide.
What we need is a directive that makes sound recommendations, so that we can be sure to reduce tobacco consumption in Europe in the future.
