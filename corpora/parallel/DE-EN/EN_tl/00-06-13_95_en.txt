Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products: this is where the Commission wants to combine the three existing internal market directives.
The simplification of regulations as such, is only to be welcomed, yet the debate about tobacco has certainly taken on a very biased tone in many quarters.
There is no doubt about it: our citizens must be protected against the damaging effects of tobacco consumption and given the appropriate warnings.
I say that as a confirmed - but hopefully very tolerant - non-smoker and am wholeheartedly in support of this.
However, the debate about labelling is completely over the top to my mind.
Every smoker is aware of the risks tobacco consumption poses to health.
If people do not have the willpower themselves to give up cigarettes then as I see it, a statement covering a large area of the packet is not going to deter them from smoking either.
Overdoing the statements will do neither the consumer nor the industry any favours.
The death' s head on the packet has no real bearing on whether or not someone decides to take up smoking.
We need to hit the consumer where it hurts the most, which is the wallet in my view.
Temptation is best tackled with a lack of money.
If we do not want to drive the industry to take up the habit as well, then we must support an extension of the deadline for reducing the tar and nicotine content of tobacco products until December 2006.
The limit values proposed by the Commission for the year 2003 are not workable in our view.
The tobacco industry in Europe constitutes a highly significant economic factor.
I am therefore against putting companies at a disadvantage competitively, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Commission talks about harmonisation of internal market regulations, yet these small enterprises will be the ones to suffer the most from the stranglehold of special conditions and measuring procedures.
