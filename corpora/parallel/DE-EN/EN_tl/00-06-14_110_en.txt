Mr President, I wanted to give an explanation of vote stating that I had abstained on much of the Maaten report.
Not because I do not share its health policy objectives, but because I really cannot understand why the Commission and this House wish to pass such detailed regulations at European level, since all they do is destroy our credibility.
When we start regulating the size, colour and position of notices and pictures on cigarette packets, then we are no longer the Europe in which I believe.
I disagree with Newton Dunn; it is not a question of double standards.
But we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here.
Other regions must decide on their own regulations.
We cannot have rules which damage exports, with the result that others will then export to these regions.
I hope that we can reach agreements with the Council and the Commission here which contain clear, unequivocal health regulations, but not the sort of details which, in all conscience, we cannot decide in this House.
