I now have another statement to make.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to ...
(Interruption by Mr Brok)
Mr Brok, we have moved on to another point.
If it is about what the honourable member said earlier, I shall gladly give you the floor afterwards so that you can make a personal statement.
Now if you would be so kind as to take your seat, that would ease the tension somewhat.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to table the motion by 185 members to set up a temporary committee of inquiry into ECHELON in accordance with Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, which was rejected by a majority at the Conference of Presidents' meeting on 13 April, for a resolution by Parliament.
The President has informed me that the Conference of Presidents is due to discuss the question of setting up a temporary committee again tomorrow.
I am sure the honourable member agrees that it makes sense to wait for the results of this discussion before tabling the matter before plenary.
It makes no material difference, a vote will he held anyway, the question is merely whether it will be during this plenary session or the next.
