I believe I have because, as far as the procedure is concerned, we have two options.
First, we can vote separately on the question of setting up a temporary committee and the question of setting up a committee of inquiry.
We can do that separately and at different times.
But the Rules of Procedure do not require us to proceed in this way.
The motion, therefore, is to vote on both questions jointly as a package and that is our second option.
I cannot see that it will prejudice the idea of a committee of inquiry, which is what you want, if we merge the votes and the whole issue takes another three weeks.
It makes no material difference; at some point the House will have to state its view.
I repeat: it would be possible, but the President suggests that we proceed differently and I suggest likewise to you now.
