Mr Lannoye, that goes without saying!
The Rules of Procedure are crystal clear: if the requisite number of signatures is collected, then a vote must be held in plenary following the decision of the Conference of Presidents, otherwise it would mean that the Conference of Presidents decides whether or not to set up a committee of inquiry rather than plenary.
And, of course, that is not how it works.
There may be one or two people in the Conference of Presidents who believe that it is, but they are labouring under a misapprehension!
(Heckling, interjection by Mr Poettering)) Mr Poettering says no-one believes that and so your problem is solved!
