Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as Parliament and the Commission are concerned, this regulation raises three issues: first, how to prevent abuse of the aid scheme for flax and hemp, because there have been very significant irregularities under the regulation in the past; secondly, how to ensure that flax and hemp, both of which are impressive, renewable raw materials with a strong ecological and social impact, can continue to be cultivated in the EU.
And thirdly, we need to protect, consolidate and promote the burgeoning processing industry in this area, an industry producing smart, ecologically valuable, biological degradable products.
So we agree on the objectives, but we do not agree on how to achieve them, which is why Parliament has postponed the final vote on this report and is currently negotiating with the Commission.
Considerable progress has been made towards consensus and a compromise has been reached on numerous points.
We met again yesterday but did not finish editing the compromises and proposed compromises.
This motion for urgency tabled by the Council or the presidency is therefore premature and we propose therefore that it be rejected for the time being.
We assume that we will have reached a compromise which can be tabled by July and plenary will then be able to vote on it in July.
I should like to reiterate my express thanks in this connection to the Commission and Commissioner Fischler, who has been most cooperative in this matter.
I hope that we shall also be able to take account in this proposal of the fact that the Commission is keen for us to table and complete this procedure this year.
