Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I agree wholeheartedly with the motion tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.
He has outlined the matter quite clearly.
I, for my part as rapporteur, should like expressly to thank the Commission for its willingness to negotiate.
As you know, we still have no co-decision in agriculture, hence the two informal meetings, both of which lasted over an hour.
We reached a consensus on a great many points and the Commission too was willing to compromise.
Unfortunately, we have no written documents on which we can really vote and pass resolutions, which is why I support the motion to reject urgency for the time being.
