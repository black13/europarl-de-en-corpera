Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam made one thing clear: there is no way of getting past a common asylum and immigration policy.
The initiatives of the European Union on reuniting families, the anti-discrimination package, temporary protection for war refugees and, at long last, the attempt to harmonise asylum law make this very clear.
Now, with the Schmitt report - for which, by the way, I thank you in my capacity as coordinator of the Greens - we have the first clear stand by the European Parliament, even if a number of sensible proposed amendments - our proposals, which are also recommended by the UNHCR - have been rejected.
Mr Pirker, I do not see a problem with this - you can reject them again tomorrow.
One way or another, we shall be voting in favour of Mr Schmitt' s report.
These are the usual parliamentary rules of play and with them we can all live happily under one roof - that is my assumption.
Tempus fugit!
We must implement the Treaty of Amsterdam by the end of 2004.
There are difficulties at hand though.
The national states are often not prepared as yet to support European rules.
But this should not divert us from our purpose.
Mr Schmitt' s report goes in the right direction and calls on the Commission to take specific steps by proposing legislation.
I hope that we will be able to persuade the Member States of the merits of our approach.
