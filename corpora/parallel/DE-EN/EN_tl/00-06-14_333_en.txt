Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, this directive is, without doubt, the most important directive for the small and family-run businesses of Europe.
A good day' s work deserves a good day' s pay.
But some have had to wait for it longer than others.
The stronger the partner, the more power he has to make a business wait.
Here, for the first time, we have a regulation which ensures that the company' s liquidity is secured once the service has been provided, and within a foreseeable period of time.
I am delighted that we are debating today in the small circle, because you can see that this directive is totally uncontested and that the European Parliament stands fully behind this directive.
We know that some 450,000 jobs are lost every year as the result of late payments.
When we talk about job security and job creation, then we have a very important and crucial directive here which helps us to secure 450,000 jobs a year in Europe.
That deserves the headlines in the press but, as you know, the fight for jobs is already taken for granted.
I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is making such an important contribution to this.
This initiative was intensively promoted to start with by Marianne Thyssen, Mr Folias and Mr Murphy and we are proud of such an excellent result in the House.
Payment within 30 days, precautions to ensure that payments are actually made and that the company receives the money within 90 days.
It is a sensational result.
Congratulations!
I am proud to be a member of this Parliament.
