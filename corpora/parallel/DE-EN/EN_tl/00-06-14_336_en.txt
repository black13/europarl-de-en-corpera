Mr President, in one way it is a good thing that the public in the 15 European states does not take too much notice of what we are doing, especially on evenings such as this where you, Mr President, the Commissioner, seven members and roughly the same number of officials must stand by our posts.
This is an issue which is seemingly unimportant but which in fact affects several million companies - I myself am a small businessman - and tens of millions of consumers.
There is a proverb in Italian: Non e mai troppo tarde - it is never too late!
But it is too late for many small and medium-sized enterprises, family businesses and young entrepreneurs.
And many companies will not survive the delay before what we will hopefully decide by a large majority tomorrow is actually transposed into law.
Unfortunately they will no longer be able to take a positive view, as entrepreneurs, of this positive step in the right direction.
It will help SMEs, bring greater legal certainty and improve property rights; in the final analysis it is an employment programme, providing help for young enterprises and family businesses but also protection for the consumer.
I think that this aspect cannot be stressed enough.
All that is left is for me to thank all those involved, who have striven over the years to achieve this result.
I hope that the intended beneficiaries will indeed be able to reap the benefits of it as quickly as possible.
