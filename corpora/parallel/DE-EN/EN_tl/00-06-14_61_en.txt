Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the priorities for Feira, the European Union must strengthen the civil conflict prevention dimension of its policy.
That means, as far as weighting instruments is concerned, that the financial and material focus must be on an effective conflict prevention policy.
The main lines of conflict today are to be found in domestic conflicts and this proves that the rich countries lack the will to do enough to foster sustainable and socially-balanced development in the crisis regions.
The opportunity was missed in Helsinki to give concrete expression to an active prevention policy and efficient and prompt crisis management and we urgently need to make up lost ground here.
I congratulate Mr Patten on his activities in this direction, which I should like to support and help develop further.
In building up conflict prevention and after-care instruments, the focus needs to be on combining a reduction in the production and sale of arms and stricter controls.
One more point: the importance of Parliament.
There is a risk in the numerous informal circles of totally inadequate democratic control of a European security policy, which is why the European Parliament needs to take the lead.
Its position must be strengthened and this point needs to be entered on the agenda for Feira.
