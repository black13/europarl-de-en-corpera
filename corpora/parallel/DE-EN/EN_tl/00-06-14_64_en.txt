Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the excellent work of our rapporteur, Catherine Lalumière, we are now able to present Parliament' s position in the run-up to the European Council in Feira.
She has succeeded in describing a really accurate and balanced position with which a large majority of the political forces here in Parliament can identify.
Thank you, Catherine Lalumière.
The war in and about Kosovo has made Europeans realise three important things.
First, that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities.
So far, we have had neither the political mechanisms nor the instruments to prevent or settle conflicts.
If we want to avoid war, we need to give ourselves this capability.
I am delighted that you, Commissioner Patten, take this same view and look forward to hearing your proposals, the Commission' s proposals.
Secondly, we have learned that we are unable to intervene independently on our own continent and in our own neighbourhood, even in the case of very limited military action.
Thirdly: we have learned that we need to be independent from our American friends if we want to control the means to be deployed in a military conflict.
In other words: if we are dependent on others when it comes to reconnaissance, transport, attacking capacity and other such aspects, then we are fighting their war, not ours.
These realisations have resulted in the European Union' s at long last tackling and stepping up its efforts to define, organise and restructure a common security and defence policy.
Today' s debate is the European Parliament' s contribution to these efforts on the part of the European Union as a whole.
