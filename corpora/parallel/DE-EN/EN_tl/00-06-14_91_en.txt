Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is surely an extremely important report on what is without doubt a serious issue.
My own opinion of the legal basis notwithstanding, I really have the greatest respect for the proposals submitted and, above all, for the work carried out by Mr Maaten, who had to process an unbelievably large number of proposals, both in committee and here in Parliament for plenary, in an unbelievably short space of time.
I think that we shall not do justice to the significance and importance of this issue if we complete this procedure in such a short space of time.
There are so many proposals - 120 in all - that I fear that majorities will be reached and results will emerge which are not compatible with each other.
We really do need more careful voting and coordination both in and between the groups so that we achieve a result which is worthy of its name.
With the best will in the world and with the greatest respect for this issue, we must not forget that we really are not under any pressure and we should use the time available to us for careful reflection and review.
