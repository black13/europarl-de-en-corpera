Mr President, I should just like to point out that I believe that the House has passed an illegal resolution in the vote on the calendar because a four-day week in Strasbourg would only be permitted if there were no additional plenary part-session in Brussels or, conversely, I believe that only if the full plenary week has been exhausted is it legal to hold additional plenary part-sessions in Brussels.
Please have the legal implications checked as a matter of urgency.
We have clearly passed a resolution which violates the spirit and probably even the letter of the Treaty.
Because this could result in our holding one-day sessions here and five-day sessions elsewhere.
That cannot be the purpose of the compromise.
Apart from that, it is a huge waste of money to cut a day here and then hold additional plenary part-sessions.
