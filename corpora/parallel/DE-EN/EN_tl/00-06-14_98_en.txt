Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Posselt and Mrs Flesch have said about this unfortunate vote on cancelling Friday sittings here in Strasbourg.
I take the view that this violates the Treaty and violates the agreement on where Parliament sits.
I am really pleased that the ministers in the Council of Ministers and not Parliament continue to decide where Parliament sits and I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will not change that.
It is hard to understand why we are passing a resolution on a four-day working week when the Treaty refers to session weeks.
Every employee in the Community, hundreds of millions of people, work a five-day week.
Once we have a four-day week for everyone else, because the self-employed already work whenever they want, then we can also say that a session week is only four days long.
I think it is a disgrace, it is a waste of money and as for the ridiculous ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
