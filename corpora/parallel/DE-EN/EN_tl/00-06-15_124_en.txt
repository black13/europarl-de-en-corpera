Mr President, in some language versions the motions are shown as being tabled on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists by Mr Wiersma and by a certain Mr Sumberg, who does not, however, belong to our group.
I, at any rate, have not changed my name.
I am still called Swoboda and I am also proud of this typical German name.
I would be grateful if this could be corrected where it is wrongly shown.
Thank you.
