Mr President, we have just heard an outstanding speech by a highly qualified representative of the Commission.
We have held a high-quality debate lasting for over an hour on the most important topic in Europe today.
I would like to ask if we can guarantee that this is properly recorded by the Parliament' s Press Service, and is not limited, as so often happens on Thursday afternoon, to just a few lines, while all the other debates are recounted in epic detail.
