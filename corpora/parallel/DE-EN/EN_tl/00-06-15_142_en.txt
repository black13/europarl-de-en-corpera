Mr President, I still remember the 1980s very well, when Latin America, including Paraguay of course, attracted enormous attention in Europe, because at that time a great many people, and above all young people, were interested in restoring democracy to Latin America.
Fortunately, by the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s nearly every Latin American state had returned to democracy.
But in several countries there are signs of a return to the old ways.
Paraguay is one of the worst examples of this.
It therefore makes sense that the European Parliament, which has always regarded itself as the patron saint of democracy in Latin America and elsewhere, should express its views on this.
The second point that I would like to mention relates to Paraguay and Brazil.
Mr Lipietz has already touched upon this, but with a somewhat different emphasis.
I regard it as being extraordinarily helpful that within Mercosur, to which both these countries belong, a code of values has now been adopted under which dictators, or attempts to establish a dictatorship, no longer have a chance of success.
Oviedo was arrested in Brazil and I hope that he will be extradited to Paraguay.
This is proof that Mercosur is more than just a free trade area - it is a political area in which democracy is protected.
By the way, I totally agree with Mr Lipietz when he says that what is at stake in Paraguay is not just General Oviedo, but human rights as a whole.
There is nothing separating us on that.
However, you cannot of course write a whole book in a short resolution.
I hope that we will be able to discus this issue at some other point, and I assume that we will also be able to reach a consensus then.
