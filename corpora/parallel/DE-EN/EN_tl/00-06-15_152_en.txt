Mr President, I shall be brief, because almost everything has been said already, while I was waiting my turn.
The situation in Peru, like the situation in Paraguay, gives cause for concern.
Nevertheless, I must say that what we have witnessed in Peru is nothing new.
The President of Peru has for years been failing to play by the rules that we expect in a democracy.
So I would not just send a delegation of observers to Peru, but I would also recommend that the European Union, the Council and also this Parliament should pay more attention to the whole region.
We need more than just a resolution every now and again, we need to be constantly alert and critical, so that the people who are working for democracy are aware of our support.
Furthermore, I would like to point out that is not just the OAS, important as it is for Latin America, that has supported democracy in Latin America.
The European Union and this Parliament have in fact also played a key role here.
We have spent a great deal of money in this region and it would be gratifying if now and again people talked about the European Union' s contribution in Latin America, and not just about North America' s role.
This is not intended to be a chauvinistic remark, I am just making it so that justice is done towards us.
I hope that the European Parliament' s views on Peru will not go unheard in that country.
I know that a great many people set a lot of store by what this Parliament says.
Lastly, I would also like to mention that the longest standing relationship between the European Parliament and another parliament is with the Latin American Parliament - to which Peru also belongs - and that involves certain obligations.
I accordingly hope that we will obtain a large majority in favour of this resolution.
