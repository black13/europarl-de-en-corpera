Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to call on the Portuguese Presidency to do anything, because that is not necessary, as they have worked to ensure effective cooperation.
However, I would like to encourage you to do certain things in Feira.
By way of preparation for the decisions to be taken in December, it should once again be made clear in Feira that the enlargement process needs to be tailored to each individual country, so as to bring those countries which are best prepared into the European Union at an earlier stage.
With regard to institutional issues, it should be made clear at the summit that enhanced cooperation cannot be used as an excuse for failing to introduce proper extension of qualified majority voting.
As far as we are concerned, the extension of qualified majority voting will be a yardstick for the success of the Nice Summit, and it is linked with Parliament' s involvement through codecision.
We need to achieve efficiency and legitimacy, that is very important.
Furthermore, we urge you to extend the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference such that it can be concluded in Nice but also so that certain important areas can be included.
An attempt must be made to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding.
It needs to be made clear that we need a voice in economic and monetary policy and democratic control of economic and monetary policy.
Progress should at least be made with streamlining the treaties and demarcating competences.
At this point I would particularly like to mention the common foreign and security policy, which follows on from the implementation of the conclusions of the Helsinki and Cologne Summits, and has made good progress under the Portuguese Presidency.
We wish to encourage you to prepare the way so that we take the right decisions over the next six months.
