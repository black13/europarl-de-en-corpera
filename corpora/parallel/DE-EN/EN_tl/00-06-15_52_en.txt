Mr President, in connection with yesterday' s vote in this House, I simply wanted to draw honourable Members' attention to a press release I have just seen, according to which the Irish Attorney General, Nial Fennelly, has just called on the European Court of Justice to declare the directive banning tobacco advertising approved by a majority of this House null and void because of its inadequate legal basis.
I am saying this because my amendment and my request that the procedure and the vote should be deferred by a further four weeks were not accepted yesterday.
I think that it would have been better if the majority in this House had paid greater attention to the legal basis and had checked it more carefully, and if it had paid more attention to the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on that matter.
I would recommend that the Commission withdraw its proposal, even if it does not relate to exactly the same thing.
(Applause)
