Madam President, the trouble with this pass is that nobody knows about it!
We make virtually no use of it at all.
That is why I think you should remind the authorities once again that this pass is valid within the EU.
Yesterday, Mrs Karamanou said that she wanted to travel to America on it, which is of course impossible.
It clearly states in the pass that it is only valid within the European Union.
But to prevent this sort of thing reoccurring, perhaps the German authorities, and also of the authorities in other countries, should be made aware of its validity.
