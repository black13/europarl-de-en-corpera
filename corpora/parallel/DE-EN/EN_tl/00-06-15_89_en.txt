Mr President, I would like to make an explanation of vote on behalf of my delegation and say right away that we intended to vote for Amendment No 26 and paragraph 27.
We are, of course, anxious for crises to be solved by peaceful means and for peace to be maintained.
After the terrible events over the last century none of us wants military conflicts.
Nevertheless, the crisis in the Balkans has demonstrated the shortcomings of the European Union.
We therefore support the creation of an effective common security and defence policy for the Union, with its own identity.
We need to learn from our experience with the war in the Balkans, so that a disaster of this kind cannot be repeated.
The Treaty of Amsterdam made the Petersberg tasks the responsibility of the Union.
That leaves Article 5.
We support the idea of incorporating this article as a protocol to the EU Treaty, but we would like to emphasise that the sovereignty of the Member States must be preserved when it comes to decisions regarding participation in military interventions.
