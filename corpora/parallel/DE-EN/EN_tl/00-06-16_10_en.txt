Mr President, with your permission, I should like to draw your attention to an inconsistency between the Minutes and the lists of roll-call votes.
Yesterday, we voted on the resolution on the Feira Summit and many colleagues will recall that - to laughter from many in this House - the Austrian Members of Haider' s party voted in favour of two amendments which were very critical of Austria and then, some time later, took the floor and said that they had made a mistake and wanted their votes to be registered as votes against.
This correction - that is, that they voted against - is accurately reflected in the Minutes but, obviously in part thanks to their party headquarters' intervening, the names of these Members do not appear anywhere in the record of the roll-call vote taken on Amendment No 4.
I would therefore request that the lists of roll-call votes be corrected so that they correspond to the events which we all witnessed here.
The Minutes are correct in this respect.
It would also be desirable to clarify how many corrections to the corrections we Members are entitled to submit.
