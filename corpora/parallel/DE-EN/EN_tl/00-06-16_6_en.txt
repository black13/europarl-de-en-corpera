Mr President, I should like to return once again to the fax, which Mr Van Hulten made available to all of us before the vote, and which concerns the issue of whether sittings should continue to be held on Fridays.
This is not just about participating in plenary sittings; there are other tasks which need to be dealt with in this regard as well.
We will now have to deal with these matters at home.
There are, however, no attendance allowances for working at home.
But since we have been promised these allowances in Mr Van Hulten' s letter, in the coming year I will be claiming the lost allowances from him.
I call on all colleagues to do likewise.
Mr Van Hulten had better start saving up now!
(Applause)
