Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, three months ago there was a coup in Fiji.
Hostages were taken in the coup, and the press and politicians the world over have taken a stance on this.
Now it is over: negotiations have been held, the hostages have been freed and the coup has been over for some time.
I wonder what further urgent comments the European Parliament should now have to make on this.
In my view this contravenes Rule 50 and Annex III of our Rules of Procedure.
That is why we are requesting the deletion of this item from the list of topical and urgent subjects.
