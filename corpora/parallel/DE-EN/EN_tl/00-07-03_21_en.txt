Madam President, once again it is not the content of a motion for a resolution that is at issue here but our Rules of Procedure.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy we have been trying to ensure - and I appeal to all those colleagues who have been involved in this initiative - that important issues of this kind are not dealt with in the topical and urgent debate; instead we want to ensure that proper treatment is reserved for them in the form of a committee procedure, an oral question or a Council statement.
Here the issue is Tibet.
We know how important this is.
In 1992 I personally produced a report on Tibet.
A motion reflecting the report's conclusions was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament.
On 15 April here in this House we unanimously adopted a resolution on Tibet, and now we are repeating what we said on 15 April, perhaps with one or two minor additions.
I do not believe that Parliament's reputation is enhanced by our constantly debating the same subjects.
That is why we are requesting that this item be withdrawn.
