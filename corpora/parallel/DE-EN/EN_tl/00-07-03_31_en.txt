Madam President, I will not tire of appealing to the consciences of my colleagues.
We, and other Members, in particular the coordinators of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have established that the matters which we select for consideration in the topical and urgent debate are not always very appropriate.
This also applies here, to Iraq.
Three months ago, at the April plenary part-session, we adopted a resolution in which we say everything that it is possible for us to say about Iraq.
All the issues are covered.
I have carefully read the new motions for resolutions which have been tabled, but they do not contain anything new.
Nevertheless, this is to be included as a topical and urgent motion because one group, which has travelled to Iraq of its own accord, now has to submit this motion for a resolution.
I think that this would be wrong and irresponsible of Parliament, and that is why we are asking for this item to be withdrawn.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
We now have a request to replace the item on Venezuela with a new item entitled "Colombia and the international conference of donor countries in Madrid" .
