Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that is precisely why we wanted to withdraw a number of items.
We wanted to have fewer overall.
But I will be brief.
As you know, the Monitoring Centre is in Vienna.
Some time ago there were difficulties there between the government and the Director of this Monitoring Centre and also the Austrian representative.
Now it appears that the difficulties are being resolved and that better relations are once again being established.
Nevertheless, I believe that this House ought to call on all governments - the Austrian Government and the other governments - to ensure that the Monitoring Centre is in fact able to operate effectively and to support it in its work.
That is why we should like to add this item.
