Mr President, I remain dismayed at the way in which Austria continues to be prejudged by 14 Member States of the European Union and believe that it is still far too early to assess definitively the overall consequences of the Feira summit.
Certainly, there will be results on one or two further fronts thanks to the indisputably conscientious and ambitious work done there.
Inevitably it was an intermediate and preparatory summit which did not deliver satisfactory results on fundamental issues and it was therefore disappointing, and above all not very spectacular, apart from the only item not on the agenda - that is, Austria - and it was therefore also a rather thankless task for the presidency.
But what it really will be remembered for is a missed opportunity to return to normal relations within the Community.
Neither in Feira nor in the ensuing days did the presidency succeed - against the wishes of the majority of Parliament - in smoothing the way back to normality.
The further humiliation of Austria was at the very least tolerated.
This will be the enduring image of Feira.
