Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we vote in favour of this directive tomorrow or the day after we will be establishing one of the cornerstones of the fight against organised crime because, as Diemut Theato mentioned, the driving force behind organised crime is the money from drug trafficking, from trafficking in human beings and from all forms of organised crime.
This money is laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy.
This poses serious dangers: a danger to the economy because of distortions of competition; a danger to the company of being undermined, and a danger to the state whose stability is threatened.
That is why it is so important that we take up the battle here against money laundering and prevent it from happening.
Because if we succeed in stamping out money laundering then we will also stamp out organised crime.
That is why I welcome the fact that a new proposal has now been tabled which extends the first directive.
The situation has changed.
Organised crime is using new kinds of businesses.
Money is being laundered through different channels from the ones which were used in the past.
That is why it is absolutely essential for the European Parliament, for the institutions, the Commission and the Council, to make decisions here so that we have a new effective instrument with which to combat money laundering.
That is why we in the European People's Party support the fact that this directive extends the list of predicate offences to all areas of organised crime from which these proceeds are derived, and extends the scope to cover the professions and businesses which are abused or which may specifically be involved.
I very much welcome the rapporteur's efforts to propose an approach which actually makes the directive enforceable and practicable and thus into an effective instrument in the fight against organised crime.
We will be firmly supporting these proposals from the rapporteur.
