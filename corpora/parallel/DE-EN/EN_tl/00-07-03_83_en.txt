Mr President, in recent years criminal organisations within and outside Europe have set up powerful international networks which make huge profits from, for example, trafficking in women or drugs.
The amounts which change hands in the process run into billions.
The fight against money laundering is also in Europe's interests.
The excellent report by my colleague, Mr Lehne, seeks to improve the existing directive on preventing money laundering.
Institutions, such as banks, and also individuals with similar responsibilities, such as notaries and lawyers, are to be involved in resolving crimes of money laundering.
We must, however, prevent possible new loopholes from opening up.
Our aim will be to develop a pan-European information system to counter money laundering as quickly as possible.
If we do not establish a collaborative network to monitor and combat money laundering then one day we will no longer have an overall picture of money-laundering activities.
It must not come to that!
