Mr President, the introduction of a European visa policy is the occasion to debate an important issue, and here in this House we are today discussing the latest developments in this visa policy.
Mr Lehne's report gives important momentum to this process and we support his report.
He is already aware of this, so I do not need to thank him yet again because I have already done so in private.
The matter I should like to address here, something which I have reflected on many times, because I am of Turkish origin, is the following.
We considered whether we should table any amendments, but in fact we decided not to do so.
We will not therefore be making any recommendations here on how the report should be dealt with.
However, I should like to take the opportunity today - because otherwise no one listens to me - to voice my opinion for once on something which I am very uneasy about.
In my opinion, it cannot be right for the European Union to offer Turkey a chance to accede while at the same time maintaining the entry restrictions.
I am surprised that we cannot manage to find an alternative way to deal with the Turkey issue, particularly within the context of this harmonised list.
I am aware of the reasons for this, but I should nevertheless like to use our Parliament as a platform.
Around 3 million people of Turkish origin live in Europe and it is for this very reason that our Commissioner ought perhaps to consider in the future how we are going to resolve this problem reasonably and humanely in the coming years.
