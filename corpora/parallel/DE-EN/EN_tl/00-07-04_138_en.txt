Mr President, the Commission' s preliminary draft budget contains few surprises as far as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is concerned.
As rapporteur for this committee, I would just like to highlight three points that are of interest to the committee, within the context of the conciliation procedure.
One concerns the information campaign in the last phase before the introduction of the euro bank notes and coins.
The remaining time will have to be used intensively, which means that the information campaign for the euro (PRINCE 2001) must be continued with high priority.
We must step up the information campaign so as to avoid any uncertainty on the part of the public, particularly in the run-up to the introduction of the euro banknotes and in view of the exchange rate parity between the euro and the dollar.
The Lisbon guidelines constitute a second important point in the eyes of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
In addition to providing sufficient means and technologies for SME, it is also important to support programmes and actions that improve the self-financing and outside financing facilities for the Union' s key players on the job creation front.
This includes developing markets for financial services, providing risk capital, but also giving special attention to female entrepreneurship, as has already been called for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in the guidelines.
My third point concerns the debate about personnel.
If the Commission wants to honour its Treaty obligations in respect of merger control, anti-trust law and state aids then my committee believes that the Commission should make the Directorate-General for Competition a top priority when it comes to the redistribution of personnel in this area.
