Mr President, Budget 2001 must not be to the detriment of agriculture.
As such, I welcome the conclusion reached by the Committee on Budgets, pursuant to which there will be no introduction of compulsory personal insurance for the purpose of evening out fluctuations in the pig prices.
However we must take action to ensure that the level of income, and thus the standard of living of those employed in the agricultural sector does not get any worse.
Our farmers are not just our food producers, they also conserve our landscape.
If we close their businesses because their work no longer pays then our landscape will become increasingly desolate.
This will impinge on us all.
Therefore we must speak out against any attempt to make cuts in the budget that will harm agriculture.
The principle of financing the poor at the expense of other poor people has no place in Europe.
