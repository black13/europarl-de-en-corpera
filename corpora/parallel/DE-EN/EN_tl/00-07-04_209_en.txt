Mr President, Austria has very strict laws prohibiting fascism, national socialism and the resurgence thereof, and there has been a succession of convictions over the past few years.
Does the President-in-Office of the Council know of any similar, or better, legislation in other States?
Will the Council continue to ignore the fact that the sanctions against Austria decided on by the 14 Heads of Government are in violation of the European Treaties?
Will it persist in its refusal to take a stance on the matter, thereby remaining in breach of the Treaties?
Are bilateral decisions not to be dealt with by the Council in future?
