Mr President, I would like to comment on Mr Kuhne' s speech, which contained some scandalous comments to my mind.
He used his contribution as one of Parliament' s rapporteurs as an opportunity for polemics.
Since I have no wish to involve myself in polemics, I most certainly would not wish to remind Mr Kuhne that his European party is happy for large numbers of staff to be funded by their own group.
I do not wish to go any deeper into this, but he ought to have mentioned it.
All will become clear as to why I requested the floor.
Mr President, I urge you to clarify, via the Bureau of the European Parliament, to what extent a rapporteur of this Parliament is allowed to include personal polemics in his or her report.
I think this is irresponsible, and if we want to maintain a common style in this House, and eliminate abuses - which are also perpetrated within our groups - something I wholeheartedly embrace, then this must be done in a spirit of cooperation and not using polemics in the way that Mr Kuhne just has!
I urge you to have the Bureau look into this matter.
(Applause from the right)
