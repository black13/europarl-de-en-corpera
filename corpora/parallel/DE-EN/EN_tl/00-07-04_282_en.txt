Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the overall objective of the railway package under discussion here today is fast liberalisation of the European railways.
As you know, we in the PPE are calling for this in all areas needed to complete the single market, wherever healthy competition can replace hand-me-down monopolies.
Only comprehensive liberalisation will allow the necessary progress to be made so that the railway, as a carrier, has the qualitative and quantitative capacity to provide services and integrate with other carriers.
The Commission texts on developing railway undertakings, on licensing railway undertakings and on allocating railway infrastructure capacity are a step in the right direction in this respect.
My fellow member, Georg Jarzembowski, has earned my unstinting support for his efforts to bring about a self-contained railway package and would like to thank him for his work and his excellent report.
What is important to me in all this is that, when management and infrastructure are separated, investments in the infrastructure are examined closely and duly compensated.
Liberalisation will only be accepted if it results in real advantages and consumers need not fear for their safety.
From this point of view, we must be sure to keep a firm hold on strict conditions when licensing railway undertakings.
As far as the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity is concerned, we must ensure that there is non-discriminatory access.
I do not deny that flexible regulations governing access to the grid have caused a number of problems in the energy sector.
But I still think it is the best market economy approach and that also applies to the railways.
We should not just talk about a common Europe, we should have the courage of our convictions and do something about it.
