Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I generally welcome any measure or any directive to improve the mutual recognition of professional or academic qualifications.
Every member who, like me, lives in a border region, knows the problems encountered by citizens who work or wish to establish in a nearby Member State.
The EU Treaty clearly regulates the freedom of movement and the freedom to establish of people in the EU.
But the devil is in the detail.
We now realise that in fact every job description needs to be regulated.
But people no longer understand this.
Is this a citizens' Europe?
Is this a common market?
These are the questions.
The difficulties are clear from the number of current directives alone - there are "only" fourteen on today's subject.
We must reduce and harmonise the huge administrative costs, including within the Member States, which is why the Commission proposal to simplify the procedure is most welcome.
Individual job descriptions, training courses and pre-requisites vary enormously within the EU.
We need to start by finding similarities in training and curricula.
In the long run, uniform training courses and uniform curricula would be a great help and we must work towards that.
Until then, the Member States must consider very carefully how and where additional demands and improvements are needed and what sort of subsequent examination then needs to be demanded.
The deadline provided for by the Commission - which says that a decision on recognition must be made within three months - is an excellent move.
Procedures for recognising diplomas acquired in third countries must also be simplified.
We must cut the red tape within the EU, so that our citizens are able to put their skills to good use in every Member State.
