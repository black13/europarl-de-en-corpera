Mr President, the European institutions must be aware that they have a responsibility and also an obligation to guarantee the European citizen an efficient and economical administration.
Unfortunately though, the opposite still holds true, as borne out by cases such as Fl√©chard and the ECHO administration.
The Commission is still denying Parliament access to information on these misdemeanours to this day, which on no account should we take lying down.
Nor should we be surprised if European citizens continue to lose confidence in these administrative systems.
Consequently, we Independents have no intention whatsoever of granting discharge to the report on the general budget.
This ought to send out a clear signal that we are committed to creating efficient and economical administrative systems in Europe.
