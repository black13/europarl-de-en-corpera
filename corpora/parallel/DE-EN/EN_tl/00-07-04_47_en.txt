Mr President, I ought to have expressed my admiration at the time, when BSE was on the agenda and the rapporteur was starting out on his lonely journey.
It has taken a long time for responsibility to be accepted and also acted on.
The instructions and legislation in force today bear this out.
I also want, and feel compelled, to express my admiration of our rapporteur, Gabriele Stauner.
With her sharp legal mind, and the courage of her convictions, she concentrated on the facts of the matter, helped to shed light on errors and gave us all - and by that I mean all the EU institutions involved - time to reflect, at last opening the eyes of those who had persisted in their blindness.
Personnel were reorganised and many initially invisible doors were opened.
I too had many discussions on behalf of the research sphere.
The storm gradually died down.
At first, we approached each other cautiously, but watchfully, then we began to work constructively together.
In fact the media and the public should be made aware of this, because at the end of the day, we are all in the same boat.
I would therefore like to thank all our opposite numbers, be they from the Commission, the Court of Auditors or the European Parliament.
That said, I was disappointed at first, because some of my proposed amendments were defeated 10 to 10.
But it was still a good outcome.
Everyone should know by now what is going to matter most in the future.
It is all about the credibility of the EU, and in my research area it is about the pure necessity of regarding research as a great asset which lends enormous European added value, and about dealing with it in a suitably careful manner in future, so that we are in a position to grant discharge to the Commission with a truly cheerful heart for once.
We have long memories though!
