Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was a great pleasure for me to hear yesterday' s speech by the new President-in-Office of the Council, Jacques Chirac, in which he told us that we should pay more heed to the precautionary principle in environmental matters than we have until now.
I do not know if Mr Chirac was familiar with the detail of this report, but in any case he gave us a very clear pointer on how to vote tomorrow.
All phthalates should be banned from plastic toys, not just six.
After all, the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment expressed certain reservations about the most commonly used phthalate, and had serious concerns about another.
If we are to take our work at all seriously, then we should invoke the precautionary principle and ban the use of all phthalates as plasticisers.
Several of the 15 Member States - and there are 15 of us, not 14, Mr President - have applied this European precautionary principle concept, and that includes my own country, Austria.
We brought in a ban on all plasticisers in the phthalate group in an order published in Federal Law Gazette II No 225 in 1998.
I can only recommend this to the other Member States.
And I do not mean that in a bilateral sense, but in the framework of the Community of Fifteen.
Let me make a second comment.
If we were only to ban things when we had absolute scientific proof, then, my goodness, how ashamed we should all be now.
How could we allow these six phthalates to be used as plasticisers in PVC without having scientific proof at that time that they were harmless?
When our children' s health was at stake, we did not cry out for scientific proof.
Let us try tomorrow to rectify our past mistakes.
