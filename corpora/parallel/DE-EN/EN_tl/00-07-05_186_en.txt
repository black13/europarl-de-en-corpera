Mr President, the rules governing the voluntary labelling system provided for in the 1999 EU regulation expire on 31 August.
The Council regulation before us must be adopted to avoid a legal vacuum arising.
The agreement reached by the EU Agriculture Ministers on a Europe-wide beef labelling system was not such a major achievement.
The work in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was in fact much more demanding than the result before us.
The content of all the measures approved is to be modified so that proof of meat' s origin is valid as a guarantee in order to apply environmental control procedures and if necessary impose sanctions.
The Community labelling system quite rightly aims to enhance transparency of production and marketing conditions for beef, and in particular to improve certainty as to its origin.
Higher product costs cannot be ruled out, as the cost of applying the system will be passed on to the consumer.
The incalculable risk as regards food quality will not be dramatically reduced in this way, as the information provided is not primarily intended for the consumer.
The last 16 years, since the first outbreak of mad cow disease, have demonstrated the importance of production for consumer confidence.
The most effective measure is to strengthen production in the region of origin, which is more justifiable both environmentally and economically speaking.
