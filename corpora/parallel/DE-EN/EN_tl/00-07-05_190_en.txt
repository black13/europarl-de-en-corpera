Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some of the amendments tabled water down the substance and the objective of the Council' s proposal for a regulation on beef labelling.
The argument being presented, as we have heard, is that we should not ask too much of consumers.
An attempt is being made then to withhold information on the grounds that consumers are ostensibly stupid.
To my mind, that is the wrong approach, and we should assume that consumers have a good grasp of things.
We should provide consumers with information about the origin of the beef, offer them certainty and take consumer protection seriously.
The implementing provisions for this regulation are being enacted under the committee procedure.
That means that tomorrow we will have to vote on a legal text whose precise content is unknown.
Even the Commission cannot tell us exactly what form these implementing provisions will take.
I regard this as a very unfortunate procedure, which demonstrates the democratic deficit in the Community decision-making process.
