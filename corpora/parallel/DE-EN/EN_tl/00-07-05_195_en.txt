Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beef labelling was actually conceived as a quick way of regaining the public' s confidence in beef after a string of crises and scandals.
But it has since turned into an almost unending saga.
Whenever the regulation might cease to apply, Parliament is called upon to act quickly to prevent a legal vacuum arising.
There have been two deadlines, first December 1999 and now the present deadline of 31 August 2000.
Commissioner, given the time periods involved, you cannot seriously call on Parliament not to adopt any amendments.
We want a workable system, and we have always said that.
As the proposal before us does not guarantee that, it is not just our right, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to adopt amendments.
When I then hear that in Italy, for example, the technical requirements for this system are not even in place yet, and that the same applies in other countries, then I wonder why there is all this rush if the system has not been implemented anyway.
I would welcome some comments from the Commissioner on that point.
The Commission' s proposal will lead to our having to deal with the system again before long.
The Commission perhaps reacted somewhat hastily in the wake of the BSE crisis, and now we are into brinkmanship again.
I cannot help feeling that the 2003 deadline that was thought up in December 1998 is now occupying the Commission' s thought processes again.
I believe that you can achieve implementation of this regulation by 1 September if you accept our amendments.
You will not achieve it if you still insist on including category of animal, which we have already touched upon several times today.
That has nothing to do with information for the public, it is just a quality issue, and does not belong in this regulation.
Commissioner, please accept the amendments and we will then have something workable in place by 1 September.
