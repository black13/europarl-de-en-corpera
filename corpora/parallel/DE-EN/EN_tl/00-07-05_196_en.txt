Mr President, many aspects of the common position we have here reflect Parliament' s position at first reading, and this demonstrates the Council' s willingness to work with Parliament in order to achieve a positive and rapid outcome in this area, which is so important for European consumers.
I would have liked to simply approve the common position without further ado.
However, I find one point that has already been mentioned several times enormously difficult - category of animal.
This comes under compulsory labelling, where it has no place to be.
Category of animal really does not assist the regulation' s objective of guaranteeing meat traceability.
I therefore support the adoption of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5.
The Council will now have to remove the provisions relating to category of animal at its meeting in mid-July if it does not want to risk the regulation not coming into force on 1 September this year.
Secondly, there is Amendment No 4 on minced beef, which relates to the last part of Article 14, first paragraph, beginning "and origin" .
I am afraid I cannot follow this either.
In my view, this amendment lacks precision.
How is 'origin' to be defined here?
Does it refer to where the animal was born or where it was fattened, or both, and who is responsible for labelling here?
Exactly how will origin be indicated?
None of this is clearly worded and I see a risk that the Council will refuse point blank to accept this amendment, so that we will end up with a conciliation procedure, which will in turn further delay the entry into force of the regulation.
This is not in the interests of consumers, and I therefore call on the House to reject Amendments Nos 4 and 6.
