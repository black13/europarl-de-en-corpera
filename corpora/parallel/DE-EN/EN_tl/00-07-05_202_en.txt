Mr President, Commissioner, it is not the label that counts.
We all understand that expression, but what counts here really is the label - and I am not talking about haute couture!
Beef labelling is an important stage in the process of rebuilding consumer confidence.
I note that despite the protracted preliminary discussions not all EU Member States have recorded every last animal on their computers.
Yet the compulsory labelling system is supposed to take force in all Member States as from 1 September 2000, thus finally replacing the voluntary system.
The question for consumers will be this: what information can we expect?
Where was the animal born?
In the EU, in a third country, at which farm, in what region?
What does country of origin mean, or perhaps even source country?
And then there is the debate about categories.
Should I buy a sucking calf, a normal calf or a heifer today?
As I come from a farming background myself and there is nothing I more earnestly want for farmers than stable prices, I believe that we should create legal bases that are underpinned by consensus.
We should not make the legislation unnecessarily complicated.
We are all concerned about public health and consumer protection.
So as from 1 September 2000 we will have labelling, and as from 1 January 2002 it will be extremely comprehensive.
The beef chain from producer to consumer can be very long, and the supply chains in Member States vary widely.
Yet I do not think that cattle headed for the slaughterhouse are really such great tourists.
However, strict criteria must also apply to imports from third countries.
By way of conclusion, let me say that I once learnt that top athletes' nutrition programmes should include meat.
Our top athletes' eating habits have a great impact on health and performance.
I hope that we can rebuild confidence and that people will once more become great meat-eaters.
