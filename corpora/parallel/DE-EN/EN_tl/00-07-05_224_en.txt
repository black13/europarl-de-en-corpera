Mr President, I would like to follow up Mrs Kauppi' s question, in relation to the strategy on the level of invention.
A high level of invention has the advantage that it is easy to defend in court, because revocation proceedings are of course a huge problem.
A low level of invention has the advantage that many companies and inventors can submit their inventions and obtain a patent very quickly.
That is why I believe that the strategic level Europe is to adopt is a vital issue, because the Japanese, for instance, have now adopted the principle of a low level of invention and accordingly have a flood of applications.
Europe and the European Patent Office in fact have a very high level of inventiveness.
I believe that this is enormously significant as an instrument of economic policy.
