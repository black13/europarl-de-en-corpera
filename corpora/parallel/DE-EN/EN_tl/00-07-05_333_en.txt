Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
May I depart from normal practice by asking you to pay greater attention to the allocated time slots.
Your colleague Mrs Reding is the very last speaker today.
She will no doubt be annoyed with me if she has to stay here until one in the morning.
Would you please therefore be so kind as to keep your remarks somewhat briefer on future occasions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
