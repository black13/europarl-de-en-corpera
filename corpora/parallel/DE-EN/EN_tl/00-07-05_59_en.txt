Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal presented by the Council here is one which has our support, although it has one serious flaw.
According to Article 14 of this proposal, and this was also discussed in the committee responsible, the documents are to be available in all 11 official languages of the European Union, but not the second official language of the Republic of Cyprus, that is Turkish.
We request that this agreement should also be translated into Turkish, as an official language of the Republic of Cyprus - not only into Finnish, Swedish, Danish, German and so forth, but also into Turkish.
The Council should take this into account in future in negotiations of this kind, if it wants to secure our agreement under a simplified procedure!
