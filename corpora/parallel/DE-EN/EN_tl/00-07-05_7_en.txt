Mr President, according to our information, Mrs Stauner withdrew the explanatory statement in the relevant committee yesterday, but despite that, it has been distributed today.
I would just like to ask you, Mr President, to establish if this statement was withdrawn by the rapporteur or not.
If it was, then it should not be distributed as an official document.
