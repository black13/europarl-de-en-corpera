Mr President, complete liberalisation would lead to an increase in competition in the rail sector and enhance the competitiveness of railways as compared with road transport.
There is no point in talking about projects to extend the European rail network until complete liberalisation has taken place.
This is therefore a matter of urgency.
Projects such as the Brenner base tunnel can only compete if freight transport can be offered at competitive rates.
Adopting this directive would give a clear signal about liberalising rail transport.
If a clear split is not made between the trains operated by the railway companies on the one hand and the management of railway infrastructure on the other, the objective of this directive will be seriously undermined.
I have therefore rejected the solution opted for in Article 6(4) of the common position.
