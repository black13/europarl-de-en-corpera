The fact of the matter is that yesterday evening, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I withdrew this explanatory statement.
I asked the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control to draft a letter to that effect.
Because we were sitting in the evening, that was no longer possible.
I assume that if I go to my office now, I will find the letter there and can sign it so that we can proceed accordingly.
