Mr President, as a people' s representative I believe it is important for us to stand by what we have signed.
Of course it is not particularly pleasant in terms of our parliamentary activities to have to withdraw something suddenly.
But the members of our group have different views on the subject of illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.
That is why we have withdrawn our signature.
I ask you to take note of that.
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
President.
In view of the time, voting time will be suspended now and resumed at 5.30 p.m.
