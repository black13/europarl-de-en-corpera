Mr President, I do not believe Parliament should feel satisfied with what has been achieved so far.
In discharging the Commission, it runs the risk of losing credibility in the field of budgetary control and combating fraud.
Nor am I sure whether people in this House actually realise that giving a discharge means accepting liability for damages.
It will be hard to explain to the citizens of Europe why EUR 14 million of taxes were squandered on the Fl√©chard case and why Parliament is letting itself be fobbed off with empty promises.
So everyone in this House who voted for the discharge to the Commission is assuming quite personal responsibility for it.
We need hardly wonder why the citizens are increasingly losing faith in Europe.
On behalf of my group, I therefore want to state that we voted against the discharge to the Commission for that reason.
