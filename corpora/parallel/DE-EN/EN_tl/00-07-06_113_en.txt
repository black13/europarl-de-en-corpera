- On 6 June I as rapporteur recommended to the Committee on Budgetary Control that we give the Commission a discharge for the 1998 financial year.
Today I voted against that discharge.
The deciding factor was the way the Commissioner for budgets handled the Fl√©chard case.
This firm was suspected of fraud as early as 1992.
Nonetheless, it was let off a fine to the tune of EUR 14.6 million.
Nonetheless the Commission continued to do business with it all those years, without asking any questions.
Now the Italian financial police are investigating and it is said that the firm is involved in shady deals and the black marketeering of butter on a grand scale.
Of course, we must not prejudge.
But the Commissioner for budgets does not have the right to refuse to tell us how many millions the Commission has paid to this firm over the past years.
Mrs Schreyer promised the figures to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 24 May, but has still not produced them.
She gives one excuse after another.
On Tuesday, she tried to make this House believe, wrongly, that Regulation 2390/1999 prevented her from presenting the figures.
The Community budget is not a matter of secrecy.
If the Commission refuses to render account, our response can only be to refuse the discharge.
