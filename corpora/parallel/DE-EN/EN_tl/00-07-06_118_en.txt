Mr President, I urgently request you to ensure in future that legislative texts are voted on first in the order of voting.
For it really is Parliament' s primary task to decide legislation!
I do not approve of the fact that we have suspended the vote after only an hour and a half today, but I will have to accept it.
However, I am absolutely against an order of voting that automatically means that legislative texts are not taken until Thursday evening.
I ask you to alter the voting order accordingly.
