I am sorry, Mr President, to continue from where I left off a moment ago and come back to what Mr Swoboda just said.
Mr President, I understand everything you have said.
But this week for the first time we did not have a vote at noon on Tuesday.
That is a decision that was taken.
We were against; the majority of the House - had they known of it - the rapporteurs - Mrs Redondo Jiménez and Mr Arvidsson and others - would no doubt also have been against it.
But if we do this, then we must also show some degree of flexibility.
Among this rather smaller body of people I dare to say this; most of us are experienced parliamentarians and we know that there are different kinds of sittings.
The Thursday sitting in July is a particularly sensitive one.
We know that, we may not be happy about it, but that is how it is.
So I would ask you to check whether the four legislative reports that are still on the agenda, and that do not need long votes, can be carried over to the next part-session.
Mrs Redondo Jiménez herself asked the same, in the case of her report, and she has my support.
Mr Arvidsson - all this relates to what I know about - will, I hope, also agree.
So I would ask you to contact the rapporteurs and the groups.
Mr Swoboda has already said it, and I can repeat it for my own group: we will agree to these four legislative reports being carried over to the September part-session or to a part-session in Brussels.
