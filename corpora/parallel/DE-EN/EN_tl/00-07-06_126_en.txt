- I voted against giving a discharge to the Secretary-General because he gave misleading information to the political decision-making bodies about the purchase of the ASP building in Brussels.
This wrongly gave the impression that the Council and the Commission had agreed to the building being financed with the help of the then property developer.
Furthermore, this wrongly gave the impression that financing the building with the help of the property developer was an indirect form of financing.
In fact, in 1988 Parliament directly indebted itself to a banking consortium headed by WestLB, for amounts of ECU 472 million and BEF 7 billion, without first publishing an invitation to tender for the contract in the Official Journal.
The Court of Auditors also found that the relevant financial regulations had been infringed.
