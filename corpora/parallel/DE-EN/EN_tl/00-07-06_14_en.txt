Mr President, the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions is a very special body.
It receives complaints from citizens, as the two previous speakers rightly said, who believe their rights as EU citizens have been restricted.
As draftsman of an opinion on the right of residence, I would like to make a few comments on the specific problems in this area.
The free movement of persons is one of the basic freedoms achieved through European integration.
Since the Maastricht Treaty there is a general right of residence, provided the individual concerned has adequate means of subsistence and adequate health insurance protection.
Freedom of movement and right of residence can be restricted only for reasons of law and order, security or health.
Experience has shown the Committee on Petitions that in practice the right to freedom of movement comes up against a great many problems because: (a) Member State authorities are slow to transpose the rules of Community law, (b) problems arise with the recognition of diplomas and qualifications in the case of specific professions, (c) the rules on social security have not been standardised, e.g. complicated forms for the refund of medical costs.
An analysis of Treaty infringement proceedings between 1996 and 1999 shows that in 97 cases there was a direct link between the petition and the Treaty infringement proceedings before the European Court of Justice.
Unfortunately, the Council often ignores the communications from the Committee on Petitions about serious violations of Community law by Member State authorities.
That reflects a negative attitude towards the European citizens' right of petition.
In future the Council should devote the necessary attention to the rights of EU citizens.
