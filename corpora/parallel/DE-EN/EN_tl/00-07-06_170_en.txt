Madam President, the Commission, like Parliament, is deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet.
We are particularly concerned about respect on the part of the Chinese authorities for the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the autonomous region of Tibet.
We have raised this issue repeatedly during the bilateral dialogue with China on the subject of human rights.
In particular, the European Union has called on China to resume the dialogue with the Dalai Lama as soon as possible.
In our view, a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way of achieving a lasting and peaceful solution to the issue of Tibet.
With regard to cooperation, the European Union takes the view that it is in the interest of the Tibetan people that we support aid projects in Tibet, provided the group of ethnic Tibetans benefits directly from them and is given priority in the management of the projects.
That is precisely what happened in the past when the Chinese authorities gave an official assurance to that effect.
On the question of the World Bank project, I can inform you that the Commission is not involved in that project.
So I do not believe we have any means of exerting much influence now, at the very last minute.
If any influence at all can still be brought to bear, it would be up to the Member States to do so.
