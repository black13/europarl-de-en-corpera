Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I gather from the Ombudsman' s Annual Report that, as we have now heard, the main complaint of the citizens is about lack of transparency.
But it appears that not everyone concerned is aware of this problem.
The Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation on public access to documents which you, Mr Söderman, rightly criticised in public as not going far enough.
Indeed there has been quite a lot written on the subject.
The spirit underlying this proposal can be gauged from the statement by the Advisory Committee of Independent Experts.
According to the experts' second report, like all political institutions the Commission needs room to consider, to formulate policy before it becomes public, because policy that is made directly before the public eye is often bad policy.
As a representative of the European public, I find this approach to questions of transparency and of policy-making in general unacceptable.
So I firmly support Mr Södermann' s justified criticism!
