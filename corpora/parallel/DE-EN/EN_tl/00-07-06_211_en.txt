Mr President, on 15 April this year, following a full debate with the Council and the Commission, we adopted a resolution that was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of this House.
In that resolution we called on the Council and the Commission to do their utmost to protect the life and health of the Iraqi people and to put an end to its suffering.
We called for the embargo on food and medicines to be lifted, because it hits the Iraqi people and not Saddam Hussein.
We called for an immediate stop to the bombing the USA and the United Kingdom is engaged on without a mandate from the UN Security Council, because again this hits and punishes not the culprits but the victims in Iraq.
At the beginning of that resolution we of course confirmed and underlined the Iraqi Government' s obligation to accept and encourage the United Nations' controls with a view to the destruction of ABC weapons and to trace the disappeared Kuwaiti citizens.
With today' s debate and this new resolution we are seeking to achieve three further objectives.
First, we want to address not just the Council and the Commission but also the United Nations Security Council.
Secondly, we propose that our Parliament should take the initiative in sending a fact-finding mission on the ground.
Thirdly, we reiterate the need for the United Nations, the World Health Organisation and the Red Cross to ensure that the most deprived and vulnerable people in Iraq can benefit from the oil for food programme.
