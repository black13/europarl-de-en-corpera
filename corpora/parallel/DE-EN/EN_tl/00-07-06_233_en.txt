Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I want to firmly reject Mr Sylla' s comment that we have a politically-led judiciary in our country, in the Republic of Austria.
Secondly I want to note that there are many urgent resolutions that deserve to be discussed in this House.
The urgency on the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia based in Vienna, tabled by Dr Swoboda, does not deserve any urgent discussion.
It was prompted by a purely personal matter concerning Professor Pelinka.
He resigned from the Centre' s Management Board voluntarily.
The real reason was that he refused to do something which is a matter of course, which is the duty of every Austrian citizen, namely to render account of his activity if he is being paid for it by the Austrian Government.
Let someone tell me what that has to do with the European Parliament.
So it is easy to understand why we will not endorse recital A of this motion for a resolution and cannot share the concern about this matter.
It should also be noted that the Monitoring Centre on racism is based in Vienna, not least thanks to the commitment of the present Chancellor and then Foreign Minister Wolfgang Sch√ºssel, and that we are proud to give a home in Vienna to this kind of institution that keeps a watchful eye on xenophobia and racism in all the European countries.
For the Centre' s report indicates that no one country is immune from such tendencies.
For the rest, Austria has very strict regulations against neo-Nazism and its reactivation.
Perhaps it needs pointing out that one sad case, the Omufuma case, was a case that a Socialist minister of the interior had to answer for.
Clearly Dr Swoboda was also aware of the embarrassing nature of his first motion, otherwise the basically reasonable and considerably weaker motion for a resolution we can all support would not have come into being.
(Applause)
