Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating a motion for a resolution that is lacking in substance.
It is difficult to identify exactly what the complaints are, which means we do not know precisely what we are discussing.
Who has actually seen Mr Pelinka' s letter of resignation?
Who knows the real circumstances of his resignation?
What is known in Austria about Mr Pelinka' s resignation is the fact that various versions are being circulated by various people.
What I know is the fact that legal proceedings are pending between Mr Pelinka and Mr Haider.
Under no circumstances is it the business of politics or of any parliament to go so far as to criticise proceedings before an independent court that have not yet concluded.
Every state governed by the rule of law provides for constitutional legal measures.
A policy that does not respect the independence of the judiciary does not, in the final analysis, respect the principle of the separation of powers and thus violates a basic principle of democracy.
Racism and xenophobia are a serious problem throughout the Union and one that must be taken seriously.
It must be combated by every means available wherever it arises.
What I expect of the Monitoring Centre is to take stock of the situation objectively and to look at it in comparative terms, so as to allow the policy-makers to react to it.
What I do not expect of the Monitoring Centre is interference in day-to-day political matters and to exercise its mandate with an ideological bias.
Because underlying the concept of racism and xenophobia there are people and their destinies, and they should not be used to put on some kind of political show.
What I oppose is that this simplistic motion for a resolution is also tabled by those Austrian Members who pretend to support my home country.
