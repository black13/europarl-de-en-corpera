Mr President, the Commission is grateful for the valuable contribution Professor Pelinka has made as a member of the Management Board towards setting up the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
Yet it is the Commission' s common practice not to express an opinion on legal proceedings concerning individuals in the Member States.
That applies particularly to this case, which falls outside the scope of EU legislation.
Moreover, the Commission cannot express any views on the reasons that led Professor Pelinka to resign from the Monitoring Centre' s Management Board.
The Commission services have already requested the Austrian authorities to appoint a new member of the Management Board.
The Commission emphasises the importance of the independence of members of the Management Board, as provided for in the regulation on setting up the Centre.
I do not believe I need give you an assurance here, since everyone knows that so far, the Commission has done all in its power to support the Monitoring Centre in Vienna and will continue to do so in future.
We are firmly convinced that the Monitoring Centre plays an important role in combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.
Let me specifically underline once again that the Commission attaches the greatest importance to ensuring that the Monitoring Centre will under all circumstances remain an independent body, enjoying the utmost autonomy in the performance of its tasks.
