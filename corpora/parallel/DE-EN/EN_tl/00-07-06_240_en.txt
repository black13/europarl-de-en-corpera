Mr President, we agreed a joint motion for a resolution, on which five groups collaborated.
Once the document was finished, a sixth group joined in.
I think it is contrary to our Rules of Procedure for a group to join in signing this motion without asking the others.
My group regards that as a breach of our Rules of Procedure and I would ask you, Mr President, to examine this matter.
Given that we collaborated on it, we will in fact vote for this resolution, yet I would ask you to ensure that the sixth group' s signature is deleted from this motion for a resolution.
