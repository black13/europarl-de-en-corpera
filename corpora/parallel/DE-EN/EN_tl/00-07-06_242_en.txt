Mr President, the same applies here as to the one I just spoke about.
I insist that you have this checked because it was just during this part-session that a member of our group wanted to add his signature to a motion for a resolution by other groups but first had to obtain written authorisation from the other groups.
We cannot have two different procedures being applied in the same week.
So I would ask you to investigate this matter and inform us of the results.
For the rest, we support this resolution because we helped draft it.
