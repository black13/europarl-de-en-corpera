I would like to give warm thanks to all the Members who took part in this debate for their suggestions, as well as for their very strong criticisms.
I will pass them on and will raise them during the Commission' s debate.
Let me just reply briefly to two points.
The first concerns the legal bases and the financing.
Here we should not forget that one of the characteristics of a non-governmental organisation is that it should not be dependent on public funding.
Otherwise it ought to be called a governmental rather than a non-governmental organisation.
So I do not have very much sympathy for the oft-repeated call for governments or the Commission to assure the financing of non-governmental organisations in full.
All they can ever do is provide support and cooperate on projects.
That is quite fundamental.
A number of speakers have addressed the question of non-governmental organisations and enlargement.
I will answer them, because this matter is within my direct remit.
All the ideas I have heard put forward in this debate have long since become reality.
With our pre-accession aid, we are working very closely with the non-governmental organisations in the candidate countries; moreover our communications strategy, the organisational and financial framework of which has now been established, is also very much targeted at non-governmental organisations in candidate countries, since the aim is precisely to fully involve civil society in this important political process.
I will faithfully report everything else back to the Commission, without omitting to mention what I perceived to be the basically rather critical mood of this debate, and I can assure you that I myself will certainly urge very strongly that procedures are simplified and decisions taken more rapidly.
