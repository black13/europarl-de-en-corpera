Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to give very warm thanks to my colleague Robert Atkins for drafting such an excellent report.
He took great trouble not just to comment on the Commission' s proposals but also to outline them.
I regard the broad line of separating the regulatory from the operational function as the right one.
Indeed in paragraphs 4 and 5 we note again that our Parliament has now decided on two occasions that the regulatory function is to be transferred to the European Union.
That brings me back to the last speaker.
Of course we have to distinguish between possibly having several or many service providers in the operational field, but the regulatory function must remain with, or more to the point go to the European Union.
Nor is that in any way a problem.
Today we have 15 Member States in the European Union, and 12 more have applied to join.
If we start to proceed according to the EEA system even at this point - defining the common rules and then asking the candidate states their opinion - we can integrate them.
That is why I also think it is a good idea in the present situation for the European Commission to pool Member States' interests in regard to the regulatory function in the framework of Eurocontrol.
We do not need multilingualism, we need unanimity on the question of the regulatory function.
I really would strongly urge the Commissioner to refer the proposals Parliament will be deciding on today back to the High Level Group and to continue ensuring that this working group produces very sound practical results.
We have great respect for the vice-president, for she set up this group of military and civilian experts and the work is progressing well.
There may still be some resistance in individual countries.
We wish the vice-president much luck and success, so that come October we can submit an excellent programme.
