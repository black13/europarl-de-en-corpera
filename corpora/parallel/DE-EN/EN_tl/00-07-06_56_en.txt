Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there has hardly ever been such a topical report as this one.
Just in time before the summer break, when everyone goes on holiday and more and more people also travel by plane, today Parliament is considering questions of air traffic.
A tiresome subject, as we all know, and as every air traveller finds out.
We all suffer from delays that often last hours.
It has now become a daily scene at airports to see every passage-way overcrowded with bored, irritable or even aggressive passengers.
It happens to us MEPs very frequently, as it does to much of the population during the holidays.
Let me remind you of another aspect.
When aircraft cannot land on time, that not only creates a great many personal difficulties for people on business trips who have to keep to their schedules but also produces extra costs and environmental pollution.
So I welcome the fact that the Commission has submitted a report on these important subjects and that a High Level Group was set up to consider the problems of establishing a single European sky.
I hope we will have the final results of its inquiries before us in good time in the autumn so that we can then really move on to taking concrete measures jointly with the Commission.
The safety aspect comes top of the list for all passengers, but especially for frequent fliers.
Safety standards must on no account be endangered.
That is why we need better airspace control and protection.
Eurocontrol must satisfy all these safety requirements, but that means we also have to create the necessary framework conditions.
