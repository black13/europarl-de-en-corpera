Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Dami√£o has drafted a very good report and taken good account in it of my opinion for the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
It is most important to everyone to improve the health and safety protection at the workplace for women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, both to protect the woman and to protect the unborn child.
This is a general social issue and must be treated with the greatest care.
The Commission' s report on the 1992 directive is only concerned with the technical transposition of the directive and does not look at the situation at the workplace, which has to some extent changed, or at the changed role of women in society.
The number of single parents has risen and women are more concerned with achieving economic independence.
The Commission must submit a proposal for revision of the directive that takes account of all these changes, and it must do so as quickly as possible, this very year.
There is a considerable need to improve the legislation.
That applies to preventive health protection measures at the workplace for the mother and for the unborn child.
Here we must avoid any risks.
Any activity that puts their health at risk should without exception be prohibited.
Periods allowed for breastfeeding should be regulated and there should be facilities for breastfeeding at the workplace.
Maternity leave after the birth of the child should be at least eight weeks.
There must be clear rules on financial support, both for the period of pregnancy leave and for maternity leave.
The question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified.
None of these necessary provisions must lead to discrimination against women or to a reduction of their chances of access to the workplace.
