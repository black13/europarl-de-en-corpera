Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to draw your attention to something really annoying in connection with the Minutes.
The "Texts Adopted" also form part of the Minutes.
I pointed out yesterday during the vote on the directive to combat money laundering the English translation of Article 6(3) needs to be corrected to bring it in line with Amendment No 26, because the English translation is wrong.
In the middle of the second paragraph of the English version there is only a reference to representation in legal proceedings, but no reference to legal consultants, as there is in the German text.
That is a key point in this directive and since the Council working group is working on the basis of the English text it is quite crucial to correct this text.
I had already complained about this in committee vis Ã  vis the language services.
At the time the committee decided not to table an amendment because the German text is the original version, as drafted by the rapporteur.
I complained about this yesterday - the situation was not remedied - and today is the third time I am complaining about it!
I do think the services of this House should work more carefully on such key questions and it really is intolerable that despite my criticism yesterday the Minutes have got the text wrong again!
I would ask you get to the bottom of this matter, to sort out this most important aspect of the directive and to please correct this in the English translation!
