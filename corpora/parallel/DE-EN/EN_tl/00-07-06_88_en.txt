Mr President, as you have said, we will be voting on the compromise motions agreed in an informal conciliation procedure with the Commission.
We referred the report back on 16 May and in the meantime it has been improved.
By adopting this procedure vis-Ã -vis the Commission, Parliament has once again expressed our resolve also to achieve full codecision in the Committee on Agriculture and in relation to agriculture.
We have achieved it by adopting this procedure for the case in point.
I want to thank the Commission for its cooperation in this regard and I hope the compromises we have reached will also gain the kind of support from the Council and the Commission that means they can only be rejected unanimously.
So the Commission and Parliament have jointly managed to establish a very strong position and I hope that will also serve as an example to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice.
