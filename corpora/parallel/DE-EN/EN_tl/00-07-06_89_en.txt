Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I really want to give warm thanks, not just to the Commission but also to all those involved, to all my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture, for enabling us jointly to achieve this compromise!
I would ask you to adopt this document today, because otherwise the Council would be able to take a decision on 16 and 17 July without having Parliament' s opinion, since we would not be cooperating as faithfully as we should according to a European Court of Justice ruling.
So I would ask that we adopt this document today.
Once again, many thanks for your cooperation!
