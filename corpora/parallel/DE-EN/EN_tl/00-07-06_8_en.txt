Mr President, yesterday we received a communication on yellow paper from the vice-president, with some nuts attached to it.
This note was about supporting the export of products from Vanuatu, a developing country in the Pacific.
I think that is a very good idea and quite right.
And I am quite happy to support it.
But what rather puzzles me is that in it the vice-president quite explicitly stated that it is illegal to import these nuts into the European Union.
So I must ask this vice-president to explain how these nuts came to be illegally imported, since it was he who delivered them to us!
That in itself is a contradiction so would he please clarify the matter.
(Laughter and applause)
(The Minutes were approved)
