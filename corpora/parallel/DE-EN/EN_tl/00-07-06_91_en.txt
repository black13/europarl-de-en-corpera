Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just a few brief comments.
I confirm that the Commission accepts 12 of the 13 compromise amendments.
The Commission merely has a few reservations about the legal wording and the order of the compromise amendments in the text.
But in terms of substance, the Commission will support them during the discussion with the Council.
Regarding Amendment No 46, I would point out that the system of voluntary transfers of quotas between Member States can only be used once, simply because otherwise it could easily undermine the allocation system.
Regarding Amendment No 51, the Commission takes note of the committee' s concern about the level of support for long fibres but must just point out again that obviously it will be impossible to evaluate the situation in full if a report has to be drawn up on it only a year after the reform.
On behalf of my colleague Mr Fischler and the Commission, let me thank you for your cooperation.
I believe that the compromise proposals that have been achieved have helped improve the text and above all, of course, have helped take the situation forwards.
