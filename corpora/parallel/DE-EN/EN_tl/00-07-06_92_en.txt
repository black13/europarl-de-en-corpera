Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret having to take the floor in regard to Mr Kuhne' s report, but this concerns a very serious course of events.
This report, which is about the discharge of Parliament' s 1998 budget, as you all know, contains a paragraph 18 and a sixth indent.
This sixth indent concerns our group.
There was an agreement - and all the group chairmen will confirm this - between the group chairmen that we would not address concrete cases relating to individual groups in the report, but that in future we will jointly endeavour to tackle any problems that may arise.
So in view of the wording in the report, I tabled a compromise amendment on behalf of my group, and it was indicated to me a few days ago that the rapporteur would approve that compromise.
We thereupon refrained from tabling an amendment that also refers to problems in regard to the Socialist Group.
I now hear that the Socialist Group evidently will not endorse our Amendment No 10, tabled in my name.
Let me state quite plainly, in all seriousness and with great regret, that this means the agreement between group chairmen was given up.
Fair play was given up!
Let me also say that our group is disappointed, not just I personally but the entire group.
If the Socialist Group does not support compromise Amendment No 10 - and that is up to the group - then let me tell you that this will be a very grave decision it is taking here today.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
