Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 propose deleting the obligation to indicate the category of animal on the labelling.
There have already been discussions about the definition of the category in the Management Committee and the Commission is confident that solutions will be found that satisfy the majority, if not indeed all of the Member States.
The Commission therefore believes it is crucial to introduce the provisions on labelling on 1 September.
To open up the whole debate again would delay their entry into force.
Then the amendments could not be adopted.
Regarding Amendment No 4, the Commission has concluded that the draft regulation already calls for full certainty of origin.
So the Commission sees no reason to adopt that amendment and it is also against adopting Amendment No 6.
Yet I would point out, on behalf of the Commission, that it is possible even now to indicate the date of the minced meat production under the simplified, voluntary procedure.
Let me also point out again that Mr Fischler stated yesterday that after the discussions in Parliament at first reading, a large majority of amendments were adopted and have now been incorporated in the text.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0165/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) [10677/2/1999 - C5-0098/2000 - 1998/0303(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Garc√≠a-Orcoyen Tormo)
