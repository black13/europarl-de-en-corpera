Mr President, I have the following question to ask: we have just received the printed version of the texts adopted.
We have received the bulky paper version with the numerous rollÂ­call votes, but what is missing is the verbatim report of proceedings for yesterday' s topical and urgent debate.
Topical and urgent subjects of major importance are being postponed until Thursdays, certainly not without good reason, but urgent topics also need to be dealt with urgently as well.
We have taken the floor on many occasions.
I recall the subject of Tibet being discussed on the Dalai Lama' s 65th birthday yesterday.
The people are keen to hear that there was great unity here in the European Parliament, how this came about, and what the outcome of our debate was.
It has happened before in my experience that we have only had one opportunity to avail ourselves of the verbatim report of proceedings for the Thursday topical and urgent debate, and that was on the Wednesday of the following week.
Hence, the question: when will we receive the verbatim report of proceedings for these topical and urgent subjects of major importance?
