Mr President, I just wanted to say something about the Minutes, although it is not yet time for them to be approved.
However, it might be possible to make a correction to them already.
Yesterday, with Mr Karas' excellent report, I had intended to vote in favour of paragraph 5, a particularly good one.
I accidentally voted against it.
I would ask you to correct this.
