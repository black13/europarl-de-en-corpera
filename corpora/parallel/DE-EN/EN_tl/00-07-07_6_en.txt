Mr President, I should like to ask you to instruct the Security Service to investigate what has been going on.
When I came into my office this morning, the door was open, even though I know for sure that I closed it last night, and my computer was switched on, even though I am quite certain that I switched it off last night.
I think that what went on there last night must be investigated at any rate.
