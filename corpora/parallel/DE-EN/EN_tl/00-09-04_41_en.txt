Madam President, the rapporteur, Mr Valdivielso, has just informed our group that the amendments are not yet all available in translation.
I do not know when they will be available, but if it were to be before tomorrow then - in accordance with our agenda - the vote would have to be taken as early as tomorrow at noon!
This is simply impossible because we need to discuss this in our groups.
Hence our request: if the groups still have sufficient time for discussion then the vote could be taken at the end of the week.
But if this is not guaranteed then it will just have to be taken at the mini-session in Brussels.
In any case, we insist, or at least we ask - as we have, of course, already decided - that the debate take place now without delay.
After all, the Commissioner is here!
