Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Poettering spoke here as a group chairman and not as a German.
I am speaking here as a German and as the acting chairman of my group.
Commissioner Patten has already outlined the Commission's views on Mr Verheugen's comments.
For me, that would actually suffice as a Commission position.
My group has always believed that not only the Commission as a whole but also all of the individual Commissioners must justify themselves before this Parliament, and this regardless of their nationality and regardless of any affiliation to a political party.
That is why we would welcome Mr Verheugen's being given the opportunity this week to clarify his remarks here before the European Parliament and, if necessary, also to amend them.
