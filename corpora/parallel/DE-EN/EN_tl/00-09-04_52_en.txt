Madam President, we would of course welcome a statement from Mr Verheugen.
Since this is a very important issue, a statement from the Commission President would obviously be even better.
But we do not insist on this.
What we do insist on, however, is that the statement which Mr Verheugen eventually makes is unequivocally a declaration by the Commission as a whole, and that any misunderstandings are then cleared up.
This is not then a private, personal statement by Mr Verheugen, but a clarification by the whole Commission acting as a college.
