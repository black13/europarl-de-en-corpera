Madam President, before the vote I should like to make a point of order.
I refer to Rule 118 of the Rules of Procedure.
This is about all Members of the House having access to all the necessary documents.
With a view to the vote, which will probably take place on Thursday, I should like to confirm the substance of what Mr Lannoye said on this issue.
There are Parliament resolutions in which we have made our views on cloning very clear.
That was also true of therapeutic cloning!
People are acting now as though the proposals put forward by the British Government were something entirely new.
In actual fact we have already discussed this and Parliament has always been opposed to it.
The votes were always controversial.
Those who now want to prevent the debate and a resolution have always represented a liberal standpoint.
But a majority of Parliament has always adopted an uncompromising position.
It would not be very consistent if now - since the issue is topical - we were not to stand by our earlier statements.
