Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two things to say.
The first is that I should like to thank both rapporteurs for their reports, which were well worth reading.
Secondly, I should like to say directly to the Commission: stick to your guns, stick to your guns with the Council!
Because the real problem is that the Council, that the Member States, are forever wanting to have their say on a matter which the Treaty says is your responsibility.
Just imagine that the Americans had implemented their aid under the Marshall Plan after the war in such a way that for each sub-programme they had asked the Member States of the USA whether they, for example, ought to fund a reforestation project in the south-western part of Bavaria or not!
It would probably have taken until the end of the last century to disburse the Marshall Plan aid.
This is not what I want to happen to you.
Mr Patten, stick to your guns!
Parliament ought to support you on this.
The Council or the Member States have a right to be consulted, but they do not have a right to co-decision.
I suspect that this will also be the decisive issue for the Commission when history judges it one day.
You will be judged on enlargement towards the east, but also on whether you create your own room for manoeuvre in external policy.
Now we are not demanding a voice for the Commission alongside the United Kingdom or France on nuclear capabilities for example.
But where the budget is concerned, the European Union's own budget, you are the executive.
We should secure this position and defend it!
In Parliament you should have an ally here!
