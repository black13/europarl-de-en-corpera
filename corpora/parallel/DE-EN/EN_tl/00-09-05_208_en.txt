Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his recommendation for second reading.
He is very familiar with the situation in Turkey.
He is aware of the problems of this country and of the people who live there.
It is no secret that Turkey cannot be democratic in our sense of the word until such time as the economic and social problems there have been solved.
It is also widely appreciated that Turkey will not be able to get on top of these problems alone and without our aid.
The demands contained in the rapporteur' s amendments - he talks of the protection of minorities, rightly demands the abolition of the death penalty and calls for a solution to the Kurdish problem - are in no way conditions designed to stand in the way of aid.
Instead, they are valuable proposals for the necessary democratic reforms in Turkey.
At the very end of the day, Turkey will benefit from these reforms being put into practice.
To that extent, we support the rapporteur' s recommendation and thank him again for the work he has done.
