Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, digital technology is changing our lives, and this change is taking place whether we like it or not.
We have to make use of it and create the relevant statutory framework.
I should like to add to what the previous speakers have said by expanding briefly upon a few points.
The Lisbon Seminar on Digital Television, held under the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, unfortunately came up with little apart from an incomplete overview of the subject.
That is why I am calling for a Digital Europe initiative with clear plans for the harmonised introduction of digital television and the digitalisation of content.
Merely setting deadlines according to a motto to the effect that the whole of Europe is to go digital by 2010 is not enough.
Secondly, the industry should be given a fair chance to regulate itself along the lines of the code of conduct for added value telecommunications services in Austria.
Not everything needs to be over-regulated by the legislator.
Thirdly, audiovisual policy concerns infrastructure and content.
We know that, where the latter is concerned, we have fallen far behind the United States, despite quota rules.
Only those who provide exciting content for a large number of viewers are taken notice of.
We must therefore do everything to support European content suppliers and to make their work easier instead of more difficult.
Fourthly, the approach according to which content and infrastructure are closely regulated should be maintained.
In my own country, the blueprint for the media authority KOMMAUSTRIA presents an exemplary way of doing this in line with the eight draft EU directives we have on the information society.
We need to keep pace and ought not to lose any more time.
