Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a glance at German cable television, where some 30 channels are now already jostling for attention, is enough to show that multiplicity is not the same thing as diversity.
In competition with commercial suppliers, there is easily a danger of succumbing to demands for mass appeal and neglecting less lucrative areas of interest.
That is why it is so important for audiovisual strategy to be linked to protection of the pluralism and diversity of opinion which are now the crucial bases for democratic opinion-forming, as well as for public service media to be guaranteed an equal opportunity to develop in the media market of the future.
There must be non-discriminatory access to this future market for all citizens, and there must also be non-discriminatory access for suppliers of all types of content.
Specifically, this means market transparency and preventing developments whereby economic power turns into the concentration of media ownership and finally into the abuse of political power.
These key considerations define the most important premisses for the further development of statutory frameworks.
Mr Veltroni's report makes important proposals in this area.
However, not everything can be regulated by law.
I should therefore like to address a matter which has still not been mentioned in this House, namely the acquisition of media-related skills.
You have to get to know your way around what the multimedia world has to offer in order to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, select what is of value and hone your judgement.
The transfer of media-related skills must become a component of the Community' s audiovisual strategy.
To that extent, the Commission' s communication still does not go far enough.
