Mr President, I would like, on my own account and also on behalf of my colleagues, to protest in the strongest terms, and have it put on record, about the article that Madam President had published in today' s edition of the Strasbourg daily newspaper.
In it, she voices her belief that it would have come to riots in Austria had the 14 EU States not imposed sanctions against Austria.
I utterly repudiate this.
In making this comment, not only has the President done the Austrian people an injustice, she has also abused her office, and thereby caused this House, an EU institution, a great deal of harm.
