Mr President, I wholeheartedly agree with what you have said, and also welcome with open arms the fact that President Prodi himself is to make a statement.
All I would ask - and the group chairmen in attendance will support me in this - is that the group chairmen are also given the opportunity tomorrow to make a brief statement of their position.
This has not been scheduled yet, but I would ask if it could be attended to, so that we too are able to make our positions clear.
There is no need for it to be a long statement, but the group chairmen must be given this opportunity.
I would urge you to arrange this accordingly.
