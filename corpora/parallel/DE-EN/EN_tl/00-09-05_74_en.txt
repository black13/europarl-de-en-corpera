Mr President, the foreign policy of the European Union can only be successful if it satisfies three main criteria: clarity, credibility and transparency.
Mr Patten, we will continue to push for this, even though you believe that we should at last put an end to the game of ping pong.
As far as I am concerned, it has started and can only finish if a constructive solution is found.
Otherwise this will lead to further competition between the institutions.
I believe the speech you gave in Paris was significant in this respect.
It is true that there should at last be open discussion on how to pursue a truly coherent foreign policy.
The European Parliament will play an important part in this.
You said yourself that it will only be possible to achieve credibility - your second point - if the European Union employs all its capabilities, i.e. all three pillars, and particularly the first with its financial and economic means, in preventive conflict management, and if the EU promotes stability overseas by making proper use of its economic instruments and using its political means to achieve real cooperation.
After all, we know that we must take a considerably broader view of the issue of protection.
Protection of the environment, the individual and human rights cannot be secured through one pillar alone.
In the same way, preventive conflict management is not just about the deployment of a police force; it involves all three pillars.
As far as the last point, that of transparency, is concerned, my group has made it quite clear today that we do not accept, nor will we accept, that access to these documents should be restricted.
Transparency is Parliament' s watchword, and we will continue to demand it from the Council and the Commission alike.
We will revisit this theme at a later stage.
