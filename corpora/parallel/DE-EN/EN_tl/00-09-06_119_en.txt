- Despite the fact that it confines itself to refugees under the Geneva Convention, I intend to vote in favour of this report.
The Commission proposal will do nothing to advance the cause of the vast majority of homosexuals or refugees granted temporary or subsidiary protection.
However, particularly from a German perspective, it represents an improvement in the situation of those refugees who are in a position to facilitate the legal entry of others, under the 'family members' heading.
And that is not the only reason I will be voting in favour.
Despite the fact that we Germans now hoist the flag against the extreme right almost on a daily basis, it is the German Minister of the Interior, Mr Schily, of all people, who has spoken out against this immigration-friendly legislation.
He is afraid that millions of immigrants will come to Germany if the directive comes into force.
In saying these things, he is playing into the hands of those who aim to drive these 'millions' of people out of Germany - dead or alive - using violent methods.
As a result, not only will our commitment to fighting the extreme right become a mask of hypocrisy; it will be turned on its head.
