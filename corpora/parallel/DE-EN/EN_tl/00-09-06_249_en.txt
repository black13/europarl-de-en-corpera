Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his precise answer and substantial input in this matter.
In the meantime, I have been appointed rapporteur for the subject and I am sure that we will work closely together with a view to moving matters on.
But the question I have is this: is the Commission still planning to conduct a study into the feasibility of making this college a fixed institution?
Because as you know, the European Parliament has called for this to be a fixed institution and not a virtual academy.
Are you proposing to conduct a study on the feasibility aspect?
You can rely on receiving our full backing for this.
