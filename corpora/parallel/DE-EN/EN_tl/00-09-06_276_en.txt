Mr President, Mr Sacconi, that is easy enough to explain.
We cannot introduce protection of origin for a product, when to do so would be contrary to Community law provisions.
Therefore, it is absolutely essential for this amended Community regulation to come into force first, because this will rule out any conflict.
It will then no longer be a problem for us to grant the protection sought by the Italian Government, or the region concerned.
