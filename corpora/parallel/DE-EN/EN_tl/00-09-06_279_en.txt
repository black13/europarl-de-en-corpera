Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Mckenna' s question boils down to whether Coillte is entitled to receive co-financed grants from the agricultural fund, specifically the guarantee section, in order to offset loss of income in forestry developments, under Regulation 2080/92.
I would like to point out that there has been no judgement from the Court of Justice on this specific issue.
However, it is true that the Commission classifies this company called Coillte as a state enterprise, because it is owned by the Irish State.
It is therefore not entitled to loss of income grants.
According to Article 2, paragraph 2, letter b of the Regulation on Forestry, these grants are reserved for farmers and other natural or legal persons under private law.
The Commission will therefore refuse to co-finance grants paid out, backdated to 1 August 1996.
A total of some EUR 4.8 million was paid out in 1997 and 1998.
The Irish Government contested this financial rectification in so-called mediation negotiations.
The arbitration body is still working on this and has not resolved the issue conclusively as yet.
The Commission has taken the stance during these negotiations that, to date the Irish Government has failed to provide any evidence that Coillte should be classified as a private company.
The Commission is unable either to confirm the sum of GBP 6.5 million quoted by Mrs Mckenna, or that of 30.5 million, which obviously relates to future payments.
However, the Commission will adopt the same stance it has adopted to date with any future applications.
