Mr President, there is really nothing I can add to that.
What Mrs McKenna has just had to say describes and elucidates precisely the Commission' s position.
There can be no question of a State as an entity, and in this case, as the 100% owner of a company, being a drawer of income, and therefore it cannot suffer loss of income either.
It is therefore evident that this money must be paid back, and that this company must not receive any fresh funding.
In addition, I would point out that this mediation procedure is not equivalent to an arbitration procedure, instead it merely represents the opinion of an institution that was set up by the Community.
However, the findings are not binding on the Commission, as we have already mentioned on more than one occasion here in Parliament.
On the other hand, each party is, of course, at liberty to go to the European Court of Justice, but we have no authority to decide on the matter.
