Mr President, I feel this question is important because it gives me the opportunity to clarify certain matters.
This is because a connection has been made between the manner in which the southern States and their products are dealt with, and enlargement.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, you have my word that the proposed reforms in the sectors you mentioned in your answer have absolutely nothing to do with enlargement.
Indeed the proposed schedule for enlargement has been drawn up on the basis of the commitments that the Commission entered into, once the Council had enacted the necessary regulations.
The reforms result from the need to guarantee the efficacy of CAP instruments, taking into account the full extent of market development.
The Commission' s reform proposals will ultimately serve to implement the European agricultural model in these sectors.
It is about securing sustainability in the full sense.
We want to bring the economic, social and environmental goals in these sectors into line with each other.
Naturally, employment and social progress, particularly in the rural areas in the Mediterranean region, will play a very important part in this.
Since the common agricultural policy under Agenda 2000 is, as you know, based on two pillars, and the implementation of the new development plans for rural areas, especially in the Objective I regions has made a significant contribution to the achievement of these goals, I feel it is quite clear what conclusions are to be drawn from this.
.
The Financial Perspective, which the European Council agreed on last year in Berlin, strictly distinguishes between the commitments for the 15 Member States and the additional funding earmarked for the candidate countries.
Therefore, there is at present no possibility whatsoever of funds earmarked for the 15 EU States being appropriated as expenditure for future Member States, the candidate countries that is.
Therefore, as I see it, the concern voiced here is completely groundless.
