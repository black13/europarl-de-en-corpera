Mr President, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I assume that when you talk about support, you are referring primarily to the direct payments provided for in the market organisation, and which constitute a major theme in the enlargement debate.
You are right in principle.
All Member States will have to respect the same acquis communitaire in the long run.
Therefore, there can only be one common agricultural policy and not two different ones.
But you yourself know only too well - and this has been the case hitherto for any country acceding to the EU, be it Spain or Portugal, or any other State - that the accession treaty, which does in fact constitute a primary right, contains transitional arrangements, which of course allow for departure from the acquis in some cases.
That is, after all, the point of having transitional arrangements.
As such, it will not be possible to answer the question as to when the Member States-to-be will actually receive their full quota of direct payments - as provided for in the common market organisation - until the enlargement negotiations have been concluded.
After all, it is precisely this issue that the enlargement negotiations are focussing on.
