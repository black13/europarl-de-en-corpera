Mr President, Mrs Matikainen-Kallstr√∂m, I am sorry that there was no interpretation at the beginning.
To be brief: naturally I would be only too pleased to send you the analysis that was carried out at the time.
The social implications, and the effect on income were also assessed during this analysis.
I will gladly make the documents you have requested available to you.
