Mr President, preventive health care is a major priority for everyone here in this House.
We know that tobacco growers in the Member States have different priorities.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following question, although I have always been, and still am, a non-smoker: does the Commission not think that if tobacco cultivation were to be completely discontinued within the European Union with immediate effect - as called for by a fair number of people - people would just carry on smoking regardless because tobacco products would be imported into the EU?
