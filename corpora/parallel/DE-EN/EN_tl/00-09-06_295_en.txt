Mrs Schierhuber, when you look at the balance of trade in the tobacco sector, you notice that the vast majority of products - and especially tobacco - used in the manufacture of cigarettes, are already imported.
The only difference is that, we are trying, as it were, with the aid of the common market organisation, to produce some of the tobacco that people consume anyway, ourselves, so that we do not have to import everything.
In so doing, we are giving some families the opportunity to draw an income from this type of cultivation.
I am absolutely convinced that the health problem, which undoubtedly exists as a result of tobacco consumption, can only be brought under control if we alert consumers as to the effect smoking can have on their health.
There will be no decline in tobacco consumption until we have succeeded in driving this message home to consumers.
We are deluding ourselves if we think we can control the problem from the supply side.
In economic terms, the only way to achieve this is to alter patterns in demand.
