Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Water Framework Directive contains many positive initiatives in favour of comprehensive and integrated water protection.
Yet the objectives are timid, vague and extremely long term.
We cannot wait 30 years for the European Court of Justice to decide whether or not the environmental objectives are in fact legally binding.
The Member States have been called upon to improve the quality of our water quickly in order to achieve the objectives in 15 years' time.
Where groundwater protection is concerned, Parliament has unfortunately bowed to the interests of industrial agriculture and recognised its right to go on polluting the environment to the same degree.
It is now also the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that existing standards are not undermined, the yardstick by which the success of the Water Framework Directive will be measured.
Any more kow-towing to industrial agriculture would lead in the longer term to our most important drinking water resources being destroyed once and for all.
We are pleased, however, that the Greens have achieved a great breakthrough when it comes to emissions of dangerous substances, which now have to be identified on the list of priority substances.
In this area, we must make genuine efforts to meet the OSPAR objectives as well and to avoid what is an incalculably serious risk to health and the environment.
