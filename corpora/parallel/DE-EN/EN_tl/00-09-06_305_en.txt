Mr President, the forthcoming Water Framework Directive is based on the justified principle that citizens of the European Community are entitled to use drinking water on a daily basis.
This should be provided for by law.
A simple, uniform and coordinated Community law on the protection of water and groundwater is to be welcomed.
Important directives such as those on protecting the food we eat, on municipal sewage disposal, on plant protection and on nitrates are being revised and redefined on the basis both of ecological criteria and criteria of origin.
The tasks are therefore broadly defined.
As a farmer, I advocate the closer involvement of those who represent the interests of professional groups and serious consideration of their criticisms.
Farming, forestry, fisheries and, in particular, the horticultural industry should also be involved in the decision-making process so that the required combination of voluntary restraint and state regulation is achieved.
The calls for zero limit values can hardly be met by means of legislation alone.
Transposing the directive presents a genuine challenge for the Member States of the European Community.
I agree with the rapporteur: it is only through cooperation that success can be achieved.
