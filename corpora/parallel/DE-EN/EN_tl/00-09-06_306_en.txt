Mr President, Commissioner, it was a very turbulent night sitting in which Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed upon a common water policy for all Member States.
Parliament' s really quite significant victory consists in the fact that this directive is to be binding.
Let us remember, however, that until the very end a number of Member States vehemently resisted any requirement that they should manage their own water resources more carefully and in an environmentally more conscious way in future.
However, it was splendid to see the way in which the Members of the European Parliament transcended all party differences and quite clearly agreed that there should be no common position without a legal requirement.
A further important victory for MEPs involved the protection of groundwater.
Dangerous substances must completely have disappeared from groundwater within 20 years of the Directive' s publication.
Will we achieve this objective?
It now remains for whatever dangerous substances are meant here to be listed in an annex to the Directive, and it is already clear to me that there will certainly be further heated discussions on this matter.
I believe, however, that the great objective of protecting Europe' s groundwater for future generations is not in dispute.
The process of re-thinking has taken place: a considerable victory for the political process and a considerable victory on behalf of our children.
