Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission what is happening with the 1991 Directive on ecological water quality which has so far not officially been withdrawn by the European Commission.
One further request, both to Parliament' s President and to the Council and the Commission: the texts are still deficient in so far as the specialist terminology in the specific languages is not correct.
I would ask for this to be re-examined, for the terminology in each country is quite distinct.
It is a problem which the translators could not solve because the text is so specialised.
It would be a poor show if the legal texts did not contain the correct and necessary terminology.
I would therefore ask for this matter to be looked into again.
In the German version alone, I have found more than twenty mistakes.
I happily leave it to you to examine this matter.
