Mr President, I too have reason to thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz.
I also found that the Parliamentary delegation very much got its act together during the conciliation and has finished by submitting a very good proposal.
Two aspects are of particular importance for me.
First of all, we have succeeded in clarifying the fact that, from the end of next year, end-of-life vehicles will have to be properly disposed of throughout the European Union.
In other words, it will no longer be possible to dispose of cars illegally or to abandon them somewhere in the woods.
Nor will there be the impulse to export them in one way or another to Eastern Europe.
Instead, they will have to be properly disposed of on the spot by authorised companies.
For me, that is one of the great, fundamental successes of this directive.
The second important point for me is no longer the issue of costs and competition.
These are problems we argued a bit about and finally solved quite reasonably by means of a compromise which all sides find workable.
Instead, the second important point is the fact that, by means of this Directive, we have established that new cars must demonstrate in their type verification and test that they are easy to recycle.
In this Directive, we are calling upon the Commission to alter the directive on type licensing so that, in the future, new cars have to be built in such a way that they can easily be recycled.
That is the crucial thing.
In that way, we are moving away from the end-of-pipe technology whereby we always have to consider what to do with the remains of cars.
Instead, we need to bear in mind, right from the time that vehicles are built, that cars, like other products, have to be re-used and disposed of.
That is precisely the right way of going about matters, and I am therefore very pleased that we have got the directive up and running in this way.
