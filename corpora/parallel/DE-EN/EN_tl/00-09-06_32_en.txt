.- Mr President, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery 's report addresses the problems that the Commission mentions in its report on how matters stand with regard to the application of provisions on residence rights.
Yet, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery would like to see the scope of application of these residence rights extended to third-country nationals.
The Committee on Petitions was asked to submit an opinion because it is a special committee that is directly concerned with the problems facing the general public.
Unfortunately, there are still far too many infringements of the rights of EU citizens; I wholeheartedly agree on that score.
Firstly, Member States are wavering when it comes to implementing Community law provisions on residence rights.
In particular, subordinate authorities in the Member States are unfamiliar for the most part with the relevant provisions.
Secondly, the problems associated with the recognition of diplomas are hugely restrictive.
What use is the right of residence to me, if I do not have the right to exercise the profession I am trained in, in the host country?
Thirdly, a failure to adapt the provisions on freedom of movement, and the social security rules, to the changing labour market, is causing problems.
It is simply not acceptable that I could fail to be reimbursed for medical treatment abroad merely because I do not have the correct form.
Mr President, we have provisions governing EU citizens' right of residence in other Member States, but even now, they are not being fully applied.
We are constantly hearing of cases where EU citizens are unable to reside in another Member State.
Therefore, let us urge the EU Member States to implement the existing Community law provisions without delay, before we consider extending these rights to third-country nationals at any rate.
