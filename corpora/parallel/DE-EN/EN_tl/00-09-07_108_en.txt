Mr President, as other Members have already said, the Kursk accident demonstrates that even ten years after the end of the Cold War, military objectives are still considered more important than human life.
I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy for the families who have been bereaved of their fathers and sons.
We know that it is not impossible that more people will yet be affected by this accident.
Everyone is aware of the dangers posed by two nuclear reactors lying on the sea bed.
However, no one knows how great the danger and the insidious impact on people's health will be.
I therefore believe that we can only draw one conclusion from this accident: we have to finally admit that despite the end of the Cold War we - in both the East and the West - are still arming and rearming ourselves, and this is incredibly dangerous and will lead to people being killed.
So we must finally put an end to this.
There can only be one response to this accident, and that response is 'disarmament now' .
This disarmament will only work if it is applied equally by the East and the West.
That also means that it has to be pursued jointly, in cooperation.
It must not mean that people like Alexander Nikitin, who take part in this and thus help to fight the continuing dangers to humanity of the Cold War and of armament, are eliminated.
I call on the Commission to make it crystal clear to the Russian Government that we will not accept further legal judgments against Nikitin or tolerate his being put on trial again.
