Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was first and foremost concerned that the treaty provisions put into concrete terms by the Bosman judgment should also be observed in future European Union policy.
We are therefore grateful to the committee responsible that it has incorporated the requests to this effect into its report.
We also unreservedly support the Commission's position on this issue.
This is necessary because of competition law and freedom of movement for workers.
Mrs Reding has already made this point very well.
I therefore regret all the more that it has become evident over the last few days that many people in positions of authority in football and other sporting associations are unable to learn lessons and enter into a dialogue.
Judging by the statements made over the last few days, you cannot help feeling that the assumption that a lot of footballers' talents lie more in their legs than between their ears is quite justified.
So, when we now hear calls for Heads of Government to get involved and turn European law on its head, as it were, then I feel bound to say that this demonstrates that people clearly have no idea what the legal position is.
This has got nothing to do with Heads of State and Government at all.
It is the European Commission that is responsible for ensuring that the Treaties are respected.
And the Commission is exercising precisely that remit.
I would like to say, once again, that I unreservedly support the position being taken by the Commission on this issue.
