Mr President, many EU Member States have a very friendly relationship with the Czech Republic, and even one based on family ties.
But I believe that in a good family you can also say things that do not suit other members of the family.
Nuclear power stations in the European Union have the highest safety standards in the world, and a candidate country that wants to commission a new nuclear power station must, of course, comply with those standards.
It is right to say that evaluating safety standards at Temelín is a matter for the Czech nuclear regulatory authority.
But it is also true to say that during the accession partnership with the Czech Republic, the Commission has identified the implementation of Community legislation on environmental impact assessment as a priority, partly because of Temelín.
Nevertheless, although the Czech Republic signed the agreement on cross-border EIA, the Espoo Convention, in 1993, it has still not ratified it.
Now, all of a sudden, trial operation is to start at Temelín, with undue haste and in a few days' time, before Germany and Austria, which are neighbouring countries, have received the information requested and before the deeply concerned population of the neighbouring countries has had an opportunity to consider the position and make their objections known to the Czech authorities.
That is what the Espoo Convention stipulates, and it is, after all, valid EU legislation.
I call on the Czech Government, indeed I implore it, to take seriously the fears not only of people in neighbouring countries, but also within its own borders.
The reactors at Temelín are a Soviet design, VVER1000, and there is nothing Westinghouse can do about that.
Please just think about Chernobyl.
I appeal once again to the Czech Government to act voluntarily now in just the same way as they would have to act if they already belonged to the European Union and were a member of our great European family.
