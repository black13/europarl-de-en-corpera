Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you would think that we would all have learnt some lessons from the accident at the Chernobyl reactor.
In that case, the radiation was not confined to the Ukraine, nor was it simply a bilateral problem.
I know that there are both advocates and opponents of nuclear power in the European Union, and that there is no common line.
And, above all, there are no uniform safety standards for nuclear power stations.
There is an urgent need for action here if our credibility is to be maintained.
However, after the Chernobyl experience we have to ask if it really is possible to bring a nuclear power plant, Temelín, on line in the heart of Europe when it still has significant limitations in terms of safety.
The Czech Republic is trying to present us with a fait accompli in commissioning Temelín.
If you will forgive my saying so, this sort of behaviour falls far short of a spirit of partnership.
Edmund Stoiber was quite right when he said today that it is a matter of following the house rules.
A resolution was adopted in the Austrian Parliament this Tuesday by all the parties - all the parties, mark you - emphasising that approval could only be given to the completion of the accession negotiations if the Temelín plant is retrofitted.
I wish to make one thing quite clear: we support the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU.
But the conditions must be right.
I call on you to support our motion for a resolution, the content of which is identical to the four-party resolution adopted in the Austrian Parliament.
After all, it must be our objective for nuclear power stations to have the highest possible safety standards.
