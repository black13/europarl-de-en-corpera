Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this debate and the reports are both a step in the right direction.
Our 700 000 sports clubs are pillars of Europe's civil society.
The Council Presidency has said that sport is education for life.
Sport is a part of youth work, a part of education policy, a part of leisure activity, a part of health policy, a part of international understanding, a part of the information industry, and a part of economic affairs and of competition.
Let me stress that I am saying a part.
To reduce sport to an economic and competitive level is to deny its wider social significance.
It has to be said that, up to now, Community law has been applied to sport in a very indiscriminate way, because it primarily treats sport as an economic activity.
This means that insufficient account has been taken of the special hallmarks of sport and its 700 000 clubs, and of voluntary work done in areas like youth work and training for children and young people.
Unless we can work successfully with children and young people, and unless Europe has an effective system of sports clubs, we cannot make our aspirations for popular sport a reality.
Doris Pack has already referred several times to the consequent need to root sport in the EU Treaties and have it influence the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The importance of sport was also mentioned in the conclusions of the Feira Summit.
It is therefore both a logical and desirable consequence of all this that sport should be given a legal basis in the Treaty.
We do not want to interfere in the affairs of Member States.
Sport comes under the principle of subsidiarity.
We simply want the overall social importance of sport to be recognised by the Commission and in European law, perhaps giving it its own budget heading so that it does not just have to be promoted through pilot projects.
