Mr President, I think it is a great achievement in human rights terms that we have succeeded in giving a signal with this resolution - a signal that it is not acceptable for embryos to be deliberately created for research purposes.
And I think that this resolution makes it clear that human life must not become a kind of consumer item.
But I, too, am unhappy about the small majority in favour of this motion for a resolution.
I hope that this is just because of tactical games on the part of the Socialist Group.
I have to say that I think their behaviour here has been shameful.
There have been calls for a temporary committee without it being made clear that Tony Blair is delaying his decision until this committee comes to a conclusion.
This smacks of contradiction.
It is shameful, to say the least, to ditch all your principles out of loyalty to Blair.
I would like to stress once again that we have always said that this is about 'therapeutic cloning' .
We have the alternative of using human stem cells to achieve the same result.
But I also hope that the Commission will now have the courage to act on the demands we have made in this resolution, by refusing to grant research funding to establishments which use these means directly or indirectly.
