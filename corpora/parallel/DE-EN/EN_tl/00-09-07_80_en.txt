- I abstained in the vote on the PPE/Greens/EFA motion for a resolution on human cloning.
I think it is right to take a stand against the decision taken by the British Parliament.
It has been stressed that the European Parliament is standing by its decision to ban cloning, and consequently also to withhold all funding for clone research.
However, I regard paragraphs 6 and 8 in particular as very dangerous, because the medical claims being made for biotechnology are taken at face value here, although the results so far have at best been contradictory.
By calling for further research into gene therapy and other forms of genetic engineering, the European Parliament is treading on very thin ice, particularly as there is not a word about the risks or about unsuccessful experiments, nor are they subjected to any kind of political assessment, all of which would cast some doubt on the unreservedly positive claims being made.
This expression of the European Parliament' s views on the cloning of embryos may represent a success in the short term.
However, I fear that totally uncritical calls for more medical genetic engineering could in the long term completely undermine this success and even reverse the situation completely.
They could open the door wider for technology whose implications are completely unknown.
