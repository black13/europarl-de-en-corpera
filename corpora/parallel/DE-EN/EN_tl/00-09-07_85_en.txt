My group has just voted in favour of the Lucas report, because of the following considerations.
A massive warming of the earth's atmosphere in coming years because of emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases was recently forecast, once again by the World Wide Fund For Nature.
This calls for an immediate response in the form of a rational policy and an economic system that is not solely geared towards short-term profit.
With an estimated share of 15%, air transport is, of course, not the only cause of air pollution and by no means the most important.
However, bearing in mind the forecast doubling of air traffic by 2015 within the EU alone, it is positively essential for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to take joint measures to limit the environmentally harmful impact of air traffic.
These measures need to cover the whole range of harmful impacts, including emissions, noise, and poor air traffic management and town and country planning, and to take account of the economic interests of airlines in a balanced way.
We support setting rigid limit values for emissions and noise pollution and the EU initiative being called for at the forthcoming 33rd ICAO Assembly.
And should the outcome of the ICAO Assembly be unsatisfactory, we are therefore also calling for the EU to set its own limits.
Measures of this kind can and must encourage the air transport industry to develop new technological solutions, and more efficient, cleaner and quieter jet turbines.
