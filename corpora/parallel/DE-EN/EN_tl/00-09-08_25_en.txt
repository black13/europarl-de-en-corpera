Mr President, my reference to Communist dictatorships has clearly triggered feelings of great agitation in an MEP from the extreme left.
I should therefore like to say that today' s vote has been very important.
The people in his party, the PDS, are clearly determined not to learn anything new for the rest of their lives.
I am therefore very pleased that we have adopted this report by a large majority.
