Mr President, permit me to address two comments to the Commission.
Firstly, the Commissioner said: in view of the "high prices of basic agricultural products in the Union" .
Perhaps the Commission could get used to the following version: in view of the "low world market prices caused by dumping" , because otherwise we risk creating the impression that the agricultural pricing system within the EU is pitched too high.
No, it is too low on the world market because farmers cannot produce at this price.
Secondly, this is a report according to Article 37.
We reserve the right - I will discuss this with the other groups - to refer this back to committee, because what you have said, your assumptions that is, will of course put paid to the efforts made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
It is then highly likely that we will enter negotiations.
I am just saying this now to give you food for thought.
The honourable Members here will then be able to make their feelings known in the discussions.
I just wanted to give you advance notice.
Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do so.
