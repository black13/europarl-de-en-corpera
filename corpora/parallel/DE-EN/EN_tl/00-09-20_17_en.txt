Madam President, a fellow honourable Member has just drawn attention to an anti-Semitic incident.
The issue of racism was heavily debated in Germany over the summer, and I would now like to tell you about several extremely disturbing incidents that have taken place there since the last part-session, in order to raise awareness of what is going on.
Three cases in point: on 2 September, a fifty-year-old waiter of Chinese origin was beaten up and called a 'foreign pig' .
On 13 September, a homeless person was found dead.
Two skinheads have admitted to beating him up.
He had subsequently died from their kicks and punches.
Thirdly, on 4 September, right-wing extremists beat up a person whose parents are of Tunisian origin.
This happened in Kassel.
I would ask that since we mourn other deaths here, could we not do the same for those whom we never knew, and especially those who were murdered for political, specifically racist, reasons?
I would like to raise awareness about this issue in this House, particularly as we had a debate about it in Germany.
