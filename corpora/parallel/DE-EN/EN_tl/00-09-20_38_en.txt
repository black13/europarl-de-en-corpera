Mr President, current petrol and diesel prices strike at the very heart of transport companies and threaten their existence.
Such prices are unacceptable.
I believe we must temporarily reduce the various tax burdens to an economically and socially sustainable level.
Bear in mind that we are not the ones that set the tax rates.
As a European Union, we have set minimum rates of taxation for motor vehicle and mineral oil.
It is the Member States that have the room for manoeuvre.
They have pushed it to the limit, and now we are facing this crisis of high oil prices, they must drop these prices and coordinate them.
We cannot have a situation where, rightly or wrongly, one government caves in but another does not, and where companies in one country have distortions in competition to contend with that companies from another country do not.
They get the same prices in the same market but their costs are different.
This is an intolerable state of affairs for the transport sector.
Madam Vice-President, I would suggest that you go to Luxembourg and tell the Transport Ministers, firstly that we need concerted action, and secondly, that we need to see a reduction in costs for the transport sector.
Thirdly, we do not want the Transport Ministers to make empty promises that will be scotched by the Finance Ministers in two weeks' time.
The decisions reached by the 15 Member States this evening, or in the course of the next few days, must be upheld.
They must translate into action.
Some Ministers bemoan the fate of the transport sector, whilst others refuse to reduce or amend taxes.
Such two-faced behaviour is unsupportable!
(Applause from the right)
