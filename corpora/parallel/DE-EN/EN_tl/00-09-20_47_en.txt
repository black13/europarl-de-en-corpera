Mr President, rapporteur, I welcome any initiative that aims to improve data protection for the people of the European Union.
However, there are serious problems with the EUROPOL and Schengen Conventions, and as regards customs cooperation.
One of these is the inadequate level of protection for data collated and processed in the institutions.
As far as I am concerned, it goes without saying that the proposed secretariat must be independent of the institutions requiring monitoring, as is borne out by the fact that it has its own budget.
Yet still I cannot vote in favour of Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar' s report.
I ask myself this: why should bringing all those who have been responsible for data protection hitherto, together in one secretariat headed by one General Secretary, lead to improvements in data protection merely because it is certain to lead to savings in this sphere?
Bringing these officials together under one roof will not guarantee better data protection.
Taking an overall political view, I see Portugal' s initiative, together with the report, as being one more step along the way towards improving coordination between Schengen and EUROPOL.
When it comes to the problems associated with the aforesaid conventions, inadequate data protection is the least of our worries.
Both EUROPOL and Schengen will add hugely to the construction of fortress Europe.
Fundamental human rights such as the right to freedom of movement, the right to asylum, or in many cases, even the simple right to human dignity, will be compromised, and these institutions will support and control this.
Therefore, I cannot vote in favour of an initiative that may bring about a mild improvement, when it will also help legitimise these institutions as a result.
Since I am basically critical of EUROPOL, and Schengen in general, and I believe that having one General Secretary instead of three does not equal better data protection, I intend to abstain.
