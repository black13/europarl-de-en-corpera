Mr President, this draft regulation is one of the first regulations in the sphere of development policy to be adopted by means of the codecision procedure.
The European Parliament has done justice to the weightier responsibility it bears by virtue of its increased decision-making powers.
Many people felt that this regulation should be passed as quickly as possible, which has meant Parliament having to distance itself from many of its proposed amendments.
The path we chose was undoubtedly the right one.
We were able to make a few improvements to this draft regulation.
One of the most important improvements - the rapporteur has already mentioned it - is that the potential activities provided for by this regulation are to be adequately funded.
It was a great achievement on our part to secure an increase in the funding from EUR 54.4 million to EUR 93 million - i.e. it was practically doubled - even though we know that we would need a much larger amount to do justice to the importance of this issue in terms of our common future.
But that would lead to a general political discussion, which would of course be beyond the scope of this regulation.
Our proposed amendments enabled us to make a number of changes to Article 3, which is concerned with the nature of the measures to be carried out.
I am disappointed that Parliament' s proposed amendment was not adopted, because it advocated dispensing with bank guarantees or credit safeguards if need be, in order to make the range of applicants and the target group as large as possible.
Despite everything, I believe this represents a great achievement on Parliament' s part, and also on the part of the rapporteur.
