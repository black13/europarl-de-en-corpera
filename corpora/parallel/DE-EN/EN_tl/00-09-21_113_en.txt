- The amendments put forward by the honourable Members Ford, Ceyhun, Boumediene-Thiery, SÃ¶rensen, Schroedter and Lambert seek to perpetuate a notion which the Wise Men have unequivocally rejected.
A desire to link the issue of racism with the situation in Austria represents an attempt to defame the country of Austria.
Many of those who do more than propose amendments by way of voicing their criticism of the situation in Austria, come from countries in which hostels for asylum seekers have been set on fire, right-wing extremists are on the march and gaining in influence, problems to do with minorities and foreigners go unresolved, and a great deal more.
You will not find anything of this kind in Austria.
The report compiled by the Council of Wise Men has confirmed that standards in Austria are above the European average, even in the most sensitive of areas.
Yet you seek to lay all the blame at Austria' s door, and turn a blind eye to the Balkans in your own backyard.
Instead of apologising to the Austrians for the injustices they have suffered on account of sanctions, you just carry on fanning the flames of resentment.
If that is your idea of a united Europe, then that in itself is of great concern to me.
Incidentally, we intend to vote in favour of the resolution put forward by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with regard to the reference to the resolution of 16 March, but not only are we not prepared to vote in favour of the related resolution of 3 February this year, on the formation of the Austrian Government, we demand an apology from the European Parliament.
