This resolution is a fine declaration against racism.
On the same day, the majority of MEPs voted in favour of the amended version of the fingerprinting system Eurodac, which further criminalises immigrants seeking to move to the European Union.
There would have been a different outcome if the vote on Eurodac had been truly anti-racist.
Therefore, all we can expect from this anti-racist resolution is fine words, and no change in the policy of criminalisation pursued by a Big Brother state.
