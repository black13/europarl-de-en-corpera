Mr President, scarcely a day goes by without a news report of right-wing extremist acts in central Germany.
Citizens' initiatives, various religious denominations and other social groupings have been warning against right-wing extremism for years.
It is there in the East and in the West, even though the acts are perpetrated by a minority.
In the East, right-wing groups no longer regard themselves as a minority, but believe they hold centre stage in society, and they have cult status among young people.
Silence breeds consent right across the social divide, which means there are certain zones in EU cities where the right wing holds sway and not the state.
There may well be various reasons as to why this is so, e.g. people were brought up in a totalitarian state, many people in the East suffer from a lack of self-esteem, there is high unemployment, and young people feel they have no future prospects, but we must not dwell on these explanations and instead, take action at long last.
A Europe founded on the inviolability of human dignity and which guarantees freedom of movement, must take a zero tolerance line with right-wing violence.
So it is time to break our silence over the right-wing violence that has become an everyday occurrence in parts of the European Union, even if we stand accused of running down our own countries.
We need a tolerant government and the pro-active financial support of local groups and players, and of those who have the courage to stand up for their beliefs.
Europe must be seen to fly the flag on this issue.
It must provide these groups with outside support, so as to encourage them to continue to stand up for their own convictions against the right wing.
