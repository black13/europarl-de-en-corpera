Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a deplorable state of affairs at the European School I in Brussels.
Thousands of children and young people - most of whom are the offspring of our officials - have not had any lessons since the end of June.
They have, as yet, been unable to start the first term of the new school year.
It was originally scheduled for 7 September.
Several days previous to that, it was postponed until today, and now the parents have been informed once again that the term cannot begin because some major building work has yet to be completed.
The renovation work has been going on for years at this school, and the asbestos problems are a familiar tale too.
Yet no alternative arrangements were made for the children.
I urge the President of our Parliament, in conjunction with the Commission, to ensure that this disgraceful state of affairs is not resolved at the children' s expense.
I cannot believe what is going on!
School attendance is compulsory and yet the children are unable to fulfil this requirement.
