Mr President, 'They died because they looked different, thought differently and lived a different kind of life.'
So read the title of an article in a daily newspaper on right-wing extremist violence in Germany.
I do not intend to recount how many times Jewish cemeteries have suffered arson attacks and desecration, or describe to you the various racist attacks that have taken place.
Racism in Germany and in Europe constitutes one of the greatest challenges our society has to overcome.
Not only does racism put the minorities living amongst us at risk, it also jeopardises the values our societies were founded on after dreadful experiences.
The European Union is the product of this development.
We can only welcome the fact that the United Nations have seized the initiative and will hold a World Conference Against Racism next year.
We must make use of this opportunity and make a clear European contribution to this conference.
I very much regret that my colleagues from Germany are not present in the Chamber at the moment to join me in sending out the message that racism does not stand a chance, either in Germany or Europe.
