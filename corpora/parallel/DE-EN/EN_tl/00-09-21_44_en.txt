Mr President, unfortunately, a number of delegates here in this House are using this extremely important debate about racism to place themselves on an imaginary list of good and evil.
Whilst those of a left-wing persuasion define their position at a comfortable distance from Stalinism, Communism and left-wing extremism as if it were the most natural thing in the world, they are evidently incapable of recognising the difference between the right, right-wing extremism and fascism.
However, those who, as a matter of course, only ever lay responsibility for crimes against humanity at the door of their political opponents, are committing the fatal error of simply using those very crimes to absolve themselves of all blame.
No one in this House becomes an anti-fascist by denouncing their political opponents as fascists.
One cannot escape one' s own history and one' s own responsibility that easily.
Finally, a word to Mr Ford, who unleashed the customary tirade of hatred against Austria in his proposed amendment.
Perhaps next time he could get his political facts straight, because that is not how the European Council responded.
Austria still belongs to the European Council, and no one spoke to us on that occasion.
