Mr President, Mr Schulz called me a racist.
Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the opportunity to respond.
He described himself as a representative of a country notorious for its perpetrators of fascism.
I would never use such an expression, even though many members of my family were murdered during the Holocaust.
I would ask Mr Schulz, as a representative of the country notorious for its perpetrators of fascism - his own words - to cite just one, just one, racist comment that I have made in the course of my career in politics.
If he is unable to come up with one, then would he please apologise, not for criticising, but for vilifying my character.
