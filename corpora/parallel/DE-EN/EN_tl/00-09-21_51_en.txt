Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Leipzig, from East Germany that is.
I have seen often enough how right-wing extremists have harassed - or attempted to harass - foreigners, or even those who hold different beliefs.
But I have also seen the other side, and how courageous men and women have defended themselves.
It is wrong to picture East Germany as being predominantly right-wing extremist in its leanings.
The vast majority of people are open-minded and tolerant, and an ever-increasing number of them are prepared to nail their colours to the mast.
I believe it is also wrong to maintain that the young people are right-wing extremists.
The issue is more complex than that, for although, Mrs Schroedter, it may be precisely these young people that grab the headlines, they do live with their parents and exist within a social sphere.
In other words, if we want to solve this problem then we must do more to educate them politically and to communicate values to them, and more still to encourage them to stand up for their beliefs.
Over the past few weeks, the German Government has made an additional DM 70 million available for just such projects.
I feel that is a very important sign.
Likewise, for me personally, the fact that consideration is being given to banning the NPD (National Democratic Party of Germany) sends out a very important social signal.
We Germans will not submit to being terrorised by a minority.
It is our democracy that is being put to the test here.
Speaking as a European, I beseech you not to write East Germany off as a region.
I myself, together with many other people throughout Germany, condemn right-wing extremism and xenophobia, and we need the support of the rest of Europe in our fight against it.
