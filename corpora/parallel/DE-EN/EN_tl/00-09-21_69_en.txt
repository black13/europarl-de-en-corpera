Mr President, I would like to support the rapporteur' s motion.
We have given our utmost attention to this report in committee and feel that our proposed amendments substantially improve this regulation.
So far, the Commission has not seen fit to adopt these improvements.
I hope we will be able to reach an accommodation in the compromise negotiations, which we will then vote on in October, because no group wants a blockade.
We want this regulation but we want it with our improvements.
It is the old story: Article 37 provides the basis, we have no power of codecision and so we make sure that we influence the proceedings.
I hope the honourable Members will recognise this and give us their backing.
