- Data protection is a typical example of one area where it makes real sense to create central control points.
The existing juxtaposition of countless Community data protection regulations, which are called any number of different things to boot, is neither conducive to effective legal protection, nor does it make for a transparent legal situation.
The continued existence of national control points is beyond doubt.
Legal protection must be provided as close to the citizens as possible.
Not only will the amalgamation of Community control points have a positive effect in terms of transparency and legal clarity, it will also help keep costs down.
At long last, a constructive, truly expedient measure at Community level.
