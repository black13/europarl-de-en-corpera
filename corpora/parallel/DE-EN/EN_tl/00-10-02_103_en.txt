Mr President, since the trans-European networks came into existence, I have been championing waterways and shipping, so you will not be surprised if I now express a slightly different point of view.
Where competition is concerned, the market plays the key role in the development of seaports.
That much we are all agreed upon, and we should not interfere with that base.
I therefore request as a matter of urgency, even if Georg Jarzembowski is sitting next to me, that Parliament should reconsider its decision of March last year.
Parliament wants the criterion to be an annual freight traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes, but it is ridiculous to ignore the potential of ports with a volume of at least 1 million tonnes, especially if they meet the strategic requirements of the trans-European networks.
We should therefore have faith in market forces and give smaller ports a chance too.
We want to promote short sea shipping, but that means we also need smaller ports, which have a valuable role to play here.
They act as interconnection points, small ones perhaps but important interconnection points.
And are you telling me that you want to argue about half a million tonnes and exclude smaller ports?
What would a minimum traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes achieve?
According to the documents I have it would mean excluding 30 European ports, above all those in peripheral areas or coastal areas that are structurally weak.
That cannot be in our interest.
Investment in the trans-European network only makes sense if we create genuine networks covering wide areas and bringing advantages for the public throughout the European Union.
A forward-looking maritime strategy should not be exclusive, it should be inclusive.
I therefore ask the rapporteur and the others who have spoken to give this their learned support.
