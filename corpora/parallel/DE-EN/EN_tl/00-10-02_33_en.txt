Madam President, the racist incidents in Germany since the last part-session sadly mean that I have to raise this issue again.
A junior staff officer in the German Army has since then been dismissed because of racist comments, and three police officers in Cologne have been suspended from duty for swearing at a Tunisian taxi driver, knocking him to the ground and kicking him.
Two children were slightly injured in an arson attack on a hostel providing temporary accommodation in Wuppertal in which a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the building.
A racist motive is suspected and further inquiries are being made in that direction.
A number of people suspected of having committed this attack have already been arrested.
In DÃ¼sseldorf, a group of up to 20 people attacked and injured a black person who had spoken out against vulgar racist comments and was consequently beaten up.
In view of all this, I can only repeat that these incidents are directly connected with racist policies.
So there can no longer be any question of treating migrants or people whose appearance is different as criminals.
Quite the opposite - it is precisely racist incidents of this kind that must be regarded as criminal acts.
