Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already heard, this is a very good report.
It covers all the key points as regards promoting a risk capital culture in Europe.
This is particularly necessary given that efficient risk capital markets play a very important role in creating jobs on the one hand, and on the other, in increasing productivity, in financing rapidly growing companies and in creating new businesses.
The report indicates that 66% of all jobs in the Community are in SMEs and that 80% to 90% of funding secured through venture capital is used to hire staff.
We therefore need more capital for investment in job-creating, growth-intensive SMEs, and also for research and development and for business start-ups.
These are the key points.
Precisely because we are way behind the United States in this field, we are also calling on the Member States and the Commission to support more money - that is more risk capital - to provide start-up capital and capital for the early part of a company's life.We want to cut down on red-tape: the one-stop shop model should be the rule in all countries, and we should take advantage of the new media here.
We also want to see a tax system which at the same time promotes innovation and encourages private individuals to invest capital in businesses.
I therefore also welcome the agreement reached in Lisbon to introduce a benchmarking system so as to promote the best of the many ways of encouraging risk capital and to make further progress in this area.
