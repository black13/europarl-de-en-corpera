Mr President, the Skinner report is to be welcomed.
Who dares wins!
Unfortunately, there are far too many European companies to which this expression does not apply.
We may be good in terms of inventiveness, but we are bad when it comes to successfully putting our inventions into commercial practice.
All too often, rights of exploitation go to American or Asian companies before SMEs in Europe have the courage to exploit inventions themselves.
Young entrepreneurs in particular often have no idea how to obtain equity capital.
Our tax and administration systems create special problems.
These systems are far too complicated and are often incomprehensible, so that companies of this kind face frustrating obstacles.
We should therefore support all the calls for reform of tax systems and administrative structures.
The present undesirable state of affairs needs to be changed as soon as possible, and the Austrian Government has already taken the initiative in this respect.
Stamp duty on stock-exchange transactions has therefore been abolished with immediate effect and the tax allowance on employee share ownership has been doubled.
It would be good if these measures could also be adopted by other governments instead of waiting until the EU requests them to do so.
