Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk.
He has consistently re-presented what we jointly agreed upon at first reading.
He has translated it into a clear and easily understandable report.
The main theme of this report is that if we are looking at European ports as part of the trans-European network, then we need a policy which provides for ports relevant to Europe's needs to be incorporated into that network.
And they can only be relevant to Europe's needs if they are connected to other transport systems in the trans-European network.
Furthermore, the small amount of support that we give to trans-European networks must in that case, of course, also be directed to port infrastructure and not just towards port superstructure.
This report is quite clear on that point.
The corresponding amendments were also unanimously adopted in committee.
I would like to comment on two additional points.
If we do not concentrate on those ports that are really relevant to export and intra-Community trade, then we will face a situation in which all ports, including all yachting harbours, are classified as European ports.
In that case the greatest danger would be a scattergun approach, not concentrating resources.
This is also recognised in our regional policy, which Commissioner Barnier has referred to.
We must point the way, but we can only do that if we support key projects in a truly consistent way instead of adopting a scattergun approach and subsidising all and sundry.
My second point is about the competitive situation not only between ports, but also within a single port.
So if we were all allowed to provide state aid for buildings, van carriers and so on, there would be unacceptable competition between private and state companies operating at the same port, and also between different ports.
That is why we need a clear pan-European policy on ports which really does respect competition.
