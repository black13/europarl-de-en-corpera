Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the events in the Middle East are a real tragedy.
I am very grateful to you for raising this subject.
My group fully supports the substance of what you have said.
As to how we should deal with this serious matter here in this Chamber, I think it would be appropriate if the problems in the Middle East were to be raised tomorrow in the debate with the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission, either by individual Members or by political group chairmen or whoever speaks on behalf of the groups.
I do not think that we can change the whole agenda, as we have a great many topics to consider this week.
I also have last Thursday's events in Belgrade in mind, and would like to suggest that we should include the Middle East peace process in tomorrow's debate on the Biarritz Summit.
That seems to be a very appropriate way of dealing with this problem.
