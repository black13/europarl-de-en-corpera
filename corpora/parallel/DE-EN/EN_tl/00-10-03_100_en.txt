Mr President, I have just one brief clarification and question to put to the Commissioner, with whose presentation I personally agree.
We can only define the accession scenario if we ourselves undertake to be ready by the end of 2002.
According to the motion presented here, the EU institutions, the Member States and the candidate countries will all help to ensure that we are ready before the European elections in 2004.
That is what the motion says.
That is not defining a scenario, it is endeavouring to achieve it.
Perhaps this wording would allow us to reach a common position so that we can make the necessary effort.
