Mr Brok, I have no problem whatsoever with this motion because it states quite clearly what our common policy is.
We will be ready as of a certain date.
We hope that everyone else will also be ready by that date.
We shall help them to be ready by that date.
It is just that, as things stand, I cannot guarantee that they will be ready.
