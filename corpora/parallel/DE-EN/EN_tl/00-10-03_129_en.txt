Mr President, Commissioner, I only have two minutes and must dispense with references to honeymoons.
Nonetheless, I should like to thank the general rapporteur, Elmar Brok, who is also chairman of the committee, for the farsightedness and astonishing sensitivity with which he has conducted the debate, including and most importantly, in committee.
As a result, we can now take up a coherent position for the European Parliament which is supported by all political groups.
After such a comprehensive debate, I should just like to address and highlight two questions, which now have no or the wrong meaning in the public eye.
The first is the question of the reforms needed in the European Union itself.
As a result of the Intergovernmental Conference, the conditions needed in order for the European Union to be able to enlarge will be in place.
All too often we stand with raised finger pointing in the direction of the candidates and lecture them on their obligations, when what we should do is point in our own direction and understand once and for all that, when it comes to fulfilling obligations, our turn comes well before theirs.
The second point concerns the setting of dates.
I am resolutely in favour of setting one date, i.e. the date by which the European Union will have completed its reforms and will therefore be ready to receive new members.
To set a total of a further twelve dates would, in my view, be irresponsible, for the reasons which numerous speakers have cited here today, and would increase the candidates' frustration rather than motivating them.
