Mr President, we must have a clear timetable for enlargement post-Nice.
The group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling for negotiations with the first group of countries to be completed by the end of 2002, so that the first accessions can take place before the next European elections in 2004.
I must say, in all honesty, that I am rather astonished, Mr Verheugen.
Was it not your suggestion to set clear timetables with interim and target dates after Nice on the basis of the progress reports, in order to motivate rather than delay reforms?
We know ourselves from monetary union how important that was.
There is another reason.
Common environmental standards and social rules can only be implemented if these countries are full members.
We know that from Temelin.
As far as I am concerned, it is out of the question to have to use additional resources from category 8 from 2002 as part of the pre-accession strategy here.
Mr Verheugen, in my view it is pie in the sky to believe that the liberalisation of trade alone can modernise agricultural production and strengthen rural development.
In truth, it needs far more measures, which should be much more financially focussed and improved under the SAPARD regulation.
