Mr President, I take my hat off to the general rapporteur and his team.
I regard the report as a great achievement.
Not only will enlargement affect human beings, it will also have an impact on the plant and animal kingdom.
This all-round view demonstrates the enormous complexity of the issue of enlargement.
There are many individual aspects to be taken into account.
The Committee on Fisheries wants to have its say, but has no intention of putting a brake on things.
We have some quite specific proposals.
We are not going to start back at square one, but we do insist on upholding the Community patrimony, which is of course known as the acquis communautaire, as does the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
After all, although the Brok report contains ten points concerning the agricultural policy aspects of enlargement, the common European fisheries policy goes unmentioned.
Now that is a real Community policy, and an all-encompassing one to boot.
It encompasses all aspects of our daily life and directly affects the European labour market.
The consequences of failing to take the fisheries policy into account could prove disastrous and should not be dismissed merely by referring to solidarity amongst the nations.
Unfortunately, so far, the report has failed to take account of these aspects, apart from the fact that the unanimous opinion of the Committee on Fisheries reappears as the annex.
That is not enough.
We therefore call upon the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy section with the fisheries policy section, for example by changing the title 'Agricultural Aspects of Enlargement' to 'Agricultural and Fisheries Aspects of Enlargement' .
It should not prove difficult to make the necessary editorial changes.
After all, the Committee on Fisheries believes legal provisions and information obligations, for example, to be of fundamental importance too.
I would urge you to support the relevant amendments.
