Mr President, do excuse me for arriving late.
Unfortunately, I am still at a loss as to how to find my way out of the maze of garages by the shortest route.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a problem that is largely to be found in the Baltic States, in particular Latvia and Estonia.
It concerns the existence of a relatively large Russian-speaking ethnic group, supplemented by people from Ruthenia and the Ukraine.
The vast majority of these people are there as a result of a decade of occupation, which is why they keep themselves very much to themselves.
In the course of the last few years, it has been possible to bring about a distinct improvement in the situation, due in no small part to the influence of the European Institutions.
I would remind you that only a few years ago, the language law contributed to the negative assessment.
I would also ask you to cast your minds back to the great difficulties attending the nationality law, which had to be amended and tailored to European standards.
These legal hurdles have now been overcome, as a result of which, many Russian-speaking citizens are now prepared to recognise the citizens' rights and duties, both in Latvia and Estonia, which are the countries worst affected.
It is a process that is having very mixed success, but it still inspires great hope, because it will mean that these citizens will also become citizens of the Union in the future, and will therefore be called upon, in a special way, to establish ties with their homeland, where their forefathers come from.
I have a shrewd idea that these citizens will become agents of cross-border cooperation in a future enlarged European Union.
