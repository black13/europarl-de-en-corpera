Mr President, I intend to concentrate on the democratic aspects of Malta' s accession.
What happened in Denmark has demonstrated that, as matters stand, the EU' s grasp of democracy meets with criticism and rejection on the part of the citizens - and I would say these are citizens who take a special interest and are well informed.
Malta is only to be allowed four MEPs, if the proposals tabled by Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen are anything to go by.
If the Leinen proposal is adopted, then this will lead to discrimination against the small countries and against the new small parties in the smaller Member States.
This will reduce the political diversity of debate.
If Malta is only permitted four MEPs then this will further entrench the two-party system over there, which has been founded on confrontation for decades, and it will hinder political innovation.
Malta should be represented by a minimum of six MEPs, like the other smaller Member States.
Democracy is not just about majorities, more than anything it is about minorities being given commensurate codecision powers.
I hope that is the spirit in which Malta will accede to the European Union.
