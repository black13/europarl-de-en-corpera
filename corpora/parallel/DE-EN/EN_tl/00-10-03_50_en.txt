Mr President, this report was postponed by this Parliament because human rights are being violated in Chechnya and international standards are not being adhered to, and in the knowledge - related to this - that a war is being waged against this people.
Now this report has appeared on the agenda without there being a discussion on the human rights situation in Chechnya.
This is astonishing because in September in the UN the subject of Chechnya was on the agenda and was not satisfactorily concluded.
Last week in the Council of Europe there was a big discussion with the Russian delegation, the vote on the basis of a report by Lord Hewitt was not able to go ahead and the matter was postponed.
Why is the European Parliament suddenly putting this subject on the agenda and acting as though nothing were amiss in Chechnya?
I move that this report be postponed.
