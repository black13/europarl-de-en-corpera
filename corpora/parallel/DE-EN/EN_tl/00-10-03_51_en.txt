Mr President, the vote was actually postponed several months ago at my request.
However, it was only the vote that was postponed, not the whole report.
Neither was it referred back to committee.
We only wanted to vote later.
Why?
Because at that time the crisis was very acute.
Now, however, we are seeing that President Putin is pursuing a policy of openness towards the West.
We do not want researchers to suffer because of there being insufficient regard for human rights in Chechnya, and I would ask that we send out a signal here, a signal of openness towards Russia and openness towards cooperation.
Only if we bind Russia to the West and to the European Union will we also be able to bring an influence to bear on its policies and remain in contact and in discussion with Russia.
I would ask for the report to be adopted.
(Parliament decided not to refer the report back to committee)
