I voted against this report.
Not because I would object to scientific cooperation, but because of the explanatory statement.
Mr Putin owes his election victory to the bloody war of extermination against the Chechen people.
He is currently continuing this genocide and moreover he is also trying to completely eliminate the freedom of the media and the rule of law in Russia, which, as it is, barely exist.
