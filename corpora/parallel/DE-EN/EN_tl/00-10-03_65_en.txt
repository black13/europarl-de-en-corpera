Mr President, I believe - and this also emerged clearly from the way in which people voted - that this is primarily about the fact that having losses recognised for tax purposes is a fundamental prerequisite, especially for small companies, because they risk a great deal of private capital.
To risk personal capital, in particular, is a highly precarious business.
That is why a facility to carry forward losses and enter them in the accounts would have a significant impact.
