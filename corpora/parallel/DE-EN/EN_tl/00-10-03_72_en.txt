Mr President, I voted in favour of this Charter, not least because of the influence which our colleague, Ingo Friedrich, and Professor Herzog have exerted on its content.
I would thank both of them for their magnificent efforts.
Of course there are some things which I have to fault.
There is no reference to God in the preamble, no clear definition of marriage and the family, no rejection of all forms of human cloning and no rights on native countries or ethnic groups.
But it has to be said that this Charter is a step in the right direction.
The achievement of the colleagues whom I named just now and others has been outstanding here.
Hence our "yes" in the hope that this is only a first step and that improvements can be made in the next few years.
