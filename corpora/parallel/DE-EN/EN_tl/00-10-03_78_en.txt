The CSU's Europe group welcomes the tabling of the final draft of the Charter of Fundamental Rights because it summarises and makes visible the fundamental rights which the public are entitled to in respect of the institutions and bodies of the EU.
However, we can only agree to the Charter being incorporated into EU or Community law if the EU's powers are first clearly described and delimited.
The Charter aims to provide comprehensive protection of people's fundamental rights and different sections go completely or partly beyond the jurisdiction of the EU.
We reject the fundamental rights included in the Charter which are appropriate but which do not justify granting the EU corresponding powers or conferring on it a duty to protect or act.
The CSU's Europe group supports the horizontal provision which makes it clear that no new powers are being established for the Community or the Union.
In some parts of the Charter additional significant shortcomings are to be found, which ought to be remedied before the Charter is proclaimed:
路 The Charter should not be overloaded with detailed rules; these should remain the preserve of subordinate law.
路 In the section on social rights no clear line is drawn to show when the rights are defensive rights or rights to participation or protection.
路 The statement on the provision of social care is the responsibility of the Member States.
路 We wish to see the inclusion of a right to a homeland and to protection from expulsion.
