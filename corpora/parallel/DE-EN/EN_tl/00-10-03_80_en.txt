Contrary to the majority of the European Parliament, since Helsinki I have been of the opinion that the Intergovernmental Conference would have more than enough to do resolving the issues left over in Amsterdam.
Developments have shown that the various wishes expressed to extend the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference are still whistling in the wind.
There is no guarantee even that a solution will be able to be found to the three "left overs" plus the problem of closer cooperation.
That is why the hope that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have life breathed into it in Nice is a vain hope.
This is a state of affairs which we liberals deeply regret.
