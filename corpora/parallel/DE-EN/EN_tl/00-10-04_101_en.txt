Mr President, I am delighted that the House has adopted Mr Schr√∂der' s excellent report by a majority of more than 90% and that, for the second year in succession, we have made an issue of the Benes decrees, which infringe international law and human rights, as well as highlighting their inconsistency with Community law and practice and with the Copenhagen criteria.
The House has done this in a way which allows the Czech Republic to distance itself by its own efforts from these decrees that are incompatible with human rights.
I call on Prague to respond to this signal, this challenge, this plea for dialogue, to grant our request and to ensure, together with our House, that this legacy of a nationalist era can be consigned to the past.
