Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both rapporteurs have done an excellent job, for which I want to thank them here on behalf of my group.
The fact that so many different forms of discrimination exist in our societies confirms the importance of the Action Programme that is the subject of Mr Cashman' s report.
The Action Programme is a key instrument for supporting the Community in developing a common strategy to combat discrimination.
We cannot accept seeing women and men still not having equal rights at the dawn of the 21st century, seeing the disabled socially marginalised, or people being excluded from society because of their sexual orientation and branded as different.
The right of all human beings to equality before the law and protection against discrimination is a basic right.
That basic right is fundamental to the ability of any democratic society to function.
Legal provisions are an important component, but cannot be the only one, in the fight against discrimination.
The Community must supplement them with political and practical programmes that can actually be implemented.
So we must support grassroots initiatives, improve information about discrimination and underpin the political programmes.
Only then can we effectively combat discrimination in all the fields of human life.
That has to be in the interest of all of us!
In that spirit I call on my fellow delegates, especially those on the Conservative benches of this House, to endorse the two rapporteurs' reports at tomorrow' s vote.
