Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all glad that there is an Article 13 in the Treaty of Amsterdam because it finally puts an instrument in our hands and gives us the task of creating a comprehensive programme to combat discrimination.
The Commission has submitted an Action Plan until the year 2006.
It is very ambitious, highly committed and very concrete in terms of its objective, actions and individual measures.
It is a programme that deserves full support and I am convinced we will be successful if we pursue that programme.
I do, however, have problems with Mr Cashman' s report, which is peppered with 17 proposed amendments.
I want to raise several points in it that worry me.
First there is the proposed wider-ranging definition relating to the implementation of the programme, which goes beyond the comprehensive definition.
I think that would create greater uncertainty because we would no longer know who could actually be assisted in line with the Commission programme.
That produces the risk that the insufficient resources will then have to be spread too thinly over too many actions.
I fear for the effectiveness of this programme.
My second point is the problem that NGOs, important as they may be, are being asked to be involved in implementing the programme regardless of their size, nature and activities.
Over and above this, they are also being asked to be responsible for monitoring; and if the NGOs are core funded up to 90% by the Union, the problem is compounded if the NGOs monitor themselves.
I do not think we should ask too much of anybody.
What we ought to do at all events is to give full support to the Commission' s highly committed programme.
