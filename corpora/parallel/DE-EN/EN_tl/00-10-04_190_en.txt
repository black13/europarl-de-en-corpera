Mr President, I have a question.
In the Committee on Budgets, the European Parliament has earmarked 10% of resources for small and medium-sized undertakings.
So what is the picture in this new area, especially as regards cooperation between the research institutes, the major research institutes, between groups of undertakings, small businesses and individuals?
Does the programme go into that question specifically?
