Mr President, Commissioner, in your communication on the European research area you also referred to the poor mobility of researchers and to the problems within Europe.
Hence my question: do you intend to follow up this communication on the European research area with legislative initiatives, with a view, for instance, to improving mobility as well as social protection during periods spent abroad?
