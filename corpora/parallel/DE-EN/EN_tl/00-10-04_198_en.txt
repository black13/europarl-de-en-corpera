Mr President, Commissioner, I have three points to make.
First, I was glad to hear you say the management is to be improved.
Indeed, the management of the programmes is sometimes rather creaky.
What concrete steps do you have in mind here?
Secondly: research is constantly changing our society and the consequences of research change our society.
What is the position of socio-economic research in the European research area?
Thirdly, the ECSC Treaty will be expiring in 2002.
At that point considerable funds will be available for coal and steel research.
Will that research be incorporated in the sixth framework programme?
To what extent will there be coordination, and how much power of codecision would Parliament have on what happens here?
