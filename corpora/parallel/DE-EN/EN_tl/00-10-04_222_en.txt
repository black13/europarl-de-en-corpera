Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for that information.
Of course I would have liked you to be more like Santa Claus and tell me now how much extra money we will have to produce in future for the minorities and for promoting minority languages.
Naturally, I am aware of the legal framework.
I want to look at the issue as a whole and ask, in that context, whether in future we might not be able to draw on the Structural Funds.
A few weeks ago, the Braunm√ºller Verlag published a book by Dr. Christoph Pan entitled "Volksgruppen in Europa - Ein Handbuch" [Nations in Europe - a Handbook], which listed some 60 minority groups in the European Union, 300 in the continent of Europe.
Out of a total of 750 million inhabitants, 100 million belong to minority groups.
If the Central and Eastern European countries were members of the European Union, we would have another 50 or so minority groups on top of the existing 60 in the European Union of Fifteen.
Dismantling the internal borders is certainly a substantial step forward, but we must be able to prepare these minorities.
Would it be possible to fund that through the pre-accession programmes and the Structural Funds?
