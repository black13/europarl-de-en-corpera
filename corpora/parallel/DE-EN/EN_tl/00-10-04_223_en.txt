Mr President, I am sure my parliamentary colleagues know that the Structural Funds - and this is something new - earmark very substantial funds for cultural activities, for both I and Michel Barnier considered it important to ensure that the Structural Funds do not invest only in roads and airports but also in people.
But the fact is that applications to the Structural Funds have to come not from the Commission or the European Parliament, but from the governments.
So in the event that the governments want to use the Structural Funds for the development and promotion of minority languages, they can do so.
Of course, it is also most important for the national parliamentarians to urge their government to take action.
