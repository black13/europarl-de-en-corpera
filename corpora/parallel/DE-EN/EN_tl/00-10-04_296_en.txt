Mr President, our group also supports the rapporteur and thanks him for his good work.
I think the Committee on Budgetary Control held important discussions on this subject and the Commission would certainly be well-advised always to draw on that committee' s authority during the further reform process.
I believe that constructive cooperation really can make a contribution to improving the reform.
We believe it is urgently necessary to modernise the management.
We support the Commission' s steps in that direction.
But we also have some criticism regarding the question of final control.
We too believe there is a need to look again at the situation with regard to the independent final control.
All this has to be brought together again in the form of overall responsibility on the part of the Commission.
We also support those groups that are already thinking about extending the reforms to the small institutions.
I believe the administration has to be modernised at European level in all the institutions.
Parliament certainly still has something to learn too and there is room for improvement in its own procedures.
We hope that in general with this process we will manage to restore European public confidence in the European institutions.
In future, the administration must be able to react more quickly.
We expect great gains from that.
In the past we often found that excessively lengthy decision-making processes disappointed the applicants and led to a loss of confidence in the European institutions.
Modernisation can do much to allay that.
But the annual audit report process is also important; it must not be confined to the discharge but must be continuous, in the form of annual reports through which we pinpoint where progress can be made, so as to restore confidence at that level too.
