Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is our declared aim to make Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge society in the world, an economic area that is able to achieve sustained economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
So we must make every effort to close the existing gap between words on paper and the actual, practical difficulties the European citizen still encounters every day.
Here, the European dimension in the field of education and training plays an important role.
We must, therefore, ensure that the freedoms laid down in the Treaty such as the right of residence and free movement, do not remain empty words.
Transnational mobility is not just an occupational and economic requirement but calls for a forward-looking basic approach.
Precisely for that reason I am still very surprised to see how many obstacles remain to greater mobility and flexibility in Europe.
We therefore call for research workers to be included in the scope of the recommendations.
We call for measures to dismantle the existing obstacles and to ensure that persons undergoing training can enjoy social security and other benefits, to prevent the risk of double taxation, to promote the learning of at least two Community languages and to develop means of financial assistance.
Finally, we call for measures to create greater transparency in the recognition of qualifications, periods of study and training.
We call on the Commission to play a more active role in promoting the mutual recognition of training certificates, which advance mobility and flexibility, so that we really can achieve our declared aims.
