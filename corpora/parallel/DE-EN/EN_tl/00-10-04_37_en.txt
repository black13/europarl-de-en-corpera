Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it can still happen, or at least it cannot be ruled out, that contaminated primary products will find their way into animal feed again at some future juncture.
Whether this will be intentional, in other words a criminal act, or accidental is not the subject of today's debate.
If this does happen, however, it will be crucial to know which amounts of which contaminated primary product have entered the feed in question.
An indication of components, summarised according to category and listed by descending order of percentage weight, would not, in our view, suffice for this purpose.
It is therefore absolutely imperative that full details of all the primary products contained in compound feedingstuffs, together with the percentage volume of each, should be a statutory requirement.
The Socialist Group endorses the statements made by the rapporteur in his conclusions on the open declaration of feed ingredients.
This mandatory explicit declaration must be part of a comprehensive safety system governing the production of animal feed.
Livestock feed is, after all, the main input in the production of meat.
Defects in the safety and verification system increase the risk of further food scandals and ultimately lead to a loss of consumer confidence in meat as a food product.
And it is always the farmer who suffers in the end.
Farmers not only have to be able to rely on the information provided by the feedingstuffs industry; they must also be able to check, on the basis of the declaration, which volumes of which raw materials are contained in livestock feed.
We believe that complete transparency for farmers is essential.
Finally, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as well as to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for their contributions, and I hope that the Council will adopt a constructive position on this matter, so that we can jointly arrive at a transparent system of declarations for feedingstuffs.
