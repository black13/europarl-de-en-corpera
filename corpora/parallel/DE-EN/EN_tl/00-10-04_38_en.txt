Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking for my group, I assume that the report on the proposal for a directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs will obtain the consent of the European Parliament.
I also expect the Commission to stipulate the necessary measures along with a strict timetable in order to ensure that the directive is applied in the Member States of the Union.
The basis for the introduction of open declarations, in other words the full listing of all feed materials, differs extremely widely between Member States.
The standards are scarcely comparable, let alone transferable.
In the long production chain for compound feedingstuffs, there are sharply divergent degrees of interest in the traceability of feed materials.
The BSE scandal was the worst and most notorious example.
Farmers are still suffering today from that utterly criminal failure to protect consumers.
As we have seen, it took years to rectify matters.
Let me say categorically that the application of the numerous necessary rules and regulations on the control and monitoring of feedingstuffs must, in my opinion, proceed from the premise that transparency for the consumer is paramount.
When it produces its own report, the Commission can prove that transparency is not a modern word for bureaucratic procedures and that danger exists, since the legal provisions on food safety are supposed to cover the entire soil-plant-animal cycle.
The report does not make it immediately clear to everyone precisely whom or what this transparency is intended to benefit.
Let me finish by stressing that the report, like the labelling of beef, will come down on the side of the consumer more than on that of the production chain.
Given the surplus production in Europe, this is the safer bet and will pay dividends in the long run.
