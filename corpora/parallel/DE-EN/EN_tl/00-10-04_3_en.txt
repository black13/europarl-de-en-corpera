Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his policy statement yesterday, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, said that whoever weakened any institution of the European Union weakened the Union as a whole.
We have, of course, debated the relations between the Commission and the Council here.
I should like to refer to the relations between Parliament and the Council and to highlight the fact that there have recently been considerable delays in the Council's replies to our written questions.
Let me cite two examples.
In September 1999 I asked a question on the subject of Hombach.
It was answered in February 2000.
I submitted a written question on the subject of European flight safety in February 2000 and am still awaiting a reply.
Whoever weakens any institution weakens the entire Union.
I have the impression that the Council in particular has now decided to ignore questions from Parliament.
That is unacceptable!
If we are to preserve the balance between the institutions, I believe we must take steps to ensure that this defect is rectified.
