Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard this amendment of the Directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs as a step in the right direction on a long road.
Its aims are clear and undisputed.
The first aim is to create traceability of foodstuffs back to their origins, in other words maximum transparency.
The second is to restore consumer confidence in European food products after the BSE crisis and the dioxin scandal.
I believe that reversal of the burden of proof, as proposed in Amendment No 4, is absolutely essential if these aims are to be achieved.
The food industry has the necessary information to hand.
For those outside the industry, it is sometimes utterly impossible to obtain this information.
The present proposal is the first in a series of initiatives based on the White Paper on food safety.
It is a start.
The Union certainly cannot rest on these laurels.
A long road lies ahead of us.
