Mr President, I wish to oppose this oral amendment.
In the appropriate Delegation committee, we explicitly discussed all these questions and arrived at a common position after lengthy discussions.
I was in Hungary four weeks ago and saw for myself the immense efforts being undertaken by the Hungarian Government.
I am therefore opposed to our accepting an oral amendment.
