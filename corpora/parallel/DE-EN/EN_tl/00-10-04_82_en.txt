I have voted for the whole package on the enlargement of the EU eastwards for the following reasons:
1. because I regard this process as a political necessity, and
2. because I wanted to send the applicant countries a positive signal, since they have made considerable progress on the charted course towards accession.
Despite the problems which undoubtedly exist and which actually affect the present EU Member States more than the applicant countries, I believe that these are outweighed by the opportunities which this enlargement process offers.
As a member of the EU-Slovenian Joint Parliamentary Committee, may I say that I believe the progress made by Slovenia in incorporating the acquis communautaire is exemplary, a view that is corroborated by the report.
I beg to differ slightly from the rapporteur in my assessment of the outstanding restitution claims and of the state of the legal system, because I know from my experience as an East German that, ten years after the unification of the two German States, the same difficulties still exist in the federal state of Brandenburg too.
Objectively, this complex process can take up to 20 years to complete.
I cannot subscribe in any way to the amendments to this report that have been tabled here in Parliament, because
it has already been noted on several occasions that Slovenia is satisfying the Copenhagen criteria,
the question of decommissioning the nuclear power plant is not part of the acquis, and
while the legacy of the Second World War can certainly be regarded in diverse ways, we can hardly expect the results of that war to be brought into line with political positions that were articulated 50 years later in the Copenhagen criteria.
