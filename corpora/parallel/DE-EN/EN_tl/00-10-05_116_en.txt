Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group proposes to support the present motion, which we have also signed, because I believe it is right for the European Union to support the solution that has been found in Macedonia and which accommodates the Albanian population.
I would have preferred it if we could have found a solution that all the parties in Parliament could have voted for.
We would rather leave it to the Macedonians to discuss where the process broke down, Mrs Pack.
I have it on good authority that they were only trivial issues, and that the government could have accommodated the opposition in this respect.
I do not know.
I do not think that is the be-all and end-all.
What matters most is that a solution is found which we can all subscribe to.
Even though this notion is unpopular in this House - indeed the prevailing mood is the smaller the unit, the more divided the systems, and the more separatist the movements, the better - I would like to make the point here, which is one we have also discussed at some length in the delegation with our counterparts from Macedonia, that we must be clear about the fact that their own Albanian-language institutions should help to promote social cohesion in Macedonia and not create divisions.
That is an important aspect we should not lose sight of.
