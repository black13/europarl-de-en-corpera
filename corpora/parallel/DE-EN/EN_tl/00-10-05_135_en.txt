Mr President, as you just said, the debate with Mr. Solana is not due to start for another 25 minutes, despite the fact that there are a great many urgent questions which cannot now be dealt with.
We have finished early nearly every Thursday afternoon over recent weeks.
There is nothing on the agenda this evening after the vote on the Plumb report and tomorrow morning' s agenda is almost non-existent.
It seems to me that a curious discrepancy is starting to take shape.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, there were considerable delays.
Question time with the Commission started nearly one and a half hours late and yet Thursday' s agenda is disappearing before our very eyes.
The question which I wish to raise and which I would ask the Bureau to clarify is if, having done away with Fridays, certain parties are now trying to do away with Thursdays.
