Madam President, I hesitated before asking to speak again because I noticed that your press secretaries just handed you something and I thought perhaps you had received the latest news.
If you have not, I would be grateful if I might briefly read out the following release from the German press agency timed at 17.53 hours.
It says: several dozen members of the special police have joined with the demonstrators in Belgrade.
All the police deployed to guard the state television building stormed by the protestors, have laid down their combat weapons and have allied themselves with the demonstrators.
This was reported on Radio Index.
Apparently at least one police station in the city centre has joined the protestors.
That was the latest at 17.53 hours.
