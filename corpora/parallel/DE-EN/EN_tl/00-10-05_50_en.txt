We Independents welcome the action programme proposed by the Commission for fighting discrimination.
But we vehemently reject the proposal submitted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to set up another special unit for the implementation of this programme.
Discrimination cannot be tackled by creating additional administrative bodies; but solely by changing people' s attitudes.
Communicating traditional values such as tolerance and respect for diversity can do far more to help achieve this goal than the most detailed annual report on the various forms of discrimination.
