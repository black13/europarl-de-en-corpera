Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the conditions under which elections were held in Peru in May this year, were unacceptable.
Against this background, the Commission gave its support to the Organisation of American States, whose brief is to monitor a range of significant democratic reforms that the government and opposition had agreed on.
The European Union emphasised only very recently, in a declaration, that President Fujimori had seized the initiative with his decision to call fresh elections.
This initiative could prove to be an important step in the direction of democracy, but only if he refrains from employing the tactics that he has announced he is going to use in these elections.
If this opportunity is to be made use of, a whole range of serious shortcomings are going to have to be overcome.
These are shortcomings that became apparent during the previous elections.
If these weaknesses are not dealt with, there is a risk that the next elections will be extremely dubious too.
The Commission therefore supports the Organisation of American States in the continuation of its work as per the schedule agreed at the time, and this notwithstanding the difficult conditions and numerous imponderables that weigh heavily on these forthcoming new elections.
The Commission, in tandem with the Member States, is currently examining how we can best help, in practical terms, in the preparation of these plural and democratic elections, and, if need be, as observers of the process.
