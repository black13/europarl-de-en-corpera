Mr President, Afghanistan has the worst human rights record in the world, both in terms of the number and the severity of the violations committed.
The predicament of Afghan women is a particularly apt case in point.
Women cannot go to work, girls cannot go to school, women cannot walk freely down the street, and they are stoned, to name but a few examples.
There is not a single human rights organisation working in Afghanistan.
It is the country that has the most mines.
It is a country where there is no hope for the children.
75% of the boys and 90% of the girls do not go to school.
It is one of the poorest countries and there is a forgotten war going on.
I feel this all goes to show just how important this resolution is.
On balance, it is clear that the international organisations and the UN are not doing enough as matters stand.
In other words, the conflict is far more complex, there is no solution in the offing and yet, as we all agree, there is an urgent need for one.
The EU has an important task before it in this respect.
It could bring its ideas on non-military conflict management to bear.
There are a few examples I could mention: the monitoring of weapons exports and small arms through to the end-user, so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there, support for non-governmental organisations and women' s organisations based there, which are courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation.
In particular, in light of the above, it is absolutely imperative that the Member States grant asylum to all those who flee Afghanistan, as a matter of course.
It would do the EU' s image no harm at all if it were to get a political initiative off the ground in the United Nations, with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in Afghanistan.
