Mr President, I would just like to set the record straight for the benefit of the Commissioner.
I would not presume to speak on behalf of the whole of Parliament, and certainly not in advance of a vote on the matter.
I merely want to clarify that I spoke here on behalf of the second largest group, and expressed a real concern of ours, and if you heard Mr Caudron speak, then you would be aware that this is not something I alone am concerned about, because it is also something that bothers another MEP.
And so I only spoke on behalf of my Group, and not for Parliament as a whole.
