Mr President, rapporteur, I would like to congratulate you on your report.
There has been some turmoil lately, and I believe the genetically modified organisms will, of course, be inclined to dispute the purport of this directive.
But in all fairness, it has to be said that no one is forced to use genetically modified material.
It has had no place in viticulture so far.
I am fundamentally opposed to genetically modified organisms and am a wine lover, and I would very much like to stick with the wine we have been producing to date.
I therefore welcome the fact that we have placed additional emphasis on traditional, regional types of wine.
When it comes to genetically modified material, I take the view that the reference made in this report to directive 90/220 secures legal protection.
Any prospective changes, will, and must, be made to this end.
In addition, Mrs Klass, it is, however, important to stress the political dimension as well as the legal aspect, particularly where viticulture is concerned, and - providing we manage to do so - to keep viticulture free of genetically modified material if at all possible.
I hope that the wine growers will have no truck with GMOs, for their own sake, because we know that consumers strongly disapprove.
I hope this will inspire us to rule out the possibility of having genetically modified vines.
