Madam President, I have a genuine point of order.
We have no urgent procedures this week, yet, Chechnya, Albania, Burma and Palestine have already been discussed.
My question to you is this: can we not change the Rules of Procedure in such a way that we no longer have urgent procedures, but deal with these matters at the beginning of the sittings instead?
(Applause)
