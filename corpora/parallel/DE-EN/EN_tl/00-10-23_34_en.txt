Madam President, as we have already told the rapporteur and the House repeatedly, there is an important piece of legislation on the release of genetically manipulated or modified micro-organisms, namely the report by David Bowe, which we are currently dealing with in the conciliation procedure.
This is the fundamental piece of legislation and it forms the basis for any other piece of legislation governing genetically modified plants.
It is therefore only sensible, and indeed, right and proper, to wait until the end of the conciliation procedure, which will not be for another six weeks or so, and then take decisions on all the other pieces of legislation.
I therefore support Mr Lannoye' s amendment.
