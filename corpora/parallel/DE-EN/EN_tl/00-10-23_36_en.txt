Madam President, I am against postponing the report, and I question the way in which this House works.
The report was adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development by a good majority and with only two votes against.
We are now embarking on a discussion about the release directive 90/220, which is inappropriate.
We are referring here to the release directive, and according to the conciliation procedure, that is precisely what the speeches will focus on.
We are doing exactly the same as we have already done in the case of forest and plant material, i.e. we are making reference to the horizontal directive.
Not voting on the report will lead to delays.
It will obstruct the trade in vine material in Europe, and so I believe that in the interests of the single market for Europe' s vine propagators, we must vote on our report.
(Parliament rejected the request)
