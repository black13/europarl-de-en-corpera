Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to move that a particular item be included in tomorrow morning 's debate, namely a statement from the Commission about an interview that Commissioner Verheugen gave to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last Friday, 20 October.
Mr Verheugen gave the impression that, according to the current state of play, the European Union will have ten new members by 2005 and, what is more, and this is more disturbing still, he called into question the significance of majority decisions in the Council of Ministers, which is what we regard as the fundamental reform element to be dealt with at the Nice Summit.
He has already been criticised within his own political circles for saying this.
We would urge the Commission to clarify matters tomorrow in its statement.
Regrettably, this is now the second time that Commissioner Verheugen has said such contentious things.
He is obviously making a habit of putting his foot in it.
We urge the Commission to clarify its position.
