Mr President, the Commission draft on the socio-political agenda contains many positive concepts such as full employment, quality of work, social quality and modernisation of social protection.
But it lacks substance to some extent.
Mrs Van Lancker' s outstanding report makes good the deficiencies of the Commission draft as regards content.
We support a pact for employment and social cohesion, a European action plan for employment with a view to boosting the social economy and local employment initiatives, social regulations for new forms of working such as tele-working and new forms of self-employment, the minimum wage, and guaranteed income.
The European Union has already stood idly by for far too long, watching poverty and social exclusion take hold in the Member States.
Indeed Mrs Van Lancker' s proposals for improving the information available to, and participation of, female employees, and for social clauses in public contracts, mergers and international agreements, are long overdue.
We object to the fact that the Commission and the Council are unwilling to make additional resources available for the social agenda.
Social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis.
It sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection.
Extending people' s working lives is not modernisation, no more so is funding pensions by freezing or lowering the statutory pensions level, and advising people to take up investment opportunities on the financial markets.
We need modern, European social harmonisation, not deregulation.
