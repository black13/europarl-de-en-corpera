Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a Community of law, because European law is observed and upheld.
The European Court of Justice takes care of that.
In so doing, it has made a considerable contribution to the success of the whole integration project over the last forty years.
The European courts are currently facing major obstacles in their efforts to uphold European law, because they do not have the necessary funding available to them.
There are 1600 cases pending before the European Court of Justice, and the backlog in translation work runs to 120 000 pages.
As such, the European Court of Justice has become a sticking point for legal certainty.
In fact, back at first reading, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market argued strongly in favour of rectifying this deplorable state of affairs and helping to reinstate the citizens' right to see their European laws upheld, and to avoid the EU falling into disrepute as a Community of law, on account of delays.
I am extremely grateful to the Committee on Budgets and the competent rapporteur for endorsing this line of argument and supporting our proposals.
In particular, we will again recommend, at second reading, that 60 new posts be created at the European Court of Justice, and, in addition, that the necessary funding be made available in the budget.
We also propose that EUR 3 million be set aside, with immediate effect, in order to enlist the services of freelance translators.
In implementing these measures, we aim to get legal supervision back into full working order, restore people' s faith in the legal certainty of the EU, and strengthen the European Union as a Community of law.
