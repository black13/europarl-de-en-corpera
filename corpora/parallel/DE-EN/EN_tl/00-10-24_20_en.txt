Madam President, I still remember well the pitying smiles of those delegates who favoured an ambitious agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference, when I suggested to them back in February this year that we could count ourselves lucky if it proved possible to find a solution to the famous Amsterdam leftovers.
What stage are we at now, eight months on and with the Biarritz Summit behind us?
Apart from hoping to make progress in the matter of extending qualified majority voting, in truth we have not made a great deal of headway.
A new Treaty is just as distant a prospect today as it was eight months ago.
Indeed it is clear that the question of the leftovers is going to be a fairly hard nut to crack.
There is no prospect of any agreement to my mind.
However, if no solution is found to the key issues, then it will not be possible for work which is at a more advanced stage - for example with regard to the reform of the European Court of Justice - to be included in a new Treaty.
Similarly, the stock phrase used by the French, that it is better to have no treaty than a bad one, is unlikely to reinforce anyone' s faith in the attainability of an ambitious goal in Nice.
