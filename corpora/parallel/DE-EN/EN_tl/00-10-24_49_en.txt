Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Duhamel report has provided us, the European Parliament, with the opportunity, barely two months before the European Council in Nice, to reiterate our position on the further development of the European Union, and in so doing to take account of the need for the EU to become primed for action on the enlargement front over the next few years, as well as to demonstrate to our citizens the medium-term prospects of the European Union.
Commissioner Barnier, you made this point a moment ago, and rightly so.
The Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats will therefore use its large majority to vote in favour of Olivier Duhamel' s outstanding report, which focuses on the essential aspects.
During the first phase, we will need a constitutional treaty that will amalgamate the existing foundations of the Treaties of the European Union currently in force, in a clear and comprehensible manner.
At the same time, however, this constitutional treaty should be elaborated in such a way that it renders the common values of the European Union comprehensible, incorporates the fundamental rights of the European citizens laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and improves the composition, role, and modus operandi of the European Union' s bodies, looking beyond the Nice Summit, thereby improving their efficiency.
What this European constitution will also need to do is clearly establish the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union, inject the dynamism of European integration into those areas where it is badly needed, and provide for joint action to be taken, for example in the sphere of foreign and security policy.
It is also important, in this context, to respect and safeguard the lowest layer of democracy and local self-administration in the EU Member States.
We must not, as has already happened with a number of directives, end up with an interplay of European and national bureaucracies which restricts and overrides the citizen' s ability to shape policy at a local level.
We therefore propose that local self-administration should form an integral part of a future European constitution and would urge you to endorse this proposed amendment.
