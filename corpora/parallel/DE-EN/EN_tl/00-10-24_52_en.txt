Mr President, the fundamental rights of the people are not merely promises, but are the inalienable rights of each individual, bestowed neither by politicians nor the state, but respected, and derived from human dignity; and these rights are only effective when they are the law of the land, enshrined in laws by Parliament and upheld by courts.
This knowledge is intrinsic to modern democracy and is at the heart of the constitution of each Member State.
The European Council is violating this fundamental consensus within Europe, by refusing to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, make it legally binding and denying the citizens, whose rights are being infringed, access to the European Court of Justice.
Fundamental rights constitute an essential defence against the state.
It is therefore ironic that the Heads of State and Government should be the ones making the decisions about the fundamental rights of the citizens of Europe.
Is it any wonder that these heads of governments refuse to submit to the regime prescribed by the Charter, and make it legally binding?
The Council' s claim to power is the main stumbling block in the current constitutional process and it is the root cause of the Union' s democratic deficit.
Not only do the Heads of State and Government want to be the de facto and sole legislators of the Union; they also want to be its government.
Who can still doubt that they regard themselves as the sole providers of the Union' s constitution?
To a large extent excluding Parliament, the citizens and - where possible - excluding the Commission too.
It has always been the task of democracy to curb the power of princes.
The question we must ask ourselves today is whether we want a Europe ruled by princes or a European democracy.
If we want a European democracy then we must initiate a constitutional process and make the Charter of Fundamental Rights its cornerstone.
