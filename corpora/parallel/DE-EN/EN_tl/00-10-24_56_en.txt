Mr President, a whole host of names has already been found for the instrument of reinforced cooperation, presumably with a view to making it more comprehensible to the citizens.
It is not the name though, but the practical form it takes, that will decide whether it will serve the interests of the European Union.
The report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs argues that differentiation can only be deemed to serve any purpose if it is conceived as a process which allows for exceptions to the rule.
However, it seems to me that the report inclines in the opposite direction.
I have always rejected any form of differentiated integration for reasons pertaining to legal theory, but also for pragmatic reasons, believing that it would allow a majority of Member States to determine the direction of policy, and deny countries joining at a later stage any codecision rights in these matters.
I still clearly recall how, in the time before Amsterdam, in what was still the institutional committee, discussions on flexibility went on for weeks.
The arguments against and the warnings about a multi-speed Europe, are still ringing in my ears.
No one has been able to explain to me yet why things are any different now.
