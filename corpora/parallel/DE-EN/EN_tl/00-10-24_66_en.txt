Mr President, where is the journey into, and with, a united Europe to lead?
The debates we are having now will add something to this key issue, which is to be addressed in the decades to come.
Do we in fact need a constitution for Europe?
To what extent should certain important competences, which hitherto have been the preserve of individual Member States, now be the subject of Community policy?
The excellent reports by Mr Duhamel and Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado expertly point the way on both issues: improved intelligibility of the Treaties, a constitutional framework, fundamental rights, delimitation of competences, constitutional state, democracy and separation of powers; no superstate in Europe, a new method of developing the Treaties.
The Duhamel report contains important pointers on all these issues.
The same goes for the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado.
Reinforced cooperation, so as to escape the stranglehold exerted by national vetos.
At the same time, we must be sure to retain a European approach, even in areas of reinforced cooperation, and ensure that reinforced cooperation does not exclude countries, but brings them closer together in the long run.
Both reports leave some questions open, i.e. the answers given are only of a provisional nature.
Do we really want to hold direct referendums on key European issues?
We venture a tentative 'yes' .
However, this issue still needs to be discussed in greater depth Do we really want to let a third of the Member States press on ahead?
Do we not need at least half of them?
We would prefer it if as many Member States as possible could tread the common European path in unison.
Our task for the future is to make this a reality.
Reinforced cooperation between a few countries cannot be in the interests of Europe as a whole.
