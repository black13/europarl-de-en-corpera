Mr President, in the course of this discussion on the Kla√ü report, I have been unable to comprehend why some people have persistently confused the terms 'genotype' and 'genetic modification' .
This has actually hampered the discussion because 'genotype' is a prototype in wine, and wine growing is an extremely varied and dynamic sector characterised by long-established traditions and ancient cultures.
Vine material provides the basis for optimum grape and wine production in terms of quality, class and quantity.
Therefore we need these types of vine in order to preserve the variety of the wine, in terms of characteristic flavour, and to prevent cut-price enterprises from undermining this regional variety of vine propagating material and working against it.
