Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the request to refer back the Duhamel report, by way of protest.
I am of course a fierce opponent of the extreme right here in Parliament.
But I am deeply disturbed, Mr President, that it is possible here in this Chamber for a Member of the left - I have forgotten now who it was - to call elected Members of this House "polluters" of this Chamber, without you calling that Member to order.
We should not accept language like that, because it is exactly the kind of language used by the extreme right in power in my home country when I was not yet born or was just a small child.
We should not accept this, whoever uses such language, whether it comes from the extreme right or the extreme left.
