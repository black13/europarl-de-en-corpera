Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has carefully considered the White Paper on food safety.
It reached conclusions similar to those of the committee responsible.
We also agree with the Commission's acknowledgement that in the interest of the public, food safety should be given particularly high priority.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights accordingly made a raft of proposals which are also included in the Bowis report before us.
In view of the limited time available, I propose to cover just two key points.
First, there is no doubt that legal provisions in the field of food safety and animal feed safety need to be simplified.
We are therefore looking to the European Commission to put forward a basic legal framework.
Within this framework, the corresponding legal instruments need to be systematically put in place in such a way that health protection stands out as the most important objective.
Second, the European public are right to demand that their health be given top priority.
Furthermore, they are right to demand that they have an important say, through their Parliament, when food and animal feed safety with a view to protecting their health is at stake.
That is why the envisaged European Food Safety Agency can only have Articles 95 and 152 of the EC Treaty as its legal basis, with special attention being paid to its powers.
