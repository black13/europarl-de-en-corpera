Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful for your comments, and support everything you have said.
I would have said it in a similar way, except that I express myself differently.
I had the same experience when I was in Serbia a fortnight ago with Mr Swoboda.
Although we were not there before Mr Hombach, we did go there, because we have the funds to help people there.
Mr Hombach only went there to make his presence felt and to establish what it might be possible to do.
We know what can be done and we are in a position to make the funding available tomorrow, which I am very pleased about.
I am also sure that under your auspices, Commissioner, emergency aid really will be provided swiftly.
This is an opportunity for the Commission to demonstrate that it does not deserve its reputation.
I have two questions.
First, Mr Modrow alleged yesterday evening that everything we are doing there amounts to reparation for the NATO bombing.
I told him that was nonsense.
90% of the damage that we are making good there is the result of socialist and communist mismanagement.
I would be grateful if you would confirm this point.
Secondly, when we were down there two weeks ago, we were told that the sanctions were being lifted, but they have not been lifted.
Where do things stand on trade sanctions?
Have you resolved that issue?
Companies need to be able to do business now.
You can put Milosevic's entourage on a blacklist, but you should open things up for everyone else!
