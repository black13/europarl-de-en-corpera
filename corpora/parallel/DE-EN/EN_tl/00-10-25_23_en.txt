Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on food safety is a long overdue response to incidents like the BSE and dioxin crises, which deeply undermined consumers' sense of security and destroyed their confidence.
I particularly want to comment on two points.
First, the creation of a network amongst Europe's research institutions is absolutely essential if we are to achieve our objective.
But we need to avoid a situation in which the future European Food Safety Agency and, for example, the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin have overlapping responsibilities and powers.
Not only the Commission, but also every Member State must be legally able to call upon this agency.
This makes sense if the European Food Safety Agency is also to be able to operate independently of the Commission and if, whenever necessary, it is to take prompt crisis management action.
However, the conditions for appealing to the Agency must be drawn up so that efficient and swift action is guaranteed.
Second, a universal system for tracing the original ingredients of all food must be created.
This principle must be consistently adhered to when the planned review of EU legislation on food labelling is carried out.
That is the only way to regain consumers' confidence in food production, which has been destroyed.
