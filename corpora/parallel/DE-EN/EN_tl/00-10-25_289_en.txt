Madam President, I mentioned that I am going to Ireland - and I am also visiting Scotland, by the way - and I have left it to the governments and the various authorities there to put together my programme and also to decide which fishermen I should meet there.
So I cannot change that at the moment, but you are more than welcome to accompany me if you wish, Mr Nicholson.
