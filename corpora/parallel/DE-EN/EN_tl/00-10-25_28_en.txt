Mr President, the sheer number of food scandals and the debate about using genetic engineering in food production have undermined the present food safety system.
Optimum food safety standards and falling consumer protection standards cannot be reconciled.
So something else is needed here, and I believe that too.
But I am in favour of most responsibility remaining with the Member States.
The Community is the world's largest importer and exporter of food.
This sector has an annual turnover of EUR 600 billion and employs 10 million people.
I support everyone involved, be it in a political, administrative or other capacity, who is working on a "food for all" strategy.
The developed industrialised nations are also best placed to make the greatest contribution here, through sustainable and varied food production.
The White Paper is a political paper for those in positions of responsibility in food production.
A zero-risk policy is not really practical.
That is why the preventive measures in the White Paper constitute the real action plans.
What is more, there is no European flavour here.
National peculiarities should not only be respected, but actually encouraged.
This is where the only weak points in the White Paper on food safety lie.
Certain questions remain unanswered, such as: what will the relationship be between the Food Safety Agency and consumers?
How is it to be financed and how will it cooperate with the Member States?
What about liability?
Up to now, of course, it has been the innocent parties who have paid.
The Commission will have to provide more concrete answers to these questions in its continued work.
