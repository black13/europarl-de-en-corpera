Madam President, Commissioner, I have before me the documents we will be voting on this week.
I think that the most important report is the Clegg report, which has quite simply demonstrated that decisions can be made swiftly and unconventionally.
I think that this should serve as a model for us in the European legislative process, so that new developments can be responded to quickly, simply and unbureaucratically with the right decisions.
I would like to congratulate Mr Clegg on having managed to reconcile so many different interests.
And I would also like to thank the Commission for complying so efficiently and competently with the Council's request to use the accelerated procedure in this case.
I believe that we really are taking genuinely forward-looking steps as far as the European public is concerned.
The public in Europe will feel, in their wallets, in the quality of services and also on the labour market, that these measures have made Europe more internationally competitive.
We know that UMTS will provide us with a new service.
The environment and telecommunications will in future play a very special role in international competitiveness.
That is why I think it is important to create a level playing field.
This directive in particular demonstrates that we have been very thorough in aiming for fairness, and this has been a model of how to legislate, with a review, with a proper and thorough examination, with all stakeholders being consulted, and, lastly, a good, efficient, swift and precise procedure in the European Parliament.
Once again, I would like to express my very sincere thanks!
