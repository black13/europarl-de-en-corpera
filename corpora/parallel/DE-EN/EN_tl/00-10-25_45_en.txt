Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mr Bowis as rapporteur.
We have heard various fine phrases quoted about diet.
Let me offer one more: variety in moderation.
The selection found on overflowing shelves has long since made this a genuine option.
But the creation of a new authority or agency cannot change the eating habits of many members of the public, or the way we prepare and store food, or people's inadequate knowledge about preparing a balanced diet.
Making food safer does not remove the need for consumers to act responsibly.
Commissioner Byrne, it sounds to me as if we will have fewer and fewer producers but more and more inspectors.
I am worried that Europe is again in danger of creating an overblown bureaucracy that is incapable of taking action.
How exactly will the Agency's powers be divided with national inspection authorities?
I am concerned that this will be another millstone round our necks.
This new authority will not strike a blow for freedom in terms of consumer policy.
Who will be suing whom in future food scandals?
We are always discussing the division of powers in the context of enlargement of the European Union.
But this concept also plays a key role in food safety.
Strict application of the "polluter pays" principle will remain essential in repairing economic damage in future.
The consistency of the White Paper on food safety leaves something to be desired in places.
The timetable for achieving its objectives varies greatly according to the wishes of many stakeholders.
So we will not stand in the way of establishing this body any more with today's debate.
However, I do believe that we should not raise our hopes too high by imagining that this body will be a cure for all ills in future.
