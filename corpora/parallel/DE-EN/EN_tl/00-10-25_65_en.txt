Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I strongly support the Community's initiative against anti-personnel mines.
I only have to picture children mutilated by mines to reach the very personal conclusion that every euro spent on opposing this madness is money well spent.
One point that NGO representatives have criticised in conversation with me is the combination of military activity with NGO work found in points 11 and 15 of the resolution.
In the course of many years' work, the NGOs have won people's confidence and respect, and I fear that such a combination could compromise the independence of the NGOs and permanently damage their relationship of trust with people in need.
People have a justified mistrust of uniformed personnel, born of many years of war.
We should therefore do everything we can to provide continuing support for the work of NGOs.
