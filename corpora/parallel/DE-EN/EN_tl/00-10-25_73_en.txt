Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Mrs Bonino's report, which provides for greater efficiency and transparency, and on which the Committee on Development and Cooperation has given its opinion.
I would like to thank her for her outstanding work.
I witnessed the suffering of mine victims with my own eyes during and after the war in Bosnia, in 1992, 1995 and 1999.
Many victims are small children, who suffer terrible trauma and appalling mutilation, and whose lives are destroyed before they have even started properly.
Every child that we can protect from death or terrible injuries because of mines, be it in Bosnia, Africa or elsewhere, makes all our efforts worthwhile.
I would also like to sincerely thank the non-governmental organisations for their commitment.
I would briefly like to comment on one point, and this concerns our amendment to the motion for a resolution.
There is no worldwide consensus in favour of banning anti-vehicle mines.
They are still regarded as essential protection against armoured vehicles throughout the world and within NATO.
No one should seek to belittle the achievements of Ottawa by saying that anti-vehicle mines should have been included.
In that case the Convention would certainly have been doomed to failure from the outset.
With regard to the enlargement of the EU, the candidate countries absolutely must sign the Ottawa Convention.
The USA, Russia and China should be urged to sign the Convention.
Greece and Finland should ratify the Convention as soon as possible.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I would dearly like to see all mines banned throughout the world, as they are some of the most diabolical and repulsive arms that exist.
Unfortunately, however, we are not in that utopian world.
