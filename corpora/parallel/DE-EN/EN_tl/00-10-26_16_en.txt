Madam President, Mr Maat may wish to make the same comment as me.
You see, we spoke again this morning.
Amendment No 929, tabled by the Budget Committee, concerns two lines in heading 1b.
They relate to young farmers and environmental measures.
I should now like to propose an oral amendment to change these lines.
We give the young farmers an additional 10 million and take the 10 million to finance this from the environmental measures.
The effect on the overall budget is neutral, but we would accommodate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
