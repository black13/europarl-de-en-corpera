The liberalisation of telecoms is already very far advanced in the countries of the EU.
Now a further part of the network infrastructure is under discussion: the connection of market entrants and customers to the data transmission network.
This is the next logical step in the deregulation policy hitherto.
But, precisely because we are dealing with the local loop, customers' interests need to be taken into particular account.
Liberalisation of the local loop is actually, of course, about getting the high-speed Internet of the future off the ground (high transmission speeds and low local telephone charges are decisive for this).
This being the case, a "basic supply" must also be guaranteed in this sector to all members of the public by extending the companies' Universal Service Obligations.
For example, included in the Universal Service Obligation could be "normal Internet connection" by 2002 and a high-speed Internet connection by 2005, with minimum requirements for quality of service, consumer protection and content on offer and special tariffs for particular groups of society (the disabled, those receiving benefit or on a low income, those who live in outlying regions, and so on).
Since this is not guaranteed in this report, I voted against it.
