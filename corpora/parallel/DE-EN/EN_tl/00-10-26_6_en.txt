Madam President, I would point out though that we still have not received an answer to one question, namely whether the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is prepared to withdraw its amendments.
I would be very interested in this, because it is by far our most serious problem.
You see, if we accept one single amendment - you know this, fellow delegates know it, I have said it more than once - then we will, as it were, already be in breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement, because we will then have gone over the margin for payments.
Would you perhaps like to repeat the question to someone from the Committee on Agriculture?
