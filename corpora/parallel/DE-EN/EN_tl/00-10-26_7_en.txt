Madam President, I understand the rapporteur's objections, but the vote on the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will not only be about money but also about a particular political line.
The amendments go some way towards making it clear what the Agriculture Committee wants, and unfortunately we do not see ourselves in a position to withdraw them; instead, we will put them to the vote and we will see what the House makes of them.
We in the Agriculture Committee believe that the views which they express are sensible and we cannot therefore withdraw the amendments.
I hope that I am also speaking here on behalf of the other coordinators.
