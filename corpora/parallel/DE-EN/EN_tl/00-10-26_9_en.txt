Madam President, as we do every year and in every budgetary procedure, we will of course have to start by voting on a few additional technical adjustments.
Last-minute negotiations have been held with all the groups and, in my capacity as rapporteur, I should like to table a number of technical corrections on five points.
The first concerns line B3-300 on information measures.
Here the groups have agreed to place 50% against the budget line and to leave 50% in the reserve, and not to put the total amount in the reserve as previously decided.
The same applies to line B3-306 for the PRINCE information campaign.
There too we should now like to place 50% against the budget line and 50% in the reserve.
Where line B5-312 - for the Medicines Agency in London - is concerned, we should now like to pay an additional 1.3 million because we have noted that the Agency now has a heavier workload because of orphan drugs.
So, we have an additional 1.3 million for the Medicines Agency.
The fourth line concerns the performance reserve.
When we decided on the performance reserve in the Budgets Committee we made a technical correction, deleting two lines in this reserve which no longer contained any amounts at all, just p.m. entries.
These are lines B7-5211 and B7-547.
They concern cooperation with the Baltic region and the civil administration in the Balkans.
The final line in this compromise package for the groups is A-3027.
This relates to the International Centre for European Training.
Here it is intended to place the total amount against the line - so there are no longer any reserves - and at the same time, the appropriations are to be increased by EUR 300 000 to 1.8 million.
These are the technical changes.
They have been agreed with the groups, and I would ask you to make the necessary adjustments before the vote on the budget so that we can go into the vote with the package agreed.
