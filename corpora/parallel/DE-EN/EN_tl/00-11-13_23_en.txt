I simply wanted to say to Mr Baròn Crespo that he can always depend on the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to keep its word.
If the Chairman of the group makes a statement here, then he can assume that the statement will still hold true the next day.
That is why we will now set in motion the procedure with which Mr Baròn Crespo obviously agrees.
It would be nice if the House were at one on this issue.
(Parliament gave its assent)
b) Sittings of 29 and 30 November 2000:
No amendments were proposed.
