Unfortunately, Mr Moscovici was not here when I spoke.
I should like him to tell me if he supports the addition of another objective to the objectives listed in the CARDS programme, namely support for education and training in south-east Europe.
This is an important new objective in the CARDS programme.
The Commission is in favour and I should like very much to know if the Council is too.
