Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I think the EU would have far more influence in the Maghreb if there were stronger links with the reform process in Morocco.
I should like to ask about progress with the association agreement with Morocco.
As you know, we have already debated the fisheries agreement.
That is another problem which needs to be resolved.
But the question of the association agreement is, I think, extremely urgent.
