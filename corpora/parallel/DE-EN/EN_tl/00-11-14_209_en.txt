Mr President, institutional reform is on the agenda for Nice.
Do you think that the Austrian model, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions, will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council?
I have a supplementary question: how do you behave towards extreme left-wing parties and what is your opinion of them?
