Madam President, I have championed the Charter of Fundamental Rights from the outset.
And I have always advocated its being legally binding.
However, that does not change the fact that I am unable to join in the predominantly euphoric appraisal of the convention as an instrument of future constitutional development.
Apart from the substantive problems already raised today, merely having national parliamentarians on board is no substitute for an in-depth debate of constitutional questions by the national parliaments.
I would also advise the House not to misconstrue the instrument of the convention as a deus ex machina of the European Union.
Just one last word to the President-in-Office: as a former member of a supreme court, I can assure you that if the jurisdiction of various supreme courts overlaps, this will quickly give rise to diverging case law and diverging case law is only to be expected.
We must not, under any circumstances, lose sight of this problem.
