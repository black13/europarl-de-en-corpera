Mr President, changing a market organisation is always a difficult decision and the objective, when weighing the alternatives, is to achieve as accurate a market-regulating intervention in supply and demand as possible, so as to ensure that production, in this case the production of pigmeat, secures farmers' incomes.
For a long time this has not been the case.
The report has been resisted and rejected.
Some of the demands go beyond the report because there is much which is out of kilter in the beef and pigmeat sectors.
The latest cases of BSE will result in reduced production and will eclipse everything put in place hitherto.
The globalisation of the economy is a red herring here and cyclical crises have absolutely nothing to do with it.
Slaughter cattle are being driven right across Europe, animal stocks are being cut back in return for state subsidies and huge ecological installations are being built.
Nor does this report offer any ready solutions; too much else needs to be done for that.
But the report does try to bundle production by applying the principle of voluntary action and by forming producer groups.
This is an honest and credible endeavour and I shall recommend that my group vote in favour.
