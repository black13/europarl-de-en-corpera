Mr President, allow me to put a question to the Commissioner, because I am rather annoyed.
He said that the Commission had no intention of changing the common organisation of the market in pigmeat.
But the title reads "on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat".
Then what, pray, has the Commission presented to us?
If you want fewer radical changes than we do, then we can come to an agreement, but if you do not want any changes, then the text is a farce.
Perhaps you could explain.
If you present Parliament with a proposal, Parliament takes the liberty of introducing its proposals.
As is our right.
