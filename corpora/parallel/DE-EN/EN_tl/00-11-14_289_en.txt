I did not say that there would be no changes to the common organisation of the market in pigmeat as the result of the Commission's proposal.
Of course it represents a change to the common organisation of the market in pigmeat, of that there can be no question.
But from the opinions expressed during the debate, it appeared that what we were doing now was introducing a common organisation of the market in pigmeat and I took the liberty of pointing out that we already had one.
