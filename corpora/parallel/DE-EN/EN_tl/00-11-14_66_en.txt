Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report troubles me.
The problems are so serious as to preclude Turkey's accession in the foreseeable future.
I should like to table three reservations: Turkey has not even started to resolve the problem of the minorities living there.
Secondly, there is no end in sight to the dispute with Greece over the island of Cyprus, which still smoulders on.
And thirdly, Turkey's criminal justice system, based as it still is on the death penalty and police torture, is unworthy of a western democracy.
Horrific pictures of serious maltreatment of detainees by the police were recently broadcast on German television.
In other words, Turkey still has a long and difficult way to go and it obviously needs our help along the way.
We aim to help Turkey become a free democratic country in which the rule of law prevails.
The Council should consider whether granting Turkey candidate status has done more harm than good here.
It will have done more harm if Turkey's expectations of accession have been raised and cannot be met because of the political situation.
The Islamic forces will certainly know how to make political capital out of any such disappointment.
