The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is an important step towards defining the general, common values of the European Union.
Nonetheless, I decided to abstain for the following reasons:
1.
The Charter sets out important fundamental rights.
However, in its present form, it fails to do justice to the demand for social justice, as I understand it, in several important areas.
It does not include the right to work or the right to housing.
Similarly, the social responsibility of ownership has been left out.
It has already been assumed that the Charter might form the basis for a European constitution.
That makes including fundamental social rights even more important.
2.
The Charter is the outcome of the work of a broad-based convention which sat in public.
That is, without doubt, an improvement on how documents of such fundamental importance are usually drafted.
Nonetheless, it does not substantiate the EU's claim to be a union of peoples and their citizens.
If the Charter is to be an expression of the common values of the people of the European Union, those people must be given an opportunity to debate it.
It should not therefore be decided and proclaimed at the Council summit in Nice; on the contrary, the summit should prompt a European debate on the Charter.
That would give us a chance to restore a Europe of the people and of broad civil involvement.
3.
The Charter contains some lofty claims but imposes no concomitant obligation and cannot therefore be enforced by the citizens of Europe.
The citizens' Europe we are striving for must establish such recourse.
For these reasons I abstained from voting during the plenary session of the European Parliament.
