Mr President, in my view, Mrs Theorin's report goes a long way towards meeting the requirement that women should have equal social status.
She has chosen her words carefully in denouncing violations of women's dignity and in demanding action to achieve change.
The report not only refers to the social exclusion of women as a problem in itself, it also rightly emphasises that protection against criminality and personal safety are no longer something that can be guaranteed solely within national borders.
I therefore support the demands made in the report for women to be given the right to diplomatic influence.
I support the initiative taken in this report and I support the statement contained in it that sexually abused women need the Community's protection and that it is high time the perpetrators stopped going unpunished.
Women and men, and people in general, are all different.
Equal opportunities means treating people differently - but how they are treated is still determined by the people themselves.
