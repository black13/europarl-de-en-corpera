Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs González Álvarez has produced a very convincing report, but my group does not agree with the idea of product liability applying to services as envisaged by the Commission.
For example, in many sectors, products are no longer assembled by the manufacturer, with the component parts instead being delivered to dealers.
This means that everyone involved in the sales chain who can affect the safety characteristics of a product now bears liability as a manufacturer, so that all dealers who carry out assembly work are classified as manufacturers.
We believe that in such cases the trade should not be burdened with manufacturer's duties under product safety legislation.
There are certainly other ways of guaranteeing adequate protection for consumers under civil law, for example, compensation for damages as a consequence of contractual liability.
I must say that I was amazed that the Commission's experts have not solved this problem themselves and I trust that the new Commissioner will give this problem some more thought.
And I hope that there will not be any problems with the Commission as regards exempting charitable organisations and non-profit making bodies from the provisions of this product safety directive.
When it comes to exports, I quite agree that exports should be banned in cases where the Commission has stopped a product from being placed on the market or has ordered a product recall.
But a Commission requirement for safety checks cannot be sufficient grounds for bringing whole branches of the export business to a halt.
As various honourable Members have already said, at the very least proof that different safety rules apply in the importing country should be accepted.
I can only urge the Commission to think again about this problem area, please.
We are at first reading.
At second or third reading it is necessary to secure the famous 314 votes, and if the report is still in the same form as now that will certainly not happen.
