Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Before we continue with the agenda, I would like to make two comments.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo complained earlier about the lack of a Council representative.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, the Council never attends sittings in the evening.
Part of the problem is that when we arrange the agenda we postpone important subjects until the evening.
The Conference of Presidents is responsible for this, and if we wish to change this, then we need to make sure that debates on renewable energy sources or important women's issues are not scheduled for the evening, because, as I have said, the Council is never present at that time.
If I may make a personal comment, I believe that we would make rather more progress, regardless of what you may think about the contribution of the only man taking part in this debate, if more men participated in debates of this kind.
