Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of votes to take, so can I please ask for a little discipline and cooperation?
Before we proceed to the vote, I wish to inform you that Mr Claudio Martelli of the Technical Group of Independent Members has now joined the Mixed Group, that is he has switched from the Technical Group to the Mixed Group.
Mr Martelli, normally you can only speak at the end of voting time, but I shall, exceptionally, give you the floor for a few moments.
There will not, however, be any discussion of this, but you can make a short personal statement.
