Mr President, I would like to have an explanation of what you meant when you said "wir checken", as that word is not part of my German vocabulary.
Yesterday, Mrs Roth-Behrendt spoke about people who were "eingesqueezed" in a lift, that is "squeezed in".
As we are talking about our citizens' rights, I would like to know if we have ever adopted any amendments on the German language.
(Laughter, applause)
