Mr President, I voted for the report although it does not distinguish clearly enough between Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro.
President Kostunica was happy to have himself compared with General de Gaulle in a recent interview.
But General de Gaulle was only able to play a major role once he had settled the Algerian problem.
I believe that Serbia's "Algerian problem" is Kosovo.
Kosovo has the right to decide about its future independently and in partnership with its neighbours.
So we must give President Rugova and President Kostunica a chance to negotiate democratically with each other.
That is why we need early elections in Kosovo, cooperation in a spirit of partnership and an agreed solution for this region achieved in the same spirit.
