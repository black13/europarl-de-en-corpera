Mr President, the Armenians' genocide was the first of many genocides in the twentieth century, which might indeed be called the century of genocide.
Franz Werfel created a literary monument to this genocide in his work "The Forty Days of Musa Dagh".
Franz Werfel had Jewish and German-Bohemian relatives.
The Jewish relatives were victims of the Holocaust, and the German-Bohemian relatives, some of whom were Jewish themselves, were driven out of Bohemia after the Second World War.
This goes to show that one disaster can trigger off the next.
When Hitler was preparing the Holocaust, he asked "who talks about the Armenians now?"
That is why we must tell our Turkish friends that wrongdoing cannot be hushed up today either.
We do not want to rub salt into historical wounds, we want to work together to right wrongs, no matter whose name they were committed in.
