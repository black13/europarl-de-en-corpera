Mr President, may I briefly correct a mistake made by Mr Swoboda.
In fact, there certainly were negotiations, and we agreed a joint motion for a resolution.
Your group did not even bring up the three points you are addressing during the consultation procedure, otherwise we certainly would have found forms of wording on which we could perhaps have agreed.
We fully agreed the text.
Subsequently, you tabled amendments, which is entirely legitimate; it is just that we cannot accept the way they are worded because they seem to relativise the question.
I just wanted to point that out in order to clarify the procedure; the content of the resolution will be decided by the vote.
