Mr President, I have concerned myself very closely with this question and have taken part in many discussions both in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
This House unanimously believes that we need to work very quickly on the Commission's document, on the basis of the Rocard report, so that we can continue the political debate and take concrete measures.
Postponing the vote would mean postponing the task we entrust to the Commission.
Given what we all want to achieve, I think that is a bad idea and I therefore ask you to proceed to the vote now.
