Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad such a large majority has agreed with the arguments of this important report.
I can only congratulate Mrs Villiers on it, for as Mr von Wogau said, she has managed to cover the spectrum of banks and their clients in Europe in this good report.
We are in favour of matching the own capital held to cover credit risks more closely with the economic risk level and further developing the rules on own funds.
We are in favour of putting more emphasis on risk mitigation techniques; and we are also in favour of broadening the basic concept of the Basel Committee.
The Basel Committee's proposals only concern the large banks and external rating, while we believe it is necessary to broaden them to cover the small banks and to include internal rating.
Another positive note in this regard is that it was clearly accepted that internal bank collateral mitigates risks.
One reason that is so important is that purely external rating would have significantly increased the costs of loans for small and medium-sized businesses.
It is the small and medium-sized businesses that create most new jobs and protect existing ones.
The merit of this report is that it emphasises the links between loan costs, job creation, support for small and medium-sized businesses and the recognition of internal in addition to external ratings.
We will therefore vote for it with great conviction.
