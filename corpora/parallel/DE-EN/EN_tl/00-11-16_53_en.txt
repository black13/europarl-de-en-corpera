Mr President, let me make one thing clear.
The EPP Group did not itself ask but was asked to postpone this.
I personally said that I could agree to that.
But there are many other views in our group.
I could agree to postponement under one condition, namely if Mrs Theorin used the time up to November II to improve her report, for as it stands our group cannot endorse it.
I want to make one thing quite clear, and it is a point of principle.
If we do not manage to complete the voting by Thursday lunchtime, then the normal procedure is for us to continue voting on Thursday evening.
It is not in order for us to postpone the vote because some colleagues cannot be here in the evening.
So, to put it in a nutshell: on behalf of my group I would agree to postpone it to November II, if Mrs Theorin states that she will continue to work on her report and to improve it.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
