Mr President, on a point of order.
Michel Rocard is quite right.
What is happening here is that a very few people are trying to take the opportunity yet again to put forward their interests, which they did not manage to get through in committee.
They then see to it that we have to hold roll-call votes, which in fact are no longer really roll-call votes.
This is a deliberate attempt by a very few people to raise their profile at the expense of others.
So, first of all, we need a sensible system for roll-call votes.
Secondly, we cannot accept the fact that after what I regard as a classic mistaken decision by Parliament to abolish Friday sittings, the very same people who once said they no longer wanted Friday sittings are now protesting!
My question is: have there meanwhile been objections to Parliament's decision to scrap Friday?
Have there been any legal objections?
What will things look like next year?
In future we might even end up in the same situation as now, where we keep having to postpone reports to the Brussels part-session instead of dealing with them here in Strasbourg.
Can you give us any information on the matter?
