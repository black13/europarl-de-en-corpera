Mr President, with the Rothe report - at least with the interventionist aid system for renewable energy sources that it describes - we are about to make mistakes in energy policy, which will have a very serious impact on Europe in the long term.
That is why I rejected the report.
Energy policy must look to the future, be sustainable and respect market principles.
What the report seeks is precisely the opposite.
The policy of constantly subsidising wind, biomass and solar energy is mistaken and purely symbolic.
Billions are paid out in subsidies to the few who are ruining the countryside with their wind turbines.
We now have a plant with more than 60 rotors, taking up as much land as 1000 football pitches.
Left standing are the consumer and Europe itself, for this policy undermines all the advantages of our policy of liberalising the electricity markets.
