We all know that we cannot base the future of our energy supplies on the energy sources of the past.
The Commission realises that, even more so the rapporteur, by calling for greater priority than before to be attached to alternative energy sources and alternative energy production.
I therefore thank Mrs Rothe for her good report.
The first lesson we must learn from past experience with conventional energy sources - for instance, their impact on the climate and on nature, the incalculable safety risks and the foreseeable shortage of resources - is that we must considerably strengthen our support for the development and use of new energy sources.
In the long term, that means we must move away from the policy of subsidising conventional, fossil energy sources.
A first step here is consistently to break down all obstacles to the use of renewables.
Moreover, in future we must do more to make existing best practice more widely known to the public.
Secondly, the aim of any energy and economic policy must be to reduce and optimise energy consumption, for only the careful treatment of resources of whatever kind can help minimise the external costs.
In that regard, we call for more targeted research into the external costs of the production and use of renewable energy sources.
Lastly, we can only restructure energy supplies if we take account of the special conditions pertaining to alternative energy suppliers.
Decentralised electricity provision is not just a structural but also a social aspect.
Thirdly, therefore, we must not liberalise the energy sector without defining minimum social standards.
