Mr President, this is an issue of principle.
Nor did Mrs Villiers agree this with our group.
I nonetheless agree with Mrs Villiers that this is an important report.
But, important though it is, it can still be voted upon on a Friday morning.
There is now just one more Friday sitting to come, namely in December.
I was against doing away with the Friday sittings.
However, that is something people have to sort out for themselves.
As long as we are in fact here in Strasbourg on Fridays, though, it is a full working day.
(Applause)
I would ask the whole of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, as well as Mrs Villiers, to vote against postponement to the November II part-session.
That has not been agreed with my group.
Nor is it in order.
I would therefore ask that we vote here and now.
(Applause)
