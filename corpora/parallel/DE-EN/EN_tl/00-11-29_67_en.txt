Mr President, I should like to endorse Mr Van Orden's statement.
Yesterday, two people broke into the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee, interrupted the proceedings and threatened our guest, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, both verbally and physically.
It was a dangerous situation.
As far as I am aware, the two intruders obtained access to the House on the authority of a lady Member of Parliament.
I shall give the President the name of the Member in question and ask her to investigate the matter and to take appropriate measures with a view to preventing such disruptive and aggressive individuals from entering the House.
The shocking thing is that this incident took place with the aid of a Member of this House.
I find it absolutely scandalous that Members of Parliament can stoop to such methods.
I should like to put a second point to the Bureau.
In our present situation, we shall continue to have problems with the safety of our guests.
I believe that we must take action, which we certainly have not done to any extent hitherto, in order to ensure that the guests of Parliament can feel like guests in this House and that they need have no fear of being subjected to threatening behaviour.
To that end, we must put the requisite organisational and security structure in place, which also means our guests being directly protected by people who are trained for that purpose, because we naturally cannot employ foreign security staff to escort our guests.
I believe we face a new challenge here, to which I ask the Bureau to respond.
