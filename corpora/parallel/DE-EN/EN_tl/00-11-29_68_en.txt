Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to express our wholehearted support for the Chairman of the Committee.
It is not a matter of curbing the right to demonstrate - absolutely not - nor do we intend to make the House into a high-security wing; it is a matter of establishing an essential minimum level of security.
We shall not have any more foreign guests at our committee meetings if we cannot offer them the minimum security cover that will guarantee their safety.
We had both the President of a nation and the Foreign Minister of Turkey at our committee meeting when this incident occurred.
Please take this very seriously, so that we can continue to receive guests in future and so that we can treat them as guests ought to be treated.
