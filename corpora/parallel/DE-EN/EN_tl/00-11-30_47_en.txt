Madam President, that is not an oral amendment.
The first part is an oral amendment, but the second part is a motion for a split vote, which I cannot accept, because it has not been tabled in time.
I can accept and support the first part, but we shall then have to vote on the whole paragraph as it stands.
(Since more than 12 Members of Parliament stood up, the oral amendment was not retained) (Parliament adopted the resolution)
