Madam President, some of us were, of course, at the same meeting.
I was not present at the Conference of Presidents' meeting either.
Our colleague, Mr Friedrich, kindly represented us.
As we understand it, we need to decide here whether we want a resolution.
Our group believes that we should have a very short text now; not a definitive opinion, but a short political statement which does not conclude yes or no.
We should then, at a later stage, carry out a very detailed assessment, particularly since we do not even have the texts yet.
This would mean - in my group's view - a short text this week.
We should not allow the opportunity to issue a political opinion to pass us by.
That is our group's position.
