Madam President, this Parliament adopts resolutions on all kinds of topical and urgent problems throughout the world, and yet when something really is urgent, namely having an opinion on the Nice Summit, we hesitate.
You can make of that what you will.
Our electorate will not understand it.
Many resolutions have been adopted here in the past without colleagues even reading the texts.
Surely we will be in a position to hold parliamentary debates on texts which have been ready for months, whose content we are familiar with, whose consequences we know and whose historical importance we are fully aware of.
I believe that it is our duty to our electorate to have an opinion on this.
(Applause)
