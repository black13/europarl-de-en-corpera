Madam President, thank you very much for taking the trouble to do this.
Our information - and I wish to add straight away that I really cannot believe it - is that the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of France, will only be present tomorrow for 30 minutes in order to speak.
He may also hear Romano Prodi's intervention, I do not know, but he would not hear the remarks of the group Chairmen.
If that were the case then I would judge this procedure to be unacceptable, and it would meet with criticism from the vast majority of our group.
I am pleased that the other groups also agree.
I hope that this information is wrong, but I would ask you to convey to the French President that it is completely unacceptable for him to come here into Parliament simply to make a speech and then to take his leave and not listen to what this democratically elected European Parliament has to say.
(Applause)
