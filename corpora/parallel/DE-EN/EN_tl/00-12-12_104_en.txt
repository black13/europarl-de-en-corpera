Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not one of those clever members who can already weigh up everything decided in Nice in detail, because I have yet to see the texts.
But if we have learned and must learn anything from Nice, then it is that Europe is far too valuable to leave it solely in the hands of the Heads of State and Government.
The model of the Intergovernmental Conference has had its day.
That is the first and most important lesson to be learned from last week's negotiations.
On the positive side, we have managed to break through the power boundaries.
This is an old demand which we Bavarians have made time and again and for which we were ridiculed years ago; now it is the basis for Council resolutions.
I see this as a huge success.
But when I look at the wrangling which took place in Nice, it would perhaps have been more important to start discussing power boundaries straight away.
That might have made it easier to find reasonable compromises here.
In theory, the Amsterdam leftovers have been dealt with.
In practice, however, compromises have been found on the basis of the lowest common denominator.
Europe cannot be operated in the long term by working solely to the lowest common denominator.
I only hope that Parliament will learn the right lessons from all this.
This Parliament must become more self-confident, especially when dealing with the Council of Ministers, if we want to prevent bureaucracy and secret diplomacy from taking over Europe permanently.
