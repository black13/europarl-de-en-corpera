Mr President, this debate is already overdue because the BSE crisis has huge implications for feedingstuffs, both home-grown and imported.
We currently have a ban on animal and bone meal, which is why we need to find a clear position here.
It is because of the BSE crisis that we are pressed for time.
When, do you think, we shall be able to say that we can supply 100% non-genetically modified feedingstuffs in Europe?
Will this label be available shortly so that consumers can rely on there being a supply of 100% non-genetically modified feedingstuffs?
