Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too can answer yes to the question whether Croatia deserves a Stability and Association Agreement.
Croatia is increasingly becoming a factor of stability in the region.
It is making positive progress towards democracy.
However, let me emphasise that even though we welcome this progress, this does not mean we think Croatia has reached its goal.
It must now take the next steps towards legislative reform, especially in relation to minority rights, freedom of the press and an independent judiciary.
It is up to the Commission to take a very critical look at precisely these aspects now in preparation for the Stability and Association Agreement.
Let me also stress that Croatia is endeavouring to put its relations with neighbouring states in good order.
That means it really has made quite positive progress here.
It is particularly important to show Croatia that we regard it as quite crucial what role it takes on with regard to stabilisation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federation there.
Indeed, that is the precisely the yardstick by which we must measure Croatia's progress towards stabilisation.
I think it would be a disaster for the EU to tie economic support to an agreement on the return of the refugees in the Association and Stabilisation Agreement.
That issue must be based on other conditions, namely whether access to asylum in Croatia is compatible with international standards and whether it is a humane access to asylum.
I believe this question has to be treated separately and must not be part of the agreement.
