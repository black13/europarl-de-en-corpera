Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome the start of the negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which will at last open up the prospect that country deserves.
Unlike its neighbour Slovenia, immediately after independence in 1991 Croatia was not able to develop in a way as to allow it to become a candidate for accession at this point.
For at the time, in 1991, one third of the country was occupied.
At the time the Croats were driven out.
In 1991/92 more than 250 000 Croats were expelled from Kraijina, from western and eastern Slavonia.
They were not able to return to their homes until the, to my mind, justifiedÂ­ recapture of these areas.
There they found their property and possessions in ruins.
Unfortunately, during this recapture Serbs who had the right to live there were expelled in return, not just by the Croats but sadly also by their Serb ringleaders, who, of course, did the same in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Sarajevo.
Unfortunately, we also saw serious attacks carried out during this recapture.
But we should not confuse cause and effect.
We then punished Croatia for this recapture by denying it our friendship.
We refused to grant it any aid.
And because we refused to help, many things then started to go wrong in Croatia, with wrongful privatisation, corruption and so on.
The new government has now taken a European line in many policy areas.
It is seeking to cooperate with The Hague.
It has stopped supporting separatist movements in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is currently adopting difficult austerity measures in order to meet the preconditions.
So I believe Croatia has deserved this support.
It can become a factor of stability throughout the region.
