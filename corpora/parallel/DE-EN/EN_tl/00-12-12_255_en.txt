Mr President, when it comes to money, we all know it is no joke.
The same applies to the European Union.
That is why we and the other EU bodies agree that we must give priority to protecting the Community' s financial interests.
However, we are of different minds on the question of how and by what means we can guarantee this protection.
If we are to fight fraud efficiently, we must bring together all police, administrative and criminal law resources, for this is a matter of the European taxpayers' money and indeed of far more than that.
It is a matter of trusting in the care taken by the European institutions, and above all of trusting the way the Commission handles the monies entrusted to it.
Indeed we know this trust may be failing somewhat in view of the sum the Commission itself named in its 1999 report on fighting fraud, namely a loss of some EUR 850 million as a result of fraud and irregularities.
So the Commission must carry out internal reforms so as to finally make good its announcement that fraud will no longer be tolerated and that it will consistently follow up all cases of fraud.
OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, must operate alongside it.
The report before us rightly devotes most space to that institution.
The conclusion of the OLAF Supervisory Committee of 5 December makes it strikingly clear that OLAF is still far from being independent or functioning properly.
It says that the obstacles the Commission sets in the way of recruiting OLAF staff can under certain circumstances constitute an irreversible risk to the fight against fraud.
I expressly call on the Commission to refrain from any interference in OLAF's activities.
Finally, I am in favour of appointing a European Public Prosecutor, so that those responsible for fraud face criminal prosecution.
