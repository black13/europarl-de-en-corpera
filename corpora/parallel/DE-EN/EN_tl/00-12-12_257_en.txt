Mr President, I can be very brief because this is not the first discussion we have held on the issue.
In this context I would therefore also like to thank the rapporteur for her persistence in entering this item on the agenda again and again, for her persistence in repeatedly calling for a European financial Public Prosecutor.
I think precisely that should be the end result, of Nice too.
We must continue to work towards it with perseverance.
We can see that there are major deadlocks in the Council, that some Member States have made no progress since 1995, that there are still deadlocks.
However, we also see, and that is something I really welcome, that the current Commission has taken up this issue and endeavoured to draft a document for Nice, and that it is working on this issue together with Parliament.
I believe that is an opportunity for us in this situation, because Parliament and the Commission can achieve something jointly.
And the only way to break the Member States' resistance is by working jointly.
Above all, we must seek to create openness.
We held a hearing a short while ago.
I believe we should continue with this.
We also have to convince the members of the national parliaments, because that is the only way we can go on working and make progress.
We urgently need a step in this direction, in order to persuade our electors, and especially our taxpayers, that the fight against fraud really is taken seriously at European level too and that we shall seek to ensure that the same criteria apply at European as at national level.
