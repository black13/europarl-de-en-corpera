Mr President, this excellently crafted report shows that the Committee on Budgetary Control can take a coherent and convincing position on such a controversial issue as the importance of budgetary control procedures and bodies.
Budgetary control will always be a tough and thankless business, because it is not a question of handing out compliments but rather of pointing out weaknesses, mistakes and omissions and thereby improving the way the Commission handles the European taxpayers' money.
In colloquial terms, what this report is saying is that in future the Committee on Budgetary Control will be more watchful and will want to hear names named when it comes to the unknown whereabouts of European tax monies.
Neither the Commission nor the Member States will be able to absolve themselves of responsibility, certainly not by passing the buck from one to the other.
Point 21 of the report contains a very courageous decision in announcing that the discharge will be postponed if the Commission withholds information.
I hope this obligation will actually be applied if it comes to the crunch.
Had Parliament taken this decision sooner, it could not have given the 1998 discharge.
For in fact, the Commission is still withholding information and has still not answered questions, especially with regard to the Fl√©chard affair.
I also want to highlight point 20 of the report.
It is a clear declaration of belief in the rights of each and every Member to request and obtain information from the Commission, including confidential documents.
This declaration of belief in the rights of individual Members is particularly important because these are precisely the rights the Commission is calling in question.
It does make us rather apprehensive, Commissioner, to find that the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties has to be referred explicitly to the need to observe MEPs' rights.
