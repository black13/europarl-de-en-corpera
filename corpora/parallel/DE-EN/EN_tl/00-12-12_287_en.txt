Mr President, first I want to welcome the work Mr Lehne has done and the fact that he took up this whole job again.
It is a pity the report took so long.
Once again, time is running away with us in politics.
It is economics that sets the pace.
The reason this feels like a rather eerie debate has less to do with the time of night and even less with the sparsity of Members now present, but more with what is in fact going on.
We are talking about a Europe that is supposed to unite, and what do we hear?
British lobbyists against this Europe, against any hint of the social model that keeps being paraded in the electoral campaigns.
It would be really nice if British Labour obviously we cannot expect anything like that from the Conservatives any more would for once move outside the borders of the City of London.
Once upon a time it was said that 'Britain rules the waves', now we hear that 'Britain is drifting away'.
Why are we always taken hostage for this little City of London?
Why are we not honest enough to say that take-overs will become a major social problem if we do not cushion them?
Why do we not dare to stand by what we keep announcing in our campaign speeches?
In concrete terms we know that 70% of mergers go wrong.
BMW/Rover was a disaster.
Daimler/Chrysler is visibly becoming a crime, when we look at what is going on there.
Does Mr Lehne's report go far enough?
No, but I do believe it is a first step in a certain direction.
I personally and I wish that for once the same would apply to British Labour too will support the amendments that lead to more regulation.
We do not want to see American conditions here at home.
We do not need them.
The European economy is doing very well.
In the United Kingdom the social differences are widening ever further.
We need this for insider deals, for cartel law.
Does might come before right?
That is the question.
But the answer is that the Lehne report is at least a small step towards empowering the people of Europe.
