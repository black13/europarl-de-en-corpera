Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this dispute between all sorts of lobby groups I have always listened to what the European artists say.
In my country, which does not have the right of resale, the artists are opposed to this directive.
Understandably so, when you look at Austrian tradition in its home market, an internationally recognised market.
I will have a hard job persuading the people in my country, but I am firmly convinced that the harmonisation of the right of resale, on the basis of the EP's proposals, will bring benefits to all concerned.
I also hope for the Commission's support, at least on one of the three major points of dispute.
And I am also thinking a step ahead.
In the very near future we will have to make more effort to seek a dialogue with the collective management firms, we must jointly seek simpler and more transparent structures and ensure that the administrative costs of this directive do not become absurd.
Collective management firms are not just a kind of collection agency, they are very important partners for the artists of Europe when it comes to their rights.
The opinions expressed on the right of resale reflect the views not of the political groups but of the Member States.
I have understanding for the different cultural traditions, but at the same time I beg this House to show the same European spirit that prevailed this morning.
It is not just a question of individual national artists, national gallery owners and national auction houses.
It is a question of the European art market and all the players involved, and especially the European creative artists.
I put my trust in the wisdom and farsightedness of this House.
