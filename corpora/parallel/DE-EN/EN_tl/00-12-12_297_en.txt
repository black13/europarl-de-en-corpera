Mr President, Commissioner, although as I am sure you know I am a friend of European regulations when they are necessary, and against a European bazaar for national special interests, I have promised to put the concerns felt by the platform against the introduction of the right of resale and by the art world before this House, which represents the citizens of Europe.
The right of resale remains as controversial as ever.
In the end, the issue is the competitiveness of the European art market, which is already finding it hard to fight off foreign competition.
In my own country, the artists themselves say that they feel they are being forced into this against their will and point to Germany, where fewer than 1% of the 42 000 artists have gained from the right of resale.
The galleries, which play a crucial part in promoting young artists, are anxious and also oppose the right of resale, since it has to be applied even if a work of art is sold at a loss.
The auction houses are concerned because the maximum amount of EUR 12 500 is no longer to apply.
I think it is important to voice the concerns of the auction houses, the artists, the galleries, the art world of a country and a platform of artists in this debate and to take them into consideration.
That has nothing to do with special national interests but contributes to an open and transparent political debate.
