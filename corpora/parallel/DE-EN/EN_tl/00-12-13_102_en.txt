If the droit de suite is regarded as part of copyright and hence as an artist's prerogative, it makes no sense to grant artists a right which they do not want.
In Austria, which is one of the three countries where there is no droit de suite, artists tend to agree that the droit de suite would have distinctly adverse effects, especially on young artists.
Even many established artists, whom it would benefit, have voiced their opposition to its introduction for reasons of professional solidarity.
Besides, it is more than questionable whether there is any identifiable need for harmonisation in this sensitive area.
The introduction of the droit de suite, indeed, would lead to an erosion of the market in works of art with all its detrimental consequences; the small galleries, which have a special part to play in encouraging young artistic talent, would come under particular pressure.
For these reasons, the Members representing the Freedom Alliance have decided not to endorse the report.
