Because of the high incidence of fraud in connection with Community resources, we in the Freedom Alliance have supported tighter controls since time immemorial.
We therefore welcome the Theato report and have voted for the creation of the office of a European Public Prosecutor.
Our position, however, is that national prosecuting powers must not be affected by the creation of the post of European Public Prosecutor.
The creation of this new authority must not lead to any transfer of sovereignty in core areas.
Within these limits, the European Public Prosecutor, acting as a coordinating authority, can make a valuable contribution to the suppression of fraud.
