Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union are becoming ineffective and are yielding less and less revenue.
One reason for this is that the systems have become so complicated that even experts find them impossible to handle.
There are too many individual taxes, and these taxes are excessively complex.
Taxpayers feel they are being fleeced by the State; how are they supposed to understand their current tax liability when the system even baffles experts?
Burdens which the public do not understand are automatically perceived to be unfair.
Their logical response is to refuse to pay.
This refusal need not take the form of tax evasion.
Very often a taxpayer will avoid taxation by doing less work, but there have also been cases of economic activities being relocated abroad.
It surely cannot be our intention in adopting new taxes, so-called Euro-taxes, to accelerate this downward spiral in our countries.
We have to appreciate that the people of Europe will not strive for greater economic success until hard work and efficiency are properly rewarded again in Europe.
We are familiar with the vital statistics: with taxes and public charges accounting for more than 45% of earned income, many of our Member States have budget deficits, whereas the United States, where taxes and public charges account for less than 30% of earned income, is achieving budget surpluses of several hundred billion dollars.
We must aim to streamline and simplify our tax systems and to reduce the rate of taxation, not increase it.
The taxation of aircraft fuel must therefore be rejected.
The sixth VAT directive must be simplified; if any limit is to be imposed at all on VAT rates, it should be an upper limit and certainly not a prescribed minimum.
This means that zero-rating of VAT must be permissible for the provision of electronic services.
