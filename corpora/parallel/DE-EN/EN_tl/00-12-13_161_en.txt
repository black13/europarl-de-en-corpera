Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my honourable colleague Mr Goebbels referred to the Feira agreement, of which he takes a dim view.
Like him, I am unable to join in the euphoria and applause that greeted it in many quarters.
I should just like to address two points.
The first point is that we in Austria have had very gratifying experience of taxation at source in connection with capital-gains tax.
It creates legal certainty for every individual saver and citizen.
It seems to me, however, that a solution which will avoid a flight of capital from Europe is only achievable within the OECD framework and not through a collection of individually negotiated bilateral arrangements.
Secondly, I should like to deal briefly with the proposals on services provided by electronic means, which primarily relate, of course, to services downloaded from the Internet and to radio and television services.
I believe we must ensure that no competitive disadvantages are incurred within Europe.
Despite my fundamentally favourable response to the Commission proposal, I have to say that it seems premature and, in parts, underdeveloped, if one considers the many questions it leaves unanswered.
Moreover, I very much doubt whether the present text will be able to find general acceptance.
To my mind, it would be wiser to aim for a VAT regime in the OECD framework, even though in all probability it would only take the form of a code of conduct at that level.
One last point is that the EU should not legislate in haste and should make every effort to strengthen e-commerce and to avoid undermining it.
