Mr President, Madam Vice-President, may I congratulate you once again for having outlined the Erika II package in clear and comprehensible terms and especially the need for us to inspect vessels in transit - subject to the international law of the sea - rather than only checking vessels that dock in EU ports.
These other ships which are only passing through EU waters can cause equally bad and even far worse pollution of our shorelines.
So I believe this approach is absolutely correct.
As far as liability is concerned, we must take a very careful look at that.
The oil companies tell us they have a voluntary fund.
This raises the question of whether we need a public fund.
If you tell us that experience has shown the voluntary fund to be inadequate, which would be unfortunate, we shall then try to sort out this issue.
Madam Vice-President, how do you rate the prospects of the Council taking a decision on the Erika I package in December?
Parliament took its decision on 30 November; you presented a good document, and we decided quickly.
How do you see the chances of the Council managing to adopt Erika I now, in December?
