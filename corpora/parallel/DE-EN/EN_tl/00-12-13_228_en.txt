Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, this very night we shall be discussing the proposal for a Council Decision on European digital content.
One of our concerns in connection with this Decision is the need to determine how harmful content can best be kept off the Net in future.
Are there plans to establish hotlines that would enable European citizens to report discoveries of harmful Internet content to a central agency?
What about Internet groups, Internet police units and user groups which are formed with a view to uncovering harmful content on the Net?
Are there also plans for technical mechanisms to filter harmful content out of the Internet in future?
