Mr President, I only wanted to ask you to update us on efforts within the Commission to incorporate the European Patent Office gradually into the structure of the European Union.
Is this not one of your strategies for the future?
Would it not therefore make sense for the European Patent Court to be based in the same place as the European Patent Office?
I am grateful for your letter in response to the initiative I took with Mr WÃ¼rmeling.
In that letter, you said the Court must be centrally located.
I should like to point out that Munich is situated in the heart of Europe and is also very accessible.
