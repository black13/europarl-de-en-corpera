Mr President, I very much welcome this e-content programme and should like to refer to two aspects of it.
First of all, digital technology reminds us that it is high time we dug up a treasure that lies buried within all of us and made use of it in this digital age.
I refer to the cultural diversity of Europe, and we have the opportunity to safeguard it for future generations with the aid of new technology.
Digital content demonstrates that Europe is not only an economic community; it is also bound by common values, and it is our desire and our duty to use this programme to preserve our common treasure for future generations in a highly competitive world.
The programme therefore presents us with two opportunities: firstly it can help us to secure existing jobs and to create new ones, and secondly it offers us a unique opportunity to exploit to the full that cultural diversity which our language barriers have always prevented us from sharing and to ensure that it benefits everyone.
Let me turn now to a second aspect of the programme.
This programme relies to an unprecedented extent on public-private partnerships.
In the cultural sphere, it is particularly important that we devise new forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors.
That is why I am campaigning very vigorously for Parliament and its committees - the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - to undertake a thorough analysis of the potential effects of this new form of cooperation between public and private funding bodies on the preservation of cultural diversity in Europe.
May I conclude by thanking all those whose support has helped to ensure that the programme provides for the reallocation of funds in favour of linguistic and cultural measures.
