Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to express our wholehearted support for Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's motion.
We all want to ensure that the people in our Member States are not exposed to excessive noise, but we also want this whole question to be regulated by law.
To that end, I ask you to support the motion proposed by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
