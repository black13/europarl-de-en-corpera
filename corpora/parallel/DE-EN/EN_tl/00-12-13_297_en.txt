Mr President, I cannot but regret that the attempt to remove this report from the agenda this evening has been so thoroughly misunderstood.
We have no intention whatsoever of pulling a fast one on the House.
Listening to David Bowe, from a fairly significant parliamentary group, one is made particularly aware that it is not at all easy to rein in the airport operators to such a degree that the people who live close to our European airports, and for whom I have every sympathy, would actually notice any improvement.
I have certainly been astounded to hear one or two speakers say that we need daughter directives.
Now daughter directives are a fine thing - don't get me wrong.
The only thing is that we have been fighting for such directives for twenty years.
We need an instrument if we are to establish daughter directives.
That, in principle, was the idea behind Amendment No 36, although I believe the idea has not been fully developed yet.
That is why we needed breathing space to work on this idea so that it could be implemented.
One thing is crystal-clear, Mrs Scheele: you are still very young, but however many years you spend in Parliament, you will never get a daughter directive on aviation noise!
They will always find a way, be it to right, to left, down the middle or wherever, to wriggle out of it.
They have economic interests too, and of course I understand that.
So what we need are parameters.
We have to establish them here in Parliament.
That was the idea behind our desire to obtain ten more days or another fortnight.
At the end of the day, it is not so much a matter of the wishes we might have but rather of the wishes we manage to turn into policies.
Once a football match is over, only the goals count.
In that respect I am by no means overconfident.
I am still quite curious to see how the dice will fall tomorrow.
But to my great regret, Mr de Roo, I have to say that your good intention is probably dead in the water already.
