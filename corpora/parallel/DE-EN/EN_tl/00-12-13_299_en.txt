Mr President, the approach adopted for this directive reminds me of the Natura 2000 model, which is bound to result in massive restrictions on the use of large areas of land for economic purposes.
This is something we should bear in mind during our discussions.
The European railways alone estimate that they will need to spend EUR 20 million on the noise maps, which is the Commission's assessment of the entire cost of implementing the directive.
The railways alone expect to spend that amount.
I should also like to emphasise that small and medium-sized businesses cannot possibly afford the cost of producing these noise maps.
I believe we should do better to switch to incentives.
We ought to think about support initiatives which achieve the aim of restricting noise levels.
It is also important that we think about the countries applying for accession to the EU.
They too would like to be able to sleep peacefully but also to go about their work without disruption.
