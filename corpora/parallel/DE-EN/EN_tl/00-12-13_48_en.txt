Mr President, I wish to reject these indiscriminate attacks against the majority of this House.
We are trying hard to carry out modernisation and gradual liberalisation, and we do not deserve to be lectured here by you, Commissioner.
You should at least thank us for taking our decision today, because this will enable you to find out in December whether the Council adheres to the line taken by the Lisbon European Council and decides in favour of your version of liberalisation, or ours.
But to lecture us and then achieve nothing in the Council is a slightly hypocritical course of action, Commissioner.
You really ought to listen to the majority of this House.
