Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work.
I am entirely in agreement with his aims.
But unfortunately, Mr Dary, it is not in our power to insist on the fulfilment of our wishes.
Strong forces are lined up against us.
Not only do views differ between States within the European Union, which is reflected, as we all know, in the difficulties experienced by the Commission in its attempts to come up with a proposal on this matter; there is also the involvement of the World Trade Organisation.
Powerful interests are at play, especially those of the Americans, who, although they are not banana-growers themselves, have invested American capital in the trading corporations.
We are familiar with the issues, and our concern that the legitimate interests of the ACP countries, of the smaller banana-growers, will fall by the wayside is surely not unwarranted.
We have tried to table amendments again as compromise motions.
I hope that the Commission will now accept these amendments.
Our main motive in tabling Amendment 35 is to ensure that the Commission reports to us on the impact of the proposed regime on the interests of the smaller banana-growers and on the ACP countries, so that, if there is to be a transition to a 'tariff only' system, we in Parliament shall have a basis on which to make a decision.
One thing is certainly clear and has been confirmed by the Commission, namely that this will have to be dealt with again in Parliament.
To that end, we shall need precise data.
Perhaps by that time we shall have achieved codecision on matters of agricultural policy, because decisive moves were made at Nice in the direction of parliamentary codecision; we only have to ensure in the post-Nice discussions that these good intentions are put into practice.
We shall most probably be in a more powerful position then, and this should be reflected in the banana report and in the objectives we lay down.
