Mr President, the original version of this amendment is the German version; the Spanish version is inaccurate.
I merely wanted to point out, once again, that we are voting on the German version; the problem arises in the second part, where reference is made to the shareholders' meeting and the supervisory board.
The Spanish version says "or the administrative board".
That is a completely different body.
