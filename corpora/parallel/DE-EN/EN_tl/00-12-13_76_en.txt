Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I confirm the position adopted by the Commission on the amendments.
Our position is exactly as Mr Bolkestein presented it yesterday.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 4, 8, 10, 16, 17 and 18.
The Commission is prepared, on the other hand, to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
Amendments Nos 6 and 7 can be accepted in part.
Amendment No 9 can be accepted as a declaration but not as an article.
