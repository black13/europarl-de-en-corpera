Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to refer to the remarks made by the Commissioner at 0.15 this morning and to point out that Amendment No 1 imposes an obligation of the Commission.
I am pleased that Mr Fischler has accepted this amendment, in which the Commission is called upon to open international negotiations so that this droit de suite applies not only within the European Union but in as many countries of the world as possible.
In this context, the amendment refers to Article 14 of the Berne Convention.
In other words, Europe could play an exemplary role in this domain.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)

Before the vote:
