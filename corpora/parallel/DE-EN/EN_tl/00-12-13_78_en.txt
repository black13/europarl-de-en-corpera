Mr President, the first 33 amendments for the Oostlander report were available in good time.
Amendments Nos 34 and 35 were not available until today.
The same applies to two amendments relating to the Theato report and seven relating to the Morgan report.
May I ask you to put a stop to this and to ensure that in future all amendments are available in good time.
