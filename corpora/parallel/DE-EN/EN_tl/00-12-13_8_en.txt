Madam President, I believe we must discuss this matter today, because we are prepared for it and are waiting to discuss it, but I wish to refute Mr Savary's arguments regarding the amendments.
It is actually scandalous that these are not available in time for our debate.
It is certainly important, to my mind, that we know which honourable Members have tabled which amendments.
For that reason, conducting a debate without access to the amendments must remain an exceptional situation.
It is an extremely unusual procedure, and what Sir Robert Atkins says is essentially correct.
Unfortunately, however, we have now reached the point at which we can no longer defer this discussion.
I therefore ask, Madam President, that we begin the debate, but let me put on record that this practice of conducting a debate in ignorance of the tabled amendments is a highly abnormal practice.
