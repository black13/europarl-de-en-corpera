Mr President, any objective observer of the situation in Yugoslavia is compelled to conclude that the criminals continue to move about scot-free while their victims are locked up in prison.
For all our delight at the changes in Belgrade, we still have to press for the earliest possible release of these victims.
This has nothing to do with an amnesty, because it stands to reason that an amnesty can only be granted to prisoners who have been justly convicted; what we are demanding is quite simply the release of unjustly convicted people.
That may be linked with an amnesty, or their release may precede the amnesty.
It is my view that the political prisoners, not least the many hundreds of Albanians, must be released without delay.
I also appeal to President Kostunica to find out what happened to people such as Mr Ukshin Hoti, with whose fate we have concerned ourselves on several occasions here without ever obtaining any information on his whereabouts.
So there is a need to investigate the fate of those who were abducted, whether they were murdered or whether they are still being held somewhere.
All those who are being illegally detained or who are in prison for political reasons must be released without delay.
That is the first step towards the establishment of the rule of law.
I do have to say that this is not much to ask in return for the substantial aid which the European Union has already pledged.
We expect action as soon as the elections are over.
