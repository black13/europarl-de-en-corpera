Madam President, I can be fairly brief, because I paid all my tributes at the first reading and no longer have so many problems with the other budgets.
But I believe the Commission deserves a special word of thanks, particularly the Director-General, whom Mrs Haug did not mention.
May I now rectify that oversight.
I have fallen victim to the new software program, which grieves me greatly, since I am an engineer by profession.
But I do depend, of course, on the assistance of our services.
With regard to Amendments Nos 34, 38, 35, 36 and 78, the computer has jumbled up the figures.
I therefore ask that technical adjustments be made here.
It is a matter of restoring what we said at the first reading.
This is not a fiddle.
It is the computer that has cooked the books here.
The Members of Parliament have been the soul of propriety, as ever.
I therefore ask for your support and trust on this point.
We shall make hand-written amendments, using 19th-century methods to overrule and outmanoeuvre the technology of the 21st century.
That will set everything to rights.
