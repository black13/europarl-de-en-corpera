Madam President, if the House permits, I should like to give an oral explanation of my Amendment No 51.
Some linguistic confusion has arisen, and what I sought to achieve is not reflected at all in this wording.
Instead of what is suggested by the words "of producers and artists, especially from the non profit-making sector", my primary intention was that we should include in this circle representatives of content providers.
Yesterday, before and after the debate, I discussed the matter with some individual Members of the House.
Several Members consider that these representatives of the content providers are subsumed under other categories of representatives.
This shows that the wording is not clear and unequivocal.
The programme is called eContent.
We should therefore include content providers in it.
This ought not to pose a great problem, in my view.
I should appreciate your support for this amendment.
