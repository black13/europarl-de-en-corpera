Mr President, in my speech I simply ran out of time before I could wish colleagues a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
I should like to do so now.
The second point that I wanted to make is that despite the critical remarks which, as you know, I also made clearly in my speech, we are glad that this report has been adopted and that the Commission is getting this scheme off the ground.
Because it is actually true that it is certainly necessary, but also right, to promote the European model of agriculture.
All those who say that you can still tuck in in style in Europe are right.
And people should do so on special occasions.
But this does not in any way change what I said clearly just now, that we also need to pay attention to the small details, that we must not forget the superior culture of a European agricultural policy which is geared towards social and ecological concerns, and that we should always check measures to ensure that they are also having the desired effect.
I should like to follow up on one further point.
To return to set-aside, if you looked, you would be able to see that, in practice, set-aside is not caused by crop rotation, but that farms are leasing poor land to use as permanent set-aside and are farming the other crops in the rotation even more intensively and with even greater use of chemicals.
This means that the whole point of set-aside, which was originally intended in 1992 to make crop rotation more environmentally friendly, is turned completely on its head.
Here we can see how small changes can yield considerable results in practice.
That was my petition this morning.
I wanted to point this out.
Now that we are all convinced that we need to reach a turning point in agricultural policy, I hope that we will also sit down together and do our homework so as to put right these small details, something which is urgently necessary.
Season's greetings to you all!
