Mr President, today's vote actually shows that important issues are also dealt with on Fridays.
This is the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being, which means that Strasbourg will lose 12 days of parliamentary sittings.
I believe that the issues which have been debated at these Friday sittings have definitely been of strategic significance for Europe.
I should like to make one further request of the French Presidency: that Mr Moscovici - because he has given really extremely brief and sometimes imprecise answers to questions here - answer these questions fully and in writing for the European Parliament, because for us, good cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament means that we face each other as equals and that each takes the other seriously.
That is why I would also be interested to know whether the issue of Friday sittings was discussed at the Nice Summit, that is whether it was of importance or insignificance to the French Presidency.
Finally, I should like to extend my warmest thanks to the House, to all of my colleagues, to all of the ushers and also to the President.
I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and hope that we will all meet again next year in good health.
