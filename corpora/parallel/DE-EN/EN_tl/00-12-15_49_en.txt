Mr President, I can already answer Mr RÃ¼big's question.
In a bit of horse-trading, Mr Chirac promised the Belgian Prime Minister that, from now on, all summits will be held in Brussels and that there will also be an additional plenary week in Brussels.
I find this really quite dreadful: it contradicts the letter of the Treaty, and I hope that it will not happen.
