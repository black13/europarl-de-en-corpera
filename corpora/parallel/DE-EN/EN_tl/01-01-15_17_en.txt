Madam President, we do not doubt that it is an important issue we are discussing here, but this is something that crops up time and again.
In the past, we always agreed that we would deal with such issues as part of a more comprehensive debate.
It is therefore inappropriate to invoke the urgent procedure, particularly as the issue which is to be left off the agenda, is so important.
I would also like to point out - although I was unable to participate in the Conference of Presidents in person, owing to our European People' s Party Congress, my colleague, James Provan, was there to represent me - that the issue has already been voted on in the Conference of Presidents and so there is no need for it to be raised once again.
We are against invoking the urgent procedure on this issue.
