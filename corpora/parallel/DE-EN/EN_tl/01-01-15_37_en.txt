Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Council - not for the first time, I might add - has contravened the Rules of Procedure.
The point being that we MEPs have the opportunity, once a month, to submit a written question, for priority consideration which, according to the Rules of Procedure, must be responded to within three weeks.
Now what we are finding is that increasingly often, the Council is failing to keep to this time scale.
Here is the latest example: I submitted a question in October, to which I have not received an answer to this day, namely when is the Council going to get round to implementing the salary increase promised to the Europol staff?
This is not an isolated case, rather such instances are mounting up.
I would urge you to press the Council to observe the Rules of Procedure.
