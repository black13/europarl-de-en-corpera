Madam President, I would like to take up some points made by Mr Dell'Alba and also say something about Wednesday' s sitting.
Not only is Wednesday' s agenda completely overbooked, but important reports - such as the Sj√∂stedt report on natural habitats, as well as others - are being handled without debate, which is wrong to my mind.
This can be put down to the disastrous decision to cancel Friday sittings, which I would like to take this opportunity to highlight.
