Mr President, what a relief that no speaker so far has called for the environmental directives to be watered down.
Mr Sj√∂stedt, it is nothing to with the poor Member States not knowing what they were letting themselves in for.
And right now they know full well that they are simply and deliberately contravening European legislation.
They are stalling for time and they know perfectly well that nothing will happen to them, because it takes so long for the Court to do anything.
What we have here is the deliberate flouting of European legislation and neither Parliament nor the Council should stand for it.
Some members are saying that we should name and shame.
I can name and shame myself because Austria is one of the countries which has failed to comply with the habitats directive, but I must also protest, Commissioner, because Austria has not been at all remiss as far as the PCB directive is concerned.
We did everything here which needed to be done even before there was a European directive.
We passed a Waste Law back in 1990 and an ordinance banning halogenated substances in 1993.
We are being accused unfairly here.
As far as the nitrates directive is concerned, Austria has now rectified its shortcomings, but we know only too well that the Member States had terrible trouble transposing the nitrates directive.
The main problem here was that, because of the extremely high density of livestock in many parts of the Union, keeping to within the limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare of farmland caused immense difficulties with the production of farm manure in several countries.
Perhaps such a high density of livestock will be less of a problem in the future, because cows, those pained and tormented creatures, are fighting back.
The form of BSE which currently confronts us may well be a sort of revenge on the part of these tormented animals.
We should take a lesson from nature and conduct ourselves properly and comply with the laws which we ourselves have passed.
