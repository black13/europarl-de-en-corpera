May I point out to the honourable Member that the question at issue here is the terms on which European industry obtains the raw materials which it uses to manufacture specific industrial products.
In theory, our starting point is the competitiveness of European industry, and it is competitive if it can obtain the raw materials which it processes on the same terms as the rest of the world.
I fail to see why any additional aid should be needed.
In any event, we can only support the agricultural aspect of this whole question with our organisations of the agricultural markets.
We are not here to use funds earmarked for agriculture to support the chemical industry.
It is our job, in line with the objectives of the Treaty, to support the agricultural aspect, i.e. to give European farmers the chance to get the products which they produce on to the market.
