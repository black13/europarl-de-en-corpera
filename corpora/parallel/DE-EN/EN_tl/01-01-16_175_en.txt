Yes, of course we can check if there is any other sales potential, but I must stress that certain limits must be kept to, even in the area of agricultural aid because, in the final analysis, all the products being addressed here, sugar and starch alike, are subject to quotas and aid is granted within the framework of those quotas.
We cannot subsidise more huge quantities now because we do not have the funds.
Aid to agriculture must be granted within the framework of the maximum quotas agreed in the organisations of the market.
We cannot simply extend the quotas.
