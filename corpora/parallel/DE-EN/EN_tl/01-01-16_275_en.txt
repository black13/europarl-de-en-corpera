Mr President, how should and how will the European Union's common fisheries policy look after 2002?
This question has stirred the emotions of everyone involved in fisheries for some time now.
The Poignant and Gallagher reports are important milestones in the preliminary debate.
The actual debate on reform will, however, not start until the Commission's Green Paper has been submitted within the next few months although, quite understandably, representatives of highly disparate fisheries interests in the European Union are already trying to influence the preparatory process within the Commission.
A great many demands have been made on the Commission.
I think it is still too early for the European Parliament to commit itself one way or another.
We should confine ourselves, within the framework of these two reports, to addressing the problems and discussing various possible solutions.
Both rapporteurs have done a great deal of work and have highlighted the basic problems of the common fisheries policy and I am grateful to them for that.
I should like to single out just three of these basic problems.
First, the problem of access to waters, which should at least be re-examined as part of the reform.
Protection zones must be defined on the basis of scientific studies and the relevant conclusions must be drawn from their results.
Secondly: regionalisation is another catchword which repeatedly gives rise to controversial debate.
But regionalisation does not mean some form of renationalisation.
We have a common fisheries policy in the EU and that is how it is going to stay.
Thirdly: I should like to finish by again highlighting how important it is for the whole fisheries sector - fishermen, science, industry and so on - to be involved in the forthcoming reform process.
This is the only way we shall be able to ensure that the new common fisheries policy is well accepted by those whom it affects.
