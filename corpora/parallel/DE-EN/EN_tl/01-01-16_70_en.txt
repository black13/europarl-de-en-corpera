If the European Union were to support learning materials that had anti-Semitic content then of course this would be an absolutely terrible thing.
But the measures in the educational sphere, which the EU is supporting in Palestine, are to do with the infrastructure or direct expenditure, for example salaries for the teachers, which means that the amendment in its present form is not actually justified and should therefore be rejected.
However, I will of course use Mrs van der Laan' s statement as an opportunity to ask the services to examine very carefully once again whether this accusation is indeed unjustified.
Relating to paragraph 26 van der Laan (ELDR).
Mr President, this is a technical amendment and it only illustrates that we had hoped to discuss this report before now.
Reference is made to yesterday, but since we are adopting the report today, this is a bit illogical.
The text should therefore read as follows:
"Welcomes the fact that it has requested the Secretary-General of Parliament to implement procedures for the handling of confidential documents, including the setting up of a secure archive, secure reading rooms, formal rules of access and an access register has resulted in a proposal submitted to the Bureau for deliberation in December 2000 which calls for implementation before 31 January 2001."
