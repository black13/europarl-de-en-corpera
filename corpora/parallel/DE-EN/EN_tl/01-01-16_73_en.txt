Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, Amendment No 5 to the draft directive on the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions has received majority support.
This is extremely regrettable because it will give third-party creditors the opportunity to gain access to the general resources as a result, which will mean that mortgages ordered abroad for the benefit of the bank will no longer be competitive.
This is unacceptable.
This, to my mind, is reason enough to reject this report.
That is what I have done, and I regret that the Commission' s common position in its present form failed to receive majority support.
