Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the Parish report is the future of young farmers in the European Union.
Once again we hear calls for new subsidies, for so-called installation aid.
I voted against the report.
The report presents the situation as if all were well with the farming world.
But nothing is well with it.
BSE has cast doubt on the entire agricultural system.
We spend almost DEM 100 billion of our petty cash on agriculture every year.
That, indeed, represents half of the European budget.
We are starting to ask ourselves what we get in return for this money - swine fever, hormone-treated calves, dioxin-infested hens and now the BSE epidemic.
I believe we are slowly becoming disgusted by this food chain we produce and perhaps disgusted with ourselves too.
Instead of grasses and cereals, we are feeding cattle with corpses of domestic cats, caged rats and other animals, and I believe this is precisely the point that must now be included in this discussion.
The use of waste products and excrement in food production is the logical consequence of a senseless agricultural policy, which undoubtedly has to be brought to an end right here and now.
We must discuss first principles, so that these subsidisation payouts, the instruments of a command economy, can be consigned to the history books.
That is precisely what we have to tell the young farmers.
We must talk about that with young farmers, about the fact that they will have to be able to survive in the market without subsidisation.
This is certainly not the thrust of the report, which is why it must be rejected.
