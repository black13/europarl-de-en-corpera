Madam President, in order to remove all doubt I would now like to make a clarification.
On Sunday, 14 January Austria had its first suspected case of BSE.
Allow me to inform the House that the institute in TÃ¼bingen informed us yesterday that the results were negative.
I hope the same will apply to all future suspected cases in Austria.
