Mr President, the EC label is an important factor of consumer protection.
But it is a purely quantitative measure.
All that is necessary is to prove compliance with existing European legal provisions.
That is certainly not enough for the consumer.
Consumers also want quality testing and certification procedures so that they can find out whether a product is of above-average standard and therefore also meets their requirements.
That is why third-party certification is quite crucial, especially for safety components.
We saw from the rail accident in Eschede that very serious accidents can occur if the railways only do their own monitoring, without any third-party certification.
Do you think that in future we should place more emphasis on third-party certification in the European Union?
