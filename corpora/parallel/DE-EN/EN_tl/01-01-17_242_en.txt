Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I consider this regulation extremely important and after all the European Parliament has been calling for an improvement in aviation safety since 1987.
That means we must also regulate the flight and rest times of the cockpit crew as of the cabin crew.
I agree with the previous speakers that we should give the unions and the airlines a last chance to settle this issue between themselves, working jointly and pragmatically.
Of course we have agreed that they must reach an agreement by May next year.
Madam Vice-President, please tell your services that if they have not done so by the end of May we will no longer play the game that has been played for six years, namely with the Commission waiting for the parties to reach agreement.
But they have not reached agreement.
The Commission behaved very politely and did not make any proposals of its own.
Either the parties agree by May, or we expect the Commission to put forward a proposal that we can incorporate in the second reading.
For it is unacceptable not to regulate a question that is crucial to passenger safety, namely whether the captains, the crews, have had enough rest to be able to carry out their duties.
These issues must be settled.
Let me address a second point that caught my attention at the December Council meeting.
If we adopt a position at first reading, in fact at Parliament's final vote tomorrow, then I insist as I am sure my colleagues will also do on the Council deciding a common position.
It can wait till May, till the two parties have reached agreement.
But in the interests of passenger safety in Europe we cannot accept no decisions being taken on aviation until the supposed settlement of the Gibraltar conflict.
The Commission and Parliament should jointly see to that.
