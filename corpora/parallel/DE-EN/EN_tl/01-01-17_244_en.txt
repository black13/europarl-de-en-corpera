Mr President, Commissioner, there are some things that are not quite as we would wish them to be in European aviation.
Last year, in particular, showed us repeatedly that it is high time to find more common European solutions to ensure that flying in European airspace follows orderly lines again, not to speak of the great dream of limitless freedom above the clouds conjured up by Reinhard Mey.
But first and foremost, flying must be safe.
We all want flying to remain safe, to see further improvements here in the forefront the rapporteur, Mr Simpson, to whom we owe thanks for an excellent report.
There are, however, different views on how to achieve greater safety.
I and luckily I am not alone in my view would hope that we leave the practical task of regulating the safety provisions, especially in regard to cabin crew and the accompanying provisions on crew training, to the European Aviation Safety Authority.
Surely it should be enough for the European legislator to set out the objectives, rather than getting bogged down in too much detail.
Unfortunately, this position did not gain consistent majority support in committee.
As a result the text we will be voting on tomorrow includes some rather too detailed provisions, for instance on the kind of training course required and so forth.
Perhaps less would be more in this case.
Be that as it may, Europe still has a great deal to do on the question of aviation.
As we saw in Nice on a very general basis, here too on a more specific basis we could plead for fewer national solutions and a more European approach.
The Simpson report is a good step along this road.
Let us take that step tomorrow and then pursue it further in a politically convincing manner.
