Mr President, ever since Amsterdam the Union has been proudly proclaiming its role as a fire brigade for crises in Europe.
The only problem is that it does not even possess buckets with which to draw water.
With the rapid reaction facility, the Union has now acquired some buckets at least, and I do welcome that.
However, I should have liked to see this fire brigade equip itself with hoses too, but Members of this House are among those who have told us that, while this fund does not meet all our needs, fire hoses are simply expensive commodities.
Nevertheless, the facility is a step forward, but I must re-emphasise that it is still a lopsided mechanism, because it only funds action after the event.
Far greater importance surely attaches to action before the event, to preventive measures.
Police forces alone cannot prevent crises, which is why we also expect funding to be provided for the European civilian peace corps that Parliament called for in its resolution of 1999, and we ask Dr Solana to pursue these things more persistently.
