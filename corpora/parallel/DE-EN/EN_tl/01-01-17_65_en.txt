Mr President, our group, as you know, did not vote for the Sjöstedt report in committee.
We would support it here, however, if Amendments Nos 5 and 6 were adopted.
We have discussed this with the other groups.
In the case of Amendment No 5, I am informed that other groups would be able to support the amendment if two linguistic alterations were made.
The first is the replacement of the word 'review' by the word 'examination' as the English translation of the German Überprüfung; this is only a linguistic adjustment.
The second, however, would be an oral amendment.
We ask that the word Rechtssicherheit in the German version of Amendment No 5 be replaced by the word Klarheit and that the English term 'legal certainty' be accordingly replaced by the word 'clarification'.
May I ask you to note this oral amendment and to put the adjusted version of Amendment No 5 to the vote.
