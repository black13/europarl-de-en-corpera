Mr President, I will be brief.
The next speaker but one on the list is down as Mr Franz Xaver Mayer.
But it is Mr Hans-Peter Mayer who will be speaking for our group.
One is a first-class politician on agricultural matters; the other is a first-class jurist.
I simply wanted to clarify that for you to avoid there being any confusion about who will speak.
