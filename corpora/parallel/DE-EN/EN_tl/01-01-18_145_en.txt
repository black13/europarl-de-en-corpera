Mr President, it does indeed cause some confusion when two people have the same surname and not even the parliamentary staff are able to distinguish between them.
Our post also gets mixed up sometimes for the same reason.
Following the horrific events of the Second World War, the United Nations refloated the idea of setting up an international criminal court.
Further impetus was given to this initiative by the violations of international law in Yugoslavia and the massacres in Rwanda.
Some people are asking where the International Criminal Court will have jurisdiction compared with the courts which already exist.
The ECJ in Luxembourg rules on the application and interpretation of the treaties of the European Union.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague rules on international disputes.
The International Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg passes judgement on violations by States of rights arising from the Human Rights Convention.
The International Criminal Court is being set up for the four particularly serious crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression.
Until now the United Nations has authorised special courts, for example the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the crimes committed in Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
In the future, the International Criminal Court will send out a clear signal that perpetrators of any of these crimes will be prosecuted and punished.
War criminals will no longer be able to hide behind the borders of sovereignty.
The new Court is an important achievement for the international community which will allow it to close loopholes in criminal prosecution.
I should therefore like to call on all of the Member States to ratify the Statute soon, and I would recommend adoption of the resolution.
