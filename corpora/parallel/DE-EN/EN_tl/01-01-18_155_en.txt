Mr President, the PPE-DE Group is shaken and filled with consternation at the news of the severe earthquake in El Salvador.
We express our deep sympathy and solidarity with the many who died or were injured and the many who have lost their family and their possessions.
The PPE-DE Group supports the motion for a resolution tabled by several groups in the European Parliament.
It is good to know that the Community has responded to this natural catastrophe so promptly by dispatching experts and money.
This is a convincing example of solidarity.
This is a suitable occasion for me to add that, as a positive member of the generation of 68, when I was a reserve officer in the German army in the seventies, I did not throw stones as other young men did, but searched with my own hands for the dead and injured in an area of Italy which had suffered an earthquake.
On that occasion we were able to rescue very many people who had been buried alive.
This is a great joy.
I can still see the dreadful images from the seventies of the earthquake in Italy, and I can understand the sense of distress prevailing in El Salvador.
It is excellent that Europe has sent help so quickly.
It is to be hoped that the aid will not come too late and that it will enter El Salvador through the proper channels.
