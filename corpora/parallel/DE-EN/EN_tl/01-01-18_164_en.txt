Mr President, I was distracted by Mr Knolle, but I will spare you the details of what he wanted to tell me.
Those who were in the Chamber just now know what I mean.
If I remember correctly, Mr Deprez wanted his report to be postponed.
Now I do not know why I have been given the floor first.
As rapporteur, he has in fact not yet told us why he is requesting this postponement.
That is why it would be only fair for you to give him the floor first.
Afterwards I will give my opinion and that of my group on this.
