Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in principle I support Mr Deprez's request.
I also support it on behalf of my group, because we believe that this is such an important issue - as Mr Deprez has said - that it requires the attention of the whole House.
And he has put forward a persuasive argument that many of the speakers who commented on this in the committee and who wanted to speak this morning are no longer here.
What was right for the Ferri report this morning must also apply to the Deprez report this afternoon.
But of course I should also like to qualify this by saying that we cannot deny that this debate is, amongst other things, about an agenda and calendar problem.
If we do not change our minds and make both Thursday and Friday working days here, then we will discuss this problem over and over again every Thursday afternoon.
In my opinion this can be resolved by creating a coherent and internally logical system for doing our work which runs until Friday afternoon.
In this specific case Mr Deprez has a right to have better attendance than he has now.
