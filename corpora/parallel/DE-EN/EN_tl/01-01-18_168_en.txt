Mr President, of course I entirely agree with Mr Schulz's last point, but I should like this once to state quite clearly that, now that the Friday sitting has been abolished, there is a systematic campaign to abolish the Thursday sitting too.
On the other hand, the responses to this are far from systematic.
On Monday, Mr Seppänen said that his report was too important to be taken on Thursday evening.
Nevertheless, following Mr Seppänen's speech, this House made a democratic decision to take his report on Thursday evening.
Then at midday on Wednesday, the President of the sitting explained that with the agreement of the groups Mr Seppänen's report would be moved to Thursday morning.
This morning we were presented with an agenda, out of which it emerged that the Ferri and Deprez reports would be dealt with this evening.
This morning nobody protested against this.
At lunchtime Mr Ferri realised that he would be leaving and asked for his report to be postponed.
His request was granted, and Mr Deprez sat there and did not protest.
This afternoon Mr Deprez realised that his speakers had gone astray and now this evening he wants his report to be postponed.
This is looking increasingly like a Punch and Judy show, I really do have to say.
I should like very clearly to oppose this postponement.
Mr Schulz, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and I are Members of this committee.
We can air our views on this issue, and we should go ahead with the debate.
However, I would hope that proceedings could be more orderly in the future.
