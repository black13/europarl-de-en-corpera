Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our central concern must be to establish equal opportunities between men and women.
By equal opportunities I do not mean levelling down, I mean equal opportunities for equally qualified women to join and progress in the decision-making process and in professional life, for example by eliminating differences in salaries between men and women doing equivalent work.
We know from the statistics that in nearly all countries at least half the electorate is made up of women, yet the number of women in decision-making positions in companies and in public bodies is remarkably low.
I regard the prime political task as being to eliminate all barriers to equal opportunities.
I have in mind framework conditions that allow women to take responsibility for shaping their own individual lifestyle.
A policy that shifts this task to economic players lets policy makers off the hook at the expense of those affected.
Because the issues involved are social protection, the value of family work, qualifications and skills, working conditions, working hours and much more besides.
It is not a matter of quotas and positive discrimination.
If you will forgive me, I consider that notion in itself to be absurd.
How can discrimination be positive?
I do not want to have my job because I am a woman, but because I am qualified for it, and I believe that many women feel the same way.
