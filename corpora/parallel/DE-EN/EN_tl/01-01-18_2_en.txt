Mr President, I must apologise, because this is not a comment on yesterday 's Minutes, but on the Minutes from the day before yesterday.
Unfortunately, I noticed too late that my name was not on the attendance register.
However, I was here the entire day and took part in all the roll-call votes and other votes.
I would be grateful if this could therefore be corrected.
