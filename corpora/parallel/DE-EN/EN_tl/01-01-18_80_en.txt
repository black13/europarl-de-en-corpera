Madam President, I wanted to explain that I particularly voted for the Poli Bortone report because Amendment No 1 was adopted.
This amendment reflects the concern felt about delays in creating the trans-European rail networks and rail corridors.
This is an issue of particular importance for the Alpine region, from which I come, and especially so in the case of the Munich-Verona cross-Alps line.
We hope that as a result of Parliament's latest vote, the Commission will regard itself as being obliged to further speed up the relevant preparatory work and to push ahead with greater concentration and effort than has been the case up to now, so as to solve this urgent problem for the Alpine region.
