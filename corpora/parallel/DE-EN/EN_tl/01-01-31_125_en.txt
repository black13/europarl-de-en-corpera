Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how many times has this Parliament condemned the murder and war taking place in Colombia?
How many resolutions have we adopted?
That is why I was delighted to hear the kind of statements the Council and the Commission made so eloquently today.
But anyone who believes that Plan Colombia - negotiated by the USA with Pastrana, Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra take note - represents another step in the direction of peace, ought to reflect once again on the fact that it will intensify the war and give succour to the military conflict in neighbouring regions, in other states.
I do not recall President Cardoso of Brazil consenting to this plan or greeting it with enthusiasm.
The role of the European Union here must be to continue to support the peace process and drive it forward, but also to encourage the government in Colombia to restore the rule of law, which is conspicuous by its absence.
There is no real separation of powers, there is corruption - we know all that is there - and it is not the task of the European Union - and I am very grateful to you for making this point - to add fuel to the fire, but rather to play a positive and committed role in this peace process.
That too is our mission.
