Madam President, for reasons of a topical nature, I am in a position to give this issue my wholehearted support.
The day before yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak to Turkey' s Minister of Justice, and I made him aware of the urgent nature of the situation.
I would therefore ask you to take action accordingly.
