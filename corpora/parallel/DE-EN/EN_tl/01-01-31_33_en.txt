Mr President, Commissioner, you said that in the future, the main focus of cohesion will lie in the East and that a cohesion policy of this kind will only be possible if there are sufficient means available.
Would you agree that we also need to allow sufficient time for this, because we know from experience that it takes time to develop regions?
How can we rely on the Commission having the commitment to allow both time and money, in order to pre-empt the effects of the cohesion policy?
EUR 4 billion are available in Category VIII for the year 2002.
Would it not make sense to deploy this with a view to achieving cohesion in the East, even before enlargement takes place?
Where do you stand on this?
