Mr President, thank you very much Commissioner, you mentioned that we will also require new rules for enlargement, and probably more money too.
I would like to ask a couple of questions on the subject of new rules and, as such, on the subject of new ideas.
Would it really be feasible, indeed would it also be wise in the future, to largely target the support at one particular area, time and time again?
Would it not make more sense to place more emphasis than we have done hitherto on particular project ideas, or else on particularly needy areas?
This would also allow us to spend the money in a more targeted way.
