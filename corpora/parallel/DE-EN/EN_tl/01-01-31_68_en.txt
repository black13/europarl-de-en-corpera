Mr President, the Barcelona Process is a splendid idea, only strictly speaking it is 2000 years overdue.
A system based on partnership with the same rights and obligations is supposed to emerge from a colonial and a post-colonial system.
Seen from a historical perspective, the ruling structures were always constructed in such a way as to produce a North-South divide, and now it is only right that Europe, whose countries - or rather, certain European States from within this system - were almost always the beneficiaries, should also take responsibility for rapprochement and parity, and should promote these aspects too.
The goal of the Barcelona Process is undisputed.
Its success depends not only on formal negotiated outcomes, but also on the extent to which we are able to dispel the prejudices we ourselves harbour towards the Mediterranean States and their inhabitants.
There can be no doubt that the realisation of the Barcelona objectives will prove decisive to a peace strategy of the twenty-first century.
Equally, it is important to ensure that no Mediterranean country is excluded.
Libya, the country that lies almost exactly at the heart of the Mediterranean States, goes unmentioned in the Barcelona paper.
The process of rapprochement will not work unless the EU endeavours to invite Libya to take part in it.
