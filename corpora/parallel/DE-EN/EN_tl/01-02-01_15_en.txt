Mr President, Commissioner, the measures proposed by the Commission so far in order to deal with the BSE crisis are mostly too little, too late and unilateral at that.
The Commission does not act, it reacts.
It is not pro-active enough to get a real grip on the situation.
Many of the questions which bother the people affected have yet to be answered.
How do we explain the different prices for BSE tests in Europe?
What will we do to address distortions of competition?
Why is there no effective help for the innocent victims?
I refer in particular to farmers in countries which are still BSE-free and to meat product companies, abattoirs etc., all of which are struggling or fear for their existence.
We are helping the wrong people.
The incineration campaign in particular is blurring the data, sweeping the problem under the carpet and, most importantly, doing nothing to help the innocent victims.
In countries which cannot incinerate, cattle are left standing in their stalls.
The people affected cannot reasonably be expected to shoulder the burden.
Seventy per cent of the supplementary budget has been earmarked for this alone.
Why are BSE tests on live animals not being promoted or imposed?
You must realise that, if we lose our farmers, then we also lose the very basis of our existence, because it is mainly the farmers, especially in our regions, and I refer here to the Alpine regions, who take care of the countryside.
If we lose the farmers, we lose our very existence.
