Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Olsson has presented an excellent report on the subject of the use of hormones in stockfarming.
Food safety must take priority in all our decisions because consumers have a right to safe, risk-free food.
Substances with a hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists as growth promoters in beef production have long-term effects and may therefore have repercussions on human health.
The main persons affected by hormone residues are high-risk groups such as pre-pubertal children and pregnant women.
During the WTO dispute settlement procedure, the scientific committee came to the conclusion from its evaluation of the risks of the six hormones that oestradiol 17â clearly had a carcinogenic, tumour-initiating and genotoxic effect.
If there is the slightest suspicion that an individual substance may have harmful effects, as is the case with oestradiol 17â, then we must react with a definitive ban.
We are also duty bound to be cautious with the other hormones at issue if we are to have a high level of food safety and health protection.
Compliance with the hormone ban must also be strictly controlled within the European Union.
European consumers are also extremely sensitive when it comes to imported products, which is why the monitoring system for meat imports from third countries must be reviewed.
Only if we apply the precautionary principle can we show consumers that we mean business when we talk of food safety in Europe.
That is how Parliament can send out a clear signal and pave the way forward.
