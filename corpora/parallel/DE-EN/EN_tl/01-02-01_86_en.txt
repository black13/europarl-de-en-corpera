Mr President, I should like to explain why the Greens were in favour of these proposed amendments.
I refer to points 11 and 13 in the explanatory statement which, in the final analysis, constitutes the basis for another, more important, explanatory statement, and the tricky points in paragraphs 7 and 12, which we have in any case supported.
Paragraph 7 expresses the wish to find a legal framework for the problems which are bound to arise on this new market.
That was in fact the main reason for this own initiative report.
So why question it?
Paragraph 12 demands, requests, calls on the Member States to consider how to apply specific VAT arrangements to publications which are downloaded.
The problem already exists and this would simply serve to completely confuse current policies.
Paragraph 12 does not in fact contradict paragraph 13, because paragraph 13 merely calls on the Member States, if necessary, to reduce or abolish any VAT rates which apply to books - especially for institutions such as libraries etc. -, i.e. not to treat publications on the new e-market any differently.
That is no contradiction.
On the contrary, it could be an important step for the future, for this new market and for books as a cultural commodity.
That is why the Greens voted in favour of it.
