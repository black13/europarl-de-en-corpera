Madam President, it is quite understandable that Mr Barón Crespo, for whom I have great respect, should now want to amend a decision made by the Conference of Presidents.
That is totally legitimate and I would do the same on another issue.
However, I hope that he does not obtain a majority, because in this case we are not talking about an infringement of parliamentary procedures, we simply want some information from the Commission.
This does not adversely affect the normal working procedures in the relevant committee in any way.
But right now we require some information from the Commission.
Furthermore, deliberations in the Council of Ministers are continuing, and why should we not have an in-depth debate on this issue, given that we will not, after all, be making any decision?
That is the point I would like everyone opposing this question to consider.
We will, after all, not be adopting a resolution, but receiving information.
What is more, and Mr Barón Crespo is very well aware of this, this was discussed in the Conference of Presidents.
Mr Wurtz contributed some ideas - and I have to say that Mr Wurtz's group and my own do not form a permanent coalition - but when we do share the same position on something, why should we not then act accordingly?
We do not wish to exclude anyone, so I would therefore request that we should leave this oral question on the agenda, so that we can duly discuss this here.
