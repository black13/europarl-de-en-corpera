Madam President, I would like to bring a matter to the Members' attention which gave rise to considerable debate when the agenda was being drawn up.
The PPE-DE Group and certain other groups requested that the subject of euthanasia should be debated this week.
Unfortunately, the Conference of Presidents rejected this request.
However, we have refrained from requesting an amendment to the agenda, as we have been informed that some groups are in favour of debating this subject in the European Parliament in principle, but perhaps at some other time.
We would therefore like to enter into a dialogue with these other groups, because we are not against debate and discussions, we actually want a debate.
However, we are very disappointed that the Dutch minister, Mrs Borst, has not agreed to take part in these discussions and has refused an invitation to hearings.
Nevertheless, that should not stop us from entering into a dialogue with the other groups and perhaps requesting that this should go on the agenda in March.
I simply wanted to make this point clear, because so many questions have been discussed in this area.
