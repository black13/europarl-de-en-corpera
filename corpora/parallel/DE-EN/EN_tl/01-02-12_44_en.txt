Madam President, I would be grateful for your attention.
There are 30 people sitting up here.
But if someone on this side asks for the floor, it is rare that any notice is taken.
Mrs Flemming asked to speak right at the beginning.
I would simply like to ask you to look at the right-hand side of the House as well when requests to speak are being made.
