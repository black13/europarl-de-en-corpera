Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to join the House in thanking the rapporteur.
It is amazing how calmly and composedly he has cut his way through this jungle of interests.
The lobby has already been mentioned.
It was indeed persistent but, on balance, it was, I think, a fair discussion and for that, too, I am grateful.
A great deal has been said about the need for balance.
I am afraid that the common position has not yet struck the balance needed.
Parts of the directive penalise the internal market, parts penalise consumers and parts penalise innovation.
The directive penalises the internal market because, at the end of the day, the harmonisation is only cosmetic and the Member States are defending their conventional payment systems tooth and claw, even though they are basically unsuited to the digital world.
We want to prevent that, which is why we suggest in proposed Amendment No 12 that the Member States should at least submit new compensation systems to the Commission and obtain a recommendation.
The directive also penalises consumers because it is quite possible that consumers will have to pay once when they buy a CD or a DVD and then again in the form of a levy.
Then when they come to make a copy, the data is copy-protected and the Member States have not even undertaken to look at copy protection systems and legal copying.
And the common position penalises innovation because it tries desperately to keep the global fee system alive in the digital age, despite the fact that new technology basically makes global fees superfluous, because copy protection allows the rightholder to be paid directly for copies and that is the fairest solution of all.
That is a directive for a citizens' Europe.
It offers the citizen security and fair freedoms in the digital world.
