Mr President, my warmest congratulations to you, Commissioner Fischler.
These measures are a step in the right direction.
They remain within the system, without changing the need to review the system for the next reform and take even more audacious action.
But this package sends out the right signal.
I have just one objection: why not divide up the bull premiums over a transitional period?
Half could be used to slaughter calves, i.e. for recovery, so it would not be Herod's premium, and the other half could be channelled into grasslands, to get into extensification, to get out of mass meat production and to achieve middle-of-the-road production.
I also note that the figure of 90 animals applies to every holding; holdings with more animals do not fall outside the rule, as the newspapers wrongly reported.
