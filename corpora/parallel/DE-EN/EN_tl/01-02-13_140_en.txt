Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to stress that I am grateful to see Point 7, the special purchasing programme.
It makes the position clear.
This means that tests are carried out before storage, and above all each Member State can make its own decision.
I am very grateful for that.
That creates a very acceptable basis for debate.
I have a question concerning the stocking density.
The ratio of forage area to cereal is 2.0 to 1.8 - so do I automatically increase the base area to give farmers an opportunity to further improve their living by growing cereals?
Now for my second question.
And I would like to welcome Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf with his bow tie, maybe that is a reference to the fact that he now has clover grass, but we could also use Lucerne grass, that is just as good.
Can you tell me why we do not use pulses, which we urgently need as a substitute for animal meal in these areas, and why does everything necessarily have to be organic?
