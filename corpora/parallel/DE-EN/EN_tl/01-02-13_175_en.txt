Mrs Zorba, unfortunately I cannot confirm that the process has started at all and that penalties have been called for as part of the process.
I know that the Turkish Government has made direct contact with the criminal prosecution authorities, but we do not know the outcome of that contact between the Turkish Government and the local authorities.
I am certainly willing, Mrs Zorba, to intervene in this matter once again at whatever level you consider appropriate.
And I believe that will be useful, because strong international pressure and intense international interest are the only things that really help in such cases.
