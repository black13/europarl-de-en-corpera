Mr President, President Prodi, I endorse the call for specific answers.
The political unity of Europe made no headway whatsoever in Nice.
On the contrary, Nice was a renationalisation-fest.
What came unstuck there, President Prodi - and I think it is important that we recognise this - was Council's presumption that it is Europe's legislator.
That is by definition what parliaments are for.
President Prodi, the Commission's attitude is unclear and extremely vague, especially on the question of the post-Nice process.
You have criticised the Treaty, but I hear that the Commission is starting a huge run of newspaper advertisements hailing the Treaty of Nice as an historic breakthrough and success.
You find reason to criticise, but your Commissioner Barnier is outlining a mere forum for debate, rather than a constitutional process and a convention.
Mr President of the Commission, I call on you to give a straight answer to a straight question: are you on Parliament's side when it comes to demanding a constitutional process and a convention and for decisive democratic principles, such as the division of power, checks and balances, public legislating and so forth, to be added to the list of Nice leftovers?
