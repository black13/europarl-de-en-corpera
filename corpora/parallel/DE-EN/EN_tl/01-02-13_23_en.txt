Mr President, integration policy took a step backwards in Nice - not a trace of stronger democracy, more transparency or a greater ability to act and take decisions.
Which is why I believe that we need to use the post-Nice process to save the Union from Nice.
I want to raise four points which I feel are important in the brief time available.
First, I call on the Council to correct the number of seats in the European Parliament for the Czech Republic and Hungary immediately; there must be no discrimination against these two countries.
Secondly, we need a clear, jointly agreed starting point for the debate on the future of the Union - re-founding should not mean renationalising.
Thirdly, we need to convene a reform conference modelled on the convention, which has the credentials and authority to propose reforms and, fourthly, if an Intergovernmental Conference is preferred, it should not, in my view, be held in 2004, when the terms of office of the Commission and Parliament expire and they are unable to participate fully.
