Mr President, we have a multitude of outstanding questions post-Nice to which we require specific answers.
They concern the dividing line between national and European powers, simplification of the Treaty, the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the role of national parliaments in the architecture of the European Union.
Why should the final responsibility continue to rest with the Member States?
This question relates closely to the definition of the purpose of the European Union.
We should be clear on one point: remits need to be clearly defined if we expect people to accept legislative and political decisions at European level.
Our top priority must therefore be to ensure that national parliaments are more involved in the run-up to the planned Intergovernmental Conference.
First, in order to get the discussion process in the Member States started as early as possible and, secondly, in order to clarify in advance any problems which might arise during subsequent ratification.
