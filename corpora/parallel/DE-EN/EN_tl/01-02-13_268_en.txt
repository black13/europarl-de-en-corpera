Mr President, I would like to support my colleague Nuala Ahern's comments that physiological products should of course also be included.
However, I welcome the fact that vitamins and minerals are classified as food products, as I believe that we should give responsible consumers the option of using them.
But I also believe that the Commission should be asking why food products are losing so much of their vitamin content, for example why broccoli has lost 80% of its vitamin content over the last 10 years.
I would like to make a particular appeal for labelling not just of ingredients but also of production methods.
There are vitamins which if naturally produced are more effective then when they are synthetically produced.
I believe that consumers also have the right to know whether or not they have been produced using genetic engineering.
I would like to pick up one last point relating to what Mrs Sandbæk said.
I particularly wish to call on the Commission to make sure that this report is not misused to support "functional" foods, because I agree with Mrs Sandbæk that traditional foods should not be artificially enriched with added vitamins.
But I wish to stress that we welcome consumers being given the option of taking additional vitamins.
