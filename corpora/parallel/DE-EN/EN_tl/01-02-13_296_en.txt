Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning President Prodi reported that over a million new jobs were created in Europe last year, and that two-thirds of these were for women.
This demonstrates that employment programmes and work in this area can have very positive effects.
I also believe that the method adopted by the Commission is the right one, that is a combination of benchmarking and promoting best practice with a view to making Europe the world leader in the knowledge-based society.
The Commission has also applied its funding very carefully.
Expenditure was only 50% of commitments.
So a great deal has been achieved with very limited means, which is particularly commendable.
And perhaps it will also be possible to trim administrative expenditure further in future.
The potential is certainly there.
On the other hand, we should do everything in our power to improve and extend this programme in future.
The relevant committee has made appropriate proposals to this effect, and the European Parliament would be proud if the positive achievements of the past year could be carried forward.
In the field of information technology alone - the information society - we will be unable to fill around a million jobs by 2004 because of inadequate training.
I believe that it is a great challenge for us to create new, interesting and good jobs in this area and also in the field of biotechnology, where we need research to solve the problems associated with BSE.
In short, we specifically need to invest in these new areas.
