Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a spirit is abroad in Europe.
It is the spirit of intergovernmentalism.
It is creeping intergovernmentalism - encouraged by the Council - which led Europe into the Nice impasse and on this, President Prodi, we are the Commission's natural allies.
The Commission and Parliament must work together closely on this issue.
If, President Prodi, Parliament occasionally criticises the Commission's administrative behaviour, it is not meant in a spirit of enmity towards the Commission, but as an expression of our democratic duty of scrutiny.
In cases of doubt it brings us closer together rather than rending us asunder.
The issue of national parliaments has been addressed.
I am very keen on having a convention rather than a forum to prepare the next stage, because the negotiators at a convention, such as the Council representatives, the Commission, parliament and the European Parliament, have democratic credentials.
We should not espouse the arbitrariness of so-called socially relevant groups.
This understanding should also be clearly formulated at the Commission.
For the rest, we must consider the role of the national parliaments in the European process.
At the end of the day, it is the national parliaments which control the Council.
That is their job.
They have no authority over Community institutions, such as the Commission or even Parliament.
So when we talk about involving national parliaments, we need to put them on the Council's side in the legislative process.
They cannot restrict the role of the European Parliament.
It is extremely important to us that this be clarified.
One of the focal points of the Commission's work will be asylum and immigration.
We do not want to elaborate a European asylum and immigration code, we want - as Mr Vitorino rightly said - individual directives.
But we need a common concept.
It is this which is still lacking and which the Commission has yet to formulate.
