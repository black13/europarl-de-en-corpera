Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I have no intention of saying anything about Nice, now that no one is listening anyway.
The President of the PPE-DE Group complained bitterly earlier on that no one was listening to him.
I intend to focus on the Commission's plans for foreign and security policy.
There are two sides to this policy, the geographical aspect and the content.
I agree for the most part with the Commission's list of countries, except on one point: there is no mention of the Middle East.
We were the biggest provider of aid and support to Palestine and the region as a whole in the past and will hopefully continue to be so in the future.
I am not satisfied with funding a process while others decide on its political content.
We need a different role, a stronger role in the Middle East negotiations.
We expect this to be understood not just as the job of the Council and the High Representative of the CFSP; we also expect an important, creative initiative on the part of the Commission.
As far as the content is concerned, we need the Commission's presence to be felt in the common European security and defence policy.
Our Parliament welcomed the development in this area in Mrs Lalumi√®re's report but - and here I should like to pick up on Mr Nassauer's Marxist digression - a spirit is abroad in Europe, especially in this area: the spirit of intergovernmentalism.
Parliament wants a common, not an intergovernmental European security and defence policy.
The Commission is duty bound, Mr President, to reinforce the Community dimension of this policy.
You want to do it by making a contribution to crisis management and conflict prevention and I think that is a good thing.
