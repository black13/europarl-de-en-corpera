Mr President, with the imminent accession of the Central and Eastern European countries to the Union, an efficient rail transport network is becoming more and more crucial to smooth cross-border rail transport, which is why we need to integrate the national networks into a single European network.
Ironing out differences in the specifications used by individual railway undertakings is an important step towards a trans-European network.
Creating transport connections and removing traffic bottlenecks in less favoured or remote regions is another important step.
Developing the infrastructure will also give these regions a chance to participate in and profit from the internal market.
