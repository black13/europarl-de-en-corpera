Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor, despite the fact that I have not yet written a book and have not read a great many.
The protection of intellectual property has always been a cause for concern to the European Union and to the European Parliament, because we know that only this protection guarantees that we have culture, that culture flourishes and that economic production takes place.
This could have been an historic moment for the European Parliament.
But it is not.
For the first time in our lives, the protection of intellectual property is being undermined.
With the consent of the European Parliament.
As we have found out, the European Parliament still has only one objective: no conciliation.
After 18 months of deliberation in the Council, we have been told to get a move on.
After 18 months of deliberation in the Council.
And then the Council says "unanimously", although it could have voted by a qualified majority, given the balance we keep hearing about.
And then Parliament is asked not to make any more amendments.
We might just as well shut up shop and go home.
I have never seen Members put under such pressure by their governments and parties.
But with the Council and the governments on either side, in the Council and in Parliament, what need is there for Parliament?
Parliament has its own responsibility and it must live up to it.
The common position has dramatically undermined authors' rights.
I am on the authors' side and I call on Parliament to restore these rights - at least to some degree.
