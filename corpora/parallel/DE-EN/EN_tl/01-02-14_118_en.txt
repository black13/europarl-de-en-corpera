Madam President, we approved the report as it is an important instrument for rewarding businesses which go further than other businesses.
The eco-management and audit scheme will be an incentive.
But we are disappointed that the principle of the best available technique is not incorporated into this report.
We are also very disappointed that there is no support for it in the major groups: it would have been a further incentive for businesses in fact to use the best available technique.
Great success has been achieved, however, in that this will hopefully motivate businesses to take part in EMAS, since registration in EMAS is stagnant at the moment because of the competing ISO 1400 system.
This decision will hopefully help to rectify this situation since EMAS is much better than ISO.
EMAS ensures that the best are singled out, while ISO only singles out those businesses which are better than they were, even though absolutely nothing is said about what they used to be like.
That is why we voted in favour of the report.
We hope that registration in EMAS will increase, especially in Germany, where it is already very widespread.
We also hope that this will serve as an incentive to enterprises to really improve their environmental instruments and to do what is best for the environment.
