Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say that we endorse the position expressed by Mr RÃ¼big before the vote because I would find it totally absurd were it not also somewhat amusing.
I do not think that the Members of this House can be called upon to be standardisation experts on technical issues.
This report says, for instance, that parents with children in prams are people with reduced mobility.
The question I ask myself is this: is the childminder, or the uncle or the grandfather who looks after this child for a day also a person with reduced mobility?
Joking apart, I believe that the people of Europe who are following this debate are quite right to ask whether we in this House do not have more important things to do.
We should leave things where they belong.
Subsidiarity should not be just a nice word; it should be implemented.
