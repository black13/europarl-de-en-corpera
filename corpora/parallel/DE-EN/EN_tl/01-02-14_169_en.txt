Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and the EIB for the very open dialogue we have been able to have over recent months.
Today' s debate shows that the work of the European Central Bank has, in the main, been assessed very positively, which, President Maystadt, I am sure you welcome.
The European Central Bank has an especially important role when it comes to improving European Community structures in less developed regions.
Two thirds of its disbursements go towards this.
But I also believe trans-European networks are of major importance, especially for transport, and they need to be set up along European lines.
We see that a common European economic area is emerging.
But we also see that the traffic situation is very often still following the old limitations and priorities of past centuries.
I believe that a common European market, a domestic market and an optimal currency area must incorporate a corresponding infrastructure and transport infrastructure.
All the activities of the European Central Bank in this area are of special importance.
I also believe that the work of the European Central Bank in other areas is of great importance, especially where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned.
For SMEs, especially those which are innovative and assume risks, simply granting loans is often insufficient; venture capital also needs to be made available.
In recent years the EIB has developed its own initiatives which, in my opinion, are especially welcome.
