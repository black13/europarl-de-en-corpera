Mr President, at the Lisbon Summit full employment was defined as the overriding objective of EU policy.
I approve Mr Bullmann' s report, which was based on the employment guidelines first formulated in 1997 at the Employment Conference in Luxembourg.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
He is correct when he says that, in the future, more qualitative indicators need to be established which, for instance, take account of the variety of jobs and the minimum consultation rights of workers in their organisation, or environmentally-friendly technologies.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to call for this method of combating youth unemployment.
The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Cocilovo, expressed this excellently.
Economic realism is necessary in all the targets we set ourselves within the framework of employment policy.
As the European People' s Party, we will not be pursuing any pipe dreams.
The transformation of our society into a service and knowledge-based society is making great strides forward.
That is why all our demands are targeted at life-long learning and at restructuring the education systems along the right lines.
We often raise our employment plans in official addresses; they feature in many papers, in European directives, in national action plans, where they are wonderfully expressed.
But paper is patient.
What matters now is that these plans are put into practice.
As its contribution to achieving the goal of implementing the proposals that have been made, the European People' s Party will assess the Spring Summit.
We do not need a literature Summit.
I am convinced that Stockholm will not be a literature Summit, as action, not proclamations, is now called for!
