Mr President, in principle, we welcome any attempt to improve conditions in Turkey and bring the country closer to the European Union.
But the question is under what conditions and with what financial resources.
A great deal has been said, quite rightly, about the human rights problems in Turkey, the Kurdish issue, and even recognition of the genocide against the Armenian people.
I myself visited Turkey as a trial observer a few months ago at the invitation of a group of students, and it was not a very encouraging experience.
It is interesting to note, for example, that the rapporteur himself, who has tabled a most interesting report, has changed his views on Turkey over recent years.
But we should not reproach him for doing so, for everyone has the right to alter their opinion.
Financial support for Turkey to boost those forces which want to move closer to Europe and achieve further improvements in democratic conditions must take place in tandem with observation of the human rights situation, however, and must not reduce the financial resources earmarked for other countries.
So we are interested in the TDI's idea of setting up a kind of Council of the Wise, which would monitor human rights on an ongoing basis and make funding for specific projects conditional on improvements in this area.
