Mr President, when I am in Turkey, I am always told that the European Parliament is Turkey's enemy.
Here today, we have made it clear that this accusation is untrue.
The objective debate about Turkey, the speeches, the regulation, or at least the Commission's proposed regulation, and the rapporteur's report have in fact shown that the European Parliament is very keen to help Turkey and make it clear that there is absolutely no desire for hostility; instead, together with the people of Turkey, we want to welcome Turkey as a democratic country in the European Union one day, and are developing sensible proposals to this end.
And here today, our colleagues from the Turkish Parliament are listening to us and following the debate.
I would like to tell them something: we have no great interest in constantly talking about what is wrong in Turkey, but let me explain why we express criticism when they exercise their mandate in Turkey.
We are politicians, and we rightly ask about the politicians.
I have here a quote from a Turkish newspaper, not a Kurdish organisation's newspaper, and with your permission, I would like to read you an excerpt.
It says, "Serdar Tanis, Chairman of HADEP in Silopi, and Ebubekir Deniz, HADEP secretary, have disappeared.
On 25 January, they were summoned by the gendarmerie to the gendarmerie station in Silopi and have not been seen since."
I think this is our problem.
If this type of thing occurs again and again in Turkey and nothing is done about it, people will have to accept that our criticism is justified.
Then they will have to admit that we are right to adopt a highly critical approach to the Turkish issue.
