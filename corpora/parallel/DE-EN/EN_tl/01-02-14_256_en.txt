Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this issue does not just concern Spain.
For instance, yesterday I got a call from a road haulier from the top of whose lorry immigrants had cut a way in through the cover during the crossing.
The British border authorities then arrested these immigrants and the haulier had to pay a fine, although he was unaware immigrants were on board.
I therefore put the following supplementary question: what is the Council Presidency thinking of doing to get to grips with this type of activity?
