Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Peijs, I would first like to wholeheartedly thank the rapporteur for her work and for her clear explanations, which once again spelt out to us what this directive is all about.
I would like to add that this directive covers the whole aspect of the creation of an internal market for financial services and is therefore to be welcomed, as we still have a great deal to do to strengthen, improve and consolidate this market and to remove existing blockades.
The common position has succeeded in bringing the rights of insurance undertakings into line with the legitimate interests of creditors.
The common position is well balanced and, what is more, it is the result of lengthy negotiations to reach a compromise.
The Council has allowed eleven years to elapse.
In view of fact that the procedure has been allowed to run on for far too long, a speedy approval of the common position would be an important step in the interest of creditors and insurance undertakings alike.
To conclude, I would like to say something so as to avoid any misunderstandings.
Throughout the whole of Europe, it is exceptional for insurance undertakings to be wound up, as they are subject to very strict scrutiny, they are very well managed and relations between customers and management are good.
The lack of an EU legislative framework is, nevertheless, a potential risk and could lead to serious problems in isolated cases.
The idea and the need for a directive are therefore justified and the outcome is to be welcomed.
