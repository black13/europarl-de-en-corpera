Mr President, quite frankly, I thought I was going to speak after the Commissioner and so I have only just arrived.
I just wanted to tell you that I read this text with great interest.
I am of the view that the European Union should not underestimate this issue.
The thing is that we, as the European Union, live on this Eurasian continent and a large part of humanity is crowded into Asia.
For us, the relationship between Europe and its Asiatic partners is of strategic importance.
In this, Macao is of great importance because, in this region, a European cultural tradition has become intermingled with an Asian tradition and a whole host of thoughts about human rights and freedom has sprung up.
Despite its relatively small size, Macao has an extraordinary bridging function.
That is why I am of the view that we Europeans must never abandon Macao.
We must also acknowledge that we are not entirely innocent in the fate of many people who lived there in the past and, possibly, of many who will live there in the future.
That is why we have an obligation which goes far beyond what Portugal generously took on.
I am pleased that Mr Cushnahan and I are speaking in this debate.
This gives us a chance to explain that this situation is not only a legacy of the former Portuguese colonial empire but an essentially European concern.
We as Europeans must recognise that Asia is our most important strategic partner and whatever brings the European body of thought closer to the Asian body of thought and vice versa, and whatever consolidates thoughts of democracy and the rule of law on the Asian continent, is not only in the interest of people living there but it is also a basic interest of the European Union.
