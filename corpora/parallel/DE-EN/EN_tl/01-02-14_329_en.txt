.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have an interesting case before us.
I think that a sharp mind must have worked on this report.
The rapporteur has managed, in an exemplary fashion, to tease weaknesses out of an agreement and, reading the explanatory statement contained in the report, Mrs Lucas, I get the impression that it may be paving the way for some form of Euro-imperialism.
I have two specific points to make.
Firstly, as regards the democratic weaknesses which have been pointed out time and again in the explanatory statement, we are setting standards for Mexico which only a strong country can allow itself to set for a weak country.
The need to adapt Mexico' s constitution to bring it into line with this agreement in particular is questionable to say the least.
It reminds me of the deficits which the European Union has itself towards its own citizens due to a lack of democratic legitimisation.
The second point which, in my opinion, should not be forgotten is that Mexico is not only an important trading partner for the European Union but, in the mid 1990s, went through what the then President of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, called the first financial crisis of the twenty-first century.
That is why, to my mind, it is especially laudable that special reference is made to problems which countries like Mexico and, especially now, Argentina have through being closely tied to the US dollar.
It is very regrettable that the Commission does not follow mainstream opinion, which says that we must pay attention.
From my own perspective, I would even prefer to go in the direction of the Bretton Wood system.
The relevant precautions are lacking, as is positive assistance to Mexico.
Perhaps the only criticism I would have against the report is that we do not point out in the recommendations that, in the field of financial crises, we should be extending our help.
