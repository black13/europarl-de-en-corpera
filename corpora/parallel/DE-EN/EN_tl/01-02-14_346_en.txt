Mr President, today, in Germany, a man is appearing before the court who immigrated illegally from the former East Germany to West Germany.
He has quite rightly been brought before the court, not because he immigrated illegally but because he grassed on illegal immigrants from the former East Germany to the state security police.
In my opinion, it should still be possible for people who betray refugees or illegal immigrants to the police to be prosecuted.
Why?
Both the Commission proposal and the report admit that illegal entry can lead to an application for asylum being approved.
Yet this is tantamount to admitting, albeit unintentionally, that, for most people, it is no longer possible to enter the EU legally.
This confirms, also unintentionally, the criticism made by the UNHCR of the EU and its isolationist policy towards refugees.
That is why the promised immunity from prosecution does not help refugees who are accepted as asylum seekers, because they must then betray the people who were actually able to help them in their application for asylum.
The conclusion is that separating commercial from humanitarian facilitation serves no useful purpose because the policy of isolation is increasingly being promoted and aid for refugees is becoming more of a financial burden.
If a decision cannot be reached to dismantle the fortress that is the EU, then at least this report must be rejected and aid for refugees must be promoted both in terms of commercial and humanitarian facilitation.
