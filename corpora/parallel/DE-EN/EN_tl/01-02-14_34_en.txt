Mr President, now that the Helsinki European Council has confirmed Turkey's status as a candidate for accession which must fulfil the same criteria as the other candidate countries, it is logical that Turkey should also benefit from a pre-accession strategy and an Accession Partnership.
The Swoboda report is one outcome of the Helsinki decision and is therefore important.
Let me repeat, the issue is not "whether" there should be an Accession Partnership and pre-accession strategy, but "how".
In one respect, the Swoboda report goes far beyond the Commission's proposal in that it calls for Turkey to be included in the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments.
This would have two consequences.
Firstly, the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments would have to be cut back, and secondly, the Berlin financial agreement would have to be cancelled.
Both are highly unlikely scenarios.
On the other budgetary aspects, I go along with the Swoboda report.
I also think it is important that there should be no discrimination against Turkey.
But SAPARD and ISPA are designed for transformation societies which are evolving from a communist planned economy to what is hopefully a social market economy.
And of course this does not apply to Turkey.
The purpose of the pre-accession strategy and Accession Partnership must be to achieve convergence between Turkey's political, economic and social conditions and the EU.
It is essential that all candidates for accession are treated equally.
But this does not require any additional resources, e.g. from PHARE, ISPA or SAPARD; it requires the same procedures as apply to the distribution of PHARE funding.
I therefore call once more for Amendment No 1 of the Swoboda report to be rejected.
