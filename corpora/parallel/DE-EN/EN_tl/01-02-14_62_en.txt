Madam President, over the last few days you have worked miracles time and again.
For instance, you managed to get Air France to bring Members to the Chamber on time.
Perhaps you could work yet another miracle.
We have just tried to come down into the Chamber using the lift.
From the eighth floor it was full to capacity, nobody could breathe, but nevertheless it stopped at every floor.
We managed to get here, but might it be possible to tell the lift to go faster.
