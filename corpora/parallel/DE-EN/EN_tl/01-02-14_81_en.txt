Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to table an oral amendment.
I have the English text in front of me.
After the phrase, "their own past archive productions produced or commissioned" should be added, "no later than December 1996" .
Then it goes on, "by them under their own editorial control" .
The background to this is quite simple, in December 1996 the WIPO Agreement was concluded.
We want to ensure it only covers archive productions which were produced before December 1996.
