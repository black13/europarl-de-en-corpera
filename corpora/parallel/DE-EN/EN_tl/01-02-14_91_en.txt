Madam President, I just wanted to explain that this directive on a uniform bus for Europe was rejected by all groups at first reading.
Then there were 90 pages; today there are 150.
That is why the European People' s Party has brought in Amendment No 9.
I support referring this draft directive back to committee because, after the standardisation of the European cucumber, we do not want the standardisation of the European bus as well.
I call on my colleagues to vote against it.
(Applause from the right)
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Report (A5-0025/2001) by Mrs Müller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements [COM(2000) 222 - C5­0234/2000 - 2000/0080(COD)]
