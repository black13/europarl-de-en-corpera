Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, during yesterday evening' s sitting, Mr Krarup tried to refer the Commission proposal, the directive and the report back to committee and to block them.
I regret this very much because the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities was not involved in the early phases of the work on the report, either in committee or through the tabling of amendments.
Secondly, I would like to point out that we are not dealing with Article 152 here, on health, but with Article 153, which concerns consumer protection.
For this reason, I ask that we vote on this report today and that we do not refer it back to committee.
