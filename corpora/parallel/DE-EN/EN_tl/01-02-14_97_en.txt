Madam President, I am sorry.
I did try to avoid this, but perhaps we should base our arguments on the facts and on the system of law in the European Union.
In the context of the internal market we are obliged to work at harmonising legislation in the area of consumer protection too.
That is exactly what we are doing with the present legislation, for which Mrs MÃ¼ller is the rapporteur.
We are harmonising existing legislation on food supplements in the Member States and one of the reasons why we are doing this is to protect consumers.
The intention is not to overstep the competences of the European Parliament, and we are simply doing what we are doing in other areas.
The Court of Justice will agree with us at all times.
Anyone who today tries to postpone it and to get it taken off the agenda is doing so using invalid arguments.
