Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of faith, conscience and religious creed and freedom of expression and association are the most elementary fundamental rights that can, and must, be granted to every individual in this world of ours.
They are part and parcel of our democracies, and we expect them to be applied everywhere as basic principles so that the dignity of human life is truly respected throughout the world.
For a while it looked as if the situation were taking a turn for the better in the People' s Republic of China too.
Sadly, in more recent times this appears to have changed, and progress seems to have not only been halted but even reversed.
For example, I greatly regret that, while the People' s Republic of China has signed important documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the process of ratifying and implementing the two covenants has yet to be completed.
That is a great pity.
This process needs to be reactivated.
I therefore appeal on behalf of my Group to the People' s Republic of China to respect people' s civil liberties just as we endeavour to do in our democracies.
May I add a postscript to the honourable Member Mr Dupuis, just to mention to him that the Falun Gong say that they are not a religious institution.
We should also respect the way in which institutions define themselves.
