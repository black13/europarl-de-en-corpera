Mr President, what was it that Karl Marx said?
"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions.
It is the opium of the people."
Marxism-Leninism is in terminal decline, but other ideologies have survived.
China is far from permitting freedom of expression, let alone freedom of religious observance, for Tibetans, Mongolians and members of Christian churches or Muslim communities.
The Tibetans are persecuted.
It is an offence to display pictures of the Dalai Lama.
Those who stand up for their beliefs face the threat of lengthy prison sentences.
I recall the initiative of the Tibet intergroup of the European Parliament to propose the nun Ngawang Sangdrol, who has spent the last nine years in prison, for this year' s Sakharov Prize.
The eleven-year-old Panchen Lama, the second-highest authority in Tibetan Buddhism, has been abducted and has since been cut off from the outside world.
He was not even allowed to meet with Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The PPE-DE Group expects China, as a future WTO member and a global player, to assume its responsibility at long last and to ratify and implement the international agreements on civil and political rights as well as those on economic, social and cultural rights.
We call on the EU Member States to take the opportunity presented by the meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
Put the obstruction of freedom of religion and the gross violations of human rights in China at the top of the agenda.
And let us remember that, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, one of the few successes of the Nice Summit, the Member States enshrined freedom of religion, conscience, expression and information in the second chapter.
I hope that our European Commission will show the same powers of initiative.
Tashi delek!
