Mr President, I believe the report is a sound one, and I congratulate the rapporteur.
I also find the term 'research area' very effective.
I believe this is a good initiative from the Commission.
I should like to say a word or two on Mr Alyssandrakis' remarks, which invite the comment that, if Greece spent more money on research, it would be less dependent on Brussels.
That is the problem for many countries in the European Union.
They have cut back on their research funding for both large and small projects.
European research cannot fill this gap.
If we want to have a European Research Area, the EU and the Member States must both play their part, otherwise we shall be faced with an imbalance that we cannot redress.
I also see the administration of these research projects as a major challenge, especially when we enlarge the European Union.
Brussels will not be able to go on administering them in the long run.
That is why we should try, perhaps with the budgetary control apparatus, with the Court of Auditors, to develop procedures that will lighten the administrative burden in this domain.
Besides, the research effort cannot be governed by the principles of prudent accounting.
Research means taking risks, and some of these risks will inevitably be financial.
The crux of all research activity is the final outcome.
The bottom line is the result of the research and not necessarily the financial balance.
I should far rather have a successful project on which some losses might have been sustained than a project with a perfect balance sheet but no useful findings.
(Applause)
