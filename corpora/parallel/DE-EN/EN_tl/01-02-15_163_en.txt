Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is about to adopt its 13th resolution since the outbreak of the first war in Chechnya in 1994.
Let me make it clear that I want our resolution today to be understood on the one hand as an urgent appeal to the Russian Government to stop violating human rights in Chechnya and to play its part in the initiation of long-overdue measures of de-escalation and on the other hand - and let me emphasise this quite clearly - as an encouragement for those on both sides - Russians and Chechens - who are trying to bring about a peaceful end to this conflict at long last.
As you know, our counterparts in the Council of Europe have recognised the efforts of the Russian representatives - and there certainly have been such efforts - to improve the human rights situation in Chechnya by restoring their voting rights in the Strasbourg assembly.
This, however, was done in spite of exhortations to the contrary by human rights organisations.
I really do think this was rather an ambivalent signal to send, and I presume that the Troika and Commissioner Patten, who are in Moscow at the moment, will raise this issue with the Russian Government and will call on the Russian side to resolve this distressing situation.
The analysis delivered by the Human Rights Watch on the situation in Chechnya is very alarming.
Nevertheless, I assume that those on the Russian side who are genuinely committed to finding a non-military solution to the Chechen conflict will win the day.
The facts of the situation have to be faced; the population of Chechnya has already shrunk to half its previous size, and it is time to pave the way for them to live in peace.
