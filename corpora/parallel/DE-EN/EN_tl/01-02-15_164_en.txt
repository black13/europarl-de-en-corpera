Mr President, last December the European Parliament adopted a highly critical resolution and declared that it would not remain silent in the face of continued abuses of human rights, particularly the sort of abuses that have been taking place in the last two years of the war in Chechnya.
Nor shall we permit the Commission and the Council, when they travel to Moscow as the Troika, to make do with a passing reference, between the main course and the dessert, to the murders and torture that are still being perpetrated in the camps and police stations of the Northern Caucasus.
Commissioner Patten is there now, so let me ask the Commission what sanctions he has threatened to apply if the Russian Government continues to do nothing to resolve the conflict peacefully, if it is not prepared to engage in talks and to arraign those who are responsible for the violations of human rights.
We have ample ground to stand on: we have the partnership and cooperation agreement, we have our strategy, and we are unanimous in our view that cooperation must be conditional on respect for human rights.
The carrot-and-stick method is the right approach for us, which is why investments in the oil business can only be made on the basis of a peace settlement in Chechnya.
