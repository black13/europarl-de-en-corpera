Mr President, I would just briefly like to say that it has been proposed that we should start earlier on a Monday and leave earlier on a Thursday.
I must say that this is absurd since it would mean that many of us would have to travel here on a Sunday so that others could have Friday free.
It always used to be the case in Europe that Sunday and not Friday was a day of rest.
