Mr President, I believe it is important that the rapporteur says a brief word on this.
I regret that we have not managed to exercise our parliamentary responsibility.
But Mr Watson is right, and we should support him.
I appeal for the support of every Member, otherwise we shall make our Parliament look ridiculous.
