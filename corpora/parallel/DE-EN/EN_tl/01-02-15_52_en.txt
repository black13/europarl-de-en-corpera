Mr President, it is certainly true that the House agreed very amicably on a common starting point and a common line in the debate on the preparation for Stockholm.
The PPE-DE proposal that was rejected is a mere nuance.
By no stretch of the imagination is it one of the cornerstones of the resolution.
I am very disappointed that this House, which is unanimous in its desire to demand more rights for the European Parliament, has neither the competence nor the guts to make a joint contribution to the Stockholm Summit.
(Loud sustained applause)
