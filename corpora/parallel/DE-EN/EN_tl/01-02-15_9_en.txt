Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the coordination and pooling of European research efforts must not lead to the demise of competition between research establishments.
Coordination and cooperative arrangements are good, but there should be no anti-competitive assimilation.
Subsidiarity defines the limits of the Community' s powers, and those limits must always be borne in mind.
Whether the Commission' s ambitious projects are realised will depend on the breadth of vision demonstrated by national decision makers, who must rid themselves of the notion that the awarding of research contracts is a means of subsidising their own national economies.
The foremost priority must be to achieve each research aim as quickly as possible for the benefit of the entire European Economic Area.
We in the Union probably have the best training courses for scientists, but sadly they often emigrate to more attractive countries like the United States after obtaining their qualifications.
Every effort must be made to keep them in Europe, which is why it is up to us to create the best possible conditions for research activity and thus to make Europe a more appealing option for top researchers.
