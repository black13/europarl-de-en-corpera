Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I recently read an excellent and extremely interesting dissertation by Dr Leitl on the control of abusive practices, which convinced me that what we need most is a functioning and supervised market and fair payment for services.
It is clear from roaming fees, for example, that the market is far from transparent.
It would be good if consumers really could find out exactly what their conversations cost or if they at least received a follow-up SMS straight away, telling them what the call had cost.
This sort of transparency results in benchmark comparisons, i.e. you can compare who is best in Europe and how we compare with the rest of the world.
We want to work out a best practice method together with the Commission.
Who in Europe or anywhere else in the world has the models which work best and which we can use ourselves?
Above all - and this is very important - we also want to use SLIM.
Various regulations being introduced today will, in fact, need to be repealed as quickly as possible once the market starts functioning.
One very important point in the Paasilinna report is Amendment No 47, because we have seen that, although the auctions were fair, a great deal of money has pulled out of this important sector.
That is why we consciously do not want to treat the proceeds from auctions as straight taxation and why we politicians take the view that this was an investment, an asset which was once a public-sector asset and which is now a virtual asset for the companies.
I also believe that, once the licences have expired, these rights should be retained by the companies, which can then sell, rent or otherwise trade them.
That will improve the companies' rating and it will improve the capital market and, by extension, the share prices, giving us an investment in this sector and strength for the future.
