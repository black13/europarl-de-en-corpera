Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when one is so far down the list of speakers, one always runs the risk of repeating certain points.
I want to try and avoid that.
But I too should like to highlight two or three points.
I too should like to express my gratitude for the interesting and exciting cooperation in Parliament right across the group divide.
There are certainly material arguments here which go beyond political bounds.
I too found the discussions with various representatives from companies large and small right across Europe very interesting and, although not everyone will be satisfied, I think we are on the right track towards a more viable future.
It has been my conviction over recent years that we need to create tight, bundled rules which allow us to react quickly in the future to technological progress.
In this respect, my maxim still holds: less regulation may be much better regulation.
I think that, in concentrating on the directives being debated today, we have succeeded in doing this.
I also think that sooner or later - I think relatively soon - we shall be able to start applying general competition law.
I must, of course, pour just a little cold water on one point.
I personally and many of my fellow Members fully support Amendment No 78, as tabled by Mrs Niebler, and shall vote in favour of it.
As I said, this support cuts more or less across the group divide, because I am positive that this proposed amendment does not stand in the way of European harmonisation.
On the contrary, in my view, the type of licensing procedure and powers set out in this article are more time-consuming and bureaucratic and, in my book, constitute interference in regional affairs in the public-service radio sector, as my fellow Member, Karin Junker, has already said.
In this respect I feel strongly that, whatever the approach, we must prevent the 'must carry' obligation from being abolished through the back door.
