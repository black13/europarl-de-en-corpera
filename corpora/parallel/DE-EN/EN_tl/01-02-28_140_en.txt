Mr President, every Member State in the European Union applies policies on women and families.
The way in which they do so depends mainly on their constitution and political institutions.
Despite some progress in the treatment of women in paid employment and in implementing equal treatment boundaries throughout Europe, sexual inequality persists.
The main aspects are correctly presented in the report.
This applies to the description of the situation of self-employed women, to gender-specific wage differentials and to differences in types of employment and unpaid work.
These economic ups and downs have serious consequences on the standard of living of individual families, most of the responsibility for which is shouldered by women.
As 8 March approaches, we need to get the point across that a person's achievements count for more than his or her sex.
Domestic violence and stereotypes, not to mention mediaeval perceptions of a woman's place, should be consigned to the past once and for all.
I want a Europe with one culture, where the dignity of men and women and of foreigners and immigrants is an asset, not an economic burden.
The report considers that all is not well here.
Nonetheless, the number of immigrants is rising, begging the conclusion that it really is time to create optimum conditions in the European Union, otherwise conflicts may intensify.
The report should cover these tasks more amply.
I would remind you that enlargement to the East is imminent, bringing with it many women with different traditions and different cultures who need to be attended to, not sidelined.
