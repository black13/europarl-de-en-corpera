Mr President, I agree to a large extent with the critical comments in the report and Mr Gemelli's proposals.
However, I too doubt that it will be possible to halve the number of poor people by 2015.
The new-liberal policies of the northern countries, which have made the rich richer and kept the poor in the poverty trap, are also shaping development policy.
The new motto 'Everything but Arms' sounds fine but misses the mark.
First, the arsenals are so full, as the result of arms exports from industrialised countries, including Germany, that war can be waged and will be waged with the weapons already available.
Secondly, it is hypocritical of the European Union to preach liberalisation of the markets as a universal panacea while bemoaning the fact that the 48 poorest countries have been allowed to export all their products to the Union duty free since the year 2000.
Thirdly, I think it is cynical of rich countries - including Germany - to encourage a brain drain from developing countries, thereby pulling the rug out from under a self-perpetuating upswing.
Development policy is not just altruism, it is self interest.
It is striking that areas which provide raw materials are defined as areas of interest and, according to the new NATO strategy and the rules of engagement for the future EU strike force, areas of interest can also be secured using military force.
If we want a new European Union for the twenty-first century, then we need a radical change in development policy.
