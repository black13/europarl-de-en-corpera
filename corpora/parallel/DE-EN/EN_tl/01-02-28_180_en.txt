Mr President, I clearly heard the lady Member state on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that she opposed this sort of agreement in principle.
But I see no reason why I should comment on this principle of the Group of the Greens in my reply.
As for what she said about flags of convenience, the question of this playing a role in the specific context of Equatorial Guinea has not yet been raised - either during preparatory meetings or anywhere else.
But I would be more than happy to have my services investigate and forward a reply to you in due course.
