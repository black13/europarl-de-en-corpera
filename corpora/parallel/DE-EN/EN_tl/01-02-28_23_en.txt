Madam President, Mr Vice-President, I congratulate you on the many proposals you have made, which in my view are entirely along the right lines.
I should like to address two problems.
Following on from the first question, lately many Commission staff have started to shy away from decision making because of what lies ahead of them.
Let me ask you this, what can you do to encourage the Commission staff to engage actively in decision making once more?
Surely all the Commissioners have not only agreed on these steps but have also stated quite clearly that they will take on political responsibility for the reform measures they are proposing in their areas of work?
And my second question is this: you propose to externalise, i.e. outsource, a range of areas.
Do you not see something of a contradiction between externalisation on the one hand, and your justified desire to create a unified and independent Commission staffing structure, on the other?
What will you do, Commissioner, to ensure that externalisation does not lead to the fragmentation of this unified civil service?
