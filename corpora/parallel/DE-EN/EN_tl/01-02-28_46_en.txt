Mr President, I am reluctant to speak, but after what Mr Medina Ortega has said, I have no choice but to respond.
Mr Medina Ortega, it is quite obvious what you are doing.
Let me remind you - as you are, of course, well aware - that there has been correspondence between the President of your group and the President of the European Parliament.
You are also aware that there are certain rules which apply when the issue of immunity is examined by the committee responsible, and that means that the relevant authorities within the country where someone is accused of certain conduct must have supplied this information.
This was also the case in 1990, when your current group President was the President of Parliament.
I would ask you to remember that our debates here are not a preliminary to the Italian election campaign, which is essentially what all your manoeuvring is in aid of.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
Now that your group and the leading figures in your party have engaged in this scandalous behaviour towards Austria, we will not let you conduct an election campaign here in the European Parliament again.
Let me make it quite clear, Mr President, that our fellow Member, the President of the European Parliament - who is, after all, the object of your criticism here - has behaved quite correctly, as she has described in her letter to the President of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Believe me, Mr Medina Ortega, if you want to conduct an election campaign here you will have your election campaign.
But you can be quite sure that we will not let you air your unrepresentative and indefensible views in this forum.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
