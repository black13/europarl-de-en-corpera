Mr President, the honest farmers who bear no blame for the BSE crisis are now paying the price for the Commission' s and the Union's misguided agricultural policies.
The draft before us merely entrenches the structures which supported large-scale factory farming and production and are therefore partly to blame for the crisis.
Seventy per cent of the supplementary budget is to be used to pay for the incineration campaign.
It thus shores up the factory farming structures which have contributed to the crisis.
We will lose all credibility with the honest and blameless European farmers if we vote for this supplementary budget.
We will be sending out the wrong signal if, with this incineration campaign, we now sweep the problems of those who are partly responsible for the crisis under the carpet.
So I support the rapporteur when she calls for a fundamental shift in our agricultural funding regime in favour of small-scale farming.
But unlike Mrs Haug, I am not prepared to vote in favour of this supplementary budget.
