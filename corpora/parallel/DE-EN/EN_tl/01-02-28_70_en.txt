Mr President, as the European Union has also helped to create this crisis the European Union must therefore play its part in managing the crisis.
But when I say 'the European Union', I do not mean the Commission or the Council or Parliament but I am essentially referring to our Member States as well, which make up the EU.
Please do not misunderstand me: no one can point the finger at anyone else and pretend that he himself has had nothing to do with this whole sorry affair.
The European agricultural policy in its current form, with all its weaknesses and errors, was created and shaped by all the Member States and parties of all political hues.
So we must all join together to change it.
That does not alter the fact that at present, we face a situation in which we have to manage the crisis on the old playing field in line with the old rules.
We cannot ignore this fact.
As yet, we have no new rules and we have no reformed agricultural policy, although that is what we are calling for.
Of course, Mr Ferber is right when he distinguishes between short, medium and long-term issues.
That is quite correct.
But anyone who is now asked for funding and support for the expenditure necessary to manage the crisis has not only a right but also a duty to call for the much-needed reforms.
We have a programme which runs until 2006, with a review in 2002.
But we already know that the review will reveal that there is a need for a fundamental reform of the agricultural policy.
So our vote in favour of this supplementary budget is a vote coupled with a clear statement.
And we will remind you of that very soon.
