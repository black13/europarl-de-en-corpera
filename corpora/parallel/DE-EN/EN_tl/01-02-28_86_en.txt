Mr President, Commissioner, I have two questions.
The current precautions in connection with BSE have been eclipsed by the dangerous foot-and-mouth epidemic.
I remember back in the 1950s, when whole villages were quarantined in order to prevent the epidemic from spreading.
How are the severe restrictions on movements of animals being enforced, Commissioner?
What I mean is, anyone who still fails post-BSE to comply with regulations should be taught a serious lesson using other means.
How secure is the situation in the European Community regarding labelling obligations?
You said that culling and the travelling ban are currently the main objectives.
How prepared are you to vaccinate animals which must surely be scattered throughout Europe on a strategic basis in order to help prevent the disease from spreading?
Are you well prepared?
