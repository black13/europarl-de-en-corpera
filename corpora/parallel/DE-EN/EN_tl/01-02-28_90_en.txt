Mr President, Commissioner, it again looks like a case of waste disposal here.
In this case from an airport, which then triggered the epidemic.
Firstly, surely it makes sense to back up State controls by imposing a duty of proof on firms in the waste industry?
Secondly, will you ensure that the holdings affected receive compensation if epidemic funds in the Member States run dry?
Thirdly, should we not be a bit more cautious with the culling programme now, because this epidemic may force a culling programme which goes beyond what we had intended?
We should at least exercise some caution here.
Not that I am tempting providence, Commissioner, but the risk does exist.
