Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I take great pleasure in conveying a message of thanks to you this morning.
Last week in Prague I had the opportunity of meeting Mr Ivan Pilip, a Member of the Czech Parliament.
Mr Pilip was detained for 26 days in a Cuban jail for having established links with dissidents.
He is now back in the Czech Republic, is in good spirits and thanks the President and also the Members of the European Parliament for their efforts towards his release.
Mr Pilip remarked that the Czech public also felt great satisfaction in the friendship forged for his benefit between the European Parliament and the Czech state and Czech members of parliament.
He is convinced that our intervention in particular played a significant role in securing his release.
I would like to make it clear that I personally played very little part in this process so I am all the more delighted to be able to pass on his thanks.
