Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks and months when agriculture has been debated, there has been much talk of a change of direction in agricultural policy.
I certainly do not wish to address these topical problems here, but I do think that some aspects of the debate have been neglected.
What I am getting at is the fact that surely it can hardly be right to pillory the whole of European agriculture right across the board or to condemn wholesale the achievements of the common agricultural policy.
The European sugar market policy, of all policies, has done nothing to deserve a judgement of this kind.
The common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector is like a horse on the road to victory, as has also been repeatedly stressed in this debate.
For many years now, consumers have been supplied with a safe basic foodstuff, and this at reasonable prices.
Some critics think and claim that sugar is too expensive, however.
Mr Daul referred to this, but it should set alarm bells ringing; firstly, because these critics are hardly concerned about the well-being of consumers but about their own profits; secondly, because the production of a basic foodstuff in compliance with European environmental and social standards has a legitimate price and thirdly, because, measured against consumers' purchasing power worldwide, the sugar price which we have in Europe can probably also be described as one of the lowest.
Some people also say that the common organisation of the market in sugar is a dinosaur.
It has been in force for 32 years, since 1968, but of course it has been repeatedly adapted.
That is why it is now also necessary to have a longer period of validity, of at least five years, as the rapporteur, Mr Daul, has said.
It would be wrong to change the compensation system for storage costs...
