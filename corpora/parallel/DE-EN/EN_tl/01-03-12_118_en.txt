Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months, we have examined the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector in great detail and have held intensive and controversial discussions, not only with the Commission, but with all those who are in favour of total liberalisation of the sugar market.
I should therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur very warmly because he has, in my view, succeeded in achieving a very good result in his report.
Time and again it is said that sugar is too expensive and that it needs to be cheaper for consumers.
I should simply like to refer to the BSE crisis.
It shows that, although farmers are seeing prices fall by up to 30%, the consumer still pays the same price for the meat in the shops.
I therefore fully support the extension of the organisation of the market in sugar until the marketing year 2005/2006.
In my opinion, this is the key point in this proposal.
This end date also coincides with that in the Berlin agreement, in which CAP funding is established for six years.
We farmers need a policy on which we can rely.
The sector's stakeholders, the sugar beet producers as well as the sugar manufacturers, need to be able to look far enough ahead to make appropriate investment decisions.
In this context I should like to mention the imminent accession of new countries.
I do not think that it would have been very prudent to establish a new COM for only two years, as originally proposed, because this would only have caused confusion and led to uncertainty.
As far as the arrangements for storage levies are concerned, I can only fully support the rapporteur when he advocates that they should be maintained.
They are an important instrument to keep the market stable and they have proved their worth over 30 years.
It would be very short-sighted to disturb the equilibrium in a market organisation of this kind - which works perfectly - simply for the sake of reform.
