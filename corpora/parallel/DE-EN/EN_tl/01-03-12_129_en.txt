Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my impatience is growing, not only as a Member of this House, but also as rapporteur for the information campaign and as a Member of the Interinstitutional Committee.
Sometimes my impatience gives way to disappointment.
Like the People's Europe initiative, the major European projects, such as the introduction of euro notes and coins, the reunification of Europe, the debate on fundamental rights and a European constitution, the debate on competences (who is responsible for what), the post-Nice ratification procedure and the post-Nice process - I use the expression major political European projects advisedly - need an information and communication campaign.
Despite the call for subsidiarity and decentralisation, the Commission and the European Parliament need to exercise joint professional management of the content.
The current unsatisfactory state of affairs is the cause of the questions, criticism and disappointment about the dilettantism of the information policy, the announcement strategy and the delaying tactics.
I ask myself the following questions: what has happened since 14 April 2000?
Where is the master plan which we were promised at that time?
Where is the specific timetable and programme of measures?
Where is the clear division of responsibilities in the Commission?
On 14 April, Commissioner Reding spoke here.
A few days ago, Commissioner Barnier deferred answering the question about whether he would be taking over responsibility for this.
Today you have stood in for us.
Where is the proof that you are serious about a joint Commission and European Parliament approach?
There is no clear strategy.
We do not need a re-nationalisation of information policy.
The Commission is not simply a channel for EU funds...
(The President cut the speaker off)
