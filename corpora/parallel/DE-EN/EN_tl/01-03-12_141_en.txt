Mr President, Commissioner, in two minutes or even less, it is terribly difficult to express the full extent of our disappointment that so far nothing has been done to help European shipbuilding.
I do not believe that this will be the last time that we discuss this matter in this Parliament.
Mr Monti, you are quite right to say that shipbuilding, research and development and intelligent maritime transport are our future.
I would so like to believe this, from our position in the here and now.
We know that shipbuilding is the last industrial sector to be subsidised.
We know that this is an anathema to you, and actually it is to us too, but the shipbuilding industry needs help quickly, help which is relevant to its current situation, not long-term subsidies - please do not misunderstand me - but financial help until the market has returned to normality.
This is not just about Europe any more; nor is it just about South Korea.
I know from my own experience - I have just been to China and Hong Kong - that other nations are observing us and that our attitude is setting them a bad example.
We, therefore, need to make positive statements, redouble our efforts and implement our shipbuilding standards and our intelligent maritime know-how with conviction.
In actual fact this is not just about a few jobs; it is not just about a sector of the economy whose difficulties we have, after all, been able to overcome so successfully up until now.
It is in actual fact about the new image of a modern European Union.
That is why we are asking you so urgently to provide help.
I have got to know you personally, Mr Monti, through our discussions on the maritime sector and have come to hold you in high regard.
Believe me that we do not wish to discover that our trust in you has been misplaced.
