Madam President, with all due respect to the Conference of Presidents - which I also attend on occasion, as you have quite rightly pointed out - there should be an opportunity for emergency statements by Members of this House, especially when new developments have occurred.
So I think that - as you, yourself, have implied - we should be able to decide in a free vote today whether we wish to include an update on this issue on the agenda, contrary to the Conference's original decision.
There is one problem, however.
In essence, of course, the Council is also called upon to make a statement on this issue, so I would ask that, if possible, it should also be discussed when a representative of the Council is present, as this will hopefully give us the information we need for our decision making.
In this sense, I should like to express support for my fellow MEP.
