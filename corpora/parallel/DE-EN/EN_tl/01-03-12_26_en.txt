Madam President, I did not really intend to speak.
I was there when, at the Conference of Presidents, we said that there was no need for us to hold a debate at this time, as we had already discussed foot-and-mouth disease last time.
Now that Mr Corbett has, however, albeit not denied Parliament the right to decide, he implied instead, as it were, that it would be inappropriate to take such a decision here, I would just like to say, on behalf of my group that in the light of recent developments, we all agree unanimously that we should have this debate.
We do not want to wait until the Commission kindly grants us a debate; we call upon the Commission to come here to Parliament and discuss the issue with us.
We send out the same appeal to the Council as well, and in this regard I am rather more forceful than Mr Swoboda.
We should not kindly request the Council; we expect the Council to make a statement as well, so that together, in the plenary sitting of the European Parliament, we can represent the interests of our citizens and our consumers!
