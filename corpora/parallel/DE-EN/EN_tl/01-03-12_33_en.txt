Madam President, I have a great deal of sympathy with the substance of the arguments put forward by the two previous speakers.
It was really quite alarming to have to hear what a member of the Commission' s staff said to the Echelon Committee.
Even if only a quarter of what he said is true, the situation is extremely problematical.
I believe, however - and this is my group's view - that the Echelon Committee is there to examine these issues in detail and get to the heart of the matter.
So I would also support the expansion of the Echelon Committee's competencies, if necessary, so that it is able to undertake a detailed examination of these issues, which have, after all, been referred to it - even if some have been withdrawn again - and then present its findings to Parliament.
As a group, we feel that this would be a better way forward.
The issues are serious, we take them very seriously, but after detailed examination by the Committee they should be presented here and dealt with by us.
