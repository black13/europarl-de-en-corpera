Madam President, I come back to my question to you, which I quite obviously raised at entirely the wrong moment.
I asked you earlier, and I should like to repeat this now, whether you are prepared, in view of the burgeoning debate about the process regarding the application for the removal of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, to answer three brief questions which I would like to put to you.
Madam President, I repeat, you are, of course, under no obligation to answer these questions, but I believe - as you will see from the questions themselves - that, together with your possible answers, they may well dismantle the obvious lack of clarity surrounding this matter.
So my request, as I said, is this: may I put these questions to you, and will you answer them?
