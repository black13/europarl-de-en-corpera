Madam President, judging from the correspondence which I have seen so far, and according to the letters which you had delivered to Members' post boxes today, it is quite apparent that you, or the head of your private office, I am not yet entirely sure which - had doubts as to whether the application for the removal of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, transmitted to this House via the Spanish Supreme Court, was submitted in a proper and correct legal form.
The first question which I would like to put to you is this: why did you not consult this House's Legal Service about your doubts as to the application's legality or notify Parliament of your concerns?
In my opinion, the normal procedure in doubtful cases would be to consult this House's Legal Service, which, after all, is available to you in your capacity as President.
Secondly, you opted instead to consult the Spanish Embassy or Spain's EU representation about your doubts concerning the application's legality.
You apparently referred the matter back to Spain's representation.
So my second question to you is this: why did you allow more than seven months to elapse without demanding a response to your enquiry?
If I have understood the sequence of events correctly, you referred the matter to Spain's permanent representation in August 2000.
You apparently delayed until mid-February before requesting a response.
That is an awful lot of months!
Why did you wait so long, and what, in your view, were the reasons for the delay?
My third question is this: under the present circumstances, would you now be prepared to involve the relevant committee of this House - in this case, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which deals with the issue of immunity - and transfer the responsibility for this matter to that Committee, or do you intend to retain this competence yourself?
Thank you very much.
I look forward to your response.
