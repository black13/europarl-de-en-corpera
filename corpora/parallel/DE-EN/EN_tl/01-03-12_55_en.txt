Madam President, I just wanted to say to Mr Swoboda that he sometimes finds it difficult to decide whether he is speaking here as the Vice-Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, as a Viennese politician, or as a former Viennese politician.
I sometimes get the impression that his statements have more to do with the fact that there are local elections in Vienna on 25 March.
