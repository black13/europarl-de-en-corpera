Madam President, I just wanted to make a brief comment on Mr Schulz's remark about equal treatment.
I am one of the three permanent rapporteurs on immunity issues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
All I can say is that we genuinely do treat everyone equally.
I also believe that your own approach in the Berlusconi/Dell'Utri cases is simply an expression of equal treatment.
I, myself, am working on a specific case in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in which we have been requesting a statement from the German authorities for nine months and have still not received a reply.
In other words, these processes are quite normal; they are certainly not unusual.
I fully support your approach towards these two immunity cases.
I genuinely believe that the treatment of immunity is not a suitable theme for political discussion in the House.
It is a legal, not a political issue.
That is an important distinction which should be taken into account in the debate, and I am most grateful to you for your approach.
