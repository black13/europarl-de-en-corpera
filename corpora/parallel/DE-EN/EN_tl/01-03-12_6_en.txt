Madam President, I refer to the speech by Mr Manuel Medina Ortega during the last part-session, and would ask you to consider the following request.
Since Mr Medina Ortega's speech concerning the application for the removal of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, a number of reports have appeared in the press, and rumours are rife in this House.
As the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we believe that it would be helpful if you, Madam President, put an end to these rumours by granting the request which I wish to put to you - although I realise that you are under no obligation to do so - namely to permit me to address three brief and very precise questions on this issue to you.
The Members of this House trust that your answers will clarify the matter.
Madam President, I believe that this would serve the interests of the House itself and also the performance of your office.
I would therefore be most grateful if you would perhaps grant my request - and, I repeat, you are not obliged to do so - in view of the political sensitivity of this matter.
