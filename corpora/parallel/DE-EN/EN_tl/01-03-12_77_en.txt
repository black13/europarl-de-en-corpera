Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we should focus on what the report actually says, for I think that substantial parts of it still show the hand of Mrs Isler Béguin.
I welcome that, and I would also like to thank the Committee Chairman who finished the work.
No one would dispute that nuclear energy and the transport of nuclear waste fall within the competencies of the Member States.
Of course, if agreements have been concluded, they must also be adhered to, especially as far as transport is concerned.
Transporting radioactive material is not a risk-free business, as the report points out.
So I think that what the report says is important: firstly, the safety of people and the environment must have absolute priority; secondly, full information must be provided to the local authorities and community.
Many people in Germany, in particular, are worried at present; they are upset about what lies ahead.
Being able to voice their opinion and take part in demonstrations is part of that.
We are united in our condemnation of violence against people and property, because it is counterproductive.
For our part, let me say this: the proposal put forward in Germany by a politician by the name of Möllemann to carry out the Castor transports by airship must also be rejected.
It would certainly be impossible to comply with safety requirements and would merely make the transport of radioactive waste even more hazardous.
Mrs Isler Béguin, you and I would probably phase out nuclear energy tomorrow, but we do not make up the majority in the world, or in this society.
So we should concentrate on this communication so that in the immediate future, the transport of radioactive waste is as safe as possible.
If we have then achieved what the German Government has set out to do, namely to agree on and complete the phasing-out of nuclear energy, the two of us might have attained our goal in a few years' time.
