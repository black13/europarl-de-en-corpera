Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, world trade is becoming increasingly significant.
With the new communications technologies, it is possible, with a click on the computer, to conclude contracts worldwide or enter into legal transactions within a very short period of time.
So it is important, that in Europe, we give far more priority to the WTO negotiations in future, and discuss the fine detail to a greater extent as well.
In my view, the European Parliament has carried out very significant preparatory work in this area, but we should also give careful thought to the structure of our economy.
In Europe at present, we have around 16 million SMEs with a workforce of less than 250 persons; these SMEs generate 60% of GNP and provide 60% of jobs.
So the WTO negotiations are extremely important for SMEs in particular.
I believe that special priority should be given to the protection of intellectual property and the enforcement of protected rights.
Here, a key task is to examine how we should define the level of inventiveness for patents, for example.
Some countries require a very low level of inventiveness and, therefore, grant a great many patents very quickly.
Other countries in Europe are very strict, and start off by making checks worldwide to establish whether the level of inventiveness is adequate.
That is why it is necessary, in my view, to have this debate.
In this context, industrial applicability - which is also a condition of patentability - should quite obviously be discussed at the WTO negotiations as well, so that we can ensure that disputes in this area are avoided.
I also believe that the precautionary principle is very important for our future.
It is also important, however, to make product safety a priority for SMEs, and ensure that with third-party certification, de facto exemption from liability can be achieved.
