Mr President, the World Trade Organisation is a tremendous economic success story.
It has been such a success that our citizens are often rather alarmed by it, and suspect that it is rather sinister.
So it is the task of the European Parliament, in particular, to instil confidence in the positive and sustainable nature of the WTO process.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, therefore, I greatly welcome the fact that Mr Schwaiger's report has again included safeguarding cultural diversity in the catalogue of demands.
Our objective must be to explain to people, in credible, informed and comprehensible terms, that this process to which we are committed has the vision to achieve four goals on the basis of sustainable development: lasting economic growth for all, the protection of our environment, compliance with appropriate social standards and the preservation of cultural diversity.
As the European Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, we should continue to promote this approach beyond the Union's borders as well.
Mr Schwaiger's report provides a fresh and very sound basis on which to proceed.
