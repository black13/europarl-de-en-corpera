Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur very warmly on his report.
I am a passionate supporter of the WTO, as he is, because I believe that it offers poor countries the opportunity to integrate with wealthy nations.
As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I am also most grateful to Mr Schwaiger for taking the view that consumer protection, animal welfare and health are very important issues which we will deal with as priorities at a later date.
If we fail to do so, we can expect to witness situations such as the Seattle débâcle time and time again.
In advance of this debate, however, I should like to raise two specific issues.
I think that it is appalling for the WTO to impose or consider imposing sanctions on the European Union simply because the European Union is trying to protect its citizens from hormone-treated meat.
We now have scientific proof that one hormone in particular is carcinogenic, while there is a strong possibility that a further five are also carcinogens.
The precautionary principle must apply to the WTO as well.
Secondly, in the European Union, a number of states - notably Great Britain and Austria - have banned animal testing of cosmetics.
The majority of citizens and consumers in the EU want to see this ban extended throughout the European Union.
I think that the WTO will have to accept that it is possible to be very successful economically yet remain sensitive to the pain and suffering of God's creatures - animals - and that we must respect animals as well.
