Mr President, Commissioner, there are always advantages and disadvantages in being the last speaker to make a quick point in a debate.
First of all, I should like to briefly mention one issue which you may be able to respond to directly.
What is the situation with regard to the operating agreement?
Even if it is not yet in force, it is clear that it is potentially explosive, especially for the future of all that we have been discussing.
Is a review planned, and what form can and will this take?
That is my first question.
The second really follows on from everything we have been discussing here.
My main concern is how acceptance of the negotiating process can be achieved in light of the current overall political situation.
What is the Commission planning to do?
What are the options for the European Union?
There is a great deal of cause for concern.
The WTO is what it is.
But what it lacks, above all - especially in terms of achieving acceptance - is transparency in almost every policy area.
The demands which we have put forward in paragraphs 30 to 40 of the report point in the right direction.
As ever, all that is lacking is the will to implement them.
This lack of transparency leads to a great many overly-dramatic, interest-led articles in the press, such as the one I read at the weekend in the Financial Times, which attacks the WTO's public image.
Of course, the venue for the WTO Round - or the Ministerial meeting first of all - is not the best choice in terms of image.
What does the Commission think it can do, in terms of a general information campaign, to bring about change?
And are you considering more specific initiatives to enable developing countries to participate in the decision-making process, e.g. by covering their legal costs and taking other similar measures which could be arranged on a bilateral basis?
