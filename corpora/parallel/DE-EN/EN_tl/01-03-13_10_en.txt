Mr President, while I may not see any other option at the moment either, I would nevertheless like to protest against the fact that Question Time increasingly seems to be regarded as fair game, so to speak, when it comes to scheduling.
In other words, every time there is a bottleneck, Question Time is cut short.
I do not think this is right, as Question Time is safeguarded in the Treaties.
It is a fundamental parliamentary right.
I think it is ridiculous that we always cut corners in this area.
Members submit their questions within the time stipulated and have a right to receive answers to those questions.
(Parliament approved the amendment to the agenda)
