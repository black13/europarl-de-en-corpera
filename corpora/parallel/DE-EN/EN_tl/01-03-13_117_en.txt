It is not so very unusual for a report to be changed so much through amendments that the rapporteur finds it is no longer true to his basic intentions and accordingly stands down.
However, what is hard to grasp politically in this case is the way this has happened.
If groups abandon jointly negotiated compromise proposals literally overnight and suddenly put in writing the opposite of their original statements, then that casts some doubt on the very seriousness of this procedure.
My group is, of course, aware that a report on the transportation of radioactive materials is not a report on nuclear power as such, but the best way to maximise safety would be if there were nothing to transport.
So in this context we are bound to mention keeping output and the reprocessing of nuclear fuel rods to a minimum.
The fact that only 5% or around 75 000 consignments are involved in the nuclear fuel cycle says something not only about the scale of the potential risk, but also about the nature of it.
We regard it as incomprehensible that a proposal for a legislative initiative on uniform standards for transporting radioactive materials within the European Union and at its borders, whilst observing the principle of subsidiarity, should be rejected.
Nor can we understand why stricter checks on compliance with legislation on the transportation of dangerous goods should be unacceptable.
Likewise, we believe that too little attention has been devoted to the issue of exposure thresholds.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the report in the form we have before us.
