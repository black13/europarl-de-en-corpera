Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for all the effort she has put into these negotiations.
I have two short questions.
The first is, over what period is the training compensation system going to be worked out and the code of conduct developed?
I ask because I believe it is very important to have a set schedule and a set time frame here.
My other question is about the transfer fee level, which is still unlimited.
So the question arises of how the solidarity fund will work, if it is really going to benefit the very smallest clubs.
You mentioned 5% of the transfer fee, which would then be shared out.
However, the key question is how this amount will be distributed and if it will then really benefit the clubs on the bottom rung of the ladder.
