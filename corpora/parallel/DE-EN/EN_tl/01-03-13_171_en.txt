Mr President, the increasing frequency of fraud offences within the Union and the Commission's behaviour are a scandal.
The financial losses associated with adulterated butter alone could exceed EUR 45 million.
What is more, it is evident that we are dealing with people who are repeating the same offence.
On the Commission's recommendation, one firm, which is now again under suspicion, was let off a EUR 17.6 million fine.
We must therefore, as a matter of urgency, give our full backing to the work of the European Anti-Fraud Office and ensure that it is properly set up as soon as possible.
However, it is also important for the authorities in the Member States to support the work of this new body, but if you look at the reports in detail, you cannot always be sure this is happening.
So sanctions should also be taken against those Member States which are not supporting OLAF's work, in the form of fines imposed by the Commission, which would also provide some financial compensation for fraud offences allowed to occur.
