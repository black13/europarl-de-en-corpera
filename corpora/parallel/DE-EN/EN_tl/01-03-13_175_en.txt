Mr President, if we create new bodies, then those bodies should be able to function efficiently.
In the EU, the institutions are located in different places and they are also subject to relocation.
That is why it makes sense to locate new institutions in places where they are geographically close to other EU institutions which they will have to cooperate very intensively with in the future.
Now, it seems to me that the European Public Prosecutor's Office will certainly have to cooperate with the European Court of Justice and that it should also have close contacts with the European Court of Auditors.
The same also applies to OLAF, which will have to work in very close cooperation with both the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors.
I therefore believe that these bodies should be located either completely or at least in part in Luxembourg, so as to ensure geographical proximity and also efficiency for these bodies.
