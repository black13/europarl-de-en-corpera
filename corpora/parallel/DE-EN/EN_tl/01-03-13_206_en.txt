Mr President, annexed to the package of measures we presented a fiche financi√®re, which shows quite clearly the items of expenditure that will be incurred and how we intend to finance them.
In this respect, the funding is guaranteed from our point of view.
We expect to remain below the limit agreed in Berlin for the 2002 budget too, especially in view of the development in the euro/dollar exchange rate, which was not foreseen in Berlin, and because our export trade, especially in wheat, is continuing to flourish, while expenditure has been lower than anticipated in some other areas.
This means that we are able to take up the slack that has developed in these areas in order to help the pressurised cattle farmers while still operating within the ceilings that were adopted in Berlin.
