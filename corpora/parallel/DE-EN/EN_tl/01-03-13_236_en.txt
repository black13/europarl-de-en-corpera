May I assure the honourable Member that the Commission does not underestimate this in any way - quite the reverse.
The Commission does not have the information that the honourable Member clearly possesses.
Only a few days ago, I had extensive talks with the Turkish Foreign Minister, and he did not mention this plan, of which you have evidently read or heard somewhere.
Nor have I heard from any other member of the Turkish Government that an annexation of northern Cyprus is planned.
I am not aware of any such plans.
If it were to happen, it would be a breach of international law and would have the appropriate consequences.
I have frequently made public pronouncements to that effect, and I am saying it again here.
You asked what happens next.
First of all, we shall continue the negotiations with Cyprus with no loss of momentum.
It is an important principle that our accession negotiations with Cyprus should not suffer because the political conflict has not yet been resolved.
At the same time, as I said, we are supporting the peace process with all the resources at our disposal, and we assume that the two processes - the peace process and the enlargement process - will support and reinforce each other.
At the moment, as you know, the peace talks have stalled.
But without betraying any secrets, I can tell you that very strenuous efforts are being made in many parts of the world, in many capitals, to get these talks moving again.
Let me take the opportunity presented by your question to appeal earnestly to the representatives of the Turkish community in Cyprus to return to the negotiating table and to be prepared to contribute, through UN proposals, to a substantive and lasting settlement of the problem.
