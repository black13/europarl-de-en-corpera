Mr President, may I thank the honourable Member for making that point.
The position of Parliament on this question is no different to those of the Commission and the Council.
I have very frequently discussed this point with all those whom it concerns, but at my next meeting with the Turkish Government, which is only a few weeks away, I shall gladly take up your suggestion and raise the issue again.
I can certainly assure you that nothing will change our view that the continued occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops is an infringement of international law.
