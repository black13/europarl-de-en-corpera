Mr President, let me say to the honourable Member that the accession talks proceed from the principle that the candidate countries recognise the so-called acquis communautaire, the established body of Community law and practice, which is non-negotiable, and that they will apply it from the moment of their accession.
Transitional arrangements whereby the application of part of the acquis is postponed can only be authorised in properly substantiated cases.
In the strategy paper on enlargement which the Commission adopted on 8 November of last year and which President Prodi and I presented to Parliament on the same day, the Commission has laid down principles governing the treatment of requests for transitional arrangements.
The Member States have endorsed these principles, and they now form the basis of our work in this area.
They may be summarised as follows: transitional arrangements should not relate to the nature of the acquis but only to the postponement of its application for a fixed period; they must not cause any significant distortion of competition; they must include a clear implementation plan, including details of any necessary investments; in areas connected with the internal market, transitional arrangements must not be too numerous and must be of short duration.
Freedom of movement, freedom of establishment and free movement of capital are fundamental elements of the single market.
Under the agreed negotiating timetable, the European Union has undertaken to formulate a common position on this chapter by the end of June of this year, if the information provided by the candidate countries so permits.
Deliberations to that end, which include the examination of some requests for transitional arrangements, are currently taking place on the basis of the aforementioned principles.
This also applies to Poland and the Czech Republic, and may I add that one element of our negotiating mandate is that proposals for transitional arrangements can also be made by the Commission if such arrangements are in the interests of the entire Union.
