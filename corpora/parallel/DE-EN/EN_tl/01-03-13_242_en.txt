Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, I believe transitional phases should be as few, as short and as flexible as possible, and in that respect I very much welcome your reply.
However, I should still like to ask you about two specific points.
Firstly, do you consider it conceivable that there might be no transitional phases at all for these two countries in the three areas in question?
Secondly, may I ask whether you find it conceivable that, if there are such transitional phases, one side' s temporary derogation from freedom of movement in respect of certain groups of people will be balanced by the other side' s derogation from freedom of establishment for particular groups of people?
