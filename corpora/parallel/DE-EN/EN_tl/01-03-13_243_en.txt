Mr President, I can answer the second part of the honourable Member' s question with a categorical no.
Not only do I regard such an arrangement as inconceivable; it would quite simply be non-negotiable as far as we are concerned.
We should resolutely resist any such attempt from the outset, but I have to say to you in all honesty that I cannot imagine that anyone at all would try to do something so utterly contrary to the spirit of the enlargement process.
What do I find conceivable?
I find it conceivable that we shall be able to define interests of both sides that need and merit protection in the three areas to which you referred and that, having defined these interests, we shall indeed arrive at a highly flexible, highly refined and highly specific system of transitional arrangements.
But at the present time I cannot make any precise predictions.
You know that the discussion process and the decision-making process on these issues have only just begun.
Our talks are still in their infancy.
I do expect, however, that it will only take three or four weeks until the first decisions emerge.
