Let me say to the honourable Member that the Europe Agreements are in force with all these countries, and these agreements allow all Member States and applicant States to conclude bilateral arrangements on freedom of movement.
The Member States, however, have made very minimal use of this facility - if I am correctly informed, only Austria and Germany have done so - which compels me to conclude that there has never been a compelling need to conclude such arrangements.
Since the Europe Agreements are still in force, governments are naturally free to go on concluding bilateral accords.
