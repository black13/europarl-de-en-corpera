Mr President, Commissioner, I only wanted to ask a supplementary question regarding the extent to which the Euroregions are incorporated into your strategy and the extent to which the candidate countries themselves will receive funding to enable them to obtain information from us about their own situation, because I believe our task is not only to inform these countries but also to enable them to converge with us.
I believe there are projects such as the planned Europa Centre at As in the Czech Republic and many others.
I wanted to ask whether this sort of thing is included in your plans.
