My reply to the honourable Member is yes - the Euroregions are naturally included.
Indeed, they are an absolutely essential component, because we already have very close-woven information and communication networks at our disposal there.
I do not believe it would be wise for the Commission to provide the applicant States with money for their own public-relations activities.
I must say quite plainly here that I believe this would mean overstepping boundaries that we should not overstep, particularly in terms of interference.
This money is political money; its use is a very sensitive issue.
No country should accept funds from an external source if they are granted for purposes of information or public relations.
The candidates have never asked us for funds for this purpose, but you know that they do engage nonetheless in these activities.
