Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the Commissioner for her commitment in this area and to thank her for that.
She has tackled this issue with an enormous amount of dedication and enthusiasm.
But unfortunately, the perception of the Luxembourg people is not shared throughout the Union, and there is still a great deal to do in this respect.
That is why I was particularly disappointed that it was not possible at the Nice Summit to bring this matter into the realm of majority voting.
We must resolve the various minority situations before they develop into problems.
We need a preventive strategy.
We have 60 minority situations in the European Union today.
In the continent as a whole there are a total of 300.
Even though the unanimity principle continues to apply, making certain policies difficult to pursue, perhaps a way could be found by means of structural support.
Could I ask the Commissioner for her opinion on such an approach?
