Mr President, I have no wish to punish anyone, so I shall come to the point fairly quickly.
It is true that the European Union has finally overcome its reluctance to introduce European rules on combustion plants.
The importance of these European rules lies very simply in the fact that we have a liberalised electricity market in the European Community, and it goes without saying that, in this liberalised market, standards for atmospheric pollution and the like should be comparable throughout Europe.
The Commission has therefore reacted properly by focusing primarily on the old plants, for which there have regrettably been no rules since 1987 and which, to put it bluntly, have caused quite heavy pollution throughout Europe.
I fully support the Commission' s activity in this area.
I warmly welcome it, and I believe it represents a step in the right direction.
Of course there is room for argument about whether particular exceptional arrangements can be extended for a year or two in the case of small power plants.
That would not have posed us any problems in our quest for a compromise.
The great pity is that we have not arrived at such a compromise.
The approach is right.
And anyone who thinks - and I wish to say this in spite of all the anger that has been voiced here - that environmental policies are a national responsibility is quite wrong, because most of the pollution emitted by these power stations ends up in the territory of our partners in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway.
I believe we are jointly and severally bound to find an answer.
I believe we have found that answer and that we have also found ways of ensuring that special arrangements can be made for small plants for the next few years.
I believe the rapporteur has presented a good report.
We should continue along this path.
