Mr President, it is right that we should consider another aspect of this communication, namely the fact that the planned 18% saving would also be a gigantic boost to the European economy.
An energy saving of 18% is equivalent to a drop in energy consumption of 1 900 terawatt/hours.
That represents a saving of EUR 124 billion, which could be used to enhance the economic potential of the regions within the European Union.
If we extrapolate from these figures, we find that consistent implementation of this programme could create about a million jobs in the European Union.
The second issue is the protection of resources.
We must be aware that 90% of the oil that is extracted today was found more than 20 years ago; in other words, it comes from sources that are more than 20 years old.
Only 10% of the oil that is being extracted today was discovered in the last 20 years.
Once again, I cannot fail to mention here that the procurement of oil is inextricably linked with the use of military power.
We see that in the Middle East, we see it in the Caucasus, and we see it in Africa.
The most important things in this context are to create awareness and to develop intelligent models for the use of combined heat and power, judiciously funded contracting models.
If we are serious about this, it is essential that the aims which are formulated here be given binding force.
Otherwise our work will merely have been a statistical exercise and an inefficient use of our own energy.
It is imperative that we remove the fiscal, bureaucratic and financial barriers.
