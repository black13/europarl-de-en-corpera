Mr President, Commissioner, as we speak about energy efficiency today, we naturally think primarily of the security of energy supplies, and security of supply is undoubtedly an issue that is very high on the agenda of the European Union.
For that reason we wish to aim for a reduction in energy intensity.
The political objective for us at the present time is a 2.5% reduction.
It goes without saying that the widely divergent starting points of the 15 Member States must be taken into account when such targets are set.
That is precisely why we believe that this target must be binding, and the process should begin in that country where the level of energy efficiency is highest, the country most capable of effecting such an improvement.
We also believe that the share of combined heat and power generation in the energy market could be increased to 18% by 2010 and 25% by 2015, because that would also put electricity supply on a secure basis.
Cogeneration, of course, can be achieved with fossil fuels as well as with renewable forms of energy.
We are backing renewable energy in particular, and there are encouraging examples in this domain, such as pellet-fuelled heating, with which heat and power can be cogenerated very efficiently.
It is also important that the European Commission steps up its coordination effort in this area.
Coordinating European initiatives is a highly demanding task, if we think of programmes such as SAVE, Altener or the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Energy.
Many programmes are available, but the important thing is to ensure that they are carefully targeted.
My last point concerns public tendering and centralised procurement.
Special consideration should be given in these contexts to small and medium-sized companies; to that end, the cost of new appliances and systems should be calculated on the basis of their entire life expectancy, including the price of total energy consumption over that period in addition to the purchase price.
