Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which really addresses the problem, and to thank him for it.
Austria has always played an important part when it comes to receiving refugees and displaced persons, and has also contributed more than its fair share to solving the resultant problems.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Nassauer for adding to what the rapporteur has said in this respect.
However, it is high time a satisfactory pan-European solution was found to this problem.
It is not enough just to call for solidarity between all the Member States.
As regards reception of persons by the Member States, the Commission proposal only talks about Community solidarity, but this concept needs to be firmed up in the spirit of Article 63(2)(b) of the Treaty.
The purpose of the directive as described in Article 1 should also include the idea that displaced persons should be allocated to the Member States with due regard for their absorptive capacity.
However, the solidarity mechanism operating between the Member States should also cover both aspects, that is to say both the financial and personal aspects of solidarity.
