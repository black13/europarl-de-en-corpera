Mr President, I am the rapporteur who was in the same position last month.
But what I cannot understand right here and now is this: we have nailed our colours to the mast and made a decision.
What are the representatives of the Council in this Chamber here for, anyway?
They should at least tell us now how they stand in relation to this, before we carry on voting.
