Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Mr President, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejects the request of the Council for urgent procedure.
It is our opinion that we have time to write a proper report.
We will not delay with this report as there are agreements among the parliamentary groups that we will complete this report by May and put it to the vote in Parliament in May, so that there will be sufficient time to vote on this matter.
Another reason why we do not want an urgent procedure is because, as you know, in Nice we were not able to secure participation for the European Parliament in decision-making in the agricultural sphere.
If we agree to an urgent procedure now, we would relinquish the possibility of participating, as we would then be out of the picture altogether.
It is our opinion, however, that the Council is very divided on this issue and that the decisive proposals and decisive formulas for compromise must be found by the European Parliament.
I therefore ask that the request for urgent procedure be rejected.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
