Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Daul report calls for an extension of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector, and that is why I have rejected it.
The system has got nothing to do with the market, it is more like something from a planned economy, a combination of production quotas, minimum prices, import tariffs and export subsidies.
All in all, this is not something we should commend, it is something we should criticise, especially as it is downright expensive for the European taxpayer.
The Member States allocate specific regions and quotas to the sugar manufacturers and this sugar is then sold within a protected national market.
You have to bear in mind that 100 kg of white sugar cost EUR 28 on the world market and that the intervention price, the European Union's guaranteed price, is EUR 65.
This is too expensive and it is bad for EU consumers and sugar processors.
This is not a sustainable solution.
