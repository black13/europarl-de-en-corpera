Mr President, I think that is a good suggestion.
We discussed this yesterday.
We were fairly unanimous in the opinion that we should amend the original decision of the Conference of Presidents to bring it up to date.
When something is done for current reasons, then, of course, something else is bound to suffer as a result.
That is clear.
We do not gladly forgo Question Time, but if that is the only option, then I fully support it on behalf of my parliamentary group, too.
