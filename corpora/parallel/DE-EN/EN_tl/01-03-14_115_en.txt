Mr President, at least the European Union surpassed itself at the Lisbon Summit.
The Council decided to create the most dynamic economic area in the world.
That was a year ago.
Are we any closer to the plans?
We have certainly become more competitive, including in new technologies.
The Member States have started on numerous structural reforms.
Unemployment has been reduced to a large - but not by any means full - extent.
Unfortunately, adequate economic and social cohesion between the regions has still not been achieved.
What we expect of the Swedish Presidency is an initiative to develop intelligent instruments for investigating qualitative and quantitative progress.
Benchmarking and gender-specific statistics should give us information which needs to be evaluated every year.
What we certainly do not need is to adopt the Swedish social model for Europe.
What we need are real measures to increase employability and ensure that the younger members of the workforce, women wishing to return to work and the long-term employed are better qualified.
The socially disadvantaged must be better integrated into working life and discrimination in employment and the workplace must be nipped in the bud.
Just how important it is to stop excluding older employees is something which you felt deserved a mention here today, Mr President of the Commission.
We must work and act across the generational divide and we must convince young people that it is worthwhile working together with older people on this project, so that we can create social insurance systems which are fundable, meaning that balanced budgets are needed in the Member States.
All this presupposes the full support of the social partners.
Anne Van Lancker is right, however; we also need agreements between them and NGOs, the representatives of civil society and, of course, the European Parliament.
