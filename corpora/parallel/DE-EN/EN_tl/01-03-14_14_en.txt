Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, as you know, many of my fellow Members are critical of the Nice Treaty.
My group - and I personally - are also deeply concerned about the future of the Union, because numerous issues which determine the daily concerns and needs of the people are still unresolved or have only been tackled half-heartedly.
More importantly, we are still a long way from a social Europe.
Nice - I am convinced and many of my fellow Members obviously share this view - has weakened the Community.
In the final analysis, the governments simply fought to maintain their national right of veto.
More democracy, greater transparency, a greater ability to act and take decisions - all were left out of the Treaty, which is why the follow-up to Nice must tackle a programme of ambitious and truly far-reaching reform with a twofold purpose.
First, it must not reverse the progress already made towards integration.
I specifically share the concern expressed by Commissioner Barnier in this regard.
Secondly, we need reforms which make the Union truly viable for the future.
In my view, this means introducing a quasi-constitutional process, as a result of which a unified Europe is established by the will of its people.
It means holding a broad, public, open debate.
But it also means, in my view, that the Intergovernmental Conference is no longer the right method for taking Europe forward.
We need a different method.
As a member of the convention working on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, having experienced its success first hand, I expressly recommend the convention method as the right way for us to work together and take Europe forward.
