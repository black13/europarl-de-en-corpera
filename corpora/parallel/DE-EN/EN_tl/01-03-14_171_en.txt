Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the crisis in European farming is already bad enough, thanks to BSE.
Foot-and-mouth - because it is such a highly infectious disease - is the last straw.
It is hardly surprising that farmers - but not only farmers - are calling for rigorous action to be taken and, with your permission, I should like to ask a few questions about this.
First: do you know the exact extent of the epidemic at the latest count?
Secondly: farmers are anxious to know if the foot-and-mouth vaccination has been abolished once and for all.
What are you thinking of doing here, given the current circumstances, for stock in general and for particularly valuable animals, such as animals on stud farms?
Thirdly: transportation is once again centre stage.
Is the transportation of animals and meat within the European Parliament being jointly controlled?
And if so, how?
What sanctions are to be applied in the event of infringement?
Fourthly: all imports of animals and animal products into the Community are a source of concern.
Argentina can supply what customers want: beef which is guaranteed free from BSE.
That is something at least.
But, as you said, they have foot-and-mouth disease.
What specific protection and what safety measures have you introduced here, Commissioner?
And fifthly: my last point - and it is an important point - concerns the cost of foot-and-mouth.
Who pays what and what funds do you think the EU should provide?
Is the Commission willing to learn from experience with the BSE crisis and act now, rather than just react as and when it has to in order to contain the foot-and-mouth epidemic?
For me this means that the Commission itself should take action as well as coordinating national measures.
