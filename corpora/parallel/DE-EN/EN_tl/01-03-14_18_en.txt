Madam President, may I begin by welcoming the highly ambitious programme of the Swedish Presidency.
A great deal has already been said and written about the follow-up to Nice.
I was delighted just now to hear many of my own thoughts voiced here today.
But there is another aspect of all this which I should like to highlight today.
During the course of the first debate on the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro working paper in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, one of the requests made was for the historical introduction in the first part of the report to be angled not from the point of view of the Council' s victories or the Commission' s victories, but from the point of view of Parliament' s defeats.
I can understand, with the impression made by Nice and the power games played out there, why one side or the other is tempted to resort to aggressive or belligerent words.
Surely there can be no victory or defeat for one institution over another; surely there can only be progress or retrogression with regard to the overall concept, i.e. the concept of Europe, and we should not lose sight of that.
I therefore feel that, as parliamentarians, we should stop using this sort of vocabulary; avoiding it will send out a message of cooperation between the institutions.
