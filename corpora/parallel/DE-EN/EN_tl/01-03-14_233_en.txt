Mr President, Commissioner, you have referred to numerous possibilities and impossibilities.
As rapporteur and committee chair, I should like to revert to the question which you did not answer and which is of crucial importance to our committee.
I refer to the callback right.
No one wants to change the Treaty just now.
The point is, can we find a solution within the framework of the 1999 comitology decision?
Why not supplement Article 6 and give Parliament a guarantee which secures its callback right, Commissioner, if the Commission or the other institutions do not act as the European Parliament would wish?
I think that this would show willing on the part of the institutions and would prove that we live in a European democracy.
