Mr President, it is true that the European economy appears to have grown quite solidly over recent years.
The main reason is the boost in exports to the US dollar area as a result of the current economic climate there and the weak euro.
So the basic principle reads: a weak euro is good for an export-oriented economy and hence good for Europe.
It is true that, at over 2%, the rate of inflation in Europe does not meet the stability criteria for the introduction of the euro, mainly as a result of higher oil prices, which are traded in dollars.
So then the basic principle reads: a weak euro is bad for the European economy.
This illustrates the absurdity of reducing economic policy measures to fiscal policy.
It is true that the number of unemployed has fallen over recent years.
But it is also true that unemployment in Objective 1 regions has not fallen, because they do not tend to have an export-oriented economy.
So we have no convergence, just continuing divergence, i.e. a deepening social divide.
It is true that investments have increased over recent years.
But it is also true that most were rationalisation and non-expansion investments and that public investment in infrastructure has fallen.
What has all this to do with a forward-looking economic policy?
The report does not contain a single proposal on strengthening domestic demand, on the specific issue of small and medium-sized enterprises, on strengthening regional economic cycles, on European tax harmonisation, on implementing the Lisbon employment summit, mentioning instead simply liberalisation, privatisation, falling social standards and the abolition of public-funded health and pension funds.
The von Wogau report must be rejected.
