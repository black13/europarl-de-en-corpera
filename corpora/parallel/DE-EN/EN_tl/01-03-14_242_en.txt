Mr President, the European economy is still doing well.
But we must admit that we did in fact expect more.
Less pleasing is the fact that the inflation rate has again crossed the 2% threshold and investments have fallen from 5.3% to 4.9% of Gross Domestic Product.
We must therefore continue to ensure that priority European objectives - promoting small and medium-sized businesses, cutting red tape, reducing overly high tax rates - are implemented consistently.
But we must also back and reform our education systems so that the lack of expertise threatening us does not in fact become a reality.
Finally, the only economic development which can be described as a success is one which manages to reduce the excessively high unemployment rate in Europe.
