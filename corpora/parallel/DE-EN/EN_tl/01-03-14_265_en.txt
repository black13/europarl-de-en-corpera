Mr President, when we talk of the strategy on Ukraine, the question of the finality of the EU resonates in the background and hence the question of whether or not Ukraine, as an important European country, has a chance of one day becoming a member of the European Union.
There are two ways of looking at this.
Either we say no, economic and trade agreements suffice, in which case the EU will only be able to make a minor contribution to stability and will be unable to apply its strict criteria.
Or we give Ukraine the long-term prospect of membership and immediately start applying a comprehensive stability strategy which, first and foremost, strengthens democracy and then leads to social and economic development.
But then Ukraine must not become the atomic dump of Europe!
