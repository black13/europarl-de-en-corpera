Mr President, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a most balanced report and then, if I may, I should like to comment on a strategic point which particularly concerns me.
Following the political upheaval in central and eastern Europe, association agreements were concluded in a bid to help these countries one day become members of the European Community or Union.
Ukraine was not one of them.
The question of the borders of Europe, which reappeared on the agenda with the fall of the Iron Curtain, has never been seriously discussed here, and hence nor has the fate of Ukraine.
However, the answer to the question of the borders of Europe is that Europe does not end east of Bulgaria because that is where Ukraine lies, and not just Ukraine.
Europe' s borders cannot be determined unequivocally, which is why the complete enlargement of the European Union is a contradiction in terms.
The current enlargement concept will inevitably bring about new divisive borders in Europe, for example between Poland and Ukraine.
This is a huge problem, which is why we need a new concept.
Since 1989/90, Europe has no longer been politically or geographically divided; it has become an open continent.
What sort of concept do I mean?
The principle of exclusivity, whereby a candidate country is either fully assimilated into the EU or is completely excluded should be replaced by the following concept: any country which thinks of itself as either partly or wholly European, such as Ukraine, should be given the opportunity to decide if, and to what extent, it is willing and able to subscribe to European policy.
This would maintain the vision of the founding fathers of a free Europe in the dialectic sense and allow us to focus again on the crux of the matter, as formulated at the time, namely to create peace in freedom for all the nations of Europe.
