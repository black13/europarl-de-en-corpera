Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am all in favour, as the report says, of democratising the whole decision-making process in connection with the management of the Internet.
It is an important point but, unlike many of you, I am less concerned with EU location nationalism and more concerned with who can actually use Internet technology.
It is a new technology and it is only a good new technology if a lot of people can use it.
The digital divide mainly runs between north and south and this is a huge problem because in the south hardly anyone has access to the Internet.
This is why I think it is important for the EU to make a commitment to limit the north/south digital divide, for us perhaps to launch a programme for the purpose and, above all, for us to invest in public access, for example in schools and libraries.
Only then will as many people as possible be able to use the Internet in the south and only then shall we reach the point at which people can obtain information on their own initiative and develop their talents freely and without censorship, including on the Internet.
