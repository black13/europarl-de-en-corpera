Mr President, the report involuntarily illustrates the extent to which the EU is lagging behind on two counts which are of crucial importance in today' s world: one is a working democracy and the other is Internet practicalities.
While we sit here discussing these issues until the witching hour, the Americans have already organised special senate hearings to look into the problems in detail.
Even as an ICANN director, having been elected a few weeks ago, I am having trouble finding out exactly what ICANN does.
We simply do not take time to stop and think about it.
A few technical points have been addressed.
I completely fail to understand why this Commission does not publicly stand up for the fact that we have dot kids, we have dot sex, that we have detailed subdivisions which make everything we have discussed here possible, a clear division between e-commerce and the public sector.
The decisive move will be to cut ICANN free from this American domination, not because it is dangerous per se, but because the management of the Internet is at stake and you must do here what you normally only talk of, Commissioner, and create openness and transparency.
