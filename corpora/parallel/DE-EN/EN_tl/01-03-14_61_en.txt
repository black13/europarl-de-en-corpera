Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my point concerns the liberalisation of postal services, which you too referred to, Madam President-in-Office.
The postal services are one example of just how inefficient Council meetings are.
It was decided in Lisbon to speed up the liberalisation of postal services.
We adopted our position in the European Parliament before the end of the year, in the hope that the Council would adopt its common position by the end of the year.
What happened?
Not a thing!
The Council did not adopt a common position.
We should in fact admit to ourselves that the Council does not want to adopt a common position.
Germany has decided to extend the post office monopoly because everything has ground to a halt in Europe.
Madam President-in-Office, we call on you to ensure at the Stockholm Summit that the Heads of State and Government instruct their ministers to proceed with the liberalisation of postal services without delay.
Only this will prove that Council meetings make any sense or any headway.
And then you should pass a second resolution, Madam President-in-Office, stating that the Heads of State and Government must evaluate structural policy, post haste.
We must be in a position to reform structural policy in 2003 at the latest, for two reasons.
Firstly, because structural policy is extremely important to labour market policy in numerous countries and, secondly, because we have to tell candidate countries what to expect in the new period if they accede after 2005/2006.
In this respect, Madam President-in-Office, please make sure that the summit passes specific resolutions on the liberalisation of postal services and the evaluation of the structural funds so that we can make headway for the period after 2006.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention.
