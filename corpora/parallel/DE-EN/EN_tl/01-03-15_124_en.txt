Mr President, the clear language of the Zimbabwe resolution leaves no doubt that we hold President Mugabe personally responsible for conditions in that country.
Unfortunately, he is unwilling to listen to advice, whether it comes from his own country or from abroad, unless it is accompanied by concrete measures.
That is why we are urging the EU to suspend all cooperation directed through government channels.
It is also important to send Mr Mugabe the message that Europe no longer has a relevant political camp to act as his political sponsor.
But I would also like to hear the Commission and the Council speak the same clear language.
It is true that bilateral cooperation for development has been greatly scaled down, but I would ask the Council presidency to make the necessity of joint action clear to the Jospin Government in particular.
If France wants more influence in the region, it must back the forces of the future.
In this part of Africa civil society sometimes manages to overcome autocratic structures unaided, and then they remember who in Europe backed the wrong horse.
Please do not let us wait for everything to fall apart down there.
