Mr President, may I introduce a further thought?
The water framework directive will bring radical changes to Europe' s water industry.
But the directive is also an opportunity for a thorough rethink of our various national water industries and water legislation and for opening up new fields of business for national suppliers and undertakings.
Water offers industry tremendous opportunities to create more value added for all by opening up the markets.
Increased efficiency through new forms of cooperation between private industry and municipal suppliers in the planning, construction and operation of plants is the first essential step in that direction.
A second step must then be to increase value added through exports.
Know-how in particular, where some Member States already have a number of strong undertakings, offers the opportunity of increasing exports by paying more attention to canvassing foreign markets - but obviously exporting only to an ecologically acceptable extent.
Everyone would gain from that.
Municipalities and consumers would save on costs.
Producers would find new markets.
I believe everyone would gain from exporting water in the same way as other countries export their gold in the form of oil; we in Austria, for example, have white liquid gold in the form of water.
