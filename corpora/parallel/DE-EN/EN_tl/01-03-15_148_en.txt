Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this plenary week is the week of conflict prevention.
A lot of wise things have been said, but the most important action in this context is this EU initiative for the UN conference on the illicit trade in small arms.
We know that this very trade is a major reason for the aggravation of conflicts and that the innocent civilian population suffers the most casualties.
The positive thing about the EU proposal is that it involves both sides, users and producers, and that the EU is striving for more binding commitments.
This conference must be the first step towards stopping arms exports.
But there will have to be a permanent commission to check that it is enforced.
It would be good if the EU would not only call for this but be the first to enforce it in its own ranks.
