Mr President, I think we are agreed that water will be a key issue in the European Union this century.
We can also be sure that we are far from paying the subject the attention it deserves.
Of course it would be an illusion to think we can solve water problems by pumping water from areas of supposed surplus to areas where there is a shortage.
If we are saying that parts of Europe sometimes have floods and that the water could perhaps be more fairly distributed, we must bear in mind that those floods are themselves the outcome of mistakes in water management.
It is high time far greater attention was paid to local and regional water management.
Water problems must, as a rule, be solved where they arise, and there they must be dealt with within an acceptable financial framework.
The neglect of one potential source of water has been criminal: the conversion of salt water into industrial and process water.
The prospects in this sector are tremendous.
Complete liberalisation of water will result in it being used by industry in a way that will bring enormous ecological problems in the long term.
We must stop that before it happens.
