Mr President, I know that speaking times can never be planned precisely, but it has quite often been the case that we have had a break after the urgent debate, and now we have one again before the vote.
In this afternoon' s urgent debate our group, the largest in the House, had only 12 minutes to share out, apart from the minutes allowed to the proposers.
It was uncommonly difficult to accommodate everyone.
We had to disappoint a large number of colleagues.
In light of this experience, I would therefore ask that the groups in future be given a little more speaking time in urgent debates than is currently the case.
The present method of calculation is clearly not altogether realistic.
