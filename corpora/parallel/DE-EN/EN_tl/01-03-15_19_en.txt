Mr President, I am sure the Spanish project is a highly emotive issue in Spain and I can understand that.
But it is first and foremost, of course, something that must be decided in Spain itself.
Taking a longer view, however, I have to say that the south' s water supply is our concern too.
A question as important as this cannot be left to the Spanish alone.
I can quite imagine that in 10 or 20 years' time we shall have to be dealing with very different projects about which we dare not even think today.
But there is something else I should like to mention briefly, that is the growing willingness to privatise the water industry.
People are thinking about it, and I expect the Commission is too.
The Ministry of Economy in Berlin has now made a study of the pros and cons of these issues.
Personally, I would be very reluctant to privatise water.
I know that Great Britain already has experience of this, but it is at least a subject we should approach very cautiously.
It would raise problems with far-reaching constitutional consequences for our Member States.
To give just one small example, in Germany we have around 4 000 municipal water companies, in France 2 or 3 large companies.
When we go for privatisation, this means that the small undertakings are simply bought up.
That cannot be what such liberalisation is all about.
It is something we surely do not want.
I do not want to go into any more detail now, I have no time to do so, but I believe it is a subject we shall have to deal with more closely in the months or years ahead.
