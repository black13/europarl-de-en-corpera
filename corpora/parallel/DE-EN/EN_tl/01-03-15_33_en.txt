Mr President, Mr Purvis has done a good job as several speakers have already said.
I think it is a good report.
Imagine if we could understand how algae produce oxygen from sunlight.
Such things exist.
We could imitate it.
It would transform our energy industry completely.
To understand that, for example, is an enormous challenge.
Or look at a sea urchin' s spine under the microscope.
You get a fantastic picture of how new materials might be built.
To understand how that is made could dramatically change our industrial culture.
We will only understand it if we are curious enough to find out, if we approach new technology, new science with curiosity and not with fear.
That is John Purvis' message and I would like to endorse it.
Moreover, as regards developing countries I would like to point out that there is one developing country that has made enormous strides in biotechnology.
That is Cuba.
For 40 years, Cuba has been investing in biotechnology like hardly any other country and today has a turnover in modern biotechnology of well over USD 100 million.
I only want to mention that because other countries are named here.
Despite all the criticism that can be levelled at Cuba in other respects, I think that is a major achievement.
In the energy industry we have tended to go the way of conventional thermodynamics.
No living creature operates according to conventional thermodynamics, otherwise we would not live as long as we do.
Irreversible thermodynamics, small changes, will perhaps show us a completely new way forward in energy.
That is also something we need to understand.
Then what we have been doing hitherto will perhaps one day be seen as an aberration.
I think we should be showing a little more courage with this technology, paying attention to the risks of course, but there has never been any progress made without curiosity or courage, and the same applies for biotechnology.
