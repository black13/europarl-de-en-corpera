Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the gene technology industry has been promising us much for decades.
It is supposed to heal diseases, solve the problem of world hunger and create better people.
What have we seen in that time?
Many dangers have appeared, people have already died in experiments, hunger has not been wiped out and better human beings have not been created.
I think these problems are the result not of a technology but of the power structures prevailing in this society.
Firstly, there is twice as much food in the world as would be needed to feed everyone adequately.
It is a question of distribution.
Secondly, sickness is caused by environmental conditions, and these cannot be changed by technology but by changing the conditions.
Thirdly, we will only get a better human being if we allow more self-determination, if we allow people more freedom, but we will not do it simply by means of a new technology.
Biotechnology on the other hand creates more selection, has already resulted in a new form of genetic racism, and we must resist that with all our might.
This report puts all the power in the hands of the gene technology industry and we can therefore only reject it.
