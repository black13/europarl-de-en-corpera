Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make two comments on the Inglewood report.
Firstly, I welcome the Commission' s basic principle that legislation that has already been amended several times and no longer gives a clear and coherent picture should have to be codified.
In connection with my recently completed report on the pension funds directive, I also believe that simplification and consolidation of the life assurance directives is urgently required, because that will create clearer distinctions between the different activities and pillars.
It is possible that when the pensions fund directive is accepted, insurance companies that are active in the third pillar and therefore also subject to the life assurance directives will in future be subject to the pension funds directive for their company pensions business.
Since this likelihood will exist, it is important that what we are doing should be as clear, simple and transparent as possible.
The Inglewood report and the simplification and transparency it initiates are therefore a welcome contribution to making things easier for the citizen to understand and therefore a contribution to a living internal market.
