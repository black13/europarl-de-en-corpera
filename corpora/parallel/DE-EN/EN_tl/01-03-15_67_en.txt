Madam President, I believe we are in a very dramatic situation; on the one hand we have the nationalist policy of Mr Kostunica, and on the other, the very European, moderate attitude of the Macedonian Government that is doing magnificently well and deserves our full support.
But in between lies Kosovo, and we must at last make clear that a few extremists, extremists whose background is unclear, do not represent the Albanian people.
That is why elections must be held in Kosovo without delay in order to strengthen Mr Rugova' s position and make clear where the majority of Albanians stand and where the democratic forces stand.
That is missing from our resolution.
That is why I wanted to vote against our resolution.
I fear I voted wrongly and I would ask you to please correct that, and I would like to say clearly that this resolution is unbalanced because the crucial point, namely elections in Kosovo, is missing.
