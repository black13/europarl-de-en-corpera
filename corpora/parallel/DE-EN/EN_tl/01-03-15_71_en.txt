A month ago, the Lamfalussy Committee of Wise Men presented its final report on the regulation of the European securities markets.
Apart from the many advantages that an integrated internal market for securities would bring, the report also contains a proposal for reform of the legislative process in securities matters which I consider to be a major step in the right direction.
The present legislative process is much too long-winded and inflexible to be able to adapt to the much more rapidly changing securities markets.
We simply cannot always be lagging behind market trends while at the same time setting ourselves such ambitious targets as the one decided in Lisbon, of becoming the world' s largest and most dynamic economic area within ten years.
I agree with the broad outlines of the Lamfalussy Committee' s proposal, but I must insist on the 'call-back' mechanism proposed in Parliament' s resolution, which allows the European Parliament to call on the Commission to withdraw the proposals put before the Securities Committee concerning implementing measures in the event of a negative position being taken by itself or the Council.
The Commission would have to comply with such a request and put forward a legislative proposal as part of the codecision procedure.
But the most important thing in all the squabbling about power sharing between Council and Parliament is that we should not lose sight of the objective of an integrated European securities market.
We have set ourselves the year 2005 as a target date for an integrated internal market in financial services.
Time is ticking by and rival markets and economies are not asleep.
