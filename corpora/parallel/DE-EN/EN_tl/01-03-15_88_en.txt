Madam President, I voted against the report on biotechnology because it pays no attention to the fundamental interests and concerns of agriculture.
That does not mean that I am against innovative access to biotechnology in general, but agriculture requires special treatment and can in no way be compared to the situation in industry.
The questions of labelling, traceability and liability are of crucial importance for farmers.
Farmers have to buy products of impeccable quality such as seed for their production.
Farmers cannot assume any civil liability for any harm caused by genetically modified products.
There must be clear rules about this.
Since this House has not come out in favour of accepting the amendments tabled in the matter by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I could not vote in favour of the report.
The principle of case-by-case assessment must apply for agriculture.
An objective and comprehensive examination must weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of introducing genetically modified plants.
