Mr President, fair access to drugs to combat HIV and other diseases is, I believe, a very important issue.
If we consider that in South Africa 50% of new AIDS cases are young persons under the age of 25, that means that a 15 year-old in South Africa today has a 50% risk of infection, and if we consider the effects of that situation - that the most active section of the population is affected - on those young people and also on the country' s development, then I think it is long overdue that we say something on the subject and send a signal in the right direction.
We wish to encourage and create fair access to medicines and vaccines.
We therefore greatly welcome Commissioner Lamy' s position and that he will give his backing to the developing countries and their right to a protection clause in the WTO and TRIPS Agreements.
We must press for these life-saving drugs to be made available as cheaply as possible.
For Europe, this means supporting the transfer of technology and local production capacity.
If we are serious about global development, these are important demands and important steps that must be taken by Europe and all concerned.
