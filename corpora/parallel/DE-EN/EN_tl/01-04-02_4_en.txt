Madam President, I should briefly like to explain our request.
The reason for it is not that we have become more tolerant of the situation in Iran, but that difficult discussions and negotiations are being held in Iran itself at the present time with a view to improving the lot of a number of Iranian citizens who work in the German Embassy.
I do not believe that we should now disrupt this process which is taking place in Iran, perhaps by adopting a resolution.
We have firm views on the violations of human rights, but in this case - and, I would stress, at this particular time - I do not believe that we should either hold a debate or adopt a resolution.
