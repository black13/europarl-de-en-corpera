Mr President, Commissioner, of course I can agree with you, Mrs Müller, that we need to subject PVC to an integrated and comprehensive life-cycle analysis.
This will show that PVC windows and window frames, for example, or PVC water pipes are products which we want to use because of their characteristics.
The same is true of blood bags, for example.
Although this is a non-durable PVC product, it is the most suitable because of the product's properties.
However, contrary to you, I do think that, because of the dangerous characteristics of PVC, we really should ensure that we do all we can to prevent it from being disposed of in an uncontrolled manner.
In this respect we need to step up our efforts to introduce recycling - both mechanical recycling and melting for reuse - for all PVC products.
It is certainly possible to find a sensible recycling solution.
Here we need to show, however, much more determination and exert much more pressure so that true closed cycles develop.
To achieve this, Mrs Müller, we also need labelling, not so that the products are marked 'Danger PVC!' , but so that they can be collected separately and be properly recycled.
At the end of the day, alongside attempting to carry out a lifecycle analysis, this is about guaranteeing that people can use PVC.
That is why we need differentiated collection and distinctive labelling of PVC.
When making any decisions about the future of PVC we also need to guarantee that employees' representatives are involved.
We need to improve this aspect of the Green Paper a little more and ensure that the PVC strategy is also implemented in the applicant countries as soon as possible.
When Mr Sacconi was appointed rapporteur I knew that he would do an excellent job, and I was right.
