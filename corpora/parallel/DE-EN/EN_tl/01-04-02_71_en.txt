Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Green Paper before us has, in my opinion, served its purpose.
All of the stakeholders - the Commission, Parliament, the companies and associations - have held in-depth discussions in the last few months about the advantages and disadvantages of PVC as a material.
Industry's repeated request to exclude certain options from the process of reflection - such as, for example, substituting PVC with alternatives or finding replacements for the stabilisers cadmium and lead - must be refused.
In my opinion, in a Green Paper nothing must be off-limits and no possibilities must be ignored if we wish to have a sound basis for deciding on a comprehensive strategy.
Mr Sacconi's report remedies the deficiencies in the Green Paper in a balanced way.
Thus, it is not only the critical waste-related issues which are assessed, but the entire lifecycle of PVC and possible alternatives.
I also believe that it is important for the social dimension, the impact on jobs, to be integrated into the reflection process alongside the ecological and economic aspects.
Because of its long lifespan PVC certainly presents advantages in some products, but these are reduced by the stabilisers used.
Urgent efforts should therefore be made to find substitutes for these two toxic substances.
In addition the percentage of material recycled must be increased.
The debate about phthalates, which we have already had in connection with toys, must be urgently concluded with an independent scientific risk assessment.
I hope that the last outstanding report will be included in the assessment of soft PVC in the Green Paper.
Overall I think that if we make the right decision tomorrow we will have a good basis for a comprehensive PVC strategy.
