Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in making this proposal for a directive the Commission is pursuing one main objective.
This objective is to use pension funds to strengthen Europe's financial markets.
If it wanted to do this it would not need a directive at all, because all of the pension funds and financial markets are covered by the OGAF directive.
That is why it explicitly mentions occupational retirement provision, meaning the second pillar of the overall retirement provision strategy.
However, if we do mean occupational pensions then the financial markets have to be subordinate to the occupational pension schemes and not vice versa.
In this case we believe that we need to talk about a proper directive on occupational retirement provision and not only about a step or series of steps which may in 20 or 25 years' time perhaps lead to this.
I now turn to the issue of taxation.
I have no sympathy for you, Commissioner, when you say that you cannot say anything about the content of the actual communication because it has not yet been adopted.
You, yourself, announced several times that it would be ready in March, then the beginning of April and then there was talk of Easter.
So when is it going to arrive?
How can we be expected to work on the proposal for a directive and Mr Karas's report in the Committee if the tax issue is not included?
Unless the tax issue is addressed we will not, in my opinion, be able to put Mr Karas's report to the vote.
You are therefore required to table something.
You say that you have hopes of enforcing the Treaty rules which are already in place with the help of the European Parliament; my only objection is that you have already had the chance to do so many times in the past.
You did not need to wait, and you can always be sure of Parliament's support for uniform taxation rules.
For once the Commission also needs to start to show courage, courage against the Council of Ministers.
