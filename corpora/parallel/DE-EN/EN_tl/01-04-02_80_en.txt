Commissioner, I should like to ask one more question because we have had repeated problems with the timing of events: when exactly will the communication reach us?
The second point which is unclear is: how is a communication supposed to help to actually determine the basic taxation rules for the whole directive if you are not able to tell us the principles according to which a minimum of harmonisation, while avoiding tax discrimination or non-collection, will have to be regulated?
Even if you leave this to the Member States a contradiction still remains, namely: how can further progress be made and what then is the significance of the directive?
