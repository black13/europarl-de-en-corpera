Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude this debate, I should like to come back once again to a point of detail arising from the 1999 budget, which is now extended to 2000 and 2001 as well.
I am referring to the SYNERGY Programme.
This energy programme was discontinued in December 1999 by the new Director-General of DG Energy and Transport.
There is a difference of opinion over the Programme's minimum threshold.
The Director-General only wishes to approve programmes involving amounts of EUR 400 000 and above, whereas the Council's Energy Working Group has set a figure of EUR 200 000.
As a result of this dispute, the implementation of the SYNERGY Programme has now been blocked for a year and a half.
The whole situation is becoming farcical, for it even proved impossible to reach an agreement at Permanent Representative level and the issue actually ended up on the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' meeting on 9 April.
Indeed, we risk losing the funds for 2001, which would mean that we would not have implemented two-thirds of an energy budget-line.
This House should therefore call upon the Commission to take issue with the incredibly obdurate attitude of the new Director-General, Mr Lamoureux, and ensure that an amicable agreement is reached.
