Mr President, Commissioner, it is quite clear that no one can give serious consideration to a generalised vaccination programme at present, for one very good reason: the vaccine is not available in sufficient quantities.
I would also like to add that vaccination must not be used to cover up poor hygiene and disease prevention.
But it is also quite clear now that the first real test of the strength of the new FMD policy since the introduction of the internal market is about to end in disaster.
However, let me add a further point in all seriousness, Commissioner: international agreements - restrictions, even self-imposed restrictions through the IOE criteria - mean that no one in Europe, neither the Commission nor the other European institutions, can bear to continue the current policy.
The endless culling of herds is neither intelligent nor appropriate in the long term.
Indeed, it raises a number of issues concerning animal welfare, guaranteed property rights, and even the principle of proportionality, which is part of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.
So I welcome the fact that those affected are starting to clarify these issues at the highest judicial level.
So how do we proceed with a new strategy which will not find it easy to dispense with tried and tested methods of disease prevention?
This automatically raises a further question: what has the Commission done to implement the report by the Scientific Committee in March 1999 as regards the regionalisation negotiations at international level, the validation of testing, and the evaluation of the criteria determining when emergency vaccinations are necessary in "at risk" regions too?
A last word: the general abhorrence of vaccinations, both on a Europe- and worldwide level, must end.
And we will push for this with all our energy and determination.
