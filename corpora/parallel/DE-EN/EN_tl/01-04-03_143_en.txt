Mr President, Mr Byrne, I disagree with you on one key point, namely that we cannot yet discuss the measures to be adopted once the current crisis has been brought under control.
I take an entirely different view.
I am convinced that if you do not start talking about tomorrow and the future now, while all the Member States are trembling at the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, you will find that once everything has settled down, the Member States will all sit back and relax.
So now is the time for you to adopt a different course of action.
Now is the time, for example, to work actively with your colleague Mr Fischler to ensure that a follow-up system for sheep and pigs is introduced immediately, so that the premium payments are no longer coupled to specific transfer date provisions.
It would no longer be necessary to move the sheep and pigs all round the European Union to ensure they can be counted at the right place at the right time when the money is available.
But I also believe that you must finally take courage and throw a stone into the water.
Why do you not say: live transports are banned?
Every live transport must be granted an exemption.
Why can animals not be transported after slaughter?
Try it and see.
Why do you not announce here and now that we need a different policy on disease?
Sit down with the IOE in Paris and say: the international policy on animal diseases needs to be changed right away, together with all the other relevant partners in the IOE.
And finally: tell us, what have you got against giraffes?
Many people have asked me that question: what has the Commissioner got against giraffes?
Why is he stopping the safari parks from vaccinating to prevent disease?
Why is he making all the safari parks close down, or putting the fear of whatever disease into the zoos throughout the European Union, because we failed to pursue a decent disease prevention policy and all the animals suddenly have to be culled?
So tell us, Mr Byrne: please tell us, what have you got against giraffes?
Please be so kind, take the measures today.
Be more courageous today, do not wait until tomorrow.
