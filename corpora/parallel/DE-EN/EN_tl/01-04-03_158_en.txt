Mr President, Commissioner, in 1991, I joined with other colleagues in this House to vote against the abolition of vaccination at that time.
I believe that against the background of enlargement, we will be forced to rethink the situation.
Last week, 4000 animals were culled as a preventive measure in my region, after piglets had arrived there from quarantine areas in Holland.
Since 2 p.m. today, foot-and-mouth disease may also have reached Germany and my home region of MÃ¼nsterland near the Dutch border.
If the cases are confirmed, Commissioner, the disease will have broken out in a region which is widely regarded as the "meat belt" of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The EU's "no vaccination" policy has always been justified in terms of exports to third countries.
So my question is this, Mr Byrne: is it not clear that this policy really has failed?
What does Europe gain, in financial terms, from these exports, and what is the epidemic costing Europe?
The Commission should put these figures on the table for the Council.
I called for this two weeks ago in the Committee on Agriculture.
Put the figures on the table, and do it quickly.
Then the Council can decide, and the Council can take responsibility for its policies.
The European Parliament will undoubtedly set out its views on this issue in its resolution tomorrow.
I am in favour of emergency 'ring' and suppressive vaccinations, and I say: let us do it right away.
I believe that the current situation is putting untold emotional and psychological strain on farmers.
What about Europe's moral responsibility for its policies?
Please, Commissioner, answer the questions we have asked.
Please do not just read your prepared text because otherwise this whole discussion will be a waste of time.
Thank you.
