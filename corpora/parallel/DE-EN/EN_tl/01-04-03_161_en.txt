Mr President, without wishing to impede the progress of the debate, but in view of the last comments, I would ask the Commission very sincerely to provide an overview at the next Committee meeting of the internal and external activities which it has undertaken in order to embed the recommendation of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare of 10 March 1999 both in the Commission's policies and at international level.
I would be grateful if we could receive a comprehensive report at the next Committee meeting.
