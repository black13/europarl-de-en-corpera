Mr President, Commissioner, I have two brief questions.
Firstly, 9 May is also supposed to convince young people in the European Union that their future lies in Euroland.
What are you doing, what is the Commission doing, and what are you arranging with the Member States so that a Euro project day takes place in every school before the end of this year?
Do you plan to launch a specific initiative here?
Secondly,what measures can be taken to help boost consumer confidence and ensure that in terms of consumer protection, there are no grounds to fear price distortions during conversion and a lack of transparency in price calculation?
Thirdly, do you intend to continue the Euro information campaign with the Member States at least during the first half of next year, and if so, in what form?
