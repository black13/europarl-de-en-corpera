Mr President, Commissioner, my question is this: the need for this information campaign is certainly not limited to the twelve future euro countries.
In Central and Eastern Europe, in particular, there are billions in circulation, especially in Deutschmarks, and in parts of the Balkans, the Deutschmark is the local currency, either officially or de facto.
The people there will then suddenly be confronted with the euro from one day to the next as well.
So my question is: How do you intend to provide information in these countries?
Are you working with their national banks?
Should they perhaps operate as issuing offices as well?
How do you propose to prevent racketeers from cheating people with their own particular forms of currency exchange?
I think there is a significant need for action in this area.
