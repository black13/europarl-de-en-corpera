Mr President, my question relates to the Green Paper "Towards fair and efficient pricing in transport".
As harmful emissions are a key measure of how transport and mobility should be regulated in future, are there any plans to consider, in the research field, carrying out cost-benefit analyses in order to determine the areas of transport in which low-emission or zero-emission options would be of greatest benefit?
