Mr President, as budget year 2002 is very important - one might even say incredibly important - because of enlargement, which is now entering a crucial phase, and because we have significant problems with the common agricultural policy and have not yet made full use of the Structural Funds, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism wishes to propose three key points.
We believe that structural measures under the four Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, Equal and Urban are very important, as are innovative measures.
We believe that it is important for at least some TENs to be extended so as to eliminate bottlenecks.
In the long term, environmental and employment policy has to be improved and emphasis should be placed on greening the budget, which has not been taken into account up to now.
We do not think it is the end of the world that none of our committee's conclusions has been incorporated into the guidelines so far, but we hope that this will be possible in future.
As a mountaineer I would like to say, in parentheses, that the fact that 2002 is the International Year of the Mountains should be reflected in the budget.
Otherwise, I accept the guidelines and support them.
