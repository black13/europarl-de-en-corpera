Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present the priorities of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the 2002 general budget.
The first point relates to the issue of statistical information, or rather the lack of it.
Statistical information is highly important for the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
We repeatedly find ourselves in situations where the statistics made available for our work are quite simply totally inadequate.
This applies to the structural indicators, for example.
The committee is therefore calling for sufficient funding for the budget line on statistical information.
Secondly, we are calling for adequate risk capital to be made available for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
Thirdly, we consider it very important to have adequate resources for the Financial Services Action Plan.
The same also applies to the Commission, of course.
We are reacting here to the Lamfalussy report.
It is better to tackle this point than to go through the legislative procedure at a snail's pace.
Fourthly, we wish to stress the need to improve the human resources of the Commission's Directorates-General.
Lastly, it should be ascertained whether the Prince programme can be continued during the first six months of the year 2002 to tackle the particular difficulties of small and medium-sized businesses which have still not made sufficient preparations for the switch to the euro, partly because of their financial resources, in contrast to larger companies and banks.
(Applause)
