, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Trakatellis very warmly for his excellent report.
But thanks are also due to the committee responsible, which accepted all 16 amendments proposed by the Committee on Women's Rights.
This shows that once again, this House is much further ahead than some Member States with their national health policies.
Although we women constitute the majority of the population, and although the double and triple burden of work, family and caring for relatives are shown to take a greater toll on our health, women-specific aspects do not always receive the attention they deserve in health policy.
Our health systems are usually gender-blind.
National reports rarely include a breakdown by gender.
Yet it is telling that in Europe and beyond, the majority of people who are dependent on medication are women.
In Germany, the figure is 70%.
So we urgently need more solid data, and above all, a holistic approach to health throughout Europe.
Gender policies must also be granted a central role in health policy in future: in research, prevention and treatment.
The new Public Health Action Programme can pave the way in this regard.
Every 20 minutes, a woman dies of breast cancer in Europe.
It affects one woman in nine.
The probability of contracting this disease increases from year to year.
Yet if it is detected in time and properly treated, breast cancer is curable.
So here too, best practice is imperative.
We must ensure that it is not only in early detection that breakthroughs are widely promoted throughout the EU.
After the adoption of the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening, the task now is to research and promote best practice for treatment as well.
