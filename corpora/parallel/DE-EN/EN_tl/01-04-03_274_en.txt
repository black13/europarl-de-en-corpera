Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a Public Health Action Programme for 2001-2006 is a well-meaning attempt to overcome the current fragmentation of European health policy into numerous individual programmes.
Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have made every effort to incorporate many additional issues into the Commission's text and improve upon it, while our rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, has made genuine efforts and worked extremely hard to take all these different wishes into account.
This has not only resulted in a great many proposed amendments; in my view, it also presents us with a text which - as an opinion of the European Parliament - is useless in its current form.
It is full of repetition, tautology, rambling paragraphs, contradictory statements, and demands which violate the principle of subsidiary, even though the opposite is claimed in the text.
In terms of content, I have concerns about the Commission's priorities as reflected, inter alia, in the allocation of resources.
Here, I support the rapporteur's proposed amendment.
But in particular, I have grave reservations about the undoubtedly well-meaning proposal calling on the Commission to set up a Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre (HCMC) to ensure the efficient operation and coordination of the programme.
I will vote against all these proposed amendments, and also protest vigorously about the fact that we are discussing this report in plenary this week even though the translation was only available on Monday.
A framework programme could create the necessary transparency for the Community's activities in the field of health and offer the flexibility to set priorities in response to current events.
In this way, the limited available resources could be used sensibly and in a targeted way.
But this requires a clear and lucid mandate for the Commission, which - in my view - the current text fails to provide.
