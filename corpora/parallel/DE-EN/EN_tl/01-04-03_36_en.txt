Mr President, no one would seriously question that food safety, food quality, consumer protection and sustainable agriculture should be priority economic policy objectives for the EU.
But as we all know, there is more than one way to skin a cat, so the real question is how we intend to achieve this objective in practice.
Off-the-shelf solutions are often used to achieve policy objectives - in this case, the Costa Neves report cites the new European Food Safety Authority.
We all know that new authorities need additional budgetary resources, but that these are hard to come by.
If we really want to achieve the economic policy objective I have mentioned, we cannot rely on doing this just by creating a new authority.
No, if we want to attain this goal, we have to reform the common agricultural policy, particularly, of course, with the planned eastward enlargement in mind.
In previous parliamentary terms, we have supported large agricultural concerns at the expense of small farmers.
We need to act quickly to put this right, so that the remaining small farms, which have always produced food of a very high quality, once again receive an income guaranteeing their economic existence.
That is the only way we can translate these objectives into reality.
