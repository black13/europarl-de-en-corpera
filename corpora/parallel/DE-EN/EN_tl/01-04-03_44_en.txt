Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why does the Council want a competitive Europe?
And why do we support this objective?
For us, it is a case of safeguarding jobs in Europe and creating new and attractive jobs.
That is the number one priority.
The crisis in farming caused by BSE and other diseases will lead to employment problems in agriculture, the meat trade and many other businesses.
That means that we need to think about how we can plan for the future and open up new possibilities for the workforce.
There are two very well known approaches to moving forward here, namely investment in training and in research.
As regards research, money particularly needs to be invested in market research, that is to say into what products consumers buy, and also, of course, in product research - for example, how can renewable energy be produced in the agricultural sector to counteract Europe's dependence on imports?
There are two sectors that will create a great many jobs in the future.
One of these is the computer industry, including the development of hardware and software, the information technology of the future, and the other is that we all want to live to a healthy old age, which means that we need social support mechanisms, and we need research into biotechnology to guarantee a healthy old age.
To achieve this, we therefore need access to finance, particularly for micro-companies.
Nowadays, it is almost impossible for a company with less than 10 employees to obtain finance unless the family, or extended family, can provide security.
We must advocate concrete measures in this area, as companies with less than 250 employees after all account for 60% of GNP and 60% of employment in Europe.
