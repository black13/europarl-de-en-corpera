Mr President, I wanted to ask who is representing the Swedish Presidency here today for this important debate.
Can you give me a name?
Yesterday, the State Secretary responsible, Mr Malmberg, informed me that to his great regret he cannot be with us today.
I regret this all the more as there will probably be a debate about Sweden's national budget, and he will not be with us here.
Could you please tell us who is representing the Swedish Presidency in today's debate at political level?
Thank you.
