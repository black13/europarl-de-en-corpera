Madam President, we have made a further improvement to one part of the amendment, in agreement with the rapporteur.
It reads as follows: "Hopes that true to the rules of social dialogue the Commission will continue to consult with the parties concerned."
The change is in the word "continue".
This is the only change, and as I said it has been agreed with the rapporteur and so he accepts it.
