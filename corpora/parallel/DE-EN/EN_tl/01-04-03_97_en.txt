Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has pointed out, this budget covers a broad spectrum of activities.
This broad spectrum of European funding tasks also includes foreign policy.
Europe is a major player on the foreign policy stage, especially in non-military crisis management, and the Committee knows that different problems arise with these budget headings than with funds administered within the European Union by the Member States.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs has therefore made it a priority to ensure that the decisions adopted by this House are also implemented.
It is unacceptable that year after year, billions of euro are not spent because the services, the cooperation with the Directorate-General, do not function effectively.
That is our criticism of this budgetary procedure.
There has been restructuring within the new Commission.
Europe Aid has been launched, and we expect that as a result, the programmes agreed by Parliament will be implemented more speedily in future.
But at the same time, we expect the Commission to refrain from setting up its own new implementing organisation and to draw instead on Member States' competencies, as they should be playing an active role in this area as well.
We want the political management of all these problems to be undertaken in Europe, but we also want the allocated funds to be drawn down.
In a year's time, we will measure your success in terms of what you have done with the many additional posts which have been created.
So this issue will undoubtedly arise once again during the next budgetary procedure, including the discharge procedure.
