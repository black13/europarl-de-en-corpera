, chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Mr President, this request for urgent procedure is about the fact that high-protein feed or pulses are to be grown on set-aside land before this year is out.
What we have here is an old demand made by Parliament finally taking effect.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has held negotiations with the Council presidency so that this scheme can be introduced within this year.
That is why my committee is supporting this request for urgent procedure.
This also provides an opportunity to grant financial compensation to cattle farms hit by the beef crisis caused by BSE, without imposing any additional burden on the budget - and I stress the word additional.
And these farms would nevertheless be given income aid through the channel of animal feed.
That will please Commissioner Schreyer.
I call on the House to vote for this request.
