Mr President, the fact that only one of the 50 poorest countries, namely Botswana, has managed to get out of the poverty trap over the last 25 years proves that the basic system is flawed.
Providing ostensibly social aid and even slashing these countries' debts are only cosmetic measures with no long-term effects.
Multinational groups have established a system of exploitation against these countries in collaboration with former colonial powers and other industrialised countries, which is every bit as cruel as it was in the colonial era.
It is amazing that often the countries richest in raw materials have the poorest population.
Take the example of Angola.
It is obvious that this system has been implemented on purpose.
The African country richest in raw materials was once the biggest coffee exporter in the world with enough money to feed its 12 million people easily.
