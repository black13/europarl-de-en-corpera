Mr President, I often receive queries from citizens wishing to carry weapons in Europe.
These people are hunters and marksmen travelling to competitions.
There are huge discrepancies in the rules here.
These are serious complaints and we are being asked why the internal market does not function in this area.
Do you intend to take any initiatives here?
