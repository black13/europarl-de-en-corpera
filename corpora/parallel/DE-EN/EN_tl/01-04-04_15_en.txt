Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has set itself the ambitious target of achieving full employment in Europe by 2010.
However, the Council should be clear on one thing: jobs can only be created if economic reforms are implemented consistently.
What was begun in Lisbon and announced in Nice was not continued in Stockholm.
In Stockholm, the brakes were applied.
In this sense, the lack of agreement on Community patents is disappointing.
The absence of a European patent is a powerful brake on the European economy, as has been confirmed in numerous talks with American researchers.
If we want a Europe which promotes private commitment, risk taking and entrepreneurship, then these long overdue liberalisation measures must be taken.
Competition-distorting aid must be prevented as and where possible and an internal market for services must at last become a reality.
