Mr President, Madam Vice-President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, first allow me to thank my fellow member, Felipe Camisón Asensio, for his report on behalf of my Group.
He has drafted it very carefully.
He did not succumb to the temptation to open the door to subsidies still wider; on the contrary, he kept it where the vice-president suggested.
The vice-president and Mr Camisón Asensio were streets ahead of the European Council.
We may, nonetheless, quote the European Council.
The European Council stated in Stockholm that we need to reduce the scope of state aid in the European Union and to make the aid system more transparent.
And that is precisely the objective here.
I think that, in replacing the old Regulation No 1107/70 with the new regulation, we have indeed made the system more transparent.
As regards the use to which it is put, I believe that aid only compensates so-called unpaid costs in connection with the development and use of transport infrastructures.
This poses a problem, because it is not clear exactly what external costs are.
Let me give you an example: the theory that it is always better, for the purpose of environmental protection, to shift freight from the road to the railway does not automatically apply.
We are debating noise in the vicinity of airports, we are in the process of banning night flights.
Just think about when you hear a good old freight train in the middle of the night; it is loud, it stinks and the brakes squeal.
What I mean is that, when it comes to questions such as "What are external costs?
How can they be scientifically defined?
And how can they be apportioned?", we still have our work cut out.
I am delighted that the report says as much.
It is work which the Commission has yet to do and I am keeping my fingers crossed that the Commissioner will be able to do it soon.
