Mr President, Commissioner, the regulation proposed by the Commission simplifies matters remarkably, compared with the previous rules.
Exceptions to aid rules are important, in fact they are absolutely indispensable because, first, additional assistance is needed in order to develop, operate, maintain and/or complete transport infrastructures and, secondly, freight sent by rail, internal waterway or combined transport should receive compensation for the unpaid costs of competing road transport, so that specific requirements, such as environmental friendliness and regional potential, can be incorporated into transport policy.
An approach which only aims to prevent potential distortions of competition and fails to include environmental, social or regional aspects is unacceptable.
The rapporteur, who deserves our thanks for his excellent work, and the Committee have set more far-reaching, important premises, which my group supports, such as including aid for short sea shipping, including combined transport operations at sea ports, granting aid irrespective of whether the company is a public or private company, minimising administrative costs by introducing thresholds below which no checking by or notification to the Commission is required, extending the period of aid and providing the possibility of extending the aid regulation.
Once this regulation has been implemented, there will be further opportunity to shift more traffic to more environmentally-friendly carriers.
