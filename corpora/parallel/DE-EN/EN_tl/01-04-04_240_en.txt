Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
The numerous proposed amendments are proof of the interest which this report has generated.
An aid regulation for transport infrastructure and use is important, because it will increase transparency.
And apart from this, we may expect this directive to improve efficiency and bring about environmentally-friendly and safe transport, even if only one small step at a time.
Although no one particular type of transport is given special attention in this directive, we expect traffic on the roads to be relieved.
But this will not happen if there is false competition between the various modes of transport.
As far as I am concerned, this regulation shifts the emphasis, with the Committee making provision for various amendments which go in two directions.
First - as Mr Jarzembowski has already explained - we think it is important to provide a more accurate definition of the concept of external costs.
They cannot be interpreted differently from one country to another or from one region to another, because that really will cause distortion.
Secondly, we also assume that distortions of competition will be avoided by treating carriers identically.
If a state invests in transport infrastructure which is to be equally accessible to all users, then no distinction should be made between these carriers.
Irrespective of whether this aid is intended for the railways, the roads or an inland port, the aid must be measured against the criterion of accessibility of the infrastructure to users, so as to guarantee fair competition.
Then we also fail to see - and some proposed amendments also relate to this - why, according to this philosophy, multimodal platforms or inland ports should be burdened with a de facto notification requirement.
We expect simpler administrative procedures and, hence, equal treatment of all carriers.
