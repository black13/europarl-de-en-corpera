Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the regulation on the granting of aid for the coordination of transport by rail, road and inland waterway endeavours to do some good, to help, with a new aid scheme, to make something out of the set phrases spouted by soap-box speakers on the subject of transport, by shifting traffic, especially freight traffic, on to more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, mainly from the roads to the railways, inland waterways etc.
That is, as I say, all well and good.
And the detailed work produced by our rapporteur on this proposal is also good, including what the Committee has added in a whole series of proposed amendments, including short sea shipping, including combined transport procedures, disregarding whether the carrier is a public or private company, not to mention a de minimis rule intended to keep excessive administrative costs within prescribed limits.
Regretfully, we must also point out what this regulation cannot achieve.
Mr Camisón Asensio himself has addressed this.
We still have to live with transport policy specifications from the last century, admittedly from the middle and the second half of the 20th century, but hardly forward-looking models for the 21st century.
If we really want to stem the tide of traffic on the roads in the future, we must do more than change a few aid rules for the benefit of the railways and shipping.
And if we do more, then we should do it consistently.
The Commission has just submitted a proposal to abolish - without replacing - the quantitative ceiling of 108% in the agreement on transit traffic through Austria.
Whether this is in keeping with the spirit of the Camisón Asensio report I somehow doubt.
The forthcoming discussion on this new proposal will give us an opportunity to clarify this question.
