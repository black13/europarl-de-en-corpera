Mr President, a very good evening to you.
At this late hour we are discussing an important matter for the coasts of Europe.
It has taken several readings and a conciliation procedure, but all' s well that ends well.
First may I thank my honourable fellow member, Willy Piecyk, for his convincing work.
He has worked for our ports and for that he deserves our thanks.
I said all' s well that ends well.
Forgive me if I include in this happy ending the fact that my home port of Cuxhaven has been given a category A classification.
I must admit that I am not completely happy with the 1.5 million tonnes minimum volume required for category A classification.
What still worries me is that this will particularly disadvantage areas at the edge of the Union, which I should like to see granted the same international status as Rotterdam or Hamburg.
Mind you, I am not talking here about ports for pedalos, I am talking about ports with an annual volume in excess of 1 million tonnes of freight.
I think it is also important to see small ports in an international context.
What is the point of talking about globalisation if we then classify our ports according to the principle of "You may play the game at an international level, but you may not" ?
On the contrary, we should be pleased that we have so many nodes with international connections in the EU.
Trans-European networks and the concomitant investments only make sense if we cover Europe with a real network of ports which includes rather than excludes.
European ports have modernised considerably over recent years in order to be able to meet the demands of maritime transport and maritime technologies.
I believe in the future of our European ports in all their diversity and hope that my fellow members will support me here in the future.
