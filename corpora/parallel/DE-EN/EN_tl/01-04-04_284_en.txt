Mr President, I wanted to refer to Rule 122.
It concerns personal statements.
It states that these personal statements may be made, if, in the course of the debate, remarks were made about one' s person.
What I now find fault with is that absolutely no remarks were made about my person.
Perhaps I may then, nevertheless, make a personal remark.
Namely, I would have liked to have heard if anyone had said that what the committee has here proposed and what we have gone on to examine more thoroughly and make more detailed proposals about fills the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture with great satisfaction.
No one has said that we - and I in particular - have now been occupied with this work for years, that we are very happy that Commissioner Fischler has now made this proposal and that - even if we do not adopt all the proposals - we are nevertheless embarking upon this use of land set aside and upon the environmental revaluation of crop rotation.
I wanted to say that as a personal remark.
Many thanks, Mr President, for giving me the opportunity.
