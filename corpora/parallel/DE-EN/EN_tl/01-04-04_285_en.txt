Even in his new capacity as chairman, the honourable Member has not forgotten which tricks can be used in order to still have the chance to speak.
But what you said was interesting Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I thank all of you who have held out for so long, particularly the members of the Commission and its officials!
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
