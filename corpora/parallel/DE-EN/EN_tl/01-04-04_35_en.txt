Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was good that Dr Trajkovski, the President of Macedonia, was in Stockholm.
He is a man who has made an all-out commitment to interethnic coexistence.
However, if you look closely at the situation in Macedonia, you cannot but conclude that the root cause of the extremist incidents lies not so much in Macedonia as in the hesitant action of the West in Kosovo.
The fact of the matter is that the minority rules in Macedonia for the Walachians, Serbs, Romas and Turks are exemplary and many countries in the region would do well to follow its example.
Secondly: the Albanian minority of around 28% naturally needs special treatment.
They have 4 ministers in key positions in this government.
What the previous government unfortunately failed to take into account was the question of higher education for these people and the need to resolve the problem of Tetovo University.
This government made a start on all this, despite the Kosovo crisis, and just as it did so, along came extremists from outside and upset everything.
I call on the Council to help this government to continue on its chosen path and to call on the opposition in Macedonia to support it.
And I call on the Member States to send money to Tetovo University so that it can start the academic year.
As far as Kosovo is concerned, I urgently call for the borders with Serbia and Macedonia to be closed to extremists.
We can probably do this with the help called for.
But UNMIC must get elections under way in Kosovo at long last, so that elected Albanian politicians can take their fate in their own hands and put the extremists in their place.
Governments in the west must realise that problems need to be monitored closely and a solution found.
If we keep stopping half way, we just give the extremists room to manoeuvre.
