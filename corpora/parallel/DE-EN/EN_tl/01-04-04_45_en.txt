Mr President, normally any corrigenda to the various language versions are announced before the vote commences.
I understand that corrections are needed to the Spanish version.
Is the Bureau aware of this or not?
If it is, I would be grateful if they could be announced.
According to my information, there is a point in the Spanish version which has not been brought into line with the basic English version.
