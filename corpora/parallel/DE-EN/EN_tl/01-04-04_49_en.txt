Mr President, this misunderstanding has already been cleared up in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I am therefore most surprised that it should be raised yet again.
We discussed this quite clearly during the vote in committee.
The matter was clarified and I therefore assumed that plenary would also understand that the English version applies and that the other languages also refer to "competent authorities" .
This new demand is therefore somewhat beyond me.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0099/2001) by Mr Folias, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, concerning discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1999 financial year
