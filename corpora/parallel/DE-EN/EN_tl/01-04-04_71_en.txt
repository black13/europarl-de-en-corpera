Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am really sorry that we did not manage to conclude the debate this morning, as a rounded overview depended on it.
I think that the Stockholm Summit set the wrong priorities.
Too much social and education policy - matters which, according to the Treaties on European Union, are not its concern - and too little market liberalisation.
The liberalisation of the energy markets was blocked by my country and by France.
As for the liberalisation of air space, we are still wrangling over how to deal with Gibraltar airport, meaning that umpteen thousand tourists will again be left sitting in airports this summer due to delayed flights.
And all the while, Stockholm was busy setting specifications for social and education policy!
It is unacceptable.
Europe is putting the cart before the horse.
It needs to continue with its liberalisation policy so that the markets can develop in the consumers' interest.
This also qualifies as consumer and social policy because more competition means cheaper prices.
As far as social and education policy per se are concerned, we should again abide strictly by the principle of subsidiarity and leave it to the Member States to put flesh on the bones of these concepts.
Europe is not culturally homogenous, nor should it become so.
Therein lies our strength because, on the contrary, Europe thrives on its diversity.
I think that Europe should stop wasting its energy and should again focus on tasks which it is able to carry out.
The next Council in Gothenburg in June will give the Heads of State or Government an opportunity to do so.
I hope that they will make use of it for the good of Europe.
