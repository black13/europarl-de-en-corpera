Mr President, a decision with serious consequences for Europe and its information society will be taken tomorrow.
I am counting on a 'Yes' to Galileo and on the insight of the Council of Transport Ministers.
We need a unanimous political vote and no more beating about the bush.
The critics still around should be told that the public-private partnership is feasible provided there is a clear political vote.
Military use may be possible, but it is not a prerequisite.
The infrastructure created by Galileo will have a much higher added value in the future than other previous infrastructure measures.
Technologically-minded young people in Europe will find attractive new jobs through Galileo.
Europe' s high tech industry will be at the top of the world league in this forward-looking sector.
The so-called market value of Galileo increases in indirect proportion to the start-up capital needed.
We must be able to insist on the European negotiating principle of burden sharing in this sector too.
It should not be too painful for the Member States to meet each other half way under these circumstances; on the contrary it should be a piece of cake.
We must do the job properly now!
Tomorrow will be too late!
Our biggest competitor, the USA, is laughing all the way to the bank and is delighted at every setback in Europe.
After all, we still need seven or eight years to roll out.
Presidents Persson and Prodi rightly and emphatically drew our attention to this new technological opportunity for a modern Europe at the start of this morning' s debate.
I repeat: Galileo is a gateway to a European information society and I expect the Council of Transport Ministers to perceive it as such tomorrow.
