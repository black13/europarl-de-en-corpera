Mr President, when the EU' s fortress policy fails, then we end up with shipwrecks such as that which occurred in France, and again in Greece, and which will probably claim many more lives.
The question is: if we really want more freedom, security and justice, what must we do in order to prevent this policy from claiming even more lives?
First, freedom is achieved by giving people a free choice of where they wish to live.
Secondly, security is given to people by pressing a passport into their hand and giving them the legal wherewithal to set up home wherever they want.
This results in more justice and greater fairness because it is the global economic conditions which the industrialised countries have forced on the world which turn many people into refugees in the first place.
Which is why I call on the Council to take prevention seriously.
A uniform modus operandi - yes, start a legalisation initiative now, because that is the only consistent policy against racism.
