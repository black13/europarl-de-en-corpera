Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost every day we read articles in the papers about refugees stranded on the coasts of Europe.
Just last Sunday, 447 Kurdish refugees landed in Greece.
In February the "East Sea" freighter ran aground in St. Rafael in France with almost 1 000 Kurdish refugees, including over 300 children, on board.
Their Odyssey to Europe had lasted ten days under inhumane conditions.
Three women gave birth to children in these conditions.
The refugees sell all their worldly possessions in order to buy a passage to Europe.
That refugees are putting their lives at even greater risk is the consequence of the EU's segregation policy.
It is intolerable.
Europe' s borders must be open to people in need, fleeing their homeland.
Why does anyone leave their homeland?
Where are the refugees who willingly leave their homeland?
No one leaves their homeland willingly unless they are being persecuted and fear torture and maltreatment.
I think we should fight the reasons why they flee.
We need an active human rights policy, we need to rethink arms exports and we need to give poor countries and regions financial aid, so that their people do not need to flee.
I call on the Commission, the Council and the governments of the European Union to apply this policy and put it into practice.
Europe does not just need an economic face, it also needs a human face.
