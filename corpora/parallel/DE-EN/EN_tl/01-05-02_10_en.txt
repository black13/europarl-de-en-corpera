Madam President, it is a matter of regret that the Council is not represented here today.
We are very well aware that the request for the Council to be represented here was made at very short notice.
For that reason I do not mean to criticise the Swedish Presidency as such, but I would like to make a point about the future, Madam President.
Just as we expect the Commission to be present at meetings of the European Parliament, in future it should also be possible for the Council of Ministers to be available to make statements when the European Parliament is sitting in Brussels or Strasbourg.
We should focus our efforts, following the great success we had just last week with a regulation on transparency and access to documents, so that in future it goes without saying that the Council of Ministers, which is always welcome here, is not only welcomed by us when it is willing to attend, but rather that the Council should always be present here in future.
(Applause)
