Mr President, according to a statement by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the number of cases of thyroid cancer has risen sharply.
That is the finding in a report by the Otto-Hug-Institut at Munich University.
According to WHO forecasts, in the district of Gomel in Belarus alone, which is the main area affected, a third of the children who were under four years of age when the accident occurred will contract cancer of the thyroid during their lifetime.
The repercussions could become apparent in seven million people over the next 50 to 70 years.
In Belarus alone, there is a shortfall in the funds needed to treat radiation victims of EUR 800 million a year.
Because there is no money, people over the age of 45 are no longer being treated.
Meaning that they will die.
Compare this amount with the EUR 1.2 billion spent by the Commission on nuclear research under the sixth EU nuclear research programme and draw your own tragic conclusions.
We call on the European Union to issue strict, uniform nuclear safety standards.
A repeat of Chernobyl must be prevented, which is why bogus environmental impact tests, such as those in Temelin, should not be carried out.
