Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first point is that drugs only harm people who abuse them and that drugs taken in moderation, such as alcohol and tobacco, can also be seen as a source of enjoyment.
Drugs cause harm when they are abused.
However, I see this rather as a social problem, with drugs acting more as a catalyst, which is why I think that fighting the drugs is not really doing anyone a service.
That is why the best solution is to allow people to decide the quantity of drugs which they want or do not want to take for themselves.
I therefore think that this initiative will not be much help.
In the final analysis, it is just more repression, more powers for Europol, which does very little to help us live our lives as we so choose.
There is an alternative to this proposal in the form of drug checking.
Various highly successful drug checking projects have been carried out in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Vienna and Germany.
The European Drugs Monitoring Centre in Portugal has given drug checking a very good report and it continues to be active in this area.
That is why I think that we should not agree to this repressive measure.
In all events, we the Greens shall not do so; instead we shall back the right of the people who wish to consume these substances to decide for themselves.
