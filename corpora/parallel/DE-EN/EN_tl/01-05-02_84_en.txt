Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Swedish Presidency and the rapporteur on their initiative.
It seems to me that transparency quite rightly has a special place in the Nordic legal world, and transparency should also occupy a special place in the institutions of the European Union.
I hope that we will go further than this expression of intent, this declaration, and that in future unlimited access to documents will be guaranteed.
Democracy and the need to bring the Union closer to its citizens are always associated with the transparency of political decision making.
It is not just the European public that has in the past complained - quite rightly in my view - about making policy behind closed doors.
I too would have preferred a more far-reaching compromise.
However, I think that for the time being we must be satisfied with what has been achieved.
As the representative of the European public, Parliament has a duty to ensure that this regulation is strictly adhered to.
In one or two years' time we will be able to review whether this regulation has really been a success.
