Madam President, it would, of course, have been good if we could have debated this urgent matter here today.
I would like to remind you and the House that Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, and for part of the time, I myself have been in Turkey over the last few days as part of a very spontaneous action.
Mr Cohn-Bendit is, of course, chair of the delegation that is to visit Turkey and its prisons in June.
We have also had a meeting on this subject today.
Mr Cohn-Bendit and I - to the extent that I was present - made the viewpoint of this House very clear to the Turkish Government, to the Minister for Justice and to the Minister for European Affairs, as we did to the organisations that are organising this hunger strike, to the human rights organisations and to the country's MPs.
I particularly wanted to mention that.
We have tried, by means of a very spontaneous action, and in view of the urgency of this matter, to make the views of this Parliament very clear to the Turkish Government, Parliament and to the human rights organisations.
