Mr President, we have all seen the European indicators.
Economic growth in Europe is slowing down.
The reasons include rising oil prices and higher interest rates, which are already dampening company profits.
We now have a choice of several measures designed mainly to bring about higher rates of economic growth in Europe.
Under no circumstances, however, should we simply increase public investment.
We need more forwards on the European economy team.
There are too many defenders on the playing field and too many reserves who never even see the ball, which is why I think that, first and foremost, we need to improve the framework conditions for our working population.
Overly high tax rates must be reduced so that it pays to work in Europe.
National budgets must be reorganised mainly by reducing bureaucracy rather than adding to the burden on our people.
