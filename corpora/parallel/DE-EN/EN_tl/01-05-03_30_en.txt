Mr President, I welcome the report insofar as I think it is important to keep developing new technologies.
I think it is important, above all, to give as many people as possible the means to communicate freely with whomever they wish, as and how they please.
People must be allowed to choose for themselves in matters of information.
This alone brings us up against the main obstacle to this free network, to free communication.
There has already been a great deal of talk here about consumer confidence.
However, I think that this expression alone is most telling.
Consumer confidence means simply wanting to create confidence so that consumers believe that communications are secure.
Privacy is a different concept; it means that communications really are secure, which is why I should like to stress again that privacy should be the real objective, i.e. really guaranteeing that communications are secure.
There is one obstacle: monitoring is being driven further and further forward, including at European level.
It is often argued that there are now new Internet crimes or old crimes which are now being committed over the Internet.
However, the measures being taken in response are based on the belief that these crimes can be contained using state monitoring methods - as if.
At the same time, most measures are only able to frighten off the really stupid offenders.
They will not do much more than that because most of those who commit crimes in cyberspace also know how to protect themselves against monitoring.
The question of data protection is addressed in Articles 10 and 13 of the report.
However, it is partly restricted by calling for protection for data with financial or health implications alone.
I think privacy is important for all data.
Everyone has the right to choose for themselves in matters of information, which is why our slogan should be: down with monitoring, up with privacy.
