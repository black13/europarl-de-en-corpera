Mr President, Mr Arvidsson has twice tried to point out a difference in Amendment No 4.
You have not said anything but you intimated that Amendment No 4, as passed today, is different from what it was in committee.
At least, so you intimated.
I assume, just to clarify matters, that we are going by what was submitted today.
