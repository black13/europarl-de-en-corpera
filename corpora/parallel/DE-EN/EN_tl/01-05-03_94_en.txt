Mr President, the Christian Social Union supported the Katiforis report in the final vote.
I should, however, just like to point out that we voted against item 4.
We agree with the objective of the report per se, which is to reduce budgetary deficits or even, if possible, to achieve a surplus.
This is contradicted by item 4, which approves of new debts, even within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact.
In the final analysis, our message should be that this 3% should not be used up - which might well be the case - and that our objective is still to achieve a surplus.
Parliament should do everything it can, especially on the eve of the introduction of the euro, to ensure that the euro remains stable and this should be the message that it sends out.
