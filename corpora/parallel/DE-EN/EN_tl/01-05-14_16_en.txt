Madam President, if I understood you correctly, the Spanish Constitutional Court has confirmed your opinion, and ruled that requests for the lifting of immunity, even from the Spanish Supreme Court, must be addressed to you through the Spanish government.
There was some controversy over whether the stance you took was necessarily correct.
In the light of the situation, I should like to address a further question to Mrs Sauquillio: Do you know whether the dossiers are already on their way here?
Have you been informed that the dossier is being sent to you again?
Yes or no?
Secondly, did I also understand you correctly as saying that you intend asking the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to deal with the matter as soon as the documents arrive?
Will you be doing that directly, or will you be informing Parliament first?
On the basis of what you yourself have said, you ought first to inform Parliament when you have received the file, and only then could you involve the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
That would mean that we could not expect the matter to come before the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs until after the next plenary session.
That is why I am asking you quite specifically: will you be passing the files to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs as soon as you receive the dossier irrespective of the plenary session, I mean the files on the presumed suspect Mr Berlusconi and the file on the presumed suspect Mr Dell' Utri?
There are, after all, two cases here.
