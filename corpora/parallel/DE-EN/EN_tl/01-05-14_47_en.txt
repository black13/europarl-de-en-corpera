Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the unanimity in committee shows that, overall, we are satisfied with the progress made since our last debate on 4 October last year.
The tabled amendments refine the draft further, making it clearer and more up to date.
We are still, however, far from our goal in everyday practice.
We must do all we can to get the agreements translated into action and to make the freedoms which we advocate as a basic principle of the European Union an actual part of the daily lives of all people, not just young people, in Europe.
Colleagues, it is true that citizens have already been enjoying greater mobility since the internal market was introduced, but there is still a long way to go.
We must continue to dismantle all barriers to freedom of movement.
Equal rights and benefits, recognition of periods of study abroad, promotion of multilingualism, promotion of information exchange and the dismantling of administrative and financial obstacles must be translated into reality and not just written down in the action plan.
A previous speaker has pointed out that we still have not reached our goal in the matter of taxation, the recognition of health insurance, employment and social law, social security and the mutual recognition of academic qualifications.
I therefore call for a greater application of the EU principle of non-discrimination in all these areas, too, because mobility also needs underpinning socially with some minimum standards so that persons who are mobile are not disadvantaged in other ways.
