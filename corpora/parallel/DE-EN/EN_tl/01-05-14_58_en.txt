draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Mr President, in the matter of e-Learning I think we must above all realise that we are entering an entirely new world, that we are exploring new things and should not therefore keep to well-trodden paths.
The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has once again found that women are still largely excluded from the Web.
Internet activities and everything that goes with the New Economy are still not the brave new world so far as women are concerned, as, incidentally, was also noted recently at a major international conference in Hamburg.
Eighteen countries contributed their experience.
There is a digital discrepancy.
The ratio of women to men on the Internet is in the region of one to four.
It is true that access is improving, but among people beginning their studies there are still only around 20% women compared to 80% men.
When it comes to the formation of Internet-related companies, the proportion of women is still vanishingly small.
We are therefore calling for new access to be created specifically for women, for special software to be developed for women, because they use the Internet differently and because women are still lagging a long way behind in qualifications.
If we want to act on the resolutions of the Lisbon Summit and create a knowledge-based society, we must pay particular attention to women.
We must, for example, abandon coeducation in some matters.
We must tread new paths here.
I think it is particularly important that we catch up with the Americans.
Here, too, we find that American women already have much greater access to the Internet.
In some fields they have actually overtaken men.
I think we still have a good chance of achieving something here with our action plan.
I therefore ask that, in formulating the action plan, particular attention be paid to developing a greater and more specific involvement of women.
