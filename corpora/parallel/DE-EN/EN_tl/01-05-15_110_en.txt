The present report on the Commission' s recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community in 2001 states that the supreme goal of European economic policy is to make the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic economic area in the world by 2010.
That is an unobjectionable aim in principle, but it is surely no mere oversight that makes the author omit the rest of this sentence as formulated at the Lisbon summit, for it went on to speak of an economic area with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
That is the very heart of the matter.
A cyclical economic slowdown is rightly identified in the report, but once again the neoliberal solutions are trotted out: supply-side economic policies, liberalisation, reduction of government debt and wage restraint on the part of employees in pay negotiations.
Although some important points that were not contained in the report on the European economic situation by the same author have now been incorporated, such as the need for harmonisation in certain areas of tax law, special emphasis on the importance of strengthening SMEs and consideration of environmental factors, some vital elements are still missing.
Unless domestic demand is strengthened, in other words unless people' s purchasing power is increased, a sustained upturn will be impossible to achieve.
That is why foremost priority must be attached to the creation of new jobs.
We urgently need to redistribute work by devising every possible means of shortening employees' working hours, to ensure that everyone who earns an income from employment is integrated on an equitable basis into national insurance and pension schemes, to show greater commitment to education and training and to alter the course of public investment policy.
As long as these imperatives are not incorporated into the strategy for the development of European economic policy, we cannot give it our approval.
