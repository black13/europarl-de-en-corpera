Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on general product safety is so important to us because it relates to a key area, namely those products that are not covered by the CE mark.
But this brings me straight to one of the weak points of this proposal for a directive on general product safety, namely the fact that it will no longer be apparent to the consumer whether a product is really safe.
This makes our Amendment No 3 especially important, because it provides quite simply for external certification by authorised testing agencies.
There is an urgent need for the Commission to consider the introduction of verification marks - marks which certify to the consumer that a product is safe and, in some cases, that the product is of above-average quality.
A product is then deemed to be safe when its safety has been verified by an accredited test centre.
This is of particular importance to small and medium-sized businesses.
If we think about the precautionary principle and prevention, it becomes clear that incentives must be created to encourage companies to have their products tested.
I believe that testing by a third party, an impartial agency, would be an important means of easing the pressure on market-monitoring programmes.
And this easing of pressure, along with the predictability deriving from testing and certification, would enable consumers to establish very clearly and easily where reliably safe products can be bought.
On the export ban, let me say that there are naturally many countries whose standards differ greatly from those in Europe.
I believe we should not be so haughty as to regard other countries' standards as inferior and to assume that ours are the only good and valid standards.
