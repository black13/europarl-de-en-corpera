Mr President, Commissioner, several points in the Commission' s crisis plan for the beef market have already been dealt with, of course.
The slaughter programme has gone through the administrative process, and we dealt with clover ley here in a debate on matters of topical and urgent importance.
So let us now concentrate on the things that remain to be discussed.
I essentially wish to confine my remarks to the 90-head limit.
It should be made clear that this ceiling already applies in Europe but is not compulsory.
That was the big mistake in Berlin.
It would have been better to have adopted the proposal we made in Parliament at that time to the effect that there should be an additional mechanism in the degressive premium model to make allowance for the cost of labour.
This idea has now been taken up again, as the speakers from the other groups have made clear.
I hope the Commission will adopt this proposal, so that we can give farms with higher livestock populations the opportunity at least to adjust this 90-head limit.
As a result, larger farms with species-related husbandry methods involving additional labour inputs would have a means of obtaining reimbursement of their costs.
I believe we would then have made this limit less rigid as well as having introduced an enlightened social factor.
I hope that the House agrees and that it will vote accordingly tomorrow.
