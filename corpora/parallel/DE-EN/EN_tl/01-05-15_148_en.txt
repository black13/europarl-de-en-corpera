Mr President, Agenda 2000 sets out the key indicators for the domains of agricultural, structural and finance policy in the EU for the period from 2000 to 2006.
Its aim was to sever the link between aid and production levels in the relevant product markets while keeping the loss of income and jobs within reasonable bounds, an aim which was formulated at a time when the restructuring process seemed destined to run fairly smoothly.
After the outbreaks of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the beef and veal markets collapsed with no sign of an early return to stability.
Farmers are counting on the additional special funds being provided now rather than disappearing in an interminable bureaucratic labyrinth.
The promises made in the initial weeks of the crisis regarding the special purchase scheme must first be honoured.
Incorporating this scheme into long-term plans to alter the organisation of the market in beef and veal will exacerbate the financial situation of beef producers.
The present draft amendment to the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal essentially fulfils the Commission' s aim of reducing the oversupply of these products.
Some of the proposals, however, have nothing at all to do with the consequences of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease.
The quality of products is not automatically better if a farm is bigger or is managed in a particular way.
Present market trends are unlikely to act as an incentive to invest in beef production.
The fixing of any form of ceiling for the payment of support is therefore an unwarranted additional financial burden on those who have already made investments.
Farmers depend on this income, and the 90-head limit will certainly be resisted.
