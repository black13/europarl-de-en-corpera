Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the subjects of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease have disappeared somewhat from the headlines, and with good reason.
Thank goodness for that!
In my view, their absence from the front pages will do more than anything else to restore consumer confidence.
Commissioner Fischler, I should like to appeal to you to accept the amendments in the Sturdy report, because referring the report back to committee after the vote would only cause delays, as far as I can see.
I could not explain such delays to the farmers, consumers and voters back home.
What are we actually asking for?
The first thing is that the goalposts should not be shifted in the middle of the game.
The rules were laid down in Berlin.
We are calling for the reintroduction of a limit of 90 head of cattle.
I believe this is something upon which all of us, from our widely diverse regions, really must continue to insist at the present juncture.
As for the plan to reduce the stocking density to 1.8 livestock units per hectare from 1 January 2002, I must tell you in all honesty that I am also at a loss to explain this to the farmers in my region.
Another lesson we must learn relates to the repeated references to alternative production methods.
I believe that organic farms are a good thing, but they are no panacea, because we are already seeing that there is too little purchasing power and too few markets for their produce.
It is my opinion that the amendments could be accepted as they stand - time forbids me to repeat the wording of each one - from my point of view and perhaps from your perspective too.
And last but not least, our guiding principle throughout this sector should be the need to produce safe food.
Safety cannot be regulated with premiums.
Safe products are the key to the restoration of a stable beef and veal market.
