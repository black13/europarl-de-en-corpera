Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have focused particular attention on a point that has come in for a degree of criticism from some other MEPs, namely the introduction of the 90-head rule.
I regard the introduction of this rule as an entirely desirable step, for two reasons: firstly, because it releases funds which we could use to assist smaller farms and family holdings wherever possible and, secondly, because it accords with a certain principle of equality.
In our economic legislation we have support systems for enterprises with up to 50 employees, for enterprises with up to 250 employees and for those enterprises with a payroll in excess of 250 employees.
In the farming world, I do not see the logic behind the special treatment of large agricultural holdings.
It seems to me that our policies will not bear fruit in the future unless we make a point of supporting the small and family-run farms, the protection of the landscape and environmentally beneficial soil cultivation, especially in ecologically sensitive areas, instead of pouring a considerable percentage of our financial resources into large farming businesses.
In my view, there is no justification for us in the long term to go on having the lion' s share of our aid resources creamed off by farms with thousands of animals, nor will the people of Europe accept such a situation.
I therefore hope that the Commission' s proposal will be adopted.
I know that my opinion differs from those of my group and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but I nevertheless hope that we can keep the 90-head rule as proposed by the Commission.
