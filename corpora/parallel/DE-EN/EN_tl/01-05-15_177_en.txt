Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, it would interest me to know, whether you would deem it useful to comb systematically through all the items in the EU budget in order to establish which of them are conducive to sustainable development?
Could we use a best-practice method to identify the budget lines with which we actually do anything substantive to promote sustainable development?
Perhaps we could also carry out a benchmarking exercise so that the development of the individual budget lines could be observed.
Do you believe that the best-practice method could optimise our performance?
