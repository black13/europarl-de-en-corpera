Madam President, Mr President, as far as sustainability and your ambitious goals are concerned, we really are in something of a vicious circle.
The forces of the market with their spontaneity and the effects of deregulation very much stand in the way of your highly ambitious goals.
I have two questions.
First: what do you think you can really do under these circumstances?
One of your predecessors, President Delors, elaborated whole programmes on the issue of shifting modes of transport from road to rail.
If you look at the situation today, however, you will see that very little has changed.
Quite the contrary, in fact, the situation has worsened.
We talk about alternative energy sources and yet solar energy and wind energy are hardly being promoted.
The big energy companies do not want to let such things onto the grid too.
Second: what form should a debate with citizens take?
What do we want to talk about?
About facts and figures, or also about how citizens can be involved more democratically and more actively in shaping policy?
What information do they want to give us, the Members of this Parliament?
