Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic growth of the Union is evidently threatening to grind to a halt.
Lip service is paid time and again to the principle of supporting small and medium-sized businesses, but the fact is that we give them far too little support, even though they are the engine of our economy and the guarantors of European jobs.
If we really want to help them, we must do all we can to ensure that changes are made to the economic conditions in which they operate.
This means that our administrative systems and regulations must be modernised and simplified.
Deep cuts must be made in non-wage labour costs, which are vastly excessive.
These measures must be consolidated by means of an extension of the Maastricht criteria on budget deficits and debt levels to include a cap on administrative expenditure.
No Member State' s administrative expenditure may on any account exceed 8% of its GDP.
If this savings potential were realised, the absolutely crucial process of tax reform could be financed, and the engine of our economy, the small and medium-sized businesses, could be primed up to remain in perpetual motion.
