Mr Nogueira Rom√°n, first of all I would like to make it clear with regard to the wording of your query that your allegation that we pay little attention to the southern Members of the Community is quite simply wrong.
I therefore reject it, as I do your insinuation that the Commission regards the southern Member States as intruders - to use your term.
The Commission does not allow itself to be led by motives of that sort where it is a question of ensuring optimal management of the Directorate-General for Fisheries, but concerns itself rather with optimising its work.
It is not a question of south or north here, but of bringing together under one department those bilateral agreements that are based on a financial payment in return for access to fishing grounds.
In this way we will be able to ensure that these are managed in a uniform and coherent manner.
In doing so we are complying with the conclusions of the Council in 1997, with the position of the Court of Auditors, which was set out in a Special Report, and with the aims of the Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy.
As for agreements with third countries, where it is principally a question of exchange of fishing rights, it makes sense to locate these in the department that also deals with TACs and quotas, because the fishing rights in these agreements are already a part of the TACs and quotas.
The case of Norway in particular makes the advantages of this new structure clear as we engage in negotiations on long-term technical measures for the recovery of cod stocks in the North Sea.
You see, there is no unequal treatment here on the part of the Commission, but rather it is a question of finding the most appropriate solution.
