Mr President, I must say that to lower the structure of the Directorate-General for Fisheries to this level and to assert that we are biased in favour of Denmark and other northern states is first of all completely unjustified and, second, Mr Nogueira Rom√°n, it is an insinuation that I simply cannot accept.
If you went to the trouble of informing yourself, you would see very clearly that since I have been responsible for Fisheries the number of Spanish staff in particular at the Directorate-General for Fisheries has increased out of all proportion.
Compared to the share of the population that Spain represents in the Community, Spain is over-represented in the Fisheries Directorate-General.
So, if you would like to see your criteria applied in the Fisheries Directorate-General, then we would have to reduce the number of Spanish staff.
I hope that you would not want that!
