Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you whether the Green Paper also takes account of the fact that eighteen million businesses in the European Union have fewer than 250 employees.
This accounts for two-thirds of all employees and affects more than 60 million workers.
Most of these enterprises are family businesses.
Many businesses also have a life cycle.
We are always talking about start-ups, but we should also think of those companies that close for reasons of age or various other reasons.
In my opinion, attention should be paid to ensuring that livelihoods are not put at risk, because this would, of course, be an enormous strain on the workers in these businesses, but also for the entrepreneurs who want to cease trading.
How will the Green Paper deal with these issues?
