Mr President, Commissioner, besides the subjects that have been amply discussed, I believe we should take a closer look at two, perhaps three, of the other points that Karl-Heinz Florenz has raised.
Firstly, I believe that the directive is not solely intended to ensure that products are designed in such a way that they can be easily recycled and to introduce recycling quotas.
Greater attention should also be paid to two other factors, namely consumers and consumer responsibility, because, when it comes to electronics and electronic waste, consumers have not yet developed the habit of using authorised recycling centres to dispose of their old equipment.
Things are somewhat different with cars.
Cars are taken to the scrap-yard.
This, however, does not necessarily happen to electric toothbrushes or shavers.
I believe we must step up our efforts in this domain.
I consider it only right that the Member States should clearly emphasise the consumer' s responsibility for collecting these waste products separately and even spell out the potential penalties for non-compliance.
A second aspect to be considered is that we are doing something entirely new here.
This legislation will create waste and material streams that have never existed before.
We therefore do not know at all how things will be recycled, which material streams will be created and what will happen to them.
Amendment No 56, admittedly, is only a short motion, but it serves to promote a system of monitoring which will not only indicate the targets that the Member States have set - what has to be achieved - but will also provide precise information on what is actually happening with regard to the targets and on the consequences of our proposed legislation in the real material world.
We should therefore observe developments closely and take stock after a certain time in order to determine whether the material streams that have developed really do match our objectives.
