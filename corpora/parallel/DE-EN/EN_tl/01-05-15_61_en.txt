Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has responded very quickly, and I should also like to thank Mr Adams, who has performed sterling work in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
My thanks are also due to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
As we know, the legislation on chemical substances, the Water Framework Directive and the Directive on plant-protection products already refer to certain dangerous substances, defining and categorising them.
The present proposal for a resolution and the list deriving from it must ultimately be brought into line with these existing directives.
Because of its far-reaching economic and legal consequences for agriculture, and for all other sectors of the economy too, the Commission should therefore ensure that the necessary process of identifying these priority hazardous substances is based on hard scientific facts.
It is imperative to act on a sound scientific basis rather than on the basis of suspicion.
The Water Framework Directive has given us a time frame that extends to the year 2004.
We now have a broad consensus on this issue throughout the EU.
We need not be carried away by our emotions.
Zero emissions is not a realistic aim.
We need clarity, built on sound scientific foundations, if we are to take the right action.
Water, ladies and gentlemen, is one of our most important and most sensitive assets.
Let us not forget that.
