(PPE-DE), in writing.
I cannot support the draft directive in its present form.
Article 3 lays down the concentration ceilings.
Since these ceilings are supposed to apply to all cigarettes manufactured in the EU, the products destined for export will also become subject to these ceilings on or before 1 January 2007.
This directive is engaging in overkill.
The Union should not regulate the manufacture of products for export to countries outside the EU to such an extent.
In the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate alone, the tobacco industry achieves an annual turnover of some DEM 1.5 million.
In the largest city in my region 1 250 people are directly employed by a tobacco company.
Its suppliers in the region, such as printers and packaging manufacturers, are all small and medium-sized businesses.
Were the directive to enter into force and the ceilings also to apply to cigarettes intended for export, thousands of jobs would be lost in that structurally fragile region alone.
Whilst cigarette manufacturers are certainly required to inform and warn consumers, it must nevertheless remain possible to go on exporting products with higher concentrations to countries where higher ceilings apply.
The serious restriction of export activity that results from this new directive will be severely detrimental to the European economy.
