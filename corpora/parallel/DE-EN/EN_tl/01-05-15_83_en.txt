Mr President, I am firmly convinced of the importance of provisions designed to eliminate the use of misleading descriptors in the labelling of tobacco products.
It must be clear to consumers that they are intentionally exposing themselves to a health risk.
Palliative descriptors such as 'low-tar' or 'light' merely salve people' s consciences and obscure the fact that these products are not the least bit healthier than any others.
Sadly, however, the Union' s policy is ambivalent.
On the one hand, it takes a resolute stand for the protection of public health by means of measures such as the present directive, while on the other hand it spends a billion euros on subsidising tobacco-growing in the Community.
The Union must set itself the aim of pursuing a rational policy.
However, it is surely well-nigh impossible to explain away this particular contradiction to the European public.
