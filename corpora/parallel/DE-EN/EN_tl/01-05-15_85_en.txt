For the following reasons I have voted against the outcome of the conciliation procedure on the tobacco directive:
According to the joint text, the export to non-EU countries of cigarettes with more than ten milligrams of condensate, more than one milligram of nicotine and more than 10 milligrams of carbon monoxide is to be prohibited.
The result would be a massive fall in exports of cigarettes from the EU and hence the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the EU.
Such a ban will serve no purpose at all, because the cigarettes will then be produced outside the EU.
But jobs in our countries will be lost.
The EU has no authority to impose such a ban.
This is not about transactions in the single internal market.
The anti-tobacco zealots should not act as if the export of tobacco products were something akin to handing out potassium cyanide.
The EU is acting inconsistently here, given that it subsidises both the growing and the export of tobacco to the tune of one billion euros.
By imposing an export ban, the EU is setting itself up as a global health freak.
This is an arrogant and disparaging way to treat the customs and practices of other countries.
The right approach would be to forge ahead with the work that has been started within the World Health Organization on uniform standards for tobacco products.
Unilateral action by the EU will prove fruitless.
