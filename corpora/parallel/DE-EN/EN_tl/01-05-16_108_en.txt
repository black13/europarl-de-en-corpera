Mr President, we are constantly calling for environmentally-friendly, ecological production methods in multipurpose agriculture.
We already have a long tradition of this in Austria, where the rethinking process started in the minds of farmers and consumers a long time ago, unlike in many other countries of the EU.
We farmers in Austria are at the vanguard here and I am convinced that this approach is also the right approach for European agriculture.
I therefore support the Commission proposal, which could be integrated into a European agricultural model.
That is why I voted against the proposed amendments which seek to exceed the 90-animal limit for premium payments - I refer to Amendments Nos 1, 10, 2 and 12 - and I am sorry that they attracted a majority during the vote.
