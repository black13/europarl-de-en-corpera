Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in amending the common organisation of the market in beef and veal, we have taken an urgently needed step in the right direction, i.e. towards extensifying cattle farming.
Apart from reducing beef production, I am also in favour of safeguarding a minimum wage for small holdings and increasing animal premiums.
However, the European Union still needs to be prepared for any sudden crises in the future.
It is not yet clear if the funding for this regulation from the savings made from reforms under Agenda 2000 will last.
Promoting agriculture with no upper limits and arbitrarily shifting money from the organisation of the market into rural development will upset any budget planning in the long term.
This problem has yet to be resolved.
