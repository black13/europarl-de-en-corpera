Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hunger strike by Turkish prisoners and their relatives has been going on for months and has cost many people their lives.
The European Union must stop standing by in silence as more and more people die.
The European Parliament must take a decisive stand if it is to be taken seriously as a negotiating partner.
We must not be indifferent to the massive violations of human rights in Turkish prisons.
We must not forget human values.
The European Union must insist that human rights are respected.
The Turkish parliament recently passed a law relaxing conditions of solitary confinement.
Now prisoners sentenced under the anti-terrorist law are to be allowed to take part in cultural and sporting activities.
My criticism of this law is that it does not allow all prisoners to take part in group activities.
All prisoners must be treated equally.
I cannot stand by while prisoners are tortured and maltreated in solitary confinement and exposed to the arbitrary treatment of the guards without witnesses.
People in solitary confinement are totally cut off from the outside world.
And yet everyone needs human contact and interaction.
We urgently need to find a way of preventing further deaths.
On behalf of the GUE/NGL group, I therefore call on the Turkish government and the prisoners' organisations to reach an agreement through political dialogue.
Dialogue will allow a social consensus to be reached, while force will only be answered with force.
My group cannot regulate Turkey's internal affairs.
But we would all like to help put an end to this situation.
If Turkey wants to be accepted in the European Union, it must stand up for democratic, humane values in the penal system.
Human rights must apply to everyone, including prisoners.
My wish is for agreement, for internal peace and for an end to hatred which opens up deep wounds.
That is why we must speak out.
