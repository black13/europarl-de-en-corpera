Mr President, I shall not take advantage of the situation by taking up more time.
I assume that I have about half a minute left and shall wrap my speech up straight away.
Naturally, I regret this incident.
I have no problem with any sort of demonstration, but people could at least show some respect for Parliament's work, rather than obstruct it, just when we are trying to end the situation as peacefully as possible and stop people from dying.
I shall say no more.
As far as the problem itself is concerned, this incident just goes to show how difficult things are.
I can only appeal on Turkey, as my fellow member Daniel Cohn-Bendit has already done.
It would be possible to induce certain people to stop what they are doing if Turkey showed willing on the three points listed by Daniel Cohn-Bendit.
I hope that Turkey will, at last, take these efforts seriously and show a little willing and stop being so stubborn, because otherwise no-one in Europe is prepared to tolerate Turkey's behaviour.
And it is Turkey's reputation that stands to suffer most.
