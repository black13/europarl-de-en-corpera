Mr President, could you please find out how these three people even got in here?
We have such a strict security system, that we have trouble gaining admittance for our own citizens who come here with good intentions.
These people could not have got in without being let in.
The fact that the Communists stood up when they came in shows where they came from.
Please look into this very carefully and check who signed the slip.
