Mr President, with all due respect, I cannot subscribe to your view.
It is not the political aspect which bothers me.
I should like to point out that when my press officer wanted to step into the Chamber, he was stopped straight away.
And rightly so.
But I fail to understand how three or four people who have absolutely nothing to do with this Parliament can simply walk in.
Secondly: when foreign minister Cem was with us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we had a similar incident which only just stopped short of an actual attack on the minister.
Irrespective of the country involved, it is no laughing matter for Parliament when the security bureaucracy in this House - and I use the word bureaucracy advisedly - stops members at every turn but is unable to prevent this sort of incident when Turkey is the subject of debate, when you would expect them to, given that there has already been one such incident.
It is a scandal.
This needs to be taken more seriously, not the political aspects but what can be done here.
Next time it will a president who is interrupted or attacked while making a speech.
I should like to know what that will do for the European Parliament's reputation.
