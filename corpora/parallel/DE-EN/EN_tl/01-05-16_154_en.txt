Mr President, the motion before us will sink our work without trace.
Thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Schleicher, we had a full debate in committee and now we want to report on it to the European Parliament.
My group is holding a special meeting right now but I feel this debate is so important that I wished to attend in person.
We need this debate now so that the Swedish Presidency can bring this matter to a close.
Because if we do not debate it now, this party statute, this regulation will not come to fruition under the Swedish Presidency.
That is why I ask all the honourable Members to show willing and debate this today so that we can vote on it accordingly tomorrow, when the time comes.
So I am most decidedly against this motion.
I am also sorry to have to say as much to my friend and colleague Mr Dupuis.
May I ask you in a spirit of friendship, Mr Dupuis, perhaps to reconsider.
