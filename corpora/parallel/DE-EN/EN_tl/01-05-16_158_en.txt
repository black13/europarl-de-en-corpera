Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would imagine that certain honourable members are delighted.
It is a most interesting coalition which we have here.
I hope that you will always feel at home in this alliance.
But I must say on behalf of the large majority of my group that we shall not allow ourselves to be discouraged by the result of this vote, which is of course in keeping with the Rules of Procedure.
I shall apply on behalf of my group to the President - and I say this here openly - for this matter to be discussed at the next mini session in Brussels, in the hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the Swedish Presidency.
For the rest, I would point out that we were notified internally earlier that the debate on this subject would not start until 4.45, which is why we were surprised that things got off to such a fast start.
As a good democrat, I do of course respect this result and I trust that those who snatched such a chance victory will be equally good democrats in the future.
I should like to make perfectly clear on behalf of my group that we shall do everything we can to obtain a party statute because it is both good and necessary to the unification of and democracy in Europe.
