Mr President, Mr Cercas Alonso has drafted a quite excellent report.
As we have seen, this is an issue which we are all itching to get our hands on: safe and sustainable pensions, a truly hot potato which gets hotter rather than cooler the longer we leave it.
That is why both the Member States and the European Union need to act here.
We need a satisfactory pension system, which is why the reference to the 1992 recommendation is, I think, particularly important.
But we also need a flexible pension system which has one eye on social change and the need to adjust to the job market.
The idea of an active old age has, basically, been accepted.
You only have to think of the employment policy guidelines for 2000, i.e. maintaining employability and lifelong learning.
I should also like to mention the contribution by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to the report.
It refers to the numerous women on widow's pensions with no source of income of their own.
We must reverse the trend whereby these widows' pensions are being whittled away.
This is one very important matter addressed in the report.
As far as the future is concerned, the concept of open coordination is on the table.
We must also ensure that this has real meaning as far as pensions are concerned.
We should not simply use it as an open sesame; we have to understand that the employment policy guidelines cannot simply be applied line by line.
On the contrary, we need new forms of coordination and these need to be created.
For the rest, I really do welcome the fact that the second and third pillars are dealt with as well as the first.
I would also mention the idea of capital formation by employees.
We must ensure that capital formation and old-age pensions complement rather than contradict each other.
