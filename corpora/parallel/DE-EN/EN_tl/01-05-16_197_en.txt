Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are social policy as well as financial, economic and employment policy aspects to the pension issue.
All these areas must be addressed together if pensions are to be secured in the long term.
I would also add that we have economic policy guidelines and the stability and growth pact on the question of employment and growth policy.
When it comes to the question of demographic change as one of the causes of the problem of pensions, there are several problems: one is the unfortunate fall in the birth rate, another is early retirement in numerous countries and a third is longer life expectancy, for which we, of course, thank God.
As far as birth rates are concerned, we must help to create a stronger awareness of what mothers and fathers contribute from a social policy point of view and ensure that family and work can be smoothly combined.
As far as early retirement is concerned, we must ensure that the retirement age can be brought up to the statutory retirement age in all countries.
A variety of measures is needed for this.
Without doubt, the question of life expectancy has repercussions on the actual retirement age as well as on the statutory retirement age in many countries.
I trust that we can help to strengthen the second and third pillars as well as the first pillar in Europe.
We have countries today in which 80% of people in employment have a company pension.
In my country it is just 9%, while the European average is 25%.
We are currently debating a directive here in Parliament, and I call on the Council to stop blocking a European regulation on company pensions at long last.
I call on the Commission to set up a European pension forum to discuss the different fiscal and employment and social regulations and to help harmonise these issues throughout Europe.
