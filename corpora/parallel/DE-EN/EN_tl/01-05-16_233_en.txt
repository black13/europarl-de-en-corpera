Mr President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office if we can reasonably be expected to wait five months for a decision.
We too have worked on this.
Think about this directive; in the final analysis it is also about having clear provisions on selection, licensing, registration and control so as to create legal security for vine propagators in the European Union.
This part is also very important to economic operators and economic partners in the EU.
On the other hand, according to my information, the plan was to wait until the release directive, i.e. Directive 90/220, had been adopted.
This directive has now been through conciliation, i.e. it has been adopted.
I therefore see no reason to delay this any further.
This directive says nothing about definitive licensing.
That needs to be decided in the release directive.
I would therefore ask you to advance, not to block Parliament's work in the Council.
