Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, the transatlantic dialogue must be extended to encompass global transport policy because both the USA and we Europeans bear a special responsibility for greater safety in the air and at sea, better environmental protection and fair competition and fair trade practices.
Our primary objective must be to adopt reasonable harmonised provisions in order to develop a transatlantic transport market - be it in air or sea transport - and to work towards global regulations based on harmonised regulations between the USA and Europe, for example in the area of air traffic noise.
We do not want to end up at loggerheads with the Americans again over hushkitted aeroplanes; on the contrary, we must endeavour to regulate environmental protection and safety standards in advance, jointly and proactively.
This is not just a task for the Commission and the US Administration.
We must try, as part of the transatlantic parliamentary dialogue, to organise specialist debates between transport experts in the American congress and the European Parliament so as to avoid political pressure between the administrations or, as the result of pressure from lobbyists, by the administrations.
We must fight together for greater environmental protection and greater safety.
This will greatly benefit our people, avoid conflicts between the USA and Europe and could form the basis for an overall joint solution.
