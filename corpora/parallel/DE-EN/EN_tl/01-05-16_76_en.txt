Mr President, I have tabled a proposed oral amendment to Amendment No 9 by Mrs Figueiredo.
This proposed oral amendment, which has been agreed with the author of the original proposed amendment, Mrs Figueiredo, replaces Amendment No 9 in your documentation.
The oral amendment reads as follows: "The question of whether Community fishermen from all Member States will enjoy fishing opportunities in waters under the jurisdiction of Greenland in future should be clarified when interim controls of the agreement are being prepared" , and I should like to ask you to accept it.
