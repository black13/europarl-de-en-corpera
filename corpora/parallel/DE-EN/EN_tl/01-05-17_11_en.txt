Madam President, I should simply like to add one more point: the striking thing about this situation was that one of the three people who caused the commotion here was the same person who attacked the Turkish Foreign Minister during a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I should like this to be recorded in the Minutes once again.
I did say it yesterday to your representative.
Surely it cannot be possible for an individual, who has been identified, not to be banned from entering this House!
Why is there not a computer with an alarm signal stored in it by means of which a person of this kind is denied access?
There must be no repeat of this!
I would really ask you to ensure that these matters are investigated.
