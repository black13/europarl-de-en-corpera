Madam President, with a view to clarifying the situation, allow me to say the following: yesterday, as we all know, there was great confusion here in the Chamber, and I do not wish to reopen the debate on the issue itself at this stage.
However, the reason why it was suggested that we should not debate this report on the status of political parties was in fact that it was said that it did not have a legal base.
In this respect it is right, however - as you said - that the relevant provision is Rule 143 of our Rules of Procedure.
Now the impression has been given that I and my colleagues thought that the report ought to be referred back to the committee; this has arisen from the fact that we mistook the number of the rule in the Rules of Procedure, and after all to err is human.
The relevant provision was Rule 143.
That is why there can be a vote straight away on whether we address this report or not.
