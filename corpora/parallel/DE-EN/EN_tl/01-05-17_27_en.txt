Madam President, I do not wish to repeat all that I have just said.
It is completely justified to make this proposal here in accordance with Rule 111.
Our group, like the other groups - not all of them, but those which have a major interest in this issue, because we believe that it promotes democracy in Europe - are of the opinion that we must not give way to the opponents of Europe in order to postpone this report, but that we must do our duty here.
That is why we are in favour of this item being placed on the agenda and also of it being voted on today in the voting block at 12 noon.
The people of Europe expect us to discharge our responsibility here.
(Loud applause)
