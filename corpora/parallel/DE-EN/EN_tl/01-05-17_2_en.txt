Madam President, yesterday, as we all know, there was a minor incident here during the debate on the situation of Turkish prisoners.
In this connection it was stated, by the Vice-President in the Chair amongst others, that the Committee on Budgets was blocking the posts which were necessary to strengthen the security service.
As the rapporteur responsible, I should like to state here that the posts requested were entered in the reserve with the agreement of the Bureau and that the Bureau has not yet made any request for these proposed posts to be taken out of the reserve.
I firmly refute, therefore, the accusation that the Budgets Committee is blocking the posts necessary to improve security in Parliament.
In so doing I would point out that the Bureau is required to request the relevant transfer of appropriations.
