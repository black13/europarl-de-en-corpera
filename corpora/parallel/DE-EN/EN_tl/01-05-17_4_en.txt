Madam President, yesterday's incident has nothing to do with the fact that certain posts have not yet been approved.
The two are wholly unconnected.
Firstly, a mistake was made at the checkpoint here on the way into the Chamber.
The people are there.
We do not need any new posts.
Secondly, people are saying that the security guards posted at the entrances were responsible.
That does not have anything to do with the posts either.
What is important is that we improve security.
Mr Ferber is right there.
However, there is no direct link to yesterday's incident.
(Applause)
