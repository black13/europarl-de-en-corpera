Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, international organised crime accounts for 10% of world trade, and a large proportion of it is in the European Union.
If the statistics are correct, developments in the crime sector are extremely alarming because in the European Union 30% of crime is already classified as international organised crime.
In the light of this trend we have to ask ourselves whether the border-free European Union is actually taking advantage of all the opportunities it has to take action against this organised crime.
Where police cooperation is concerned we can say that substantial progress has been made.
We have Europol, and Europol is working extremely successfully to fight crime.
In the field of judicial cooperation, however, we must unfortunately note that here cooperation is still in its infancy.
With Eurojust we now have a new instrument which will become operational in 2002 and will represent decisive progress in cooperation between the judicial authorities.
In principle, then, Eurojust works like Europol.
It coordinates the criminal prosecution authorities in the fight against organised crime.
What we must hope is that cooperation with existing units, with the judicial network and with Europol, works and that duplicate investigations are avoided.
I would congratulate the rapporteur.
There is only one point on which I disagree with her.
She has proposed that Luxembourg should be the seat.
As an Austrian, who also knows that the enlargement of the European Union is at hand - and welcomes it - and that Vienna is moving closer to the heart of the European Union, I would make a counter-proposal and propose not Luxembourg but Vienna as the seat of this authority.
