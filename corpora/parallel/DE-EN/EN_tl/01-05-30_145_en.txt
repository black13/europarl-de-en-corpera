Mr President, evaluating an extensive and not always specifically formulated ten year programme for EU environmental policy is a difficult enough task in itself.
What the rapporteur has made of it makes the matter even more difficult.
I think that what the Commission laid before us was a very good starting point.
I really feel sorry for the Commission officials who presented a very good report because their good work was changed so much.
I am unable to congratulate the rapporteur.
In the discussion on the evaluation of the Fifth Environment Action Programme with a view to the sixth, three essential concerns were repeatedly formulated in the fundamentals, and thankfully I find them here again: streamlined EU legislation, a voluntary approach to implementation - so far as possible - and greater involvement of the consumer, whose behaviour we want to influence, after all.
Because it is no longer the 'What' that is at the forefront of environmental policy today.
We are agreed on that - industry is, too - but how we get there, that is where the controversy lies!
As I see it, the EU way is often twin-track, contradictory, difficult to implement, bureaucratic and costly out of all proportion to the ecological purpose.
Such legal errors are then multiplied fifteen fold in the implementation.
If, as I very much hope, we are to have enlargement very soon, there will be twice as many, because in the end with all these mistakes the dogs always bite the last one in the chain.
That is not industry, it is the consumer.
The implementation of existing EU environmental legislation addressed in the Environment Action Programme and rightly called for repeatedly by Commissioner Wallstr√∂m makes good sense and is also consistent with our repeated call for streamlined legislation.
I find there is a lot missing from this environment programme.
I am sure we could have included it.
Only what the rapporteur has made of it does not improve matters.
I feel sorry for the Commission officials!
