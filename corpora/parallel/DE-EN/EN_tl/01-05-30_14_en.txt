Madam President, I should also like to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission on this proposal.
If I understand you correctly, however, this Sixth Framework Research Programme contains far fewer specific programmes than the fifth and I should like to ask you why?
What are the reasons?
We therefore have fewer specific programmes for the sectoral themes.
Up until now, we had one for biotechnology, one for energy, one for the environment, and so on.
In future that is all going to be under one roof.
Are you not afraid this will make the framework research programme less visible?
Is there not also a danger that the lobbies representing various professional groups and sectors will be less involved in the Sixth Framework Programme because they are not clear what area it falls under?
My question is: Can you give us the reasons why you have fewer specific programmes this time than last?
