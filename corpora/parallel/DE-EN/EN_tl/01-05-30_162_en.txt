Mr President, my favourite Commissioner, when I bought new tyres for my car six months ago I decided to buy tyres with a 71 decibel noise rating.
That is 3 decibels less than we are to adopt for the year 2005 tomorrow.
Mr Commissioner, I am at a loss to explain to anyone why there are already tyres on the market that are 3 decibels below the standard we are to adopt for 2005.
Some say the tyre may be quiet, but it is unsafe and also uses more fuel.
That is not true!
The tyre I bought has a rolling resistance far below the average and it also has grip values and aquaplaning values that are much better than the average.
It is therefore a quiet, low consumption and, at the same time, safe tyre.
It is also advertised on the tyre itself - I think rightly so: reducing CO2.
So more can be done than proposed.
To that extent I find the compromise just about acceptable.
You and the Commission really ought to go and look at what is available on the market.
Then you should put forward as soon as possible a fresh proposal for a further reduction in noise - while maintaining the standard of safety - and I think Parliament will then happily go that way with you.
