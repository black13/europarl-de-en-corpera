Mr President, I should like to expressly thank you for pointing out that the rapporteur' s speaking time must not be used to express personal opinions - let alone in such a sharp way that is almost defamatory!
I should like to protest that I as an MP, which is what I am - I shall be speaking on behalf of my group later - get what amounts to a ban on speaking for expressing an opinion on the subject that I have never concealed.
I also have the right to sign for the group amendments that my group supports.
Please also note that a rapporteur also has to maintain a certain neutrality and represent the opinion of the committee.
I am speaking here as a Member of Parliament and not as the chair, and I have not signed anywhere as chair.
I must ask that these be kept separate and that the work not be confused in this way.
We actually have quite a good climate in the committee.
I am rather shaken by the way things are proceeding here this evening!
