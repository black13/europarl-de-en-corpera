Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people die on our roads in Europe every year.
As MEPs we therefore have a great responsibility to work for greater safety on the roads.
We also know, however, that traffic is increasing from year to year and one of the consequences of this is that it becomes a greater source of danger.
In my opinion, the question of the compulsory wearing of safety belts has a crucial part to play.
In general, I am very much in agreement with the Commission' s proposal for improving the safety of drivers and passengers.
I also agree in principle that it should be compulsory for safety belts to be fastened at all times in all seats that are fitted with them or with the basic requirement that seats fitted with safety belts or child restraint systems should be used.
I also see it as a fundamental obligation that restraint systems should be used for children under 12.
I should like to note, however, that Member States need to be given some leeway for the national transposition of the directive on certain points.
I am thinking of the use of restraint systems for very small children.
I am also thinking of medical reasons and of quite specific situations such as the requirements for minibuses and coaches which the rapporteur has also mentioned.
More details would be taking us too far here.
Harmonisation of legislation at European level will make for transparency and clarity and improve the various national regulations.
All in all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on this report, which I think is also a very balanced one, and I can already assure you today that my group will agree to this report.
I should like to point out, however, that the detailed transposition of the directive must now be undertaken by the Member States and in the end it is the Member States who are responsible for safety on Europe' s roads.
