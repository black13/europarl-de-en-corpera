Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just one point will suffice to make clear to you my committee' s disappointment.
I represent fisheries policy.
This is one of the few European policies, however, that lie in the sole competence of the Community.
As a result, all the legislation coming out of Brussels in this sector affects the Union' s citizens directly.
The democratic deficit of which we rightly complain is all the more obvious to all concerned.
We, Parliament, the only institution legitimised by popular vote, continue to be denied any real involvement in making those laws.
I am referring to the codecision procedure, which, despite our demands, has still not been opened up for fisheries policy.
The future of Europe' s fisheries from 2003 is being rewritten at this very moment.
I therefore particularly want to reiterate, indeed to emphasise, our pre-Nice position today in the post-Nice era.
A mere consultation of Parliament is not enough.
We want to be really involved in defining the most important themes.
We therefore emphatically call for the codecision rules to be taken into Articles 32 to 38 of the EC Treaty and ask for your support!
I find there continues to be a further deficit in Parliament' s involvement in fisheries matters when it comes to concluding international agreements.
We demand that the European Parliament' s assent be made mandatory for international agreements negotiated by the Commission, which do after all have an impact on the budget.
Finally, we want our own title in the EC Treaty, all that, dear Elmar, in addition to agricultural policy.
It is only logical.
Only then will we be able to keep up with all the rules and regulations of that now highly developed European policy!
