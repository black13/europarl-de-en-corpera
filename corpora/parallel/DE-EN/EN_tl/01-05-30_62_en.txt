Mr President, I should also like to applaud the rapporteurs in particular because they did not give way to the temptation, perhaps even the pressure from a largish number of parliamentarians, to demonise the outcome of Nice as a knee-jerk reaction, but rather endeavoured to make an objective critique.
Almost everything has already been said about Nice.
I should like, however, to take up one thing that Mr Poettering touched upon but did not really emphasise.
I consider the call for the Intergovernmental Conference proposed in Nice for 2004 to be brought forward to 2003 to be mistaken.
The arguments put forward for that are not convincing.
For one thing we also have important elections in Europe in 2003.
Secondly - and there is extensive agreement about this despite differing ideas about the run-up to it - the next Intergovernmental Conference is to be of short duration.
It can therefore easily be accommodated after the elections to the European Parliament.
Above all, however, the best way to meet the desire for a broadly-based discussion about the future of the Union would be to make it a subject of the election campaign.
Bringing the meeting forward looks like evading the electorate and the electorate will see it that way.
Be warned!
