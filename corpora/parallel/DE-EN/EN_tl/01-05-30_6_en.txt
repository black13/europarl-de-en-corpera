Madam President, I should like to address the same issue.
The bad thing about the renewal of these ENFOPOL plans is that they go much further than was planned three years ago.
It will no longer only be traffic data and content data - that is the header of an e-mail and the content - that are monitored, but many, many more details down to credit card details, and IP-ports, which would enable everything on the computer to be monitored.
In other words, there would be no part of the communication that was not monitored.
That was not even mentioned in the documents before the Council.
We have no way of getting hold of the information!
It appears that, because of a formal error, the actual decision has not yet been taken.
It can be taken at any time, however, and no further meeting is required for the purpose.
I should like to repeat the call.
We need to debate this.
We have just had a committee of inquiry into Echelon and we are angry that the NSA and other secret services are violating fundamental rights.
What is happening is that something much worse is being planned in the EU and absolutely everything can be monitored!
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
