Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, achieving genuine equality for women and men is one of the most important social and political tasks.
Women still suffer discrimination in the labour market.
Women still earn less than men.
Women are under-represented in senior management.
Throughout Europe, unemployment is higher among women than men.
Mrs Hautala's report is an important contribution to equal opportunities.
However, I believe that the directive should take more aspects of women's working lives into account.
The proposed reform does not go far enough.
For example, it fails to provide regulations on equal employment conditions for women.
Women must have equal pay for work of equal value!
We need targeted re-integration measures after career breaks.
I work actively to ensure that women and men have equal opportunities in every area of society.
I urge the Council and the Commission to adopt measures to achieve these objectives.
