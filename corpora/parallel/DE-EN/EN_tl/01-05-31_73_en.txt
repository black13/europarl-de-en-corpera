I would have liked to vote for the motion for a resolution on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the European Union, with our group's proposals for amendments, if I had had the opportunity to make it clear, through a recorded vote, which points I cannot support under any circumstances.
I do not believe - in common with the former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, incidentally - that we should have a European Constitution as long as there are individual states with their own constitutions and as long as there is no European nation.
Nor am I one of those people who regret the fact that at Nice, the rules on qualified majority voting were not extended to taxation.
We have not yet reached a stage where an accidental majority in this House could agree, over the heads of the national parliaments, the types and levels of taxation to be levied by the Member States.
I would therefore have wished to vote against this provision in a recorded vote as well.
In this House, I have always supported the principle that decisions on fundamental and constitutional matters must be unanimous.
I would therefore have liked to vote, in a recorded vote, against the paragraph which states - quite incorrectly - that this would undermine the social and political deepening of the Union.
In order to make my views on this issue very clear, I was unable to vote for the resolution as a whole.
