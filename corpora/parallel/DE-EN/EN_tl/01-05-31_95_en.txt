The effectiveness of the use of seat belts and restraint systems in vehicles to reduce severe injury and death is widely recognised.
This applies especially to the use of child restraint systems.
The Commission's proposal and the Committee's proposals for amendments improve and expand upon the existing Council Directive 91/671/EEC of 16 December 1991:
1.
Drivers and passengers in all vehicles on the road must wear seat belts where provided.
2.
All the existing exemptions for restraint systems, in particular for children, are eliminated.
3.
The child's physical size is taken into account as a parameter for the use of seat belts.
4.
Rear-facing child restraint systems which are fitted to the front passenger seat are only permitted if the airbag has been deactivated.
5.
Better information to be supplied to the public.
Despite the omission of important points such as
attachments for child restraint systems to be fitted as standard in all vehicles,
detection systems to be introduced to indicate whether the front passenger airbag has been deactivated,
identifying the best way of providing information on seat belts and restraint systems in vehicles,
my group fully supports the report.
