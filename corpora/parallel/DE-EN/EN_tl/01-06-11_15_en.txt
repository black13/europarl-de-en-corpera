Madam President, I have another question regarding Wednesday.
Due to our ill-judged decision to cancel Friday, for which you cannot be held responsible, we now have to begin at 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday.
We are on the way to a five-day Wednesday!
We might as well start at midnight on Tuesday and work right through until 8.30 a.m.
However, I rise to address the issue of Question Time again.
Question Time with the Commission has been cut yet again.
We always prepare ourselves very carefully so that we put specific questions to specific Commissioners.
This was enforced by this House during a reform of Question Time years ago.
We have thus addressed questions to specific Commissioners, and I see that apart from a single question to Mr Kinnock, everything has been thrown into one enormous pot.
The attendance of all the other Commissioners at this Question Time, which was scheduled six months ago, has been cancelled without substitution.
I would like to know why this is the case.
