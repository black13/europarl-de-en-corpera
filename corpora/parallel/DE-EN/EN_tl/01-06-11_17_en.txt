Madam President, with your permission, I rise for the first time here in connection with the Rules of Procedure.
I wish to propose that we include a debate on the impact of the referendum in Ireland as a separate agenda item.
In my view, the referendum in Ireland offers this House the unique opportunity to shape democracy and intervene immediately in the current debate, rather than always following after the event.
Nice resulted in too little democracy and failed to create a sound basis for enlargement.
We need more than this now, and with the help of the Irish people, we can re-open this debate.
This is the reason for this motion to amend the agenda: we move that a separate agenda item be included to debate the impact of Nice, our positions as parliamentarians with regard to our own willingness to create more democracy in Europe, and the finality of Europe.
Europe's citizens would not understand if we shirked this issue at this time.
