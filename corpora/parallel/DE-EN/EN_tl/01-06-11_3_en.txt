Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have a comment about the Minutes.
In the Annex to the Minutes, in the Texts Adopted, on the Méndes de Vigo report - I am just looking for my papers and of course cannot find anything now - it states at one point that a European constitution should be drafted.
This goes back to a proposal for an amendment by Mr Brok.
When I checked with Mr Brok, he confirmed that he did not choose this phrase in his proposal for an amendment.
I would therefore request that the proposals for amendments be used to check again whether this theme has now been included correctly in the final Méndes De Vigo document in all the languages, as we obviously want to avoid any misinterpretations here.
