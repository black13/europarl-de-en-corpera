Madam President, I am sorry, but something seems to have got lost in translation.
My question was very precise.
I wanted to know why, out of the three Commissioners who were scheduled to participate in Question Time with the Commission, two have been cancelled and all the questions addressed specifically to these Commissioners, such as Mrs Schreyer, have been bundled together under 'General Matters' , where they have no chance of being answered.
That was my question.
