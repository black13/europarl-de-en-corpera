Madam President, I would like to come back to a less amusing issue than the exchange which we have heard during the last five minutes.
I wish to ask whether there have been any further developments concerning the application for the removal of Mr Dell'Utri's immunity since the last Parliamentary session.
After all, since 8.30 this morning, we have been deprived of the other case, to the great regret of our colleagues in the PPE-DE, so I am told.
I would like to ask you this: since the last Parliamentary session, have you received any documentation from the Spanish authorities concerning the application for the removal of Mr Dell'Utri's immunity?
If so, have you already forwarded this documentation to the committee responsible?
If not, do you intend - now that a further month has passed since May - to take any initiatives to request the Spanish authorities no longer to block the process initiated by the Spanish judiciary?
