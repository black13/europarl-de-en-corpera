Madam President, thank you for permitting me to rise again.
I greatly regret the fact that my only opportunity to put a question to you regarding the Dell'Utri case is at the opening of Parliament during the discussion of the agenda.
As a simple Member of this House, there is no other opportunity to raise this type of issue.
I have been accused on several occasions in this House of only having an interest in this matter due to the Italian election campaign.
The election campaign is now over, and so I would like to come back to the Dell'Utri case since it has great significance for every Member of this House.
An application for the removal of immunity could be lodged tomorrow against any Member of this Parliament - against me, against Mr Poettering, against Mr Haarder, against Mrs Frahm, against any one of us - and, in order to avoid public speculation, the Member concerned must have the opportunity to make a direct statement about the accusations.
For the last nine months, Mr Dell'Utri has been denied the opportunity to make a statement on the accusations made against him here.
This is why it could be quite important to tell the Spanish authorities that the way in which the Spanish government deals with applications for the removal of immunity submitted to this House is also a matter of honour in its relations with the European Parliament.
One further point, Madam President: in Europe, where there is a separation of powers, it is accepted that the judiciary can approach the legislature direct.
There is only one Parliament where it is claimed that the executive must have a proviso in such cases, and that is this Parliament.
This is an absurd situation for which I hold you, Mrs Fontaine, entirely responsible.
