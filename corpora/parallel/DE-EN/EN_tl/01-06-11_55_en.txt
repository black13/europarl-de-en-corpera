Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, our debate today concerns a highly sensitive issue: the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
Both are on the increase.
For this reason, we must engage in closer cross-border cooperation, work far more intensively to prevent such crimes through information and awareness-raising, and try to include society in this process to a greater extent.
Of course, it is also important to amend our criminal law and ensure that it functions on a cross-border basis, as trafficking, abuse and child pornography operate across borders as well.
We believe that various measures are necessary for this purpose.
The penalty, that is, the term of imprisonment, should be increased from a minimum of eight to a minimum of 10 years, with stiffer penalties being imposed when the victim is under 16, rather than under 10.
I cannot understand what is meant by the reference to child abuse involving 'particular ruthlessness' .
Any form of child abuse is ruthless!
There is no such thing as 'mild' child abuse.
Anything that happens to a child in this context is ruthless.
That is why I believe that the age limit should be raised to a minimum of 16, as the harm suffered by children is just as profound whether they are under 10, or 11, 12 or 13 years of age.
I am therefore in favour of raising the age limit to 16.
Victim protection for these children must also be safeguarded, not only for the children but also for the families and the witnesses.
Legal assistance and psychological support are very important.
Children should also be given the opportunity to make their witness statements on video, which is unfortunately not the practice in every country.
Sadly, there is not enough time for further comments.
However, I would like to thank everyone who supports the work in this field.
