Madam President, we found it very difficult indeed to put forward this proposal, especially as we are always keen to cooperate, also with Mrs Hautala, as far as politically possible.
However, we wanted to have enough time for the debate on Gothenburg, which is why we have proposed that the Wuori report be postponed until the mini-session.
This is therefore not a substantive objection; it is simply a matter of having more time to prepare the important Summit in Gothenburg.
