Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the content of these two reports, and also wish to thank the Commission for its initiatives to combat these appalling crimes: the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
It is right that we should think not only about how to define child pornography and sexual exploitation but also to what extent and where we set the age limits.
It is also right that we should discuss the maximum penalties.
I support the proposals put forward in the report.
However, I should like to draw your attention to a further point - and I am grateful that it has been included in the reports - namely the problem of minimum, rather than just maximum, penalties.
A society's condemnation of a crime is reflected to a substantial extent in the minimum penalties it applies.
Even today, in many cases of child pornography crimes, the inadequate minimum penalties available mean that a suspended sentence is imposed.
However, child pornography is certainly not a crime where a suspended sentence is appropriate.
I therefore call for this House, through its cooperation on defining adequate minimum sentences, to create conditions which ensure that society genuinely recognises that these crimes are the worst form of harm that can be inflicted on a child.
Together, through these initiatives, we should lay the foundation stones for this awareness within the European Union.
