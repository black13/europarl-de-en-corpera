Mr President, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs - in agreement, I believe, with the supporting committees, namely the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Industry - wish to recommend rejection.
We did not receive early notification.
We have only had the texts since Friday.
We are being asked to approve this aid for the first time, and it is not entirely clear which other parts of the budget some of this money is supposed to come from.
For that reason, the matter requires due political consideration.
At the same time, however, may I say that we shall make every effort to ensure that a decision can be taken at the plenary part-session in July, and we shall make the necessary preparations to that end.
Accordingly, we recommend the rejection of this request.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
