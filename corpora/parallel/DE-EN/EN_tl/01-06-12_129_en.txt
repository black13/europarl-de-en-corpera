Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Seattle we learned that the world is changing.
I believe we have to accept that certain decisions of the past require revision.
The European Parliament is responsible for monitoring the common trade policy.
We have co-decision rights on matters relating to the single market.
But on important international trade issues, the Union is not such a model of democratic transparency.
I believe that Sweden, which is itself a model of transparency, is called upon as the present incumbent of the presidency to take us another step along this road.
It is quite simply imperative to guarantee an open and transparent decision-making process on the basis of Article 133.
We know that the European Union, after enlargement and the forthcoming final stage of the switch to the euro, will be the world' s foremost trading bloc by a considerable margin.
In the United States, it is apparent that cooperation between the Government, the President and Congress actually works very well and that information flows freely between them.
Cooperation between the Council and the Commission is very good at the present time; Mr Lamy must be complimented for this.
I do wish, however, that the Council would also take joint initiatives with the European Parliament on the international stage, because these issues are of the utmost importance to our future.
One day, when our membership has risen from 15 to a greater number of States, our clout will increase, and I believe that the link with the roots of the Union' s legitimacy in its Member States is an essential democratic requirement.
If we want to develop a global market for our goods, such an effort will ultimately affect all of us.
In other words, we must stand shoulder to shoulder as equal partners and strive for success.
