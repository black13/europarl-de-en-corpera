Mr President, since Mr Danielsson addressed me directly, I should like to reply to two points.
Firstly, let me express my thanks to the Swedish Presidency for the recent invitation from the Swedish Ambassador in Brussels to informal talks with the members of the 'Article 133' Committee.
This, however, was a cocktail party, not a meeting, and I pointed out to several people, including the chairman of the ambassadors' group, that it was perhaps not an ideal arrangement to hold the event on a Thursday evening, when the Members of Parliament were returning to their constituencies at the end of a plenary week.
But these things can be rectified, and another weekday could be chosen next time.
That is the first point.
Thank you for the initiative of your diplomats.
Secondly, you said that things will have to be changed - not now but in 2004.
But please remember, Mr Danielsson, that we now have a round of international trade negotiations in Qatar, and we have a ministerial meeting at which the U.S. Congress will be represented.
The U.S. Congress, however, has not yet approved the 'fast track' proposal.
This means that the U.S. Congress currently has direct participatory powers in Qatar.
We in the European Parliament are no longer receiving sufficient information from you.
Compare your conduct, the conduct of the Swedish Presidency, with that of the members of the U.S. Administration, who now speak to the Members of Congress virtually on a daily basis, week in, week out.
You no longer have any national control; you no longer have any European control ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
