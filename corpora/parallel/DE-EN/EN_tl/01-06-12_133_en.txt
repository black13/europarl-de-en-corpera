Mr President, I am grateful for the fact that we are having this debate, but I should just like to make two points.
I am in the same boat as my fellow Members, in that I was only informed of one of the meetings to which the Council presidency invited us.
We were, of course, delighted to receive the invitation.
But it was indeed a cocktail party on Thursday afternoon, with all the attendant difficulties.
When I arrived, the door was already closed.
There was something I had to discuss beforehand and could not make it for the start of the gathering.
It would be very good of you, Mr Danielsson, to make a proposal next time for a better arrangement that would enable all of us to be present.
As for the second meeting you mentioned, I should be grateful if you would remind us which meeting that was.
I know nothing about any other meeting.
Konrad Schwaiger did not refer to it, presumably because he knows nothing about it either.
Would you perhaps be so kind as to tell us which meeting it was that you invited our committee to attend?
There is another point on which I am at one with my fellow Members, and I know that this is not a question but a brief comment: I wish you would truly regard this Parliament as a heavyweight in the political ring and treat it accordingly.
We fully understand that we do not yet have the means or the right to demand such treatment, but I believe you can regard us from a political point of view as an equal partner.
