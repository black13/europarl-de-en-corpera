Mr President, this report makes it possible for the European Parliament to debate the ASEM process and comment on its results.
This new partnership between Europe and Asia gives both sides a golden opportunity to deepen and strengthen relations, in respect not only of the economy, but also political, social and cultural matters.
As early as the third ASEM Summit in Seoul political aspects such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law were successfully promoted from being the subject of a fruitful dialogue between the partners in the ASEM process to prompting relevant undertakings from leading ASEM politicians.
It will come as no surprise to anyone to learn that our Parliament, which has made these values the focus of its work for years, attaches quite particular importance to these same values being respected by the Council and the Commission and to the Council and the Commission doing all they can to make these values part and parcel of the ongoing political dialogue with our Asian partners in the ASEM process.
At a time when the European Union is almost talking about nothing else but enlargement, it is, I believe, very appropriate to say that this ASEM process and the circle of partners within it should also be extended to include states like India, which might also be deemed to have earned a place in this dialogue.
I should like to address two points which, in my view, have wrongly become the subject of talks with and occasional protests on the part of the Chinese Embassy.
Our requiring Taiwan's politicians to have visas for private visits to Europe does not amount to recognition of the Republic of Taiwan or in fact anything at all; it is the pursuance of a consistent policy which Europe has on the freedom of movement of people, consistent in particular if in the future Taiwan were also to follow in China's footsteps and become a member of the World Trade Organisation.
Finally, Commissioner, I should like to draw your attention to an old demand of the European Parliament: we have always said that with a region such as Taiwan, with which we in Europe have very intensive economic relations, our relations are such as to warrant a representation, that is an information office, being set up there.
