Mr President, rapprochement and cooperation will only be successful if we strive for mutual respect and partnership in the Asia process.
We know how much effort Parliament has put into producing this report.
I should like to point out a number of facts.
Firstly, the history of the 20th Century has left deep wounds in Asia which have not yet healed.
The bloody suppression of the Boxer Uprising in China, the occupation of Manchuria, the Korean War and the aggression against Vietnam are all inextricably linked with the names of states which belong to the exclusive club of the great countries of this world: the USA, Germany and Japan.
The EU has a peculiar way of perceiving the role and responsibility of states if, given this historical background, it wishes for example to assign Japan a kind of policeman's role in Asia.
It is equally disconcerting that the EU is not distancing itself more decisively from the confrontation course which the USA is adopting, for example with its spy planes, against China.
I should like to make a second point.
In Asia, the future depends largely on there being harmonious relations and a balance of interests between China, India and also Russia.
Any attempts to play these countries off against each other would seem to me to be very dangerous, including and even in particular for Europe!
A sustainable Asian policy must be directed at partnership and constructive dialogue, and not least with the People's Republic of China.
Anyone who relies now on short-term interests and gaining a quick advantage will not in the long term be able to make a decisive political contribution to establishing peace, cooperation and partnership between Europe and Asia.
