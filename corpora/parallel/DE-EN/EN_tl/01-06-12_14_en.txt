Mr President, Commissioner, the European Food Authority is of fundamental importance to the people in our Community.
This is what we have been telling each other repeatedly for many months now - adding for emphasis that it is high time, after the many scandals of the past, to restore the confidence of the people of Europe in their daily bread, from whatever source it reaches their tables.
Every day that goes by without this new authority taking up its duties in the service of food safety is a day wasted, a missed opportunity to protect public health in the European Union.
This is why we must expedite our preparatory work.
We must ensure that the Food Authority is operational at the start of next year.
The need for haste, however, must not impair the quality of the legislative groundwork.
The European Food Authority requires stable legal foundations, so that it does not become the pawn of any special interests even before it begins its work.
For this reason, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and leave the whole Regulation in the realm of the codecision procedure.
The mechanism of restricting the European Parliament to a consultative role when it comes to deciding on the seat of the authority is a piece of shoddy workmanship.
It also betrays the intention of prompting a bout of horse-trading between interested parties with widely differing motives, which can only be detrimental to our Food Authority.
Let us therefore put paid to the plans of Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, who has already let it be known through the press that he wants Luxembourg to be given the Food Authority as compensation for the loss of other European bodies.
Please vote for Amendment No 215, which seeks to guarantee a uniform legal basis and to preclude the pursuit of extraneous objectives.
