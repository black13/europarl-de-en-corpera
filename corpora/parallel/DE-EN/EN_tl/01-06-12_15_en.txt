Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has tabled an amendment in plenary, in which we note that the establishment of this authority is not an anticipated expense.
We also note that it cannot be funded without a revision of the Financial Perspective or a reduction of other appropriations under heading 3.
The amendment has its origins in the Committee on Budgets.
It is important for us to make the point that everything we do must be affordable.
Sadly, the Environment Committee has chosen not to embrace several of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets.
One of these was the time-honoured amendment that the Committee on Budgets keeps tabling for the inclusion of a recital emphasising the indispensability of transparency, scrutiny and compliance with budgetary procedure.
Some agencies are still in a sorry state in this respect.
The Environment Committee has also decided that the authority should be financed from the general budget alone.
There is a desire to keep the authority independent.
This may be a noble aim, but it is unrealistic.
The fact is that we have agencies such as those on medicinal products and standardisation which are financed by means of contributions, and nobody would suggest that they have been infiltrated.
The Committee on Budgets did, however, see a great deal of sense in the proposal that an examination be undertaken after three years to establish whether it would be possible and advisable to levy fees.
This means, of course, that a decision to introduce fees was not taken.
The proposal that contributions to staff pensions be entered on the receipts side of the Commission budget has also fallen by the wayside.
Another amendment that was not adopted is our proposed requirement that the Member State hosting the Food Authority should make a financial contribution or contribute some of the land for its headquarters.
And the Authority is to present a draft budget each year.
