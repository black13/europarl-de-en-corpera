Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Commissioner Lamy very much for this initiative.
It is, I believe, an initiative which once again shows far-sightedness and which attempts to solve problems which we all know lie ahead before they even arise.
We all know that we can only enjoy success in world trade if we offer products and services which are also actually bought.
Hence my question: thanks to trade on the Internet we have now attained a very high level of activity internationally in the small consignments sector.
In Europe we have 18 million employers in a labour force of 250 million.
Could you envisage our putting in place appropriate measures for individual small consignments up to a certain number of euros, so that this small-scale trade is also able to develop completely freely, without barriers and without excessive bureaucracy?
