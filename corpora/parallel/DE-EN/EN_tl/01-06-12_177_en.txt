Mr President, thank you for your comments, Commissioner Lamy.
In making them you have already answered part of the first question which I am about to put to you.
I should like to come back once more to the system of incentives in the GSP, in the generalised system of preferences, which has of course been extended to social policy and the environment.
From what I have heard, this programme - which I consider to be very sensible - has not yet met with the desired response in the countries concerned.
At this early stage, and leaving aside the fact that the scheme does not of course impose any negative penalties, do you have any indications why the response has been so poor?
The second question is: has an assessment been made of the extent to which the large free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, which is of course planned by the USA and within which it is intended to reduce tariffs to zero would - if it ever becomes a reality - impair or stimulate trade with us in particular in the generalised system of preferences?
Has the Commission already considered this?
I have one final question on the WTO: recently it was written that people would actually welcome a decision in Qatar to open a new negotiating round in various sectors.
Can you say anything more about this?
