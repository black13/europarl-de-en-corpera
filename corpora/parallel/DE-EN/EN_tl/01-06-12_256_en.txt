Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I should first like to thank you for clarifying that the sanctions against Austria were not imposed by the Council or any other European institution.
I believe that this is very important because of course the decision of the Heads of State and Government had no legal base and was made without hearing the aggrieved party.
It was therefore an inappropriate course of action, the like of which has actually never occurred before in the European Union.
That is why I would be interested to know whether you, in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, believe that this decision against Austria was actually also the reason for the no vote in Ireland last week.
