Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations and discussions on these proposals for draft regulations on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution and fire have been ongoing within our institutions for almost two years.
The original purpose of these proposals was simply to change the legal basis of the existing regulations in this sector following a ruling of the European Court of Justice.
In addition, both measures expire at the end of this year.
The Commission supports the Council's common position of 26 February, which for the most part is in fact in line with your own amended proposals on this matter.
I therefore hope that Parliament will be able to accept the rapporteur's recommendation - and I should like to take this opportunity to thank her very much for her work - and also vote in favour of this common position.
