Madam President, not every Council initiative seeking to harmonise tax rules works to the benefit of the public.
There are frequent announcements of good intentions to simplify tax rules.
In actual fact, however, the measures are instead directed at keeping tax competition within the Union in check.
This is particularly true of all measures which seek to harmonise tax rates, for the simple reason that it is highly unlikely that it will be agreed to align with those countries which have lower tax rates.
Usually only the opposite approach is possible.
This means that states with leaner governments and lower rates of tax are actually forced to levy taxes which they do not even need.
This Council proposal to amend Directive 77/388 should be seen in a quite different light, because the purpose of the proposed measures is actually to simplify matters for taxpayers throughout Europe.
The amendments seek above all to reduce companies' administrative costs and thus strengthen competition.
For this reason we can support these amendments which contribute to a genuine simplification of our tax legislation.
