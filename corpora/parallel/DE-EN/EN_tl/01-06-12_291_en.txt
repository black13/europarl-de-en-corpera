Madam President, I should first like to thank the rapporteur very warmly for his painstaking preparation of the report.
The shadow rapporteurs no doubt also had a hand in this.
Neither are my thanks diminished by the fact that the rapporteur has called 32 Members, of which I am one, a group of narrow-minded individuals.
Nevertheless you will of course allow me first of all to repudiate this description here.
On behalf of a minority in our group, I should like to express a number of reservations which we have on the proposal.
It is proposed, in the extreme case, that an official who has worked in the Commission for ten years and who is 50 years of age be given early retirement with an allowance of 65% of his salary.
We do not believe that a lucrative, generous early retirement scheme of this kind can be justified to the European taxpayer.
When we have spent the whole day talking about the Irish referendum in the corridors and when we are always talking here about proximity to the people, may I please ask who can actually explain to a pensioner who has paid into a pension scheme for 40 years why a 50-year-old A3-grade official should be given EUR 5 500 to go for walks in the country?
No one is able to explain to me why the Commission, which has 18 000 posts, is nevertheless not in a position usefully to deploy 600 officials who are obviously no longer productive.
Neither is anyone able to tell me why this should now be an essential component of this Commission reform.
I fear, you see, that there will be crafty, shrewd and smart officials who will succeed in benefiting from this golden handshake.
In the end the good ones will go, the bad ones will stay, EUR 16 million will be spent and everyone will be disgraced!
