Mr President, if we had had this regulation ten or fifteen years ago and had adhered to it, if the Member States had applied it, there would have been no BSE.
That would have saved us billions, and it would have prevented a great deal of animal and human suffering.
After that introductory comment, may I also hand out a few bouquets.
First of all, let me thank Mrs Paulsen.
In my long years of parliamentary work, I have seldom experienced such close and constructive cooperation in a specialised political field.
It always gave me great pleasure to engage in the discussions about these amendments and proposed improvements to the text.
And let me also thank Commissioner Byrne.
Although his institution was somewhat slow to act, he himself then set to work vigorously and presented a good proposal.
But I must also thank the European Parliament, which has been very consistent on this issue - from the preparatory work of the Committee of Inquiry to the resolutions we have drawn up here; not least among the results of this consistent approach is the fact that we have now secured codecision rights in this domain.
I have the impression - and this is not meant to detract from your invaluable contribution, Mr Byrne - that, whenever the codecision procedure is applied, the Commission' s proposals are more concrete, more punctilious and better adapted from the outset to the wishes and the working methods of the European Parliament; these proposals serve as an example of the way we should be working here all the time.
In closing, let me say that the Agriculture Committee will take special care to ensure that imports to and exports from the European Union are subject to these strict safety precautions and that we obtain a funding system which will guarantee equal treatment for all farms in the European Union when it comes to disposing of high-risk substances.
