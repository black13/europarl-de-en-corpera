Mr President, animal by-products which are suitable in principle for human consumption must also continue to be available as animal feed once they have been properly processed.
I cannot understand why anyone would want to impose a permanent ban on this valuable source of protein.
I do, however, support the present temporary ban on the use of meat and bone meal in animal feed.
The current rules and checks must be strictly applied.
Once this is guaranteed, it should be possible to use meat and bone meal once again.
Another specific point concerns the use of leftovers from large restaurants and catering establishments.
For decades these leftovers have been used to produce a highly nutritious pig feed.
This must remain possible in future, which is why I support Amendment No 102 as tabled by the Greens.
Finally, let me say a few words on the avoidance of cannibalism in the feeding of animals.
I believe that the separation by species of material for processing into meat and bone meal would be very difficult to achieve.
Pigs, hens, fish and so on have no scruples about eating their own kind.
I am at a complete loss to understand why animals are now being expected to comply with human ethical standards.
I hope we shall remain realistic on this point, because the proposed compulsory separation of by-products by species will not enable us to prevent cannibalism among animals.
