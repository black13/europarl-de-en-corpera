Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises, the present Paulsen report on the health rules governing animal by-products not intended for human consumption has its place under the broad and essential umbrella for the protection of food safety and animal health.
The term 'by-products' as used here refers primarily to meat and bone meal.
In its proposal, the Commission formulated a conditional ban, in other words a graduated ban, on the use of meat and bone meal in feeds and fertilisers.
Mrs Paulsen has developed very effectively the ideas presented by the Commission.
The division into three categories is to be welcomed, as is the fact that the Commission only authorises the use of Category 1 meal in animal feed if it has been sterilised for 20 minutes at a temperature of 133ÂºC and a pressure of 3 bar.
The Commission proposal, as amended in committee, is therefore consistent with the demand of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE for strict separation of animal waste products into those that are basically fit for human consumption and those that come from infected and sick animals.
Healthy waste products from the abattoir are valuable providers of protein which we should not discard.
Omnivores really will eat everything.
We should not try to re-educate them.
As far as ruminants are concerned, it goes without saying that meat and bone meals are taboo.
We need responsibly applied and controlled technology for the production and processing of meat and bone meal, and we need still more research.
If we proceed on the basis of this regulation and transpose it in our Member States, we shall have built firm foundations from which we can go on to guarantee the safety of our foodstuffs and to ensure that our consumers are well supplied with good food.
