Mr President, may I congratulate Commissioner Byrne for fitting all that into a short space of time, but we did not catch much of it, because the interpreters found it impossible to keep up with the pace he set.
We must find some sort of a system to ensure that the comments made by members of the Commission actually reach our ears - either the speeches will have to be shortened or the Commissioners will have to be given more time to deliver them.
One way or the other, we cannot expect the House to make do with the present system.
It makes unreasonable demands of the Commissioner and of us who are trying to listen to him.
