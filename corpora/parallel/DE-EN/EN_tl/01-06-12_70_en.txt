Mr President, to my very great surprise, I have learned this morning that a group of three Vice-Presidents has decided to assign the issue of services of public interest, which is incontestably a competition matter, to the Legal Affairs Committee.
The Rules of Procedure state that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is responsible for competition matters.
The proposal in question, concerning services of public interest, was even presented by Mario Monti, the Commissioner responsible for competition.
Our rapporteur, Mr Langen, who has been working on this matter for several months and has now submitted a report, has just discovered to his astonishment that another committee is responsible.
I wish to say quite clearly here that a group of three Vice-Presidents has no authority to overturn the Rules of Procedure.
For this reason, I ask that we proceed in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and that the Conference of Presidents deal with this matter.
Unfortunately, it is not the only current issue concerning the competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is apparently being widened bit by bit.
This question must be settled once and for all, and the Conference of Presidents is the body to settle it, for the present situation is obstructing the proper discharge of our parliamentary duties.
(Applause)
