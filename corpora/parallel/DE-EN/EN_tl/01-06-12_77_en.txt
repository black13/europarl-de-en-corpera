Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of our own food authority is an essential signal to consumers, whose confidence in food products has been badly shaken in recent times.
Not only the Commission but every Member State too must have the legal power to appeal directly to the new authority.
That is logical.
The European Food Authority must operate independently of the Commission, so that it can intervene as quickly as possible in any crisis.
We have great expectations of this authority, and we want it to be staffed by independent experts who can offer the politicians a scientific basis that will enable them to make the right decisions and fully restore consumer confidence.
