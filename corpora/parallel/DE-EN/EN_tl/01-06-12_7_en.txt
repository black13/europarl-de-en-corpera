Mr President, I raised the matter of Question Time yesterday.
The President, as you will see from the Minutes, replied that too few questions had been received for two Commissioners, whose names were therefore removed from the list of speakers for Question Time.
I checked this out.
Mr Kinnock received only one question, yet his name remains on the list.
Mrs Schreyer took a question from me; she is not on the list, even though other Members, such as Mr Trakatellis, addressed questions to her.
So something is very much amiss in this whole business.
I should like you to look into this matter and provide me with some clear information tomorrow as to why Question Time was shortened.
