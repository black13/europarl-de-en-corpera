Mr President, may I say, as permanent rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets for the agencies, that the Committee on Budgets is satisfied with the document presented.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has accepted the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets on the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency.
I should like to start by outlining the context within which the following proposed amendments are set.
The structure of the agencies is such that finding a uniform line is no easy task when it comes to funding.
Nonetheless, the principles of the European Parliament require us to ensure that the authorities are efficient and transparent and control their costs.
With new agencies, we must ensure that their budget is managed along clear lines from the outset.
Now to the proposed amendments.
The first proposed amendment introduces a new recital on the subject of transparency and control.
Fundamental budgetary principles should apply to agencies because they implement EU policies, employ staff and are fully or partially dependent on Community subsidies.
Amendment No 2 clarifies that we expect the Member State to contribute towards the premises of local offices.
The third proposed amendment contains provisions governing the adoption of the agency's budget.
Control is exercised on the part of the European Parliament through the Committee on Budgets and how funding is provided.
We must ensure that the Agency is not given too much independence.
As permanent rapporteur for the agencies, I know that, if agencies are too independent, they take too much on themselves and overshoot their objective and their actual remit.
