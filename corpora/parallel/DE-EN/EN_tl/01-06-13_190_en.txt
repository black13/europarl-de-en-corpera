Mr President, honourable members, ladies and gentlemen, following the new restrictions on the use of meat and bonemeal in feedingstuffs in the wake of the BSE crisis and at the request of the Nice European Council and the Agriculture Council, the Commission has thoroughly investigated the supply of and demand for oil and protein crops.
The European Council expressly stated in its conclusions that any proposals for measures need to respect the financial perspectives.
Our findings are contained in the Commission communication to the Council of 16 March on options for promoting the cultivation of protein crops in the European Union.
According to simulations carried out by the Commission services, a significant increase in aid per hectare for protein crops would only have a very limited effect on the areas cultivated in the Community.
The main reason for this very slight increase is that cereals are much more attractive crops and greater increases in world market prices are forecast for cereals than for protein crops.
In order to promote organic farming, the Community has allowed fodder pulses to be used on holdings which comply strictly with organic farming standards.
Whether or not more products containing GMOs will be farmed in future depends on licensing arrangements and consumer acceptance in the Community.
In the final analysis, market trends will obviously be the deciding factor.
