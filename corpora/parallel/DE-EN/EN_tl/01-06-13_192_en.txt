I can gladly give the honourable Member this assurance because you must bear the following in mind: not all the meat and bonemeal produced in the past was used in feedingstuffs.
Half a million tonnes of meat and bonemeal were exported every year and another half a million tonnes of meat and bonemeal were used to make dog and cat food every year.
Only the remainder was used in feedingstuffs.
If you then also bear in mind that, recently, more soya was used than was needed for nutritional purposes, because the feedingstuff manufacturers calculated that it was in their interest to do so, then the protein balance in feedingstuffs barely changes.
The amendment to the ban on feeding fishmeal and meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry accounts for less than 3% in the import system in terms of volume.
Less than 3% is simply not enough to trigger huge speculation or somehow put the Community under pressure.
