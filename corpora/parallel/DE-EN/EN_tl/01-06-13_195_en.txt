Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by reminding the House that the principle of subsidiarity has to be respected in structural policy.
But this also means that, when restructuring plans are being programmed, it is the individual Member State which is initially responsible for drafting the plans and submitting them to the Commission.
Obviously, the Commission works in close liaison with individual national authorities in such cases.
In principle, more funds could be used to resolve the problems caused by the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco failed to materialise.
First and foremost, of course, the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, which can be used to apply for Community grants for the fleets and the fishermen and shipowners affected.
In addition, aid can also be granted within the framework of the European Regional Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Guidance Fund in order to diversify into other activities in the coastal regions affected.
In all events, we need to start by deciding on the measures and then calculate how much money is needed.
And, in view of the conclusions of the European Council in Nice, the Commission is currently checking if additional funds are available for restructuring the fleets affected within the framework of the current financial perspectives.
