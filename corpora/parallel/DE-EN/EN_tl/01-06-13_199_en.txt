Mr President, I did not quite understand from the translation who exactly has been lining their pockets.
But I assume that you meant certain Moroccan forces were lining their pockets.
Is that correct, Mr Varela?
I see.
I have to say that I am not familiar with the details of the accusations which have been or are being made.
But I can assure you that one of the main reasons we said a new agreement had to be set on a new financing basis and a new funding method had to be found was in order to preclude any such suspicions from the outset.
That is why we were keen not to do the same in this new agreement as we had in earlier agreements, i.e. to pay out the money without earmarking it for a specific purpose.
Part of the negotiations involved earmarking these funds.
Then, of course, the Moroccan side would have had to maintain records of how it had deployed the funds.
I think this needs to be the general model for the future.
We really cannot agree to provide funds when some or practically all the money paid is clearly being used to develop their own sector without any accounts being rendered as to how these funds have been used.
