Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the real value of the Nice Treaty is that it ushers in a phase of genuine reform of the Union - indispensable reform if the Community is to be prepared for enlargement.
I shall welcome any more accurate timetable for enlargement to come out of Gothenburg, although to name specific candidate countries would be irresponsible, given the negotiating chapters still outstanding and the Irish vote.
The Irish vote demands sensible reaction and analysis, even if only 33% of the electorate voted.
This is not democratic fiddle-faddle.
Wrongly interpreted, the result of the referendum implies that the Irish voted against enlargement.
But what they voted on was the Nice Treaty.
There have been numerous setbacks in the history of the Union: Denmark's no, Great Britain's policy during the first BSE crisis, the resignation of the Commission and the illegal sanctions against Austria.
We must make a careful analysis of the reasons behind the Irish vote, which begs the question of what is wrong with the European project.
We do not just need a public debate on the reform of the Union; we need more democracy and greater transparency on an integration process which is becoming ever more complex.
The involvement of the national parliaments as the representatives of European democracy is a key point here.
