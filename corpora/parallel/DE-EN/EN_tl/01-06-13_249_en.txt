Mr President, following intensive negotiations and an excellent job by Mr Busk, we are now in a position to debate his report here in Parliament.
On behalf of my group, I should like to thank both him and Mr Maat for their work.
I think that the compromise proposals negotiated will bring us another step forward in improving how pigs are kept.
But it is and remains just a compromise.
Optimum demands, often couched in emotional terms, are self-evident but cannot be implemented as they stand.
In the final analysis, every new legal framework has a huge impact on the people affected.
It is important here for us to have flexible transition times.
Adjusting to other or new animal husbandry systems takes time and, more importantly, costs money.
The conditions of competition are particular harsh in the pig production sector.
I should like briefly to address another two points: first, extra space for fattening pigs and, secondly, castration.
Neither is covered by the Commission proposal but I think that the European Parliament should set higher standards for the protection of animals here.
The 1997 Scientific Veterinary Committee report on the welfare of pigs gives us a starting point here, especially for the space which fattening pigs require.
We would not be able to get the general ban on the castration of pigs which some people are calling for across to German consumers in my view.
Whether or not double vaccination of males can replace castration only time will tell.
But I think this is the most practical solution.
As far as the timetable is concerned, I think we have found an acceptable compromise.
Holdings will have time to change their production methods over a fairly long period of time.
Finally, I call on the House to adopt the report as it stands.
