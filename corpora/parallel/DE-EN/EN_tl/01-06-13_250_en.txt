Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, when we received the Commission proposal, we were somewhat undecided in committee as to whether we should deal with it at all because, with all due respect, it was very insubstantial.
We received a poor quality, inadequate document and considered whether we should return it to sender and ask for a reasonable proposal on the protection of pigs.
But it must be said, Mr Busk, that you deserve our warmest congratulations on your work.
That includes Mr Maat and Mr Kindermann, who helped with the compromise amendments.
Now we have a proper proposal and, once again, Parliament has done a good job.
It is also a good thing that we intend to adopt it now because, had we decided otherwise and rejected the proposal, animal protection associations would again have accused farmers of wanting to stonewall, of wanting to put commercial interests first.
But that was never our intention; we want to implement animal protection, obviously in tandem with farmers' commercial interests.
As Mr Sturdy just said, we obviously need to ensure that the standards which we set at home also apply to products imported into the European Union.
In this sense, we have to work towards reasonable external protection which adopts a qualified version of what we describe here as the European way in agriculture and have again implemented in such detail here.
