Madam President, we have discussed this at great length and negotiated with Mr Oostlander in person.
We do not agree with this oral amendment.
Unfortunately, it is the UCK, not the 'so-called UCK' , and they are 'armed groups' , not 'allied groups' which is why we oppose the oral amendment.
(More than twelve Members rose to oppose these oral amendments being taken into consideration) - On the subject of Amendment No 41
