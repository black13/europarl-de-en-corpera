Mr President, may I jump the queue and ask Mr Posselt a question?
I have listened to his history lesson most attentively but was somewhat surprised by his criticism of Mr Mahathir, as Professor Rinsche has always taught us that Mr Mahathir was the greatest of all Asian statesmen.
Do the German Christian Democrats know something we do not?
You said, Mr Posselt, that Karl IV was a Luxembourgois like Mrs Lulling.
I had always assumed that Mrs Lulling was a Luxembourgoise.
If I have misunderstood, please do enlighten me.
