Mr President, the dubious honour of holding the world record in human rights abuses goes to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
A few weeks ago, as previous speakers have mentioned, the statues of Buddha at Bamiyan were destroyed and radicalism continues to gain ground.
Religious minorities - first the Hindus and now all non-Afghans - are forced to wear a yellow patch to identify themselves, resurrecting fatal memories of the totalitarian Nazi regime in my country.
Since the Taliban took over, the situation of the civilian population has deteriorated dramatically: women and girls are systematically oppressed, forced to wear the veil, denied an education and face the death penalty for adultery.
Women are not even allowed to take part in the distribution of bread under the UN world food programme.
They are no longer allowed to play leading roles, and the work of international organisations is being hugely obstructed.
Men must wear a fez and grow a beard, thieves are maltreated and their hands are chopped off in public as a deterrent.
The high Islamic priest of Egypt and numerous Muslims, Farid Wasil, is refusing the Taliban knowledge of the true values and ideas of the Koran and has declared their religious values and fatwas to be null and void.
Commissioner, we call on the government of Pakistan to refuse this regime any form of support, be it financial or moral.
Almost nothing has come of earlier promises to destroy poppy fields and opiates.
Last Wednesday, German customs seized six kilos of heroin and 64 kilos of hashish worth EUR two million in a container from Afghanistan.
Drug dealing is used to fund campaigns by religious fanatics and international terrorism.
Bid Laden is still in Afghanistan, feted instead of extradited.
The UN sanctions must stay in place, Commissioner, until Afghanistan makes the transition from the mediaeval world imposed by Mullah Omar to the modern world and hence to democracy and the rule of law.
