Mr President, following the tragedy in Nepal, which wiped out almost the entire royal family, this tiny kingdom in the Himalayas is now threatened with civil war.
We must also remember that it is hemmed in between Tibet, which now belongs to China, and India, with tensions threatening to come to a head between these two heavily populated countries.
The facts on today's Nepal.
Nepal is about the same size as Switzerland and Austria put together.
Twenty-two million people live there and, if you think that a large part of the country is highly mountainous, then these people do not have a great deal of space.
The flat land is overgrazed, the forests have all been cut down and ecological meltdown threatens.
There are hardly any schools, hardly any infrastructure and corruption is rife.
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world and its only source of income is tourism.
Then there are the Maoist groups which oppose the royal family and have already seized control of part of the country, mainly in the west, and who are even more sceptical of the new king, the late king's brother, than they were of the old royal family.
What this country needs now is enlightenment.
These people also need our solidarity, they need hope and suggestions.
Tourism must not run dry, which is exactly what will happen if there is a civil war.
I think that Europe should play the role of peacemaker here, hence my proposal to send a small EU delegation to Nepal to take preventive action before it is too late.
We must bring our values of transparency, democratisation and hope to this country.
We must not abandon this country, which has so many friends in Europe.
