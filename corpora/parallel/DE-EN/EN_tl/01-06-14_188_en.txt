Mr President, in order to obtain as broad a consensus and as broad an agreement as possible, I would suggest that we introduce an oral addendum to replace Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 as a new No 5a which reads as follows - and I trust you will forgive my poor French, I did not know we had a French-speaking president in the chair:
"Condemns all the massacres against the civilian population perpetrated by the military forces in place" .
If agreed, this would replace Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4.
