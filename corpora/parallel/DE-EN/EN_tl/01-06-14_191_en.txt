Classical swine fever is one of the scourges of the animal world in Europe.
This viral infection in pigs, which is harmless to human beings, occurs time and again because the virus is widespread in certain regions of the EU where it is carried by wild pigs.
It makes sense to develop strategies to fight this disease in periods of respite rather than crisis, strategies based on preventive measures since, if there is an outbreak, animals have to slaughtered on a massive scale.
The EU's vaccination policy is attracting more and more attention, especially since the last outbreak of foot-and-mouth.
If conventional vaccines are used, the stock affected must be totally isolated for long periods.
The situation would be different if we could use marker vaccines, which are currently being investigated and improved.
We must be able to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals.
Mrs Redondo has presented a good, balanced report on the problem of classical swine fever.
I support the call for more research and development on vaccines.
Using marker vaccines would give us another very useful tool with which to fight the disease in areas with a high density of pigs, obviating the need for wholesale slaughter.
Hygiene plays a very important part in connection with disease.
Feedingstuffs must be prepared to strict standards which can and must be controlled.
I am opposed to a total ban on swill feeding because this would destroy valuable feedingstuffs, merely because we feel we are not in a position to prepare it, that is, to heat it so as to destroy any risk of disease.
