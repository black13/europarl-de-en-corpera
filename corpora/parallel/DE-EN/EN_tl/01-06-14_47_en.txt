The fundamental objectives of this recommendation are to increase road safety, guarantee a minimum standard of health and safety for those working in the sector and establish equal conditions of competition with other transport operators.
The common position adopted by the Council fails to take proper account of these objectives, especially on the following points:
the inclusion of self-employed truck drivers
the exclusion of employees in haulage companies based outside the EU
the definition of the working times and standby duty
the definition of night work
Although we realise that accepting the recommendation would lead to difficult negotiations with the Council, my group voted in favour because:
1.
Self-employed truck drivers need to be included within two years of the transposition of the directive in order to resolve the problem of bogus self-employment so as to get round restrictions on working times.
2.
The working times of self-employed truck drivers must include not just the time at the wheel but also the time needed to check the vehicle, do administrative work, run the business etc., because otherwise rest periods are too short, thereby jeopardising drivers' health and lowering road safety because numerous serious accidents are caused by overtiredness.
3.
The definitions of standby duty, night time and night work must take account of social aspects.
4.
All truck drivers must provide proof of the time spent at the wheel, irrespective of whether they are employed or self-employed.
