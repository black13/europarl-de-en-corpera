My group is delighted that the European Commission has taken account of the demands made by the European Parliament in the wake of the debate on harmonising safety standards and reporting systems in 1997 and has presented its own proposal for a directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation.
Reports on faults, defects and malfunctions, which represent vital safety information, are now mandatory in all the Member States of the EU.
At the same time, all such information is to be treated in confidence.
We all want to see constant improvements to air traffic safety, passengers, airlines, technical services and responsible political forces such as the Members of the European Parliament alike.
Especially since the volume of air traffic is expected to spiral in forthcoming years.
It is a proven fact that most air traffic accidents are caused by human error, which is why introducing a uniform system for collecting, recording, exchanging and disseminating information on dangerous or potentially dangerous occurrences in all the Member States of the Community will allow a wide variety of occurrences to be evaluated, conclusions drawn and preventive measures taken.
Systematically evaluating cases in which the wrong decision or wrong action was taken will be particularly important for staff training.
Recreating and simulating situations in which a decision is required will help to ensure that staff are better prepared and react calmly to irregularities and emergencies.
In addition, safety risks can be reduced by recording and storing any technical problems, faults or defects which occur in a database to which the safety authorities have access and by evaluating and disseminating the conclusions.
We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal for a directive and are in favour of the report presented by Mr Collins and the few proposed amendments to it.
