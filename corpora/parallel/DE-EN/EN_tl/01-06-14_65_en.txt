Animal welfare is part of our basic ethical understanding.
However, we must not forget that high animal protection standards result in higher production costs in the EU, which is why we must ensure that our pig breeders are not exposed to competition from imports which do not have to comply with the same animal protection standards and are therefore able to charge lower prices.
We therefore need to prevent imports of pigmeat from third countries which do not have the same laws on animal protection and animal health standards, which is why the whole question of animal welfare needs to be dealt with during the forthcoming World Trade Organisation negotiations.
We should also consider that arrangements for animals change when new animal protection standards are introduced.
Pig breeders who only recently built pens which comply with current standards must be given a reasonable transitional period to amortise their previous investment and make changes when current rules are changed or rather tightened.
The new regulations will contain specific details on how pigs are to be kept, that is, pen sizes, the design of pens and arrangements for pregnant animals.
We must bear in mind when endeavouring to bring about changes in agricultural policy that anyone who wants better and better standards of animal protection must also bear the consequences as a consumer, that is, they must be prepared to pay more for pigmeat produced under better conditions of animal welfare.
We have a quality mark for such pigmeat in Luxembourg, for which there is a growing demand, proving that consumers understand perfectly well that they need to dig deeper into their pockets for quality agricultural products.
