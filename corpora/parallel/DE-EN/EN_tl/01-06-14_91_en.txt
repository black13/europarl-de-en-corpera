Mr President, the Commission also takes the view that we should not be looking to make savings, but nor should we be looking to extend premiums.
As we understood the proposal, there would be an across-the-board increase of 20%, which would generate considerable additional costs here.
As I have already said, all increases in premiums under Agenda 2000 are covered here, with the exception of the last increase which is due to be applied to the beef sector on 1 July.
All the others have already been included; and the increase in the beef sector next year will not be 20%, it will be around 10%.
So if a farmer - and he has the choice - feels he would do well to wait another year before opting for global payments, then he can do so, and then this beef farmer would enter the global payment system a year later.
He has that choice and will not be disadvantaged as a result.
Our objective is not to make so-called savings and no such insinuation should be made; our objective is to make people's lives easier here while guaranteeing budgetary neutrality.
For the rest, as I said, this first step is a trial and once it has been applied for three years - no even sooner, because we want a sort of midterm review; in theory we can check whether or not things are working out once it has been up and running for a year.
