Mr President, the last century began with the widespread use of poisonous gas in the First World War, that is, with chemical weapons.
Then came the use of atomic weapons after the Second World War and the last quarter of the twentieth century, beginning with the Vietnam War, was marked by the development of biological weapons.
We have to understand that our era, with the possibilities offered by genetic engineering, brings with it the potential for appalling destruction.
Man's ability to destroy - and we are talking irreversible destruction - is increasing; at the same time, unfortunately, the international legal order is failing to keep pace and the foundation needed for the international legal order, especially common moral concepts and common ethical values, is becoming weaker rather than stronger; in other words, we have a weaker ethical basis alongside greater potential for destruction.
This illustrates just how tremendous our responsibility is, which is why we urgently need to comply with and strengthen international law and work towards multilateralism on these issues.
The USA obviously has a great deal of responsibility, as does the European Union, and we must guard against a tendency to play a part whereby, rightly as it happens in this case, we protest about the Americans but are unable or unwilling to act as an independent, powerful factor in the international play of forces.
We are quick to criticise the leading role of the USA - and I believe that this leading role is, in fact, too big.
That is not the fault of the USA, however, it is the result of political and, above all, security policy weaknesses in the European Union.
I call on the Gothenburg Summit to set the right priorities once and for all and to focus on foreign and security policy at the summit so that the European Union can at last work as an equal partner with the USA.
Then we shall be able to resolve these problems.
