Madam President, Prime Minister, Sweden has held the presidency of the Union for the first time.
As an Austrian, I know that it is by no means an easy task.
The objectives were ambitious.
The presidency concentrated on a few priorities, in line with the maxim "less is more".
Above all, some important progress has been made towards enlargement of the Union.
Some agreement has been reached in the chapters on freedom of movement of persons and freedom to provide services, and I would like to offer my congratulations on that success.
However, there is one point on which I cannot agree with the commentators in the newspapers.
I do not seriously think you can say that establishing concrete data for accession is a great triumph.
There are a great many questions that remain to be resolved.
Following the Irish referendum, the process of ratifying the Treaty of Nice has become uncertain.
The question of whether Nice is a sine qua non for enlargement has been the subject of some debate.
But the people of Ireland have given a clear signal that the debate on the future of the Union can no longer be conducted behind closed doors and over the heads of our citizens; the public has to be directly involved.
One objective of the GÃ¶teborg Summit was to work out a strategy for sustainable development.
I see the Council's commitment to shift transport to rail and to encourage the full internalisation of external costs as an important clarification of this.
The Community will soon have a chance to match its words with deeds.
The forthcoming negotiations regarding the expiry of the transit agreement with Austria will provide a good opportunity in this respect.
