Mr President, we all know that in the pharmaceutical world there is a very long time lag between inventing a new product and having it ready for the market, generally 10 to 12 years.
The product then still has to be launched and another 20 years must elapse before third parties can manufacture it.
That is why the question arises as to whether instead of resorting to patent rights and compulsory licences, it would not be better to have a development fund for such cases and to make an effort, at international level, to make a large amount of money available so that by means of bulk purchasing medicines can be made available at correspondingly low prices.
Let us not forget that the selling price is a combination of manufacturing costs and licence fees.
Companies would be able to supply medicines at more favourable prices if volume purchasing applied.
So my question is whether the Commission could take an initiative in this area.
