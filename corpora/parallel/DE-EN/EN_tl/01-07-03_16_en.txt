Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the images from Göteborg were alarming.
Vandalism, a blind destructive frenzy and criminal violence, all of which should be condemned, and my Group most certainly does condemn them.
We must never allow anything like this to happen again.
But people who want to make their views known, who want to exercise their right to demonstrate or who want to protest against political decisions should still be able to do so peacefully without any restrictions in future, just as some 20 000 peaceful demonstrators also did in Göteborg.
Committed citizens will continue to see European summits as a political opportunity to express their ideas and expectations, and that is a good thing, because we need to take the public's views into account more when building a democratic Europe.
Politicians and governments should no longer be allowed to sweep over the heads of the public and ignore their sentiments.
The Swedish presidency in particular has made great efforts in this direction.
It has made an effort to tackle the problem of the democratic deficit in Europe, and we really must recognise that.
Unfortunately, the results have been somewhat disappointing.
However, that cannot be laid at the door of the Swedish government alone - all governments have to be held to account here.
When it comes to a public debate on the future of Europe, that debate should be a wide-ranging one.
It needs to be purposeful and result-oriented.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, you know that we in this House want a convention to prepare the next intergovernmental conference.
We have done some preliminary work here, and it will now be the job of the Belgian presidency to initiate this convention before Laeken.
I very much welcome the fact that there are already proposals on the table to extend the agenda and to address further issues in the debate on the future of Europe.
