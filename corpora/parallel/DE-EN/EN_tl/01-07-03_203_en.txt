Mr President, this morning Mr Karas said that there will be a large majority in favour.
I will not be part of that majority.
I believe that the Commission's proposal and also the report imply a continuation of the fundamental change in European retirement provision systems and also in social security in general.
By that I mean a move away from legal systems based on solidarity and towards private capital-based systems.
My criticisms relate above all to two issues.
The first is this: are occupational pension schemes in the EU to be subject to Community-wide competition?
I have certainly learnt a great deal over the last ten years about competition and what it can achieve, but no one can convince me that an issue as fundamental as social security provision in old age should be subject to competition.
There are three specific problems here.
The first is that there are no binding rules governing the security of contributions paid in.
Secondly, I believe that the supervisory arrangements are inadequate, and, thirdly, there is the fact that in your report, Mr Karas, there is the additional option of an occupational pension being paid out by way of a lump sum.
That implies enormous risks in old age.
The second major problem is this one-sided orientation towards financial markets.
Everything that can be said has already been said about that.
As I see it, this has more to do with the present and future of Europe's capital markets than it has with the future of pensions.
The scope for maintaining and updating legal pensions systems based on solidarity has not been used to the full in any Member State of the European Union.
However, what we really need is European coordination of occupational pension systems, as is already the case with legal pension insurance systems.
That problem has not been solved here.
