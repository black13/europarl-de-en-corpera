Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the resale right directive was to harmonise the common market.
This aim has been achieved, but with rather dubious success.
Quite apart from that, it is questionable whether there is really any need for harmonisation in this area.
Particularly at a time when things are being streamlined and efforts are being made to achieve transparency, introducing another Community tax is counterproductive.
It impedes trade; in fact it could even be said that it will bring it to a halt, because it is only a question of time before the art market shifts away from Europe in favour of the USA or Switzerland.
In fact an imbalance will arise in the art market, with all the negative consequences that implies.
Small galleries and the young artists they promote will be particularly affected by this new tax, however small.
Even established artists, for whom this directive ought to bring some monetary advantage, have spoken out against it.
It is a total mystery why this directive should be used to force something on the people affected that they do not want.
By saying yes to this directive, Europe has had its day as a patron of art.
That is why we in the Freedom Party have voted against it.
