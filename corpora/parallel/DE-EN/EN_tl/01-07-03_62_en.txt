Austrian artists are opposed to the introduction of the resale right.
They see the resale right as being a major economic disadvantage, because it will inevitably lead to a drop in the initial sale price.
The introduction of the resale right will lead to a migration of the art market from Europe to countries such as the USA or Switzerland, because there is nothing of the kind there and resale prices for works of art will not therefore be forced up.
Small gallery owners will be particularly hard hit, as they are far less able to withstand this pressure on prices.
It is impossible to see why the resale right should be imposed on artists against their will as a form of copyright.
For these reasons the Freedom Party is rejecting this report.
