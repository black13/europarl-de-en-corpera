Madam President, in this resolution, we have expressed our views on the issue of Macedonia, and I would just like to say that I welcome the European Union' s active commitment in Macedonia.
However, we should not proceed in a didactic way, but on the basis of respect for the people and nations there.
Macedonia has an all-party government in which all the nations are also represented.
It has a pro-European prime minister and an outstanding pro-European president.
If we continually talk about minority rights, we must acknowledge for once that the European standards on minority rights which we constantly refer to actually do not exist, unfortunately, in the EU itself.
We really would be well-advised, therefore, to approach the matter with some measure of humility.
We can offer our services, but we should be careful not to adopt a didactic approach all the time.
Above all, we should strengthen the government by making it clear that countries such as Macedonia which work with the European Union will also receive massive political and financial support from us.
This was why I thought it was regrettable that Commissioner Patten, who is unfortunately no longer present, said that if we were to provide funds, the money would simply be used for bombs.
This was a most inappropriate statement towards this democratically elected all-party government.
I hope that our Macedonian friends, represented by their President, will visit us here in Strasbourg soon, and that the visit by Boris Trajkovski can be rescheduled.
We must tackle the signs of disintegration, but we can only do so by strengthening the country' s democratic authorities.
