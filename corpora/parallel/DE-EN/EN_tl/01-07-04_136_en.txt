Mr President, I would have welcomed it if there had been no reason for me to rise at this point.
I had assumed you would be making a statement at the start of this sitting on how you see this difficult situation.
I rose only because others have now risen and I then feel obliged to do so as well.
First of all, however, I believe it is essential for you to make a statement on your view of the situation.
I reserve the right to speak again at that stage.
I will only refrain from commenting further at this point if you now supply this House with the information it requires.
