Mr President, I note your statement and believe that you are correct, both in terms of process and under our Rules of Procedure.
I simply think it is important that the President of this Parliament naturally has the right to convene the Conference of Presidents.
However, the Conference of Presidents - and this is why I have risen again - can only accept information from the President of Parliament again; it has no right to make any further amendments to any decisions announced this morning by the President.
