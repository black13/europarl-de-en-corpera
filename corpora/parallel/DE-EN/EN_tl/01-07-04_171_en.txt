Mr President, Matti Wuori' s report has shown that the political campaign against censorship through violence must become a joint campaign within the framework of European foreign policy.
After all, freedom of opinion and independent journalism are the backbone of democracy.
It is important, therefore, to ensure that such information is recognised as freedom of opinion and a basic prerequisite for individual fundamental freedoms, and for collective and social basic rights.
We can only achieve this in practice if censorship through violence is abolished.
Yet many journalists continue to risk their lives or freedom in defence of the public' s right to information.
What is the European Union doing?
It has established deeper partnerships with countries which continue to practise censorship.
It is very important that in the partnership and cooperation agreements and at the summits which take place in this context, these are used as instruments to make this a central political theme, and not merely a footnote, in Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
I would like to ask the Council and the Commission whether they are prepared for the issue of press censorship to be anchored more centrally in European policy in order to give fundamental rights, human rights, social and collective rights an opportunity to develop.
