Mr President, what we have just heard is unprecedented in the history of the European Parliament, of which I have been a Member since the first direct elections in 1979.
The Belgian Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the Council does not belong to my party.
Nevertheless, I would say to you, Mr Vanhecke, that the comments which you made just now make you and those who share your views deserving of our most critical judgement.
It is intolerable that you should pick a fight like this here in the European Parliament.
Do it in your own country, but not in the European Parliament!
The President-in-Office has our full support where the defence of democracy and the rule of law in Europe are concerned.
(Applause)
