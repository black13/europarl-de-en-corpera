Mr President, unfortunately I was not in the chamber when the content of the human rights report was being discussed.
At that moment, we had a problem outside with a small group of people who do not agree with the situation in the Turkish prisons.
This was why I was not in the chamber.
However, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, for his report, as he offers a good approach with this report.
I am particular impressed by its structure.
We have already talked about this.
It is quite right to link this report with the human rights charter.
This is certainly the right decision and was undoubtedly a tremendous challenge, and there will have to be a great many further amendments.
We all agree on this.
In terms of its content, however, I should also like to comment on what we have witnessed around Parliament today.
In his report, Mr Cornillet has addressed the situation of prisons in the European Union.
I should simply like briefly to remind us all of one thing: we often visit other countries and criticise the accession countries, especially about conditions in prisons.
Conditions in prisons in the accession countries are unacceptable, in our view.
Yet reading through Mr Cornillet' s report, it is apparent that we have a great many problems with our own prisons in our own countries.
This should not merely be noted down by you on paper: the governments in the European Union must take steps to address this situation.
In any event, some thought must be given to this issue as well.
