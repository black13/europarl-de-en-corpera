Mr President, whether the presidency' s chosen epitheton ornans is achieved - and it is an ambitious aim - is something which we will only be able to assess at the end of the year.
In any case, the programme which has been presented today indicates as much.
I am particularly pleased that the issues surrounding the future of Europe play an important role in this programme.
Allow me, in this connection, to make two comments.
Firstly, I think that we cannot simply ignore the Irish referendum and proceed with our agenda without harming the European Idea.
Secondly, I am convinced that if the intergovernmental conference were brought forward to 2003, as the European Parliament has proposed, this would be seen as an attempt to escape the people' s vote.
The result would be a further fall in turnout at the elections.
I particularly welcome the fact therefore that the report on priorities will still be produced in 2004, hopefully after the elections.
I should like to recall one further point: it should come as no surprise to the Belgian presidency, of all presidencies, if it is forced to realise when implementing its ambitious programme that, because the sanctions are still ringing in their ear of solidarity, the Austrian people have become rather hard of hearing.
