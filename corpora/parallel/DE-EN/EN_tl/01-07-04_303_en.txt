, Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Mr President, I should like to address Commissioner Schreyer.
I am rather surprised to hear her say I wrote her a strongly worded letter.
She quotes me as having written that she should kindly come to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
That cannot be true.
I wrote a businesslike letter in which I asked her to come to us in the Committee for Budgetary Control in accordance with our agreement between the Commission and Parliament.
If Mrs Schreyer has other commitments, I do, however, assume that she is able to send a senior official to give the Committee the information it requires.
The letter has no other meaning.
Mrs Schreyer, I am somewhat astonished that you read the letter in that way.
It was entirely businesslike.
I just wanted to explain that.
Thank you.
