Madam President, I rise only very briefly because, given the plethora of information on the table in the form of voting lists, I should like to clarify that anyone who wishes to express agreement with the rapporteur must in this case vote against the report.
That is, anyone who is of the same opinion as the rapporteur must vote against the report.
(After the vote on the joint text by the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, the President referred to the Rules of Procedure, having noted that the votes were tied) President.
Given this delicate situation, we shall, as always, be carefully observing the Rules of Procedure.
This matter concerns Rule 128(2 and 3), which says that in the event of a tied vote on the agenda as a whole or on a text put to a split vote, the text put to the vote shall be deemed adopted, but that 'in all other cases where there is a tied vote, without prejudice to those Rules which require qualified majorities, the text or proposal shall be deemed rejected' .
The text is therefore rejected.
(Loud applause)
I believe that this is perfectly clear.
Are there any objections?
