Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all presidents are at liberty to vote or not.
It is their decision.
This result is absolutely clear.
There is no majority in favour of the report and we should not call this result into question.
To do so would be to challenge the effectiveness of decision-making in this Parliament.
