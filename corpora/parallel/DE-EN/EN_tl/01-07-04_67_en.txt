Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fontaine, I am particularly addressing you personally.
As you know, I am not one of those Members who usually contributes terribly much in this House to making your time here a happy one, but today I should like to thank you explicitly because I believe that you have done two things.
Firstly, you have given Mr McMillan-Scott the right answer.
I congratulate you on this.
Secondly, you had the case checked in the Rules of Procedure.
You quoted the relevant passage in the Rules of Procedure, thus dispelling any doubts, and you then noted the conclusion of the vote by stating, "rejected".
In so doing you have done exactly what a conscientious president must do.
I should like to thank you for this.
(Applause)
