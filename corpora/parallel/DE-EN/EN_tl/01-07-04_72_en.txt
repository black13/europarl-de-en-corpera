Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the floor briefly.
To avoid there being any confusion, I should like to clarify just very briefly that - with the exception of Amendments Nos 2 and 4 - Amendments Nos 1 to 11 already represent compromises which were struck with the Council even before the second reading, within a kind of informal conciliation procedure.
I should really like to urge you to vote in favour of these amendments because I believe that we have succeeded in improving the common position considerably.
