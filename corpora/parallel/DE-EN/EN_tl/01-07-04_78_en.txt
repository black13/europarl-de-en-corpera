Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor.
Firstly, I should like to say that Amendment No 118 does not replace Amendment No 46; in fact both need to be put to the vote.
Secondly, with your permission, I have an oral amendment to propose to Amendment No 118.
If the change were to be adopted I would be able to vote in favour of Amendment No 118.
The change is as follows: instead of the word 'exemption' the words 'this restriction' should be added, and after 'after legal personality' we add, 'only apply to the institutions responsible for the administration and management of such IORPs, if this restriction cannot be enforced under relevant national law against IORPs without legal personality.'
If this oral amendment is accepted - and I have agreed it with the Member who tabled the amendment - then I would be able to support a vote in favour.
(Parliament agreed to take into consideration the oral amendment)
