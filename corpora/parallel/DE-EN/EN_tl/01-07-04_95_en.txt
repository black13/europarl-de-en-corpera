Madam President, we have voted today, in a second reading, on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.
The Commission' s White Paper has set us an indicative target, namely that 12% of gross energy consumption should be covered from renewable sources by 2010.
In order to achieve this goal, we must promote the generation of electricity from renewable sources by means of various incentives, as we are still a long way from achieving this target.
New technologies need unbureaucratic, simple and effective promotion mechanisms.
I would like to take this opportunity to underline, above all, the importance of renewable energies for the rural regions.
The production of energy and the cultivation of energy crops offer an alternative income-generation opportunity for our farmers in Europe, which must be exploited.
The multifunctionality of the rural regions can thus be strengthened and increased.
I see this as a major opportunity for agriculture and dynamic rural development in a united Europe.
