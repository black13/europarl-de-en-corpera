Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every Member State has undertaken to abide by the general declaration on human rights and hence to oppose capital punishment.
The death penalty violates the right to life and is degrading.
According to Amnesty International, 1457 people were executed in 2000, of which 85 were executed in the USA, 1000 in China, 75 in Iran and 123 in Saudi Arabia.
In Iran last week, a woman was condemned to death by stoning for adultery.
It puts one in mind of the Middle Ages.
This cruelty outrages and horrifies me.
No death sentences have been carried out in Turkey since 1984, it is true, but people are still condemned to death.
This is unacceptable, especially in a country which aspires to become a member of the EU.
Turkey must abolish the death penalty before it can be accepted in the European Union.
Every time a death penalty is carried out, there is a possibility that an innocent person has been executed.
Such cases have occurred in the past.
I am particularly concerned about the current debate in Russia on the restoration of the death penalty.
Five years after the last execution, more and more people are calling for the death penalty to be reintroduced for terrorists and drug dealers.
I should like to remind Russia that it undertook to abolish the death penalty when it joined the Council of Europe five years ago.
Armenia and Turkey must also honour this commitment as members of the Council of Europe.
The first world congress against capital punishment was held in Strasbourg in June.
I welcome events such as this, which endeavour to find ways of abolishing the death penalty.
I consider the death penalty to be a barbaric institution.
It is cruel and inhumane.
I condemn all 87 countries which still have the death penalty and call on those responsible to abolish it.
