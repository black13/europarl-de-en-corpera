Mr President, as previous speakers have already said, we are gradually losing all hope of South Africa's becoming a stable factor in Africa.
The tremendous impoverishment of large sections of the population, which goes hand in glove with the massive spread of AIDS and with drug-dealing and racketeering, are real causes for concern.
Do we not realise that poverty and the need for survival are a crisis waiting to happen in Africa?
This is where the crisis prevention is needed that we have spoken of so frequently over recent weeks, this is where we need self-help development programmes for the black population, health protection, support for preventive health care and, most importantly, educational support, before it is too late.
All this was discussed at length.
We also discussed something else, namely no arms exports to countries where poverty may disturb social peace.
Unfortunately, the Council has not honoured the promise made in the European Parliament.
Sweden, together with Germany, Great Britain and Italy, supplies arms to the value of 43 billion in local currency.
All the intentions expressed here, namely conflict prevention programmes without arms exports, have been forgotten by the Swedish government.
That is not all.
The whole thing was set up by bribing the South African government.
That shows that our code of conduct for arms exports is still full of holes and that we still cannot use it as an instrument for real conflict prevention.
We need to work on this.
We need clear criteria and transparent mechanisms so that this cannot happen again.
