Mr President, yet again I must concur with the previous speakers: our future neighbour Belarus is still a long way from being a democracy and democracy is now the only basis on which we can live together in Europe.
It is with concern that we must concede that even the four basic conditions which we set for preparations for the presidential elections have not been met.
The opposition is still being persecuted and criminalised.
It still has no free or fair access to the media, especially state television.
Disappearances are still not explained, especially the fate of Mr Kontscha and the Russian cameraman Mr Zawadski, for whom journalists are now holding a commemorative week.
However, today, I should like to highlight the case of Professor Bandaschewski, who has tried for years to enlighten the people in the areas contaminated by Chernobyl.
Because he told the truth and because he opposed people moving back into these areas, he has now ended up in prison serving an eight-year sentence.
Can you imagine?
It is intolerable.
Belarus still represents a challenge for European diplomacy.
We must be critical where criticism is needed but we must also provide support where we can.
Belarus is of strategic importance to the EU, which is why we must do everything we can to ensure that democracy is restored there.
