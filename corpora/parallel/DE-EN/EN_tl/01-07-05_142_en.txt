Mr President, when we talk of Belarus, we are talking about more than just the situation in an albeit important country.
We are talking about the future of the whole of Eastern Europe.
The Pope was recently in Ukraine and voices were raised both for and against him.
Not between denominations, however, as everyone would have us believe, because pro-Europeans of all denominations welcomed his visit.
It was the anti-Europeans who criticised him.
The Russian patriarch Alexei travelled to Belarus, not to criticise the repression of human rights and religious freedom there, but to campaign - with the support of the state - for the restoration of the single state of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
This shows that we are talking about an important political force here, which is why it is important to support the freedom of the people of Belarus and ensure that democracy and the rule of law are established there.
Now that Milosevic has been toppled, the last real Communist dictatorship in Europe is the regime in Belarus.
It is most important to ensure, and here my support goes above all to Mrs Schroedter, who has done a great deal of work here, that prisoners of conscience are released, that political prisoners are released, that the opposition is at last given a fair chance and that free elections can at last be held in Belarus, so that this country can return to where it has belonged since the beginning of its history, namely in the community of Europeans.
