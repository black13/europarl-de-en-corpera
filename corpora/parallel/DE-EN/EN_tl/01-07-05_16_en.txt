Madam President, G8 summits looked like becoming a routine sort of affair.
That has now changed and more and more people are recognising that they are moving away from economic and financial issues and beginning to take on the role of a sort of world government.
That generates mistrust and encourages rejection.
We may bemoan the weaknesses of the UN, but it is accredited by the international community, as is UNCTAD, although UNCTAD appears to be in a state of enforced inertia.
By contrast, the G7 or G8 have devised their own mandate, acting purely on the strength of their economic clout or clout in general, in their bid to rule the world.
The neoliberal policy promoted as a result widens rather than narrows the gulf between north and south and speeds up the rate at which developing countries fall into poverty and debt.
Anyone who criminalises resistance on the part of those who oppose globalisation in general - as has already happened, not that I condone violence - is guilty of hushing things up and confusing cause and effect.
We should be looking for alternatives to neoliberal policies, not deploying riot police and cancelling agreements on tourism.
What we need is for attention to be paid to our citizens' interests - that is what the European Union should be committing to.
We should be safeguarding these interests and making sure there is no room for what is currently happening.
