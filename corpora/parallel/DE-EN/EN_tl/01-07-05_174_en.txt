Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can keep it brief.
First I should like to thank Mr Nicholson for his report and, secondly, I should like to state that the Commission fully supports this report.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that 6 mm thick single-twine netting is equivalent in terms of selectivity to 4 mm thick double-twine netting.
There was therefore no reason to prohibit 4 mm thick double-twine netting for fisheries in the Irish Sea.
We have therefore amended the regulation accordingly.
I should like to thank you for your positive attitude to this Commission proposal.
