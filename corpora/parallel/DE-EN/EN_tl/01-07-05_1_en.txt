Madam President, I saw a few boats landing at Parliament this week and notified the security service.
Not only were there language difficulties; the telephone line was so poor that it was almost impossible to communicate.
I would be most obliged if the number on which the security service can be reached could also be clearly displayed in the House, so that if anyone wants to report an incident, they can do so quickly and efficiently.
