Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I think Mr Schnellhardt has highlighted the main point.
The equipment at issue here - recreational craft and, more importantly, jet skis - is used solely for leisure activities.
In other words, it is something our society can do without.
If we are to pollute the environment not because society needs to but merely in the pursuit of leisure, then this equipment should be as clean and quiet as possible.
It is therefore right and proper that we should want to improve on one or two points in this directive.
With all due respect to our rapporteur, this is not about canal boats in Great Britain, it is not about self-build craft which are not marketed.
That is not where the problem lies and we have allowed derogations for these craft.
The main problem is with sports craft and - I repeat - jet skis in particular, which are produced in large numbers and used on sensitive inland waters, including waters used for relaxation and drinking water supplies.
In this respect, we need very strict provisions for these areas in order to transfer the technology which we have already adapted and introduced for other mobile engines - in cars and lorries - to engines for recreational craft.
This cannot be done from one day to the next.
That much is obvious.
We need a certain transitional period here, we are all pragmatists here, and we shall give manufacturers a transitional period.
We need to apply the technology, however, so that leisure activities cause the minimum possible exhaust emissions and the minimum possible noise.
