Mr President, I move that any member should be able to use the travel office to visit groups of visitors within a radius of 25 kilometres of the European Parliament at any time.
At the moment we are only allowed to travel 20 kilometres, which equates to a 15 kilometre radius.
That is too short, given the hundreds of kilometres which many groups travel in order to come here.
Please could you take suitable action here.
