Mr President, yesterday afternoon there was a demonstration in front of Parliament.
The demonstrators used powerful public address systems, that is, loudspeakers.
This unbearably noisy spectacle hampered both me and other members in the exercise of our mandate.
Please ensure that, first, demonstrators have no cause to enter the grounds of Parliament, as happened yesterday and, secondly, that they are prohibited from using public address systems in the vicinity of the European Parliament.
So as to avoid any misunderstanding, may I point out that I am an advocate of the right to demonstrate and am delighted when groups of musicians visiting members entertain us in Parliament and the inner courtyard with their musical renditions.
