Madam President, one comment perhaps, as the question of language has already been raised twice.
I should like to point out that the question of language is regulated in the Rules of Procedure, which state that Parliament itself makes the final decision on how languages are to be regulated in the House.
Any concerns - including about decisions by the Bureau - are therefore totally unfounded.
