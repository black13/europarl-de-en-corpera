I voted in favour of the Wuori report on European Union human rights policy.
I welcome the call for a better EU human rights strategy towards third countries and candidate countries.
Economic questions take centre stage during accession negotiations, while human rights issues are granted nowhere near the same importance.
I voted against the rapporteur's Amendment No 10 because it deletes the passage calling for the Turkish government to guarantee the return of more than 3 million refugees.
I have visited a number of refugee camps in south-east Turkey and seen the human misery for myself.
Even human rights reports should not ignore refugees.
I should also like to add, Ã  propos the Wuori report, that there are not just Christian minorities in Turkey, as stated in Article 90, there are also the Yezidi, a religious community which is not recognised.
On official documents such as birth certificates, instead of Yezidi, a cross is entered or they are left blank as a sign of non-recognition.
Everyone has the right to worship freely and I therefore call for all religious communities in Turkey to be recognised.
