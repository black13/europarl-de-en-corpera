Madam President, I am somewhat surprised that we are deciding now whether to have a resolution or not.
Our group had simply agreed with the proposal from the Socialist Group to revise the agenda slightly.
Admittedly, we made no formal connection between the two matters, but there was absolutely no question of there now being a resolution on Genoa.
Mr Wurtz, you have just indicated in your speech that we shall probably end up commenting on the very issues which we want to avoid here.
In any case, we do not feel that now is the right time to comment in a brief and hasty resolution on violent events, events which we take very seriously.
Our group is of the opinion that the issues of violence, menacing behaviour and the threat from globalisation should be very carefully looked at by Parliament and must not, through hasty or random decisions, be tied up in resolutions.
As we can see the risk of this happening, we completely refrain from passing a resolution and support what the Conference of Presidents decided last week - where I was represented by Mr Provan - that is to say that we should hold a debate and discuss all the aspects but not come to a hasty decision now concerning the contents of a resolution, or comment on the violence.
Rather, we should do this in our own time and with a great deal of care.
Therefore, for sound reasons we are against a resolution on Genoa.
