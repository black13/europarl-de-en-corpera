Madam President, thank you for giving me the opportunity of responding to the honourable Member so quickly.
I would like to congratulate him on the success of the English national team and at the same time point out to Mr Ferber, who is unfortunately not here, that the overwhelming majority of the German team comes from Bavaria!
