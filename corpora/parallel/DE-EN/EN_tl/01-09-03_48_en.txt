Madam President, I would merely like to expand on what Mrs Morgantini was just saying.
The ban on the peace demonstration on 1 September led to the death of one person who was fleeing from the police.
Today, 500 people remain in custody.
I ask you to do what you can to see to it that the 500 people still in prison are released immediately.
