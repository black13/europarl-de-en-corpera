Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to offer my congratulations to the two rapporteurs, Mr Menrad and Mr Mayer, and also, and especially, to Messrs Gas√≤liba, Rothley and Lehne, who have added specific aspects.
I am glad that the Mayer and Menrad reports were discussed together because this also underlines the fact that we are endeavouring to live out the social market economy and, rather than play social policy off against economic policy, consider these as complementary and common factors and establish a symbol of unity.
On which basic conditions is this European limited liability company founded?
Globalisation brings home to us what it means for there to be no borders; the internal market is hopefully on the verge of implementation, enlargement of the European Union will unite the continent, and there will be notes and coins for economic and monetary union, with the euro as the visible sign of Europe' s coming together, the symbol of a growing European identity and the expression of the Union' s intention to be a resolute presence on the world market.
We are agreed upon the objectives.
However, transposition is often half-hearted.
The keys to this are the legal base, an absence of European fiscal regulation and essential discussions on modernising the regulations governing European mergers.
A number of tasks have failed to be undertaken in the Member States at the necessary pace and with the necessary determination.
The jurisdiction - the key word here is unanimity - corresponds to the realities of power politics, not however to the requirements of European politics.
Finally, I call therefore on the Ecofin Council to devote more of its time to fiscal assessment at Community level and to the necessary fiscal regulations and less time to proposals which undermine the stability pact and weaken the euro.
