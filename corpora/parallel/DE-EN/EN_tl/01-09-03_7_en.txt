Madam President, I have only indicated my wish to speak because Mr Barón Crespo considered it fitting to take the floor here again.
I must tell you that, quite frankly, I do not think it was necessary to have addressed this subject here again.
Since this has been done, however, I would just like to say one or two words on the matter.
Of course, the process of waiving immunity is a difficult one, and we need common rules to govern this.
But, Mr Barón Crespo, it has already been decided that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market shall deal with this.
Therefore, your comment here was unnecessary.
I would particularly like to stress, Madam President, that, in all questions related to this process, you have conducted yourself completely in accordance with the law, and I would like to emphasise this here once again.
We would like to wish the former Member of this Parliament, Silvio Berlusconi, every success as Italy' s Prime Minister.
We are certain that we also have the support of Italy in building a sound future for Europe.
(Applause from the PPE Group)
