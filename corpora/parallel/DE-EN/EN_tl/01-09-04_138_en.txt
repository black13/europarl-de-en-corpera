Mr President, the upside of the fact that we are so late debating the old progress reports is that we can inject some up-to-date input just before the new reports are finalised.
I have observed developments in Lithuania with interest, and not only since I became the shadow rapporteur for this country.
It demonstrates the classic problems of a candidate country, problems which apply across the board and do not therefore need to be restated.
One specific aspect, and this also costs the EU a great deal of money, is Lithuanian energy policy.
The sector as a whole has already cost three heads of government their job.
First on the subject of Ignalina, which Mr Souladakis has already addressed.
I think that it is up to us to ensure, when the closure process is implemented, that locals are kept properly informed at all times of what it is actually planned to do and what their prospects are in this relatively isolated area.
My personal impression is that this is not yet the case.
As a result, some Lithuanian politicians, admittedly without portfolio, are irresponsibly raising people's hopes in order to curry votes.
This triggers anti-European sentiments because the debate is over-simplified.
Privatisation of the oil and gas sectors is also causing a degree of ill feeling among the people because western investors have acted as if this is a banana republic.
Now, no one even bothers to distinguish between EU nationals and Americans.
People have become sceptical of western capital and more receptive to so-called national solutions.
However, allegedly national solutions in Lithuania are in fact generally a front for Russian money.
I just want to make sure that everyone involved both inside and outside Lithuania is aware of this and bears it in mind when making political and economic decisions.
