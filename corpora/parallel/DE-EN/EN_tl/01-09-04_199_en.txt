Thank you, Commissioner.
I should just like to ask two more questions.
First, what is the situation regarding humanitarian help for Chechen refugees in Georgia?
Unless I am mistaken, you have not yet said anything about that.
And secondly, are you planning a mission to Chechnya and does the Commission plan to set up a permanent representation there?
