Madam President, as Europeans we will only be able to act as mediators if we are not only neutral towards both sides but also show the necessary respect for the needs and expectations of all parties to the conflict.
German Foreign Minister Fischer has perhaps shown us what European mediation could be like, by contrast to the embarrassing comparisons made by the Finnish Foreign Minister between the crimes of the national socialists and Israel and the aggressive attacks against Israel made by the Belgian Foreign Minister.
I was also shocked to see shops in Brussels with signs saying "We do not stock Israeli products" .
Perhaps some day European politicians will understand that no one is interested in their personal interpretations of the conflict.
Our task is to help to calm the conflict, and this will only be possible if we recognise the Palestinian people' s need for independence and freedom, while also recognising Israel' s need for security and above all, too, recognising Israel as a democracy.
