Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in congratulating the Commission on its negotiating tactics and success.
I think it is as the Commissioner said: the protocol has been saved.
Obviously, this in itself will not solve the problems.
The problems inherent in climate change and what needs to be done to stop climate change go far beyond what was agreed in Bonn.
But it is an important first step.
We must counter those who criticise the Kyoto protocol in principle - a number of members from Germany, for example, have said that the whole protocol is useless - and those who, as environmental politicians, have said it is useless because it does not go far enough, by saying that, if your house is on fire and you think it will take ten fire engines to put it out, you are hardly going to turn the first fire engine away and say, please do not start fighting the fire until all ten fire engines are here; you do what you can as quickly as possible, bearing in mind that other measures are needed.
These other measures are being negotiated both at international level and, of course, in the European Union.
Now we have to tackle the question of implementation.
You made a number of important announcements on that today, Commissioner, and you have our support.
We must keep talking to the Americans at international level.
A lot of people, including here in Parliament, are hugely critical of the Americans because of their policy in just about every political arena.
I think we should concentrate on fundamentals.
We should make it clear to our American friends that we do not agree with them on numerous counts but that we can live with our differences.
However, in this area, we Europeans cannot live with the fact that the Americans keep holding back.
And we need to tell them as much again and again.
