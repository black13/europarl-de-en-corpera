Mr President, I too say bravo, Commissioner.
Well done.
For the rest, it never fails to astound me just how united Europeans are on the question of climate change and the measures needed to counter it.
I think that climate policy is a policy people can identify with in Europe and we should turn this to our advantage.
I also think that it is our duty to work on the American public, so that they follow our lead.
Perhaps, in this case, we are one step ahead of the Americans, just as public opinion on other questions is often one step ahead of Europe.
I should like to comment on one point of view: the impact of this climate policy on energy policy.
The whole point of climate policy is that it requires us to put a price on CO2 in the future.
Let us suppose that your estimates are right and that CO2 costs about EUR 30 a tonne.
That means that electricity from brown coal will rise by about 3.5 eurocents and electricity from hard coal will rise by about 3 eurocents.
The price of renewable sources of energy will not rise, i.e. they will become more competitive.
But nor will the price of nuclear energy rise.
As is it not excluded from emission trading and is only banned where there is joint implementation, this works to the advantage of nuclear energy.
This completely changes the weightings within the energy spectrum.
That is not the subject of this evening' s debate, but it will be subject of debates over coming months and years.
I just wanted to point that out.
For the rest, I share the view of many of my fellow members who said that this is a process.
We have only just begun it and we must stick with it.
The very fact of having been there is, I think a very good thing.
