, representing the Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first, our thanks to the rapporteur.
The Commission proposal for a European Aviation Safety Agency comes in response to a long-standing demand by Parliament.
The Aviation Safety Agency is our second agency in the transport sector; a third for the railways and rail safety will ensue.
I think this strategy of creating European agencies is an ideal way of helping the European transport markets to integrate.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already proposed a number of important amendments for the Aviation Safety Agency, such as strengthening the agency, giving it more independence and extending its remit.
I also think it is important - and I speak here on behalf of Mr Kuckelkorn - that we accept an amendment proposed by the Committee on Budgets on funding.
Come what may, we must ensure that we have efficiency, transparency and controlled costs.
These two agencies give us the opportunity to take a clear line right from the outset.
My group has also tabled a number of proposed amendments.
The first concerns the composition of the administrative board.
We are calling for employers and employees to be given a seat on the board.
Another proposed amendment concerns the creation of local offices of the agency, which have been suggested in order to allay the fears of a number of Member States about loss of sovereignty.
We expect the Member State in which the agency is located to make a financial contribution.
One purpose of this rule is to prevent a Member State from pressurising its agency, i.e. the agency established on its sovereign territory, into setting up local offices.
Here too I am positive that this is a reasonable and legitimate concern on the part of Parliament and I therefore call on you to support it.
