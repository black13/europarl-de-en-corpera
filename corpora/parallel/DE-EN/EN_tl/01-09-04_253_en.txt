Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has examined the proposal for a regulation very carefully.
It obviously supports the aim of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency.
However, we realise that we somehow need to harmonise the legal framework within which such agencies are created.
A great many agencies have now been set up: the Aviation Safety Agency, the Food Agency, the Agency for Medical Products.
It is high time we had a clear legal framework for starting up these agencies.
The two previous speakers have already commented on certain aspects.
I am grateful that the Commission announced in its White Paper on European governance that it intends to take a somewhat clearer line here.
Sparks obviously fly when these agencies are created because decision-making powers are transferred to external institutions even if, Mr Schmitt, the final decision does not, of course, always rest with these agencies.
It is especially important to us that the supervisory committees be made up of equal numbers of representatives from the various European institutions and for the European Parliament not to lose its rights of influence by outsourcing decisions.
It is also important to us for the legal recourse created within these agencies' procedures to be in keeping with the European Treaties and the principles of the rule of law.
Another particular cause for concern is that the powers of intervention created for these agencies need to be in keeping with the fundamental civil rights on which we agreed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We have tabled proposed amendments on these points and we are grateful that they are at least being accepted in part.
