, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, the vote on deleting the 108% clause is about more than just Austria's environmental concerns.
Transit traffic in a sensitive Alpine region is the secondary issue.
Primarily, it is about the fact that Austria has a valid agreement with the European Union.
The Commission is now trying, in its proposal for a regulation, to cancel this valid agreement unilaterally and expects the European Parliament to validate this illegal move.
If we vote in favour of this proposal, we shall be helping to break an agreement to the detriment of a Member State of the Union.
What this can and will do is to destroy any trust in agreements concluded and hence any trust in the legal security of the European Union.
A large majority of people living in the Alpine regions in question came out in favour of accession to the EU in 1994, believing in the sanctity of contracts.
If we vote in favour of this unwarranted abolition of the protection clauses, we shall foster reticence towards the Union and force people back on to street blockades.
In this sense I urgently call on you to support Mr Swoboda's report or, given the present weather, not to leave him out in the rain.
