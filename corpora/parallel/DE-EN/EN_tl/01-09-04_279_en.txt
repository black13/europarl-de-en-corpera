Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Swoboda, our rapporteur, and Mr Kronberger are both Austrian.
That is, of course, no coincidence and they have both explained the situation in Austria in detail.
However, I do not see this as a purely Austrian problem.
This report and tomorrow's vote are about a decision with far-reaching implications.
I am not trying - nor do I have any intention of trying - to play the internal market, competition and environmental and transport policy off against each other.
I see two points at issue here.
First, to repeat the concern expressed by my fellow members, we should not emulate President Bush by ending an agreement unilaterally.
Secondly, how serious are we about our European environmental and transport policy?
How serious are we about implementing it and how efficiently do we want to promote it?
So we are not just talking about reducing nitrogen oxide in the Brenner pass.
We need a coherent transport concept for the whole of the Alps and we need to internationalise the external costs.
Until we apply real costs, roads will be cheaper and neither combined transport nor the railways will be able to compete.
The whole of the ecologically sensitive Alpine region needs our support within the terms of the Alpine Convention.
Our citizens, and I do not just mean in these sensitive regions, are counting on the European Parliament and the sense of responsibility of all its members.
