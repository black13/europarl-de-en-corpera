Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak as an Austrian, but I also speak as a European for three reasons.
First, the Transit Agreement was part of a Union promise to Austria.
The promise being that the sensitive Alpine region would not be buried under an endless avalanche of transit traffic.
Austrians trusted in Europe's word.
66% of Austrians were in favour of accession to the Union.
If this Commission proposal is adopted, this promise will be broken.
I speak to you as a European; this is the sort of thing which will come back to haunt us if another referendum somewhere in Europe turns out badly.
Secondly, transit traffic and hence the 108% clause, which it is proposed to abolish, forms part of the Act of Accession to the European Union.
In other words, the Transit Agreement is primary law.
I ask you in all conscience: what is an agreement worth if the European Parliament can undermine primary law in a vote?
This is also a question of principle, not just Austrian, but European principle.
Thirdly, a question to all of you: what are words on paper worth?
To quote the new Article 6 in the Treaty of Amsterday: "Environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Community policies and activities referred to in Article 3", such as the free movement of goods.
Tomorrow's vote will be a measure of just how seriously this House takes the objective of this article in the Treaty of Amsterday.
Or, ladies and gentlemen, do we just pay lip service here to environmental protection and sustainable development?
The contest tomorrow is free movement of goods versus environmental protection - it is a fundamentally European question, which is why I call on you to vote in favour of the report.
