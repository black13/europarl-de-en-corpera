Madam President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, thank you very much for your remarks here today, especially for the clear language which you, Madam President-in-Office, used and which is not always found in the Council' s statements.
You actually described what the Israeli government is doing, namely murdering its opponents, whom it accuses of being terrorists, as murder.
In the light of this fact I find it embarrassing and sometimes in poor taste to make reference to schoolbooks when we see that Orient House is occupied, Palestinian territory is invaded and occupied and Palestinian police stations are systematically destroyed regardless of the human casualties.
Anyone who says Mr Arafat is responsible for what is going on there cannot be very well informed about politics.
Everything we have tried and proposed in the past has failed, sending observers - I am glad Mr Van Orden also advocates that - all that has failed because of the Israeli government' s refusal to accept it.
Even the Mitchell report, which we all support as a common point of reference, cannot be implemented because the Israeli government under Mr Sharon - who is wanted by the police in your country, Madam President-in-Office, which is why he cannot be invited to Brussels - wants to interpret the Mitchell report and determine when it will be applied.
In view of this situation, I am no longer calling for greater involvement in the process.
We want to be involved, but we are not accepted.
What else can we do?
We have a treaty with Israel and we ought to give some thought - you have also mentioned this in the past, Commissioner, where treaties have been broken - to whether we can maintain that treaty in force or whether we ought to suspend it.
