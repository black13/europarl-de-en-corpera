Mr President, a very good evening and welcome to Europe's first culture channel.
But joking apart, what can I say to you in just a minute?
Perhaps I should try to take the wind out of the sceptics' sails.
This is not about intervention, it is not about interfering in national cultural policy, no new wave of harmonisation is being started; on the contrary, it is about bringing sermonising politicians down to earth and saying, could you please stop using subsidiarity as a veto.
It is about saying, if you really mean that culture is one of the most important models for the peaceful integration of Europe, then you must put your money where you mouth is.
We try to join forces in so many areas; why should culture go it alone?
Joint investment by Europe in culture - I like that expression better than subsidy, it is not just a question of financial support - is long overdue.
May I run over time slightly in order to pay my respects and offer my thanks to all the members who have patiently fought to make headway here over the years, long before my arrival here.
I should like to thank them for every millimetre of ground won and I too shall fight for more, millimetre by millimetre.
