Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to offer Mr Ruffolo my warmest thanks for taking the initiative because, without such an effort on his part, we would have no own initiative report and we would not be able to talk about it today or ask for funds from the budget.
So my warmest thanks.
The report was adopted with a broad consensus, it has come at the right time and it represents a political challenge for everyone involved in it.
And I hope that means a lot of people at all levels.
Setting up an observatory for cultural cooperation and the proposed three-year cultural cooperation plan will, in the final analysis, be a gauge of just how seriously politicians at all levels are trying to maintain and develop a European area of culture.
I am also delighted that two points have been included which I addressed in my report on the status of artists in 1992, Mrs Echerer.
I called at that time for greater support for patrons, including through greater tax incentives.
I called then - as I do now - for a long overdue study to be drafted on the approximation of taxes on works of art and the work of artists.
Because we have social cohesion and are citizens of Europe, we need a European cultural policy and our amazing diversity must be highlighted time and time again.
Project Europe shed its economic and technical orientation a long time ago.
We desperately need to draft a common cultural policy and common education policy if we are to rekindle the soul of Europe, which has been choked by economic expediency and covered in a thick layer of bureaucratic dust at all levels, regional, local, national and even European, for far too long.
Our citizens today simply want more beautiful things.
More beautiful things will reawaken their enthusiasm for Europe and more culture costs a bit more.
So please let us add something to the budget now.
