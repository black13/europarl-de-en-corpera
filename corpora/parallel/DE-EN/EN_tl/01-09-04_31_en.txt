Madam President, I have a question for the President-in-Office.
There are reports in the press today that the Prime Minister of Israel did not receive the European Union' s High Representative.
So Mr Sharon has not seen Mr Solana.
Can the Council give us more information?
Was it because there was no time, because Prime Minister Sharon has gone to Moscow, or was there a political intention not to receive the High Representative?
Has the Council been informed of this?
I should like to know.
