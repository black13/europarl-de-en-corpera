Madam President, I wish to raise a matter of a highly sensitive nature for this House and which affects the debate about enlargement.
It concerns a statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry about Mr Poos' report on the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.
In that statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry makes an unfair and slanderous attack on an honourable Member who presented his report to the relevant committee.
The committee accepted the report as it stood with only two votes against.
I can see that parliamentarianism in Turkey has not yet reached the stage where they can understand what is in this report and what responsibility, if we can call it that, Mr Poos has taken on.
It is a report of Parliament.
I would therefore like to see Parliament respond to this unfair attack.
Madam President, to give you just one example of the bad taste, it says here in point 1 of the statement:
'Mr Poos is known for both his opposition to Turkey and for his personal links with the government of Cyprus.'
That is a slander bordering on the criminal.
I would like to see a response to this accusation from Turkey not from Mr Poos but from this House and also from the Commission.
Thank you, Madam President.
(Applause)
