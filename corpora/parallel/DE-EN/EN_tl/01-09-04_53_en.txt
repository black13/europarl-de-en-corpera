Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its report on the progress of the Czech Republic, the Commission writes, and I quote: "The Czech Republic continues to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria."
This is a remarkable statement.
The Commission's report does not contain a single word about the Benes Decrees.
The Commission overlooks the fact that upholding the Benes Decrees, which justify the expulsion and murder of many thousands of people after the Second World War, is clearly contrary to the accession criteria established by the Community.
The Czech Republic's stance, that it does not wish to repeal them, amounts to a disregard for fundamental basic values and human rights which the EU expressly upholds.
This means that Europe is sending out a signal which does lasting damage to the EU's credibility on matters of fundamental and human rights.
As a representative of Austria I should also like to say a word on Temelin.
Temelin has significant safety defects.
The Commission's report on the safety of Temelin also confirms that Austria's misgivings about the reactor are justified.
Notwithstanding this, the Czech Republic is trying, by activating the reactor, to present us with a fait accompli.
This is not the kind of behaviour that we expect when working in a partnership.
The place to resolve this problem is Brussels.
I await a European initiative to close it down.
Commissioner Verheugen, you described Temelin as the safest nuclear power station in Europe.
This is not only not very helpful, it is also counterproductive if we are to identify a strategy for abandoning the site which is acceptable to everyone.
