Mr President, in relation to what Mr Dell'Alba has said I simply wanted to report, without wishing to defend the Commission, that I also spoke to the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Kinnock, today and apparently the reports are already on their way.
There has been a technical problem, so no one was being devious; there was just a technical hitch.
