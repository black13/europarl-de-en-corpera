Mr President, I do not wish to make an explanation of vote.
I am simply here to listen to colleagues' explanations of vote, in particular Mr Fatuzzo's, and I would earnestly request that you do something about the level of noise here.
This shows an unacceptable lack of respect for those who are making explanations of vote.
