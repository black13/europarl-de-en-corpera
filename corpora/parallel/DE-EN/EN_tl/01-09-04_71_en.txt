Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the positive outcomes of the Treaty of Nice is the European Company and we are now debating this in the context of Mr Menrad's report on the involvement of employees, which I welcome.
My concern is simply that if we constantly extend workers' rights and in particular if we lower thresholds, as is the case in this report - from 1000 employees to 500 for the rules on worker participation to be applied - we will place too great a burden on this European Company.
The European Company is supposed to attract companies to Europe.
This new company model is intended to open up Europe as a business location and make it more attractive.
That is why it is also necessary, in particular where worker participation is concerned, for us to keep a sense of proportion and not to burden the companies adopting this model with these new rights in such a way that it is simply no longer of interest to those who wish either to enter Europe or to use the European Company to be more mobile within the European single market.
In my view sufficient account has not been taken of this and that is why I have voted against.
