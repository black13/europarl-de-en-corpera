Mr President, I am interested in knowing what has become of the Commission - the Commissioner is there, we did not see you just now - and whether the Council is also going to take part in this important debate on the individual countries, which does actually constitute the substantive debate on enlargement.
I am very disappointed that this does not seem to be the case.
Perhaps you could note this in a suitable letter.
I believe that it shows a lack of respect for this Parliament if this important debate on the individual countries, which really is a central component of the enlargement process, is not followed by the Council.
