- Mr Schmitt' s report is supported by the majority of my group.
The advantages of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency in place of 15 national agencies are undisputed:
It can create uniform authorisation procedures,
it can standardise the rules on air safety and environmental protection, and
it can create standard provisions relating to the safety of products, persons and installations.
At the same time, the new Agency would be a recognised partner for aviation authorities in other parts of the world.
The functions of the Agency are clearly defined: consultancy, providing technical support to the Commission, issuing the requisite official documentation, conducting checks and inspections, monitoring the implementation of statutory provisions, devising and funding research projects and cooperating with the agencies of non-EU countries.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted other important amendments which would make the Agency more independent of the Commission as well as defining the obligation of the Agency to keep the European Parliament informed.
My group also attaches importance to the provisions that are designed to increase transparency.
These would subject the Agency to the following controls:
General Community budgetary procedures would apply to the Agency,
Community anti-fraud legislation would apply to the Agency, and
the Agency would be subject to regular external assessments.
For these reasons the vast majority of our group voted in favour of the report.
