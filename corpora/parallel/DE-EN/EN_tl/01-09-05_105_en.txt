Madam President, allow me to explain my vote on the Swoboda report.
Although the problem of transalpine traffic to which Mr Swoboda refers in his report primarily affects Austria, it also relates to the entire Brenner corridor.
That is where we have the problem, which derives from the fact that the proposal and the ideas presented by the Commission lose a very great deal of credibility as far as the area between Verona and Munich is concerned by seeking to amend a Protocol to the Act of Accession unilaterally.
We are in favour of tighter ecological restrictions.
We are in favour of measures if they respect the interests and equal rights of the people and companies that operate in the area in question.
But it is absolutely imperative that contractual law be upheld, both now and in the future.
