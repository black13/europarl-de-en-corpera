The FPÃ– members voted for the enlargement report on the Czech Republic.
However, I wish to reiterate our position on paragraphs 42-44 of the report.
The Melk Accord between Austria and the Czech Republic has failed to achieve the desired results so far.
Its objectives have not been met.
A satisfactory outcome can only be obtained if the Temelin issue is dealt with at European rather than at bilateral level.
What is required, therefore, is a European initiative on the closure of Temelin which sets forth a timetable and financing options for its final phasing out and involves the Commission and the Member States.
