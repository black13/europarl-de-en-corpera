European air travel is expanding rapidly, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years.
Protecting users of air transport, i.e. passengers, and guaranteeing their safety, health and consumers' rights are becoming more and more important as air transport increases, especially as the new possibilities for travellers to book and buy airline tickets via the Internet offer advantages but also pose risks.
The Commission' s proposal on which the report is based offers better protection to air transport users, especially as regards access to information about their rights as passengers.
It also offers the airlines the opportunity to enter into voluntary commitments with the airports.
I especially welcome the proposed strengthening of the legal framework to protect consumers, as it sets forth clear, binding and legally enforceable rules which must be complied with by all the airlines.
Experience has shown that these framework rules are essential so that air passengers are fully aware of their legal rights in the event of a dispute.
This does not mean that I am against voluntary commitments on principle, but I would prefer legally enforceable rules to govern the relationship between the airline and the airport as well.
This is not envisaged in the report, however.
The question which therefore arises is this: who is to regulate compliance with the voluntary commitments, and what methods should be used to address non-compliance?
Based on these considerations, we also support Mr Collins' demand that any issues which cannot be settled satisfactorily in the interests of consumers through voluntary commitments should be dealt with in separate proposals at a later date.
On behalf of my group, I therefore support Mr Collins' report.
