Mr President, I have listened to your comments with interest, but I would like to refer back to my question, Question No 6: What conclusions should now be drawn for European Council meetings in future, not only as regards policing but also in organisational and policy terms?
In particular, I should like to know whether you are considering reducing the number of participants and the agenda, as has happened with the G8 summits.
If the European Council meetings are only to take place in Belgium in future, has the idea of its own designated location been considered?
Are there any thoughts on this issue and if so, what are they?
