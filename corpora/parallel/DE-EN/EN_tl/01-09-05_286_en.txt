Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you yourselves are familiar with the hundred franc note in Belgium, which is worth about 2 euro.
In Greece, there is the thousand drachma note, which is only worth 0.5 cents.
In other words, we are quite used to having a largely paper-based currency, so my question is this: do you think it is likely that we will ultimately have one or two euro notes as well, given that the five euro note is currently the smallest denomination?
In the southern countries in particular, notes are far more popular than coins.
