Mr President, at the end of this debate I should like to say a few words of thanks, first of all to the chairman of the committee.
We did not know each other before the committee was formed, and yet within a few days we were cooperating as if we had been working together for years.
This is not to be taken for granted; it is no everyday occurrence.
Thank you very much for that.
I thank the members of the committee.
We did not always agree, but the atmosphere between the members was never unpleasant, and our cooperation was constructive.
These are also things we cannot always count on in this House.
So let me express my sincere thanks to them too.
My thanks go the Secretariat, the Secretary-General and his staff, and to the many people who have helped us with their advice and information.
Some of them are mentioned in the report.
There are others who have not been mentioned in their own interest.
My gratitude to them is no less heartfelt.
(Applause)
