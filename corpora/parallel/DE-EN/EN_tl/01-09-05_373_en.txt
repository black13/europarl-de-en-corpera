Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nistic√≤ has submitted an outstanding report whose content I fully support.
It is essential that this directive creates uniform standards for the safety and quality of blood and plasma in the Member States.
To this end, identical procedures for testing blood and plasma must be adopted which comply with the most recent techniques.
Trained personnel should ensure the highest safety standards for donors and recipients alike.
A transparent system of traceability and labelling will allow blood to be traced from donor to recipient and back.
This also helps to minimise the risk of infection.
Voluntary, non-remunerated donation is, and should remain, a basic principle.
Unlike Mr Lund, I believe that there is certainly no direct link between non-remunerated and remunerated donation and safety/quality.
The key issue is the selection of donors and testing by qualified personnel.
However, reimbursement for plasma donors must not be ruled out in the European Union in future.
Europe can only cover 50% of its plasma needs.
The shortfall is made up from plasma from the US, for which the donors have received payment.
The import of plasma from paid donors must not be prohibited by the new directive.
This would inevitably lead to supply shortages, which would also affect the manufacture of medicines from these products.
Plasma is required to produce vital medicines such as coagulation factor 8 and coagulation factor 7 for haemophiliacs, and immunoglobulins to prevent infection in patients with congenital immune deficiency.
A shortage would put many patients' health at risk.
I would ask you to bear this in mind when voting.
