Mr President, I am sure we all agree that terrorism is one of the most critical challenges our society has to face.
It is a global phenomenon, with cells operating throughout the world.
It can therefore only be effectively combated internationally.
Fighting terrorism also means defending human rights and democracy.
The cowardly terrorist attacks and murders we have seen recently, which have been at their most virulent in Spain, testify to the need to intensify European anti-terrorist cooperation.
International terrorism, which draws support from many a dictator or Islamic fundamentalist regime, cannot be effectively combated in the European Union unless the competent national authorities cooperate with each other.
Our House also bears responsibility in this respect; to exercise this responsibility, we must nail our colours to the mast by adopting this report on the role of the Union in combating terrorism and making it clear that we are unanimously committed to the fight against terrorist activity.
I wish to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work towards this goal.
Our proposals are intended to create the conditions for effective European cooperation among the Member States in order to put an end to the murders committed by terrorist organisations such as ETA in Spain.
