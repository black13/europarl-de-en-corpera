Madam President, I had to wait to see whether the amendment proposed by the Liberal Group was carried.
We are now looking at Amendment No 2, which relates to the BSE risk in the candidate countries.
This risk is only referred to in the report on Poland.
This is why I have tabled an amendment referring to the fact that this risk is also present in other countries, because the wording would otherwise have amounted to discrimination against Poland.
But I made a mistake: the amendment says 'in all other countries' , but it should read 'in other countries' .
There are different risk categories.
Subject to that alteration, I recommend that the House adopt this amendment so as not to discriminate against Poland.
(Parliament agreed to take the oral amendment into account)
