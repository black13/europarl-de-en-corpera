Closer European cultural cooperation is a welcome and desirable aim.
I voted for the Ruffolo report because I firmly believe that closer cultural cooperation will be mutually enriching.
Familiarisation with other cultures helps nations and peoples to understand each other and fosters peace.
The culture and language of the migrant communities in Europe must not go unmentioned in this context, and I call on the European Union to ensure that some of its financial aid is used to support the cultural activity of these ethnic groups.
Cultural cooperation in Europe is a fundamental aspect of closer European integration.
By learning about each other' s cultures, the people of our countries can undoubtedly develop a sense of European identity.
I consider this particularly important, because Europe is still remote from its people, for whom it is something situated in distant Brussels.
Besides its unity, Europe is also characterised by its cultural diversity.
That is of inestimable value and helps peoples to live together in peace.
I am determined to work for a Europe whose inhabitants do not merely coexist but, above all, engage in fruitful interaction.
