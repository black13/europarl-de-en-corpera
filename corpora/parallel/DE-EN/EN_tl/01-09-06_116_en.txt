Mr President, the Council, Commission and Parliament are well aware of the situation in Zimbabwe.
No one can claim they knew nothing about it.
In taking a passive line, the Council of Ministers is guilty of aiding and abetting.
It is outrageous that, yet again, the Council's 'Africa' working party failed to pass a resolution at its meeting in Brussels yesterday.
Obviously the presidency is only paying lip service to Africa, despite advertising it as a priority.
Unfortunately, France is the ringleader of a group of Member States that obviously has a different agenda.
How else are we to explain the fact that, while everyone else is either stopping or drastically cutting back on funding, France is increasing it.
I call on the Member States of the European Union who want to take a more active line to step up their collaboration, even before the Treaty of Nice takes effect, and to remind France and the rest that they are surely backing the wrong horse in taking this de facto passive line.
I think, my dear Mrs Kinnock, that Mr Mugabe will have no need of our resolutions or demands if he decides to impose a state of emergency.
He will do so anyway because, even if the elections are held, he will lose.
