Mr President, neither BSE nor foot-and-mouth are British diseases; they are a European problem.
With millions of animals being slaughtered and farms being crippled or wiped out, this is hardly the time for party political argument.
I well remember how Labour let fly at the Conservative government during the BSE crisis and now there is the temptation for the Conservatives to let fly at the Labour government, but even if governments are guilty of omission, what you are doing here is not exactly constructive.
We have submitted a regulation on feeding meat and bonemeal in certain cases - we are talking animal waste here.
Had we had it at the time, there would have been no BSE problem.
The same applies to foot-and-mouth.
The Commission needs to change its strategy.
Holland may have ring vaccinated successfully, but it was only by going against the mood in the EU and the Commission.
I do not want you to help, I want you to do something so that we end up with a different strategy which we can then also secure through our trade policy.
We must move away from this insane strategy of 'foot-and-mouth free' or 'disease free' and discuss this with our trading partners.
We need a regulation on feeding or destroying leftovers.
What the Council has done now, that is, just banning, is no help at all.
This rubbish has to go somewhere and we cannot dump it in landfills because then the problem of improper processing will keep recurring.
