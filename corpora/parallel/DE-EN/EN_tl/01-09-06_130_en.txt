Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The number of cases of foot-and-mouth is on the rise once again.
As you know, the foot-and-mouth virus is harmless to man but is highly infectious to all cloven-hoofed animals and results in huge financial losses.
With new outbreaks occurring, I again call on the Commission and the Council to favour vaccination rather than slaughter.
We must rethink how we fight zoonoses in Europe and today we have what I think is a very balanced resolution in order to do so.
Consistent preventive hygiene is only one side of the coin.
With people travelling the world for business and pleasure, foot-and-mouth disease is an ever-present threat and we must be far more consistent in applying controls at airports to prevent this epidemic from coming in and spreading.
I realise that both farmers and consumers are having difficulties with the ethical implications of the current vaccination policy.
We are talking fatal consequences here.
We must, at long last, move away from our non-vaccination policy.
We need marker vaccines.
We need a reasonable approach to ring vaccination and we need to make up our minds once and for all to show through our policy that science needs to make progress with prevention, that is, by formulating suitable vaccines.
