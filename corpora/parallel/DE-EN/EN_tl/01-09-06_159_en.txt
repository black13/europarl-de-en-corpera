Mr Wurtz, you were not present.
First of all, it was Mr Miranda who attacked the other Member and I allowed the other Member to speak briefly in order to reply.
That is the end of the matter because if Mr Miranda says something else and Mr Ribeiro e Castro says something else, we may very well be here all day.
Both gentlemen had the chance to speak on the same subject and the final score is therefore 1 all!
