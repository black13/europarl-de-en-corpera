Mr President, I should like to say on a point of order that the President took absolutely the right line because Mr Ribeiro e Castro did not stand up for UNITA; on the contrary, he signed a motion criticising it.
He criticised it in his speech and the President allowed him to respond to your personal attack.
To my mind, therefore, the President took absolutely the right line.
