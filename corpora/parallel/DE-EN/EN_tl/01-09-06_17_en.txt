Mr President, this may well look like a fight over a tiny paragraph somewhere in the EU's great system of treaties, but I believe that what we are dealing with is a quite fundamental question and not just a cultural contrast.
Again we see that the world has not yet managed to allow the principles of the Enlightenment, which have found their way into American case law via the Constitution and the Freedom of Information Act, to travel to Europe, because the Enlightenment unfortunately made no inroads into the French administrative tradition.
That is again how one experiences these various speeches.
It is a bitter experience to find that the EU is still where it was on 17 December 1992, when dealing with the draft on the Ombudsman.
In any case, however, here we are, and I believe that this time we will win.
The many complaints from citizens having problems with EU institutions are essentially to do with so much still being withheld or suppressed.
What is now being proposed in the Garrett Report, which in my opinion can only be supported, is only the first step.
At first it should be the Ombudsman who is actually given access to all documents, but then it should also be the citizens themselves.
We urgently need here a reversal of the burden of proof; I would, indeed, demand of the Ombudsman that he should tell us in future what documents he has still not received where regulations on confidentiality have been invoked, and that we should, by means of this reversal of the burden of proof, reach the point where we really are living out a democracy and, as far as possible, have access to all documents and also to public sittings of the Council.
For I am firmly convinced that a democracy cannot exist without transparency.
