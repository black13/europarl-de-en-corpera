Mr President, Mr Ebner, well done!
A good report.
Like under a burning glass, mountain farming shows what happens when you try and master sustainable land management tailored to a particular location.
Your report also has a drawback, however.
It only focuses on this aspect.
It is interesting that the House, or rather those still in it - although they do, after all, represent the majorities - can reach a majority understanding on these numerous excellent proposals and warnings.
It is true of agriculture as a whole that we should have fostered sustainable management in general, but then there would have been no agreement here, so that this acts as an alibi and that is a pity.
However, that should not detract from the usefulness of this report and we shall, of course, vote in favour of it.
We should like, however, to widen this debate to agriculture as a whole in order to achieve sustainable land management tailored to each particular location.
