Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Kinnock's report is a huge achievement and is to be welcomed unreservedly.
The ACP countries of sub-Saharan Africa are some of the least developed countries.
There are depressing educational deficits here and women and children are deprived of even the most rudimentary basic education.
There are examples, however, which give cause for hope and it is these which I should like to address.
The government of Mali which, as you know, is a bitterly poor country in the Sahel, has imposed an ambitious political programme which courageously tackles decentralisation and comprehensive education reforms.
Children in Mali, boys and girls, are to receive a good school education, where possible in their regional or ethnic dialect.
That is easier said than done, however, because no teachers have been trained in the regional dialects and there are no corresponding curricula, let alone books.
Teachers need to be trained first and books need to be written first; and that is not something which can be done overnight and it is not something which can cover the whole country straight away.
You only have to think of the nomadic groups in the desert.
They require special schools and special arrangements, to name but one example.
This is an enormous challenge in education policy and is being extremely well supported by numerous donor organisations.
The radio can help, especially in sparsely populated regions.
The numerous local and regional stations which have started up in Mali, as in other developing countries, could easily be used for decentralised education plans, even if the tapes used are produced centrally.
Lessons over the radio have always been a way of life in the Australian outback.
In Africa, customised electronic methods and mobile schools could go a long way towards rectifying the education deficit.
It would be rewarding for the development cooperation of the European Union if we were to be involved in these new methods.
