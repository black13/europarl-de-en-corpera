Mr President, as a democrat, I have to take on board decisions even if I do not like them.
Yesterday, however, in connection with my report, a decision was taken which points in two directions.
After we had already discussed the legal basis for this decision, and also raised appropriate objections to it, to which we received no response from the Commission, this House decided yesterday to agree to the Commission's legislative proposal and then passed a resolution rejecting the Commission's proposal.
This is recorded under item 11 of the Minutes.
I would now like to propose that the resolution passed by this Parliament yesterday be referred to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the purposes of clarification under Article 148(3).
There are two specific reasons for this: Firstly, we need clarification as to which of the two resolutions in this instance is actually valid.
Secondly, we need, for the future too, clarification in the Rules of Procedure as to what is to happen in cases such as this.
For if, as appears to me, votes are being, as it were, immediately corrected by the authorities, I find that not exactly in order.
I believe that a correction should in principle be made if the Committee on Constitutional Affairs so decides.
I therefore base my objection on Article 148(3).
I request this House's Committee on Constitutional Affairs to clarify the situation and set down a ruling in the Rules of Procedure as to how we should proceed in future cases of this sort.
