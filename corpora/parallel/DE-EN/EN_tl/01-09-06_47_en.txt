Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to thank the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and you in particular, Mr Lannoye, as rapporteur, for examining the drafts of the five so-called vertical directives communicated to you by the Council.
These directives relate to sugars intended for human consumption, to honey, to fruit juices and similar products intended for human consumption, to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption and to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut pur√©e intended for human consumption.
The Commission welcomes the way that Parliament has kept to the guidelines given by the Council on comitology and has thereby agreed to replace the advisory committee procedure by the regulatory committee procedure.
As regards the amendments to the Council's five drafts, the Commission notes that Parliament had been heard as early as 1996 on the corresponding proposals by the Commission and had adopted positions on them in the sittings of 14 January 1998 and 4 May 1999.
Even though some of these amendments appear to me thoroughly sensible from the editorial or technical point of view, I regret however that I must point out that, as has been said, we are dealing here with Council drafts and not with original proposals by the Commission and that these amendments therefore apply to the Council drafts and not to the Commission's proposals.
I must therefore, unfortunately, observe that the Commission cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report.
