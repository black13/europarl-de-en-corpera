Mr President, I have no wish to hold up the vote but this morning I raised an objection to the session minutes under Rule 148(3).
Rule 148(3) requires a decision by Parliament.
No such decision has been taken.
I just wanted to know what happens to my objection now.
Secondly, I should like to point out that we decided yesterday to adopt the Commission proposal on which I reported.
We then adopted a legislative resolution rejecting the Commission proposal.
The services changed this in the Minutes to 'approves the Commission proposal' .
However, item 4 still contains a sentence which contradicts the first decision because it still says that the upper ceiling is to be maintained, which was something we rejected at the outset.
Because of this contradiction in the current draft minutes, I have asked that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs should be instructed to look into the matter with a view to making a general amendment to the Rules of Procedure clarifying what happens when this sort of contradiction arises.
I just wanted to point out that no decision has yet been taken on my objection to the minutes, as required under Article 148 (3).
I assume that the Minutes have not been approved on this point and will not therefore be approved until a later date.
