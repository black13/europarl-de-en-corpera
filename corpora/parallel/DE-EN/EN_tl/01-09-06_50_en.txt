Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr Swoboda is making a mistake and I would ask you to consider it carefully.
Parliament did indeed make a slightly contradictory decision yesterday, I repeat a slightly contradictory decision.
We adopted the Commission proposal on the transit system by a clear majority of 303 votes to 253.
The proposal says that the previous upper ceiling is to be abolished.
Parliament approved this by a clear majority.
In my view, item 4 has been included because of a faux pas by a number of colleagues.
However, there is still no material contradiction here because we also call on the Commission in item 4 to maintain an upper ceiling until the ecopoint system expires.
In other words, we clearly decided in the legislative act to adopt the Commission proposal.
If the Council agrees, and I hope that it does, then all will be well.
The second call in item 4 is a call for the Commission to reflect.
What the Commission does in this case, whether it proposes a new upper ceiling or no upper ceiling, is up to the Commission.
We did not, as you will see if you read the second clause, call for the old upper ceiling; we said the Commission might like to consider setting a new, reasonable upper ceiling.
However, this faux pas was carried by a majority.
All that means, however, is that the Commission has been asked to reflect and submit an opinion to Parliament once it has done so.
Parliament's clear position was, is, and remains - and in this respect there is nothing to correct, Mr Swoboda - that we approved the Commission's position yesterday by a large majority and I should like to confirm as much.
