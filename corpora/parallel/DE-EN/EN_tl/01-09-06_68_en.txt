Mr President, before we vote on this motion, I should like to point out that, if we vote in favour of this motion, we shall be in serious violation of European primary law, by which I mean the fundamental Treaties of the European Union.
It is unacceptable, in a democratically constructed Europe, for the Ombudsman to be given control over Members.
It is unacceptable for Members to be accountable, irrespective of how much one approves of and supports the office of the ombudsman.
(Applause)
