Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I rejected the Evans report because I am not in favour of renationalising competition policy in Europe.
If the Commission gives up its monopoly on exemptions in the future, this will not reform competition law, it will merely change the system.
If the Commission then confines itself to supervising abuses within the context of this changed system, then that is something which, to my mind, is highly questionable.
If national courts in the European Union are allowed to return judgments under competition law in the future, we shall no longer, I think, be able to talk of a uniform competition policy in Europe, especially now that the European Union is preparing for enlargement.
What we need is a European Monopolies and Mergers Commission and I think that is what we should be working towards.
