Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that this report has been presented.
Every one of us who has read 'Desert Flower' by Waris Dirie will always be shocked and appalled by this practice.
I am thinking today of the 130 million women and girls who have been subjected to female genital mutilation, and each year some two million more are affected.
I am also thinking of the many young girls who die horrifically as a result.
Let me say from the outset that I am strongly in favour of the EU and its Member States adopting a joint position to abolish these practices which are harmful to women's sexual and reproductive health.
Within the framework of a joint immigration and asylum policy, the Commission and the Council will have to take account of these aspects of female genital mutilation.
The same applies to refugee policy.
In this context, let me point out - and this is clear, in my view - that asylum will then be granted primarily when political protection is required for reasons of state.
Genital mutilation is a grey area, and it is usually carried out by private individuals.
This makes it even more difficult to combat the practice.
A great deal of persuasion, public information and educational work is required from all of us and a change of attitude is needed in society as a whole.
For me, genital mutilation is a human rights violation which I cannot accept under any circumstances or from anyone.
A public debate on this issue is needed to raise awareness both in the EU and in the developing countries and spare future generations of women this dreadful mutilation.
Above all, we must ensure - and this has been mentioned by previous speakers - that this practice is also outlawed in the Member States, for I know that there is a major grey area here.
I ask everyone to work together with a genuine will to stop this practice.
