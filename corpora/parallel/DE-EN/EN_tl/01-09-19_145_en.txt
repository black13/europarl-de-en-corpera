Mr President, around 12 million people in the EU are reported to have been subjected to bullying at work.
The real figure is far higher.
The victims suffer exclusion and harassment, rumours are spread about them, they are deliberately denied information and scapegoated.
Managers or staff - anyone can become a victim or a bully.
The impact of harassment is still completely underestimated, so very few effective instruments are available.
Yet it is a serious workplace problem.
It causes aggression and stress, sickness, resignations, staff turnover - all of which cost the economy and the social systems several 100 million euro per year.
Together, the fifteen EU Member States must take stock of the situation.
Best practice approaches will help us all benefit from an exchange of experience and devise effective measures to combat the problem.
However, solutions must be tailored to the type of bullying involved, which can be gender-specific, age-specific or racist.
Jan Andersson has submitted an outstanding report.
It was quite rightly adopted unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Almost all the proposed amendments from the PPE-DE have been integrated, such as consultation with Europe's social partners on developing joint anti-harassment strategies.
In practice, this will involve constructive conflict management, better internal communications, and the creation of support networks for victims.
We also propose appointing a confidential mediator at the workplace to whom employees can turn if they so wish.
Ms Diamantopoulou, we firmly expect the Commission to submit a Green Paper next year on the issue of bullying at work so that we can develop an action programme which will have a sustained impact.
