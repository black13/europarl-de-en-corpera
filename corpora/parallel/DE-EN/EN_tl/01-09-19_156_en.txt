Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs for their tenacity and commitment.
I have no doubt that these were essential qualities during the negotiations with the Council, especially in the discussions about large combustion plants.
This House was determined to ensure that old plants were included in this directive as well, and finally achieved this goal.
This is a key area in which we have been successful.
However, we have not been entirely successful.
We have had to accept a great many derogations, extensions and lower limit values, not because no other option was technically feasible - for otherwise we would frequently have been accused of trying to achieve the impossible.
In this instance, it is quite obvious that upgrading existing plants to meet the standards in modern installations presents no problems from a technical point of view.
Indeed, in many sectors, this is already a reality.
No, the resistance focussed solely on microeconomic factors relating to specific large combustion plants.
This is a short-sighted view.
We must think macroeconomically and take account of the public health costs of pollution and harmful emissions.
In this respect, I simply cannot understand the Council's negotiating position on this issue.
However, as the directive now includes old plants, I shall vote for the compromise as well.
