Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity in speech must now give way to solidarity in action.
In Germany, the Christian Democratic parties - the CDU and CSU - feel, in any case, that we have obligations towards the Americans in our joint resistance to terrorism, too.
American action was decisive in the reconstruction of our country and the recovery of our unity.
So we must share with them the burden of combating terrorism.
Mr Vitorino's proposals are a first step on this road, and the right one.
They are not, however, short-term measures.
They will become effective in 2002 at the earliest.
Right and proper as they are, we can and must do more.
We can, for example, make Europol better equipped than it is at present.
Europol urgently needs an agreement with the USA, within the framework of laws currently in force, on the exchange of data in the fight against terrorism.
Such arrangements have previously foundered on our making our data protection provisions into the measure of all things.
Our protection of data has therefore been of more use to the terrorists than it has to their victims.
We must make it possible for Europol to become immediately operational.
We must at once put in place whatever joint action teams are available.
Wherever terrorists are being investigated, Europol must be on the spot and promoting the immediate exchange of data between the investigators and those working in Europol headquarters.
These opportunities already exist, and we must seize them.
It can be done within the framework of the laws in force and does not require us to wait for the incorporation of directives into national law.
