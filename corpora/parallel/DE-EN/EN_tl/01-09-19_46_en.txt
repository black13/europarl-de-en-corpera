Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we can see that the response to this terrorist act is being prepared, and I believe it is being done with great care.
The United States is dealing with this business calmly and attempting to solve the problem in a multilateral context, including cooperation with NATO.
This indicates that all is being done with calm deliberation.
I believe that, for this reason, we must also make it clear that there is no reason for us to evade our responsibilities and obligations, not simply because of our gratitude and not only in order to guarantee the future of transatlantic relations, but because it is in our most fundamental best interests.
Terrorism is taking on the dimensions of a war and resulting in destruction the like of which we knew only in wartime; it is this terrorism that is in a position to strike in the same way at Brussels today, London tomorrow and Madrid the day after tomorrow!
The combatants are already in our midst, and so nobody can steal away.
Nobody, I believe, should look for an alibi, a reason not to join in when the action really does start; and, when it does, it will involve the taking of steps which we must develop on the basis of a new definition of security policy: military action involving the application of all foreign policy instruments, for example the prevention of alliances in favour of the other side, and in conjunction with internal security, about which Mr Vitorino and many in this House have already spoken.
On this last point, it must be clear that cross-border measures can be put in place against cross-border terrorism and that the best national legislation and the best national police can do nothing without cooperation in this sphere.
Let me finally say just one thing: nothing justifies terrorism, but we must still make it our concern to remove the root causes of support for it.
We must, therefore, play our part in removing the breeding-grounds for terrorism in the Middle East and in many other regions
