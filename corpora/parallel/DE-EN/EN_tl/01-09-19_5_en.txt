Madam President, of course Mr Swoboda is entitled to receive an accurate reply.
I just want to ask your services to give it on the basis of the midday debate.
Not to be too blunt about it, I had the feeling that Mr Swoboda, on the day itself, tried to use an amendment of the Minutes to change the outcome of this House's vote.
For this reason, I ask that the midday debate should be taken as the basis of any answer your services give to Mr Swoboda, and please be so kind as to let me have a copy of it.
I am quite sure that your services understood perfectly well what this House had in mind!
