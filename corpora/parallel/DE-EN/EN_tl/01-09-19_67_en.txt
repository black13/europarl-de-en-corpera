Mr President, Commissioner, the Cohesion Fund was created in order to prepare the structurally weak countries of the EU for economic and monetary union.
The cohesion countries have substantially caught up over the past few years and they all participate in EMU.
I would therefore observe that this objective of the Cohesion Fund has been attained.
Despite this, Agenda 2000 decided that the Cohesion Fund should continue.
Would it not have been consistent to let the Cohesion Fund expire, not abruptly perhaps but by its being phased out?
The eastward enlargement means that the EU's present cohesion policy cannot be continued with any longer.
We all know that eastward enlargement will not be for free, and this must be said frankly.
Apart from that, I too believe that much is going wrong with our cohesion policy as regards efficiency, administrative costs and this policy's vulnerability to deception.
What the cohesion policy needs is a fundamental debate about its strengths and weaknesses, that is, about its possible reform.
I know that this is a difficult debate, being about our patrimony.
But it is also about a quite fundamental question: what, in the EU, does solidarity mean?
