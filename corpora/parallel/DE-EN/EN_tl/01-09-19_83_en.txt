Mr President, it is intolerable that people should embark on another debate when the speaking time has expired and the Commissioner has spoken.
I would ask you to prevent this in future, otherwise I too would like to speak for another two minutes.
As it is, I can only say that the Commissioner has replied very well to all our questions and that we are very grateful to him.
