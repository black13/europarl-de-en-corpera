Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council's proposal offers refugees an opportunity to acquire refugee status under the Geneva Convention in accordance with uniform criteria which will apply throughout the European Union.
This proposal guarantees rapid and reliable procedures for genuine refugees - who account for around 10% of all those who apply for asylum - and also ensures that unsuccessful applications will be rejected quickly.
This applies to around 90% of asylum seekers who apply for reasons other than genuine persecution.
That is better than being forced to wait for years before being informed of a negative decision.
This proposal also puts an end to 'asylum shopping' .
However, we also need supplementary measures.
These include the Dublin Convention, Eurodac, and rules on safe third countries and safe countries of origin.
The European People' s Party therefore supports the Council's proposal.
However, on behalf of the PPE-DE, I should like to make it clear that asylum law must not now be exploited for political purposes through all the amendments and proposals put forward here and used as a pretext for immigration on many different grounds.
This ignores the reality.
We must use these new European instruments for immigration, asylum or short-term help when refugees come from war-torn regions.
We must not adopt any unrealistic measures.
In future, it must be guaranteed that the right of asylum will be reserved for those who are politically persecuted and will not be extended to groups who some people might want to bring here for political reasons but who do not comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention.
Our aim must be to guarantee reliable and prompt support for genuine refugees, as well as follow-up measures to assist them with integration.
At the same time, we must make it clear to everyone else that there will be other new instruments governing economic immigration into the European Union.
