Madam President, Commissioner, in a situation in which the outrages in the USA have been used by some people as a pretext to incite antipathy towards asylum seekers, it is especially important for the European Union to devise minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status which are based on respect for human rights.
The Commission's proposal meets this requirement.
I particularly welcome two provisions proposed by the Commission.
Article 3(3) states that Member States may decide to apply the provisions of this Directive to procedures for deciding on applications for kinds of protection other than that emanating from the Geneva Convention for persons who are found not to be refugees.
This means that persons fleeing from fundamentalist violence - as in Algeria - or rape victims can be granted asylum.
The UNHCR has been calling for this provision for some time.
Unfortunately, it has not yet been adopted in practice in my own country, for example.
Annex 1 sets forth the three criteria which must be met for a country to be defined as a safe third country.
If these criteria are applied in future, some of the deportations from EU countries will no longer be permitted.
I am pleased that the Commission's acceptable proposal has been improved by the Committee responsible and not watered down as the original rapporteur Mr Schmitt intended.
As it now stands, the Directive is an important step towards a more humane asylum policy in the European Union.
