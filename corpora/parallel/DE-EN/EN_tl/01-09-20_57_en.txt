Mr President, on behalf of my 34 colleagues from the Social Democratic Party of Germany and also on my own behalf, I should like to make the following comments about the vote on the Watson report, which was formerly the Schmitt report.
In the Federal Republic at present, the issue of immigration/asylum legislation and residence rights in Germany are the subject of a very broad debate.
The Federal government, the German Bundestag, the LÃ¤nder, party commissions and cross-party commissions have been engaged in an intensive debate on issues which to some extent fall within the scope of the Watson report, and we are currently in the process of debating legislation within Parliament and between Parliament, the Federal government and the Bundesrat.
Against this background, the SPD representatives in this House have been presented with Commission proposals, the opinions of the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt - now Mr Watson - and proposals from the various groups which partly conform and partly conflict with the domestic policy issues facing Social Democrats in Germany.
On a number of points, we have therefore deviated from our group's voting behaviour or rejected the proposals.
Here, our apparent proximity to the PPE-DE Group exists solely on paper, for our substantive views are generally different from theirs.
However, we joined our group in supporting the Watson report in the final vote out of our sense of Social Democratic loyalty, although in terms of German constitutional law, we had major concerns on a number of issues which we believed it was important to voice.
I felt I should explain this background because when the vote was taken in this House, we had yet to reach a position in the domestic policy debate.
As a result, some of what we have agreed here does not necessarily tie in with what we are debating at home.
