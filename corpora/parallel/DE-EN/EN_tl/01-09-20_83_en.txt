We have been discussing equal pay for equal work and for work of equal value since my youth, and that is a long time ago.
The ILO's Equal Remuneration Convention has existed since 1951.
In the European Community the principle of 'equal pay for equal work' was laid down in Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome in 1958.
Yet as is always the case whenever it is a matter of justice for women in any walk of life, in implementing the principle of equal pay, the politicians are dragging their feet, as are the trade unions, unfortunately, which are still male-dominated organisations.
We have had the Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women since 1975.
We have action programmes and a Community framework strategy on gender equality.
We have countless resolutions and guidelines.
We have the Beijing Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in 1995.
And now we have this report which - in view of the fact that the average wage gap between men and women in the EU still stands at almost 30% - is by no means unnecessary, for on women's issues in particular, we know that constant dripping wears away stone.
In the 17 recitals and 19 paragraphs contained in this resolution, which I support, we have put forward a great many sound and useful proposals designed to eliminate this wage gap, which continues even after retirement and especially affects women with lower pension provision, thus resulting in lifelong discrimination.
It is clear that action is required from the social partners in particular.
However, what is also required is courage from the women concerned and their representatives, especially the women's organisations.
In reality, we have sound legal bases on which to act against wage discrimination.
