Madam President, as a parliamentarian I feel myself to be represented by the President of this House above all others, and so it is to you that I wish to address a very specific query relating to what was said by Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
The Italian Prime Minister's statement has been criticised by many, including - which may be surprising - by Mr Haider, who found it too xenophobic.
Madam President, you have always strongly advocated dialogue with Islam, and have also taken definite steps in the direction of such dialogue.
Your policy stands in contradiction to what Mr Berlusconi has said.
In view of the fact that you have had very forthright things to say in other situations - which I did not always find easy to defend back home, but I defended you because I have always valued your clear language - I think it important that you should find equally clear and unambiguous words in this connection.
It is this that I ask of you.
Perhaps these words have passed me by; perhaps I have not heard them or not read them.
I would ask you to make this Parliament's position in respect of these remarks quite clear.
This is a Parliament that has always promoted dialogue and has always engaged in it.
Our whole existence as a Parliament is bound up with the dialogue between religions and between cultures, and I believe that you, as President of this Parliament, should say so clearly and unambiguously on this occasion.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
