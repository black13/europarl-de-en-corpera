Madam President, I would very much like to add to what has been said.
You win some, you lose some - that is normal.
But we need proper preparation in matters as serious as this.
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, the right time for calm discussion of this would have been at the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, when you were absent - which is not an accusation, these things happen to us all.
It would be a good thing if this House were to have a joint ballot on such important issues.
I ask you to arrange things in the future so that we discuss such matters in the Conference of Presidents in the first instance.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
