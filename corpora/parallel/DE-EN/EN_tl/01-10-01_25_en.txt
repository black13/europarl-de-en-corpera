Madam President, I am one of those Members of this House whose cultural background is not exactly Christian.
There was a statement recently by a statesman, who should speak in a statesmanlike manner, but who, when speaking about Muslims and Christians, actually, in my opinion, dropped something of a clanger.
I deeply regret that we were unable to deliver a joint response, but had to have a discussion instead.
I greatly regret this, because we should be counteracting escalation.
A dialogue is urgently needed specifically between Muslims and Christians.
The Italian Prime Minister's spoken contribution added nothing, but was highly counter-productive.
For this reason, I greatly regret that we were unable to counter it with a common response.
