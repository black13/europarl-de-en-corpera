Madam President, Mr Poettering's highly credible words show that he represents only part of his group, for hardly had he come to the end of his speech than Mr Santini asserted the very opposite of what Mr Poettering had described as being the position of the Christian Democrat Members of this House.
It would, then, be consistent of Mr Poettering to call upon the Forza Italia members of his group to fall in with the group's position, for what Mr Fiori proceeded to say shows that what Mr Poettering expresses here is not the view of the Christian Democrat members, but only the opinion of some of them.
Madam President, I did not hear your radio and television statement myself, but many of those who were able to do so said that you had taken up an excellent position on behalf of the European Parliament in respect of Mr Berlusconi's remarks and have told me emphatically that Mrs Fontaine's position is exactly that which the European Parliament should take up.
Let me first congratulate you on it.
I would, though, also like to ask you to do the following: as your position is visibly the majority view of this House, you should again expressly communicate this position to Mr Berlusconi and, at the same time, ask him - in order to dispel any doubt - to make a statement in reply.
For if his cultural relativism were really nothing but a misunderstanding, your letter and an appropriate response from Mr Berlusconi would be decidedly helpful.
