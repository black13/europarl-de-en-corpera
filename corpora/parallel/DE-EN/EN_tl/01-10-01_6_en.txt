Madam President, I would like to say again on behalf of our group what I said on 12 September - I believe with the agreement of all in this European Parliament - namely that the terror perpetrated by human beings must not be confused with the peace-loving Muslim faith.
I refer back to Anwar el Sadat's tremendous speech to the European Parliament on 10 February 1981 - we were meeting in Luxembourg in those days - in which he said: "Islam is a religion of love and not of hatred".
On behalf of our group, I wish again to observe that we oppose the rhetoric which speaks of a clash of civilisations and that we desire partnership and friendship with all peace-loving Arab and Islamic countries.
It is precisely for that reason, indeed, that I proposed that we should convene the Mediterranean Forum.
I am given to understand, Madam President, that you too have it in mind to submit a proposal to this end.
Having been addressed personally, I wish to point out certain misunderstandings which originate with a Member of the Commission.
We agreed in the Conference of Presidents - Mr Bar√≥n Crespo was unable to be there last Thursday - that we do not want to make this the subject of the debate here in the plenary sitting but wish, rather, in the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, to consult with the Member of the Commission about the remarks that have been made.
On behalf of our group, let me say here and now that we reach out our hands to all peace-loving Muslims, wherever they live throughout the world, be it outside the European Union, in the Arab and Islamic states or in a country of the European Union; we want peace, partnership and friendship with all Muslims of good will!
