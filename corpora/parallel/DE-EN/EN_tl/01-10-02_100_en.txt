Mr President, the report is more critical on the subject of the export of weapons than any previous report by Mr Titley.
Despite this, we must observe that its demands do not reach their target either as regards parliamentary scrutiny or as regards transparency.
As far as parliamentary scrutiny is concerned, there is no demand for formal provision for an opinion by the European Parliament, and that is the least we can ask for if we are to have some degree of influence.
I take an even more critical line on what is said about transparency.
Here, Mr Titley speaks of transparency in the form of a framework agreement.
We know, however, that the framework agreement between six EU States to promote the defence of industry and of a global defence market is precisely the most opaque procedure ever, that it clasps tightly what it used to give: no parliamentary scrutiny and no debate, even on the conclusion and ratification of this agreement.
That must be changed.
