Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for giving us this interim report now.
We are dissatisfied with the Member States, which have practically left you in the lurch over the last eighteen months.
The interim report on trans-European transport networks has been overdue since 1999.
We thank you for presenting it now.
So, to our first question: in your report, you make it clear that you want to add new elements, but that you also want to insist on existing projects which the Member States are still working on - such as the Brenner Tunnel - now at last being finished.
I would therefore ask you how we are together to ensure, even with a possible change to the financial arrangements, that older projects as important as the Brenner Tunnel, but also new ones such as the Franco-Spanish link across the Pyrenees, or the fixed Femarn Belt link between Denmark and Germany actually get built?
Madam Vice-President, you have already alluded to my second question: when are you going to expound to us in committee or in this House what your policy will be on combating new competition in the form of subsidised air travel?
Alternatively, the question arises of how the airlines can be helped after the tragic events of 11 September.
