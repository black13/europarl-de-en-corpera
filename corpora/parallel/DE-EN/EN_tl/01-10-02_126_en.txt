Mr President, I think we can agree wholeheartedly with the Commissioner's main remarks.
I can endorse what Mr Jarzembowski said.
I would, however, like to ask the Commissioner, whether she is able to concur with our view that we can learn from our experiences to date with the Trans-European Networks.
One insight we have gained, for example, is that when the Heads of State and Government decide upon a list, it is not necessarily better than a list of priorities drawn up by Parliament.
Might we perhaps put this experience to use?
In any case, I find the Commissioner's approach in the White Paper, concentrating on rail and waterways, very much worthy of support.
The issue there is whether or not we should check all the financing instruments, not only the money we have for the TEN, with that in mind.
For if it is only in the TEN that priority is given to rail and waterways, then the other funds - for example the Cohesion Fund and others - will have to be looked at and checked with a view to their perhaps taking these new priorities into account as well for the sake of consistency.
Those are my two questions.
