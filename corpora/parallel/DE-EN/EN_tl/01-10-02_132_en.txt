Mr President, I believe that the terrible experiences in America are causing the European satellite navigation system, GALILEO to be looked at from a new political and economic angle.
The Member States have in the past supported this good initiative of theirs only with reluctance.
Do you believe that there is now a new readiness on the part of the Member States to implement GALILEO without delay?
