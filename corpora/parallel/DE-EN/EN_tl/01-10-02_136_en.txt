Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for your initiative.
The citizens want enlargement to build visible bridges.
The Slovak government seeks a bridge in the form of the joining of Vienna and Bratislava airports into a mega-airport with a 'Transrapid' rail line to improve transport links.
This could well be the first stage of the Paris-Vienna route you have mentioned.
I believe it would be a very important initiative to take it onward as far as Budapest.
We also have, however, the shipping junction on the Danube, and in the long run this would become a triple junction.
Do you think this programme could also facilitate the financing of junctions of this sort?
