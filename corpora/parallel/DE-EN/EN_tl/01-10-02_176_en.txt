Mr President, the Commission is paying very careful attention to the use of minority languages in Slovakia.
It takes the view that Slovakia has made considerable progress in developing a positive policy on minorities and in drawing up the necessary legislation whilst putting in place and supporting the relevant institutions.
The enacting of the law on the use of minority languages for official business was, in this regard, an important step.
It brought domestic law into line with current international standards and complied with the specific recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the Commission.
A further important step was the ratification of the European Charter on regional or minority languages.
It should be noted in particular that Slovakia desires to concede the greatest possible freedom to the Hungarian minority in accordance with the flexibility that the Charter makes possible.
The Commission nevertheless observes that considerable efforts are still required for the practical enforcement of all the existing legislation.
In some areas, minorities do not avail themselves of the rights guaranteed them by the law on the use of minority languages for official business, above all, it seems, through ignorance of them.
This seems to be the case above all in communities with a large proportion of Roma among the population.
The Commission will continue in future to urge Slovakia to continue its efforts to implement the provisions of its laws, improve policy in this area and make the necessary budget funds available.
The observations which you, Mrs Maes, have made in person come as no surprise to me.
They prove only that the difficulties with implementation, which I have described, continue to prevail.
We will be discussing this topic further in the next progress report on Slovakia, which is due to appear in November.
