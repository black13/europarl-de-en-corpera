Commissioner, I wish to put a short supplementary question.
I was not entirely satisfied with the reply.
Above all, I am concerned about what we are doing now.
Are we to wait for technological innovations, for example the fuel cell, to at least partially solve some of the problems we have with traffic across the Alps or should we not now use the truth about the cost as an instrument to force heavy traffic, in the Alps at least, off some of the roads and onto the railways?
