Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find it a very positive indicator that this conference was held in Durban; that there were wide-ranging discussions; that a resolution was drafted; and that there has been a conclusion.
I find that this discussion, in some respects, looks too little to the future and considers too few definite and preventative measures to combat racism so that, if possible, it does not even come into being.
I would like to call at this point for the European Union itself to take the lead by good example, and I wish now to refer to two areas of current significance in which we can do something tangible, namely asylum policy and immigration policy.
If we succeed in what we have set ourselves, that is, in implementing a unified asylum policy with minimum standards and rapid and reliable decision-making, we will no longer have the situation that faces us now, with asylum seekers waiting for years in ghettos, constrained to work outside the law and becoming marginalised.
Rapid decisions lead to help being made available quickly and to recognised refugees being speedily integrated; it prevents the marginalisation that at present occurs.
This would amount to the prevention of racism!
I seek progress in immigration policy as well.
If Member States, as far as they are able and presupposing that work, accommodation and educational opportunities are available, accept citizens from outside States and offer help with integration, then that is another step taken against exclusion and discrimination and in favour of integration, and I believe we should grasp these practical tools in order to be really successful in preventing racism and discrimination.
This is an opportunity for our European Union.
