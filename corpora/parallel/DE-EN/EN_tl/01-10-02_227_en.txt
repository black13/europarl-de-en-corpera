Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, the World Conference on Racism in Durban was overshadowed from the outset by a political strategy of discrimination.
Arab States attempted to impute racism to Israel, with the intention of making the Arab world out to be victims of Israeli racism, which was then to be condemned by the conference.
This was a perfidious strategy.
They attempted to make use of this important conference for their own purposes.
Like the conference as a whole, any attempt to seriously get to grips with this strategy was sunk by the terrible events on 11 September.
We now have a situation in which the entire Arab world is in danger of itself being pilloried in a racist way.
All people of Arab origin or from an Islamic cultural background are in danger of having the deeds of a small terrorist group laid at their door.
There are, unfortunately, already examples of how this can happen openly and violently.
It can also, however, happen surreptitiously through concealed mistrust.
Either way, it is a creeping venom seeping into our open society and becoming a burden on it.
This would represent a victory for the terrorists.
So let us not allow it to happen!
Let us not follow the bad example that cast a pall over the Durban Conference.
We Members of Europe's Parliament, above all people, must be wary of rashly pigeonholing people by nationality and religion.
Let us be an example.
Let us continue to be open and tolerant.
But the terrorists must be in no doubt: they will be pursued with rigour, with no regard to race and religion.
We here can do something against racism.
Let us act accordingly and give an example.
That will be worth more than all the conferences in the world, something that will be demonstrated when we take this debate to its post-Durban conclusion.
