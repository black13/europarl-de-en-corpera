Madam President, Commissioner, with outstanding diligence and sometimes frightening consistency of purpose my fellow countryman Paul RÃ¼big has again produced a report containing almost everything that is good and right.
For that very reason, I hope I may be allowed to question some of it.
We have been discussing why innovation is so important for the European Union.
The rapporteur has given a broad answer to that question.
We could of course ask him what innovation?
What innovation is most in demand at the moment?
Perhaps military technology so we can find Osama bin Laden quickly.
Is that the kind of innovation we mean?
Is it innovation in surveillance that will enable us to uncover sleepers in the future?
Or do we not need to define innovation?
With our European system of values, are we not concerned here with innovation in education, innovation in social learning?
And how will we get there?
Would it not be an innovation finally to know how much is spent on innovation?
Do you know, Commissioner?
I have tried to find out how much is invested in the future in a big country like the Federal Republic of Germany.
We know what is spent on administration, we know what is invested in transfer payments, but when it comes to investing in the future, nobody knows.
We all agree that there cannot be too much funding for investment, because that is really the only way to safeguard the future.
But the question is, what kind of a future?
Where are we heading?
And is not the time after 11 September actually an ideal time to question much that was simply only a fixation with technology and instead to initiate research into social innovation?
Has the time not now also come to free ourselves from old instruments like gross national product and bring the innovative instrument of a well being factor more into the centre?
Questions on a good report.
Nevertheless, once again congratulations, Paul!
