Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Vitorino.
Commissioner, you have listened seriously to the demands made by many experts on migration and NGOs and have made it clear in two communications how policy on refugees and traditional migrants is to be handled.
With your communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status valid throughout the Union for persons granted asylum you have brought forward some excellent proposals for harmonising asylum policy.
Your proposals will now help us to find some concrete solutions.
The rapporteur, Mr Evans, has made a fine job of this.
I regard the additions he proposes as enhancing the current debate on concrete directives.
You have also succeeded, Commissioner, with your communication on a Community migration policy, in making it clear how important it is that future migration in the European Union should be jointly controlled and regulated throughout the Union.
However, we will probably have to carry on debating the wishes of the Nation States, which I take very seriously.
They want to arrange the fine tuning of migration themselves, although their strategies have already been a failure at national level for decades.
I trust that we will soon manage to persuade our colleagues at national level that there is no alternative to Union-wide control of migration.
