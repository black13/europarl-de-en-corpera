In this instance, I ask for a vote on the legislative resolution, in particular because of items 8 and 9, on which we have just voted.
In my judgment, it is sufficient if we proceed to examine the Turchi report, but because of items 8 and 9, I would really attach importance to us now actually voting on the resolution.
I ask you to vote in favour of it.
(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution.)
