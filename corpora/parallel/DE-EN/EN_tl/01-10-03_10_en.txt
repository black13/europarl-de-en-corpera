Madam President, I must take this opportunity to inform you that a party of schoolchildren invited by me for this week - tomorrow to be precise - has cancelled the visit.
I also heard, however, that mine was not the only group affected, but that around half the invited groups had cancelled their visits this week.
The children in question, or their parents, fear that security measures in this House are inadequate and that the children would be in danger if they visited Parliament.
Let me request you, then, to supply the public with extensive information about the adequacy of the security arrangements.
Should this not be possible, consideration should be given to a general suspension of visits.
I myself have also another concern: I would welcome it if those visitors' quotas that cannot be made use of because visits have been cancelled, could be set aside for future dates rather than be lost, so that these groups that, for understandable reasons, are not visiting Parliament now, may make up for it at a later date.
