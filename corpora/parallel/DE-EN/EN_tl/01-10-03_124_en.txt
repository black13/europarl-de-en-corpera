That the international exhaustion of rights conferred by trade marks has been an energetically discussed topic in recent months, is shown by this report, which has dragged on for months and has been thoroughly revised, as is clear from a comparison with the first draft report.
The exhaustion of trade mark rights affects all branded products.
As President of the Wine Intergroup, I would like to concentrate on the consequences for this sector.
The international exhaustion of trade mark rights will be of no advantage to the consumer in the European Union as regards food and drink, as is confirmed by the study produced by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) at the Commission's request.
European consumers could indeed be put at a disadvantage in the longer term by our industries' losing the opportunity to develop new products and to offer the consumer new services.
Should yields decrease decisively through parallel imports from third countries, there will also be a decline in motivation to invest in new markets.
In the event of the international trade mark rights becoming exhausted, complex distribution networks will come into being and it will become more difficult to put a stop to trade mark piracy.
There is no doubt that disadvantages will result for the consumer and for the manufacturer of branded goods, for example with regard to consumer health protection.
I am therefore speaking out against the international exhaustion of trade mark rights.
However, in view of events since the report was drafted, I will not be voting against it.
