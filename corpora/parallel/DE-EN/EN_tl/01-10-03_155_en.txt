Mr President, stability and growth are objectives of economic activity that everyone wants, whichever party or group in the European Parliament they belong to.
However, when it comes to defining these concepts and in particular when it comes to how we should achieve these objectives, then there are considerable differences between us.
A purely fiscal interpretation will not help us to solve the present problems, which are reflected in falling economic growth and consistently high unemployment.
The market economy as an economic concept is fine, but it is unacceptable as a social policy tool.
Or to put it another way, the market can and should regulate the economy, but not society.
We see the priority as being not a supply-oriented economic policy, but a demand-oriented one.
We do not believe that liberalisation is a panacea.
We need not only commercial competition, but also a linkage with economic and social criteria, in order to achieve the highest possible level of social security, sustainability and justice.
Balancing budgets is fine, but not at any price.
In contrast to the President-in-Office, I wish to call for an anticyclical economic policy.
In times of recession, increasing public expenditure on investment in new capacity and in education and training are essential.
We have the euro area, but we do not have a European economic, fiscal and social policy.
That cannot work.
It is not just a matter of achieving price stability alone, which is the ECB's remit, we also need to achieve socio-economic stability.
A more flexible approach to the existing convergence criteria will not solve the problem, it will just shift the burden to those who meet the criteria.
We need a new version that takes into account additional parameters such as the employment rate, the value-added ratio and the investment ratio, because these indicators reflect economic strength and development.
