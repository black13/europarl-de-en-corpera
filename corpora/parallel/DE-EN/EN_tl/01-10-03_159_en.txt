Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a very in-depth discussion of this subject today.
I have gradually been sensing that this debate has made it clearer and clearer how justified the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats was in taking the initiative to table this motion, and how important that was.
There are 89 days to go until the euro notes and coins come into circulation, and on top of that challenge we are living in very uncertain times.
At the same time there have been reactions in some governments around making the Stability and Growth Pact an issue.
We have already heard the names of certain people in some governments who have not done their homework properly when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact.
For that reason it is particularly important in these uncertain times and with 89 days to go before the euro comes in, to convey a sense of clarity and calm to the markets and also to consumers.
Europe's Stability and Growth Pact will not be shaken.
That is why it is necessary to counter the idea that weakening the Stability and Growth Pact is a way of acting to prevent a recession.
It is simply not true that inflation can create jobs.
And it is not true that the Stability and Growth Pact did not allow enough leeway for hard times.
The Member States that have the greatest leeway are the ones that have done most of their homework.
So I can only urge you not to play with fire.
It is irresponsible to add to uncertainty at a time when things are already uncertain, and the Stability Pact is a requirement for the stability of the euro.
