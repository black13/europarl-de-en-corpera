Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I have two short additional questions.
First, I would like to know if Council has asked the Republica Srpska how many expellees and refugees have now returned to the Republica Srpska.
Are any figures available on this?
Secondly, I would like to ask if cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has had any repercussions on the finances of the Republica Srpska.
