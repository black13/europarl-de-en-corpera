Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in 1998 this House adopted my proposal for a common European border police.
However, by the beginning of this year neither the old Italian government nor the German government had adopted this.
I would like to ask you if the Council has made any further progress with this issue of a common European border police or if anything is planned in this area under the Belgian Presidency.
