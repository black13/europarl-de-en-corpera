Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we Europeans should be clear in our own minds that we are going to be weighed in the balance in the times that lie ahead.
The United States of America and world public opinion will be looking to see whether we demonstrate our solidarity and our capacity to act in the face of the new challenges of international terrorism which have just become visible.
European effectiveness has hitherto often fallen at the hurdle of national sovereignty.
Effective joint action has often been blocked by invoking national sovereignty.
Now, national sovereignty is not an objective in itself, and certainly not if it tends to hinder rather than promote the defence of national independence against terrorists and the effective protection of citizens against terrorist attacks.
It is for that reason that the future will see us having to develop effective Community instruments and examining whether national sovereignty helps or hinders us in doing so.
Solidarity with the United States is a principle invoked on every side, and this is right and proper, as this attack has been not only on the United States but also on our fundamental values, as was intended.
That is why it is so perilous for a member of the Commission, namely Mr Nielson, to abandon Europeans' solidarity as a community.
His remarks are dangerous because they blur responsibility for the terrorist action, transfer the guilt for it onto the victims, and pour scorn on the solidarity we affirm in the resolution on which we are voting.
These remarks, then, must be withdrawn.
We can expect Mr Nielson to apologise for them.
