Mr President, for the whole week we have been unable to hear the original sound out of this system.
The acoustics in this Chamber are very, very poor.
This is not a new thing, though.
To add to that, we have been getting a terrible noise out of the loudspeaker today, which interferes with everything.
Because of the noise from the loudspeaker, we cannot hear anything.
Somebody must do something about this sound system.
