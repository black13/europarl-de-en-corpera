Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of drafting European law should concentrate on fundamental issues rather than pointlessly wasting time and energy on details.
This was written by Mr Prodi in a guest column in the 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung' on 27 July this year.
I indeed hear this gospel, but I have no faith!
The Miller report is evidence to the contrary, defining things that are self-explanatory.
It tells us, for example, what a floor is, what is meant by 'behind' and 'in front' and informs us that provision must be made for passages through which two coaxial cylinders must be able to pass.
The whole thing is actually absurd, but - and here I refer back to the quotation from Romano Prodi - Europe's citizens will rightly ask themselves whether we have nothing more important to occupy us.
It was therefore with extreme annoyance that I took part in this brief vote on the Miller report.
In many spheres, the imagination of regulators is positively inexhaustible.
Yet there is a lack of real political will where really explosive legal issues are concerned.
It will not be in that way that we will bring Europe and its citizens closer together.
