Mr President, strong competition, increasing concentration and globalisation are now key features of manufacturing industry around the world.
This creates great advantages, but also disadvantages, for the consumer.
Although there are numerous institutions in the EU Member States which are responsible for quality assurance and consumer product regulation, product recall is unfortunately becoming far more common.
The purpose of this report is to enforce the precautionary principle in respect of any product placed on the market, and identify suitable approaches.
I myself am a producer of consumer goods and so I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for her proposed solutions, for the task is to protect producers as well as consumers.
One option is to harmonise the regulations governing the authorities responsible for product safety.
The network of information which will be required in this context will be broad.
It is therefore appropriate to expand the existing directive first of all and revise it after a thorough appraisal of the situation.
The market cannot be regulated.
This is why preventive safety and health measures are especially important.
The report contains numerous references to the fact that in the Member States, operators' and producers' rights take precedence over the rights of consumers.
The purpose of the report is to change this situation.
I fully support this objective.
Due to the wide range of products available and the resulting risks to consumer safety and health, a new legislative approach is required.
The report makes no secret of this fact.
It also makes it clear that an export ban must be adopted for dangerous products.
This issue has yet to be considered in detail, and in my view, the proposed period until 2003 is not too long for this process.
