Mr President, anyone who visited Uzbekistan during the Soviet era was enchanted by its glorious Islamic heritage, its thriving markets - especially compared with the markets elsewhere in the Soviet Union - and its lively atmosphere.
We are therefore especially concerned about the situation in Uzbekistan today, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
This is no longer a booming country; it is a country in a difficult political situation, scarred by hunger and environmental devastation.
Intensive cotton farming with excessive use of fertilisers has undoubtedly contributed to this environmental disaster.
Furthermore, as the previous speaker has just pointed out, Uzbekistan is now in a situation in which we must fear the worst over the coming weeks and months, especially in light of developments in Afghanistan.
The European Union is called upon to help the region as a whole - for in a situation of economic privation, environmental devastation, and a permanent threat from Islamic fundamentalist or terrorist groups, it would be an even greater disaster if the European Union failed to help the people in this region by supporting them in their efforts to overcome the catastrophic environmental and health situation and assisting them to achieve a modicum of economic prosperity, and above all by providing basic foodstuffs.
I am sure that Commissioner Nielson, who is the appropriate person to participate in this debate today, is already giving thought to these issues and making preparations with his staff for what has to be done today, but above all, what must be done in the event of further disasters, e.g. in response to refugee flows from Afghanistan.
Our task is not simply to deliver great sermons.
This is not a clash of civilisations; it is not a campaign against Islam.
What we must do is to take practical action during the coming weeks and months and show the people that we genuinely wish to express our solidarity and support with more than just words.
