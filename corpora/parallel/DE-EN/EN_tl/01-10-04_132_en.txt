Mr President, we pointed out years ago that the Caucasus and Central Asia threatened to become the Balkans of the future.
Hardly anyone has shown any interest in this region; among the heads of government, only the Pope seems to have shown any concern, and what the Pope is among the heads of state, Ursula Schleicher is here in the European Parliament.
She has shown exemplary commitment to this often forgotten region.
My fear is that the events of 11 September will be misused in order to create new spheres of influence, with entire nations and ethnic problems being forgotten or sacrificed to energy supply interests.
After President Putin's speech in the Reichstag, many people have forgotten that he was the person who reignited the war in Chechnya, and that as the head of the secret service under Mr Yeltsin, he incited and manipulated the conflicts in Migrelia and Nagorno-Karabakh.
This is why these European regions are entitled to our solidarity, and we must ensure that we have a presence there.
I therefore appeal to you, Commissioner, to put President Putin's words to the test.
If he is genuinely interested in improving the situation, tell him you are going to Chechnya, that you want to test the water for more openness and a greater presence for the European Union.
As regards the three states of the Southern Caucasus, we need Commission delegations at last, not only in Georgia but also in the other two states.
This is a region which affects Europe's vital interests, not only in strategic and energy supply terms, but also as regards human rights and our cultural links with this region.
