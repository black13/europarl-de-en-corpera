Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it will not only horrify a great many women to see that a US company, through the patenting process, has effectively acquired ownership of 'breast cancer genes'.
The fact that in the race for money and profit, a great many people's health is put at risk is enough to make anyone's blood run cold.
Yet this is exactly what threatens to occur following the award of patents on the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes.
As a worst-case scenario, many patients may face delays in the early detection of breast cancer as a result of these patent awards.
Yet with this type of cancer in particular, early detection is crucial to increase the chances of recovery.
Furthermore, the virtual monopoly on test methods pushes costs so high that early detection of breast cancer is no longer available to many women.
Nor should we ignore the extent to which the BRCA patents are impeding research in Europe.
One of the leading cancer research institutes - the Institut Curie in Paris - has highlighted this situation and provided impressive and conclusive proof.
It is very welcome that this prestigious research institute has taken action and, with the support of the French Ministry of Health, is initiating an opposition procedure to the patent award.
This House will certainly not be making a mistake if it supports this position.
A welcome step would be to call upon the responsible agencies to lodge immediate appeals against the award of the BRCA patents with the European Patent Office in Munich.
It is also important that we should appeal to the institutions and governments of the EU Member States to lodge similar appeals as a matter of urgency.
We owe this to the women affected.
This is the least we can do for them at this point.
