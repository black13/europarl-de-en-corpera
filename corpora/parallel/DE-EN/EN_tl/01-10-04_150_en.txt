Mr President, the previous speaker made a comment.
I think that Mr Rothley attacked me personally.
I would like to make it clear once again that the European Patent Office does not have a court.
It has a Board of Appeal.
That is a significant difference.
I say this so that our colleague is properly informed.
It is quite clear that the patent refers to genes - indeed, to mutated genes - and to the analysis procedure, for the sake of accuracy.
I would recommend that any Members of this House who are interested should visit the website of the Institut Curie in France - the prestigious research institute which has initiated an opposition procedure - as this describes the situation in detail.
It is indeed a fact that only an invention may be patented, not a discovery.
On Ms Thors' objection regarding the urgency: the deadline set for instituting proceedings against the first patent expires on Tuesday.
This means that we cannot wait for the Fiori report, which will not be discussed until the October II part-session.
What Mr Rothley says is also incorrect.
We are indeed a legislative body, but his own Minister of Justice in Germany, Ms DÃ¤ubler-Gmelin, once applied this procedure.
Even the Federal Government once appealed against a patent which had been awarded by the Patent Office in 1999.
