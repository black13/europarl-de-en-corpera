Mr President, I vigorously endorse what Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said.
Commissioner, you cannot take an infinite amount of time over this.
I too expect that the Commission will state its position on this issue by 9 October.
You said that there are no objections of an ethical nature, but that you will study the question of the field of protection for inventions.
However, you have not answered the question put to you by myself, Mr Blokland, and others on whether Article 5.1 now applies in this context or whether Article 5.2 should take priority.
I believe that many Members of this House expect the Commission to clarify this serious and very important issue.
