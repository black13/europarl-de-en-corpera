Mr President, this is a very serious matter.
I call upon the Commission to study very carefully whether these patents which have been awarded genuinely comply with the Patent Directive, and not to act as if this House had no role in this area and were not entitled to adopt decisions.
I hope that you will take serious steps to comply with the decisions which are about to be adopted by this House.
