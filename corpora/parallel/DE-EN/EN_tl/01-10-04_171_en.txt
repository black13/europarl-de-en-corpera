Mr President, we have heard on the news that a Russian commercial airliner has crashed into the Black Sea.
It is not clear whether it was an explosion or whether the aeroplane was accidentally shot down by the Ukrainian army.
I think that before the start of this vote - regardless of what caused this tragic accident - we should briefly remember those who have lost their lives in this tragedy.
