Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, HIV and AIDS are not only a health policy problem, but a general social problem.
This has been made quite clear during today's debate.
A holistic strategy is therefore required to combat them.
Tackling poverty is one approach, but I would like to focus on other priorities which I believe are equally important: information and education, prevention, and of course treatment.
These are the three areas which must be considered if we want to make progress, particularly in Africa, where the problem is most acute.
This means providing information and sex education for children and young people, for without a change in sexual behaviour, the problem cannot be mastered.
A proportion of the available resources must therefore be allocated for this purpose too.
The sexually active population must have the opportunity to practise prevention.
I should particularly like to mention Senegal as a positive example, where religious and political leaders have worked together to halt the spread of AIDS through prevention.
A similar approach has also been adopted in Uganda.
If politicians and a country's spiritual leaders work together on this issue, a great deal can be achieved.
The CÃ´te d'Ivoire, for example, has therefore appointed a Minister for AIDS and HIV.
I believe that these are models which deserve our support.
There is another important problem, which is how to prevent the sick from being ostracized.
This is a major problem.
We must dismantle social taboos and not only ensure that those who are living with infection receive the medication they need, but also encourage their positive integration into society.
This is the only way to create a climate which ultimately halts the spread of disease in a holistic way.
