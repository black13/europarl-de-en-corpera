I believe that it is sensible to freeze the bank accounts of organisations or individuals who perpetrate or support acts of terrorism such as those which took place on 11 September 2001.
What has been submitted here, however, is a list of individuals and organisations who are merely assumed to have been involved in some way in the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
However, it is possible to proceed against them, even without a judicial process or final proof.
Such a measure would be comparable with being remanded in custody, when suspects have not yet been found guilty in a court of law.
If no evidence of guilt is found, prisoners on remand are released and paid compensation.
No such provision is envisaged here.
Moreover, the clause contained in Article 2(2) enables other unpopular persons and organisations to be included on this legally dubious list.
Given that the Justice and Home Affairs Council has already talked about urban violence in connection with terrorism, I fear that this will make it possible to freeze the bank accounts of individuals or organisations who demonstrate against the EU's policies at European Councils, for example.
Had I voted in favour of this resolution, I would have given my support to a questionable and arbitrary act.
I therefore voted against the resolution despite my sharp condemnation of terrorism.
