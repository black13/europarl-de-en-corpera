Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 January 2002, economic and monetary union will be completed.
For each Member State, there will be a continued and binding obligation and need to consolidate public budgets on a sustained basis.
This is set out not only in the Commission report but also by the rapporteur herself.
I fully support this objective.
I therefore welcome the report's proposal that the current requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact be expanded with new and individual objectives for each country.
Consolidating the public budget is the main priority for every government in order to create the required scope for action.
As a representative of Austria, I know what I am talking about.
Despite all the difficulties and a mountain of debt, the new government is working to ensure that the ambitious goal of achieving a zero deficit remains in place.
