Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to the rapporteur.
That has already been said.
There are four areas I would like to touch on briefly.
First, we want to make the international monetary system more stable, because financial stability is, among other things, a public good and a basic economic precondition for growth, employment and social justice - that is to say, a moral duty.
Second, we demand not simply a reform of the IMF, we require of the public authorities the moral obligation to create optimum balance between the free play of markets and the need for them to be regulated in accordance with the fundamental principle of the eco-social market economy, and to guarantee a balance between the public and private sectors in public rescue measures in times of crisis.
We demand of the Member States economic policies geared to growth and employment, and we demand the cancellation of debt, subject to appropriate economic and political conditions.
Third, we begin at home.
The euro is a stability currency even in the eyes of the world.
The response of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank after 11 September was one of stability in the face of the crisis.
The Stability and Growth Pact is a European response.
The Commission and the European Parliament have, by a majority, expressed their opposition to the Tobin tax, and the Liège resolutions include measures as correctives to globalisation.
Fourth, we oppose measures to slow down economic development and ideologically motivated attempts to undo the Stability and Growth Pact or introduce the Tobin tax on its own, which create insecurity among those who work in the market.
So I also regret that the Social Democrats' Amendment No 10 reinterprets the actual Liège resolution by inserting the Tobin tax.
Remove this reinterpretation; in Liège we find ourselves.
