Madam President, as Mr Cohn-Bendit has referred to me, I will gladly respond in this House to what he has said.
The Conference of Presidents confirmed the majority vote of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and also proposed the runner-up, who had also received a large number of votes, so that there are three nominations.
I would also like to tell you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that you can not only reach me at any time by telephone, but I am also available for private discussions whenever you wish.
