Mr President, I am very grateful to the Commission for using today's statement to take up a theme that currently causes a great deal of concern to the people of Europe.
I also welcome the way the Commission deals explicitly with all the areas at especial risk, and, in particular, its inclusion of industrial plant and nuclear power stations, which was demanded on Austria's initiative in Parliament's resolution on the events of 11 September.
We know that precautions were taken at several nuclear power stations in Europe to enable them to survive the impact of smaller aircraft at least.
Does the Commission have an overview showing which nuclear power stations did not do this, and what is planned at a European level to reinforce protection measures overall, at least at these stations but also at all others?
We know that no nuclear power station is completely safe, and that some are not technically up to date in other respects of relevance to safety.
It would be all the more surprising if there really were a letter from Commissioner Verheugen, confirming that the Temelin plant is completely safe.
As such a statement would contradict everything international experts have found out about Temelin, I cannot believe that this statement about its safety was actually made by Mr Verheugen.
I therefore ask the Commission to show this document, addressed to the Czech and Austrian governments, to Parliament.
We have been very committed to this issue, and I think Parliament deserves, even if the Commission takes an opposing view....
(The President cut the speaker off)
