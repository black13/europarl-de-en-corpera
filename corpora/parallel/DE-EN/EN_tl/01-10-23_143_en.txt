Mr President, this Budget has again committed substantial sums of money to the planned enlargement.
We must not, though, in doing this, forget the 23 frontier regions which will be particularly - even adversely - affected by the accession of these countries.
Being a Member for one of these regions, Carinthia, I am disappointed.
I am sorry that the Commission, the Council, and also the Committee on Budgets are not giving these regions adequate support by allocating sufficient budget resources.
To cut resources for these regions is to play a dangerous game with popular feeling.
If the population of these regions suffers overwhelming disadvantages, as is to be feared, the possibility cannot be excluded that they will vote against enlargement and thereby jeopardise the whole undertaking.
