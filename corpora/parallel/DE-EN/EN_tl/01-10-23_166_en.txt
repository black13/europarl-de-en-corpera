Mr President, at the very outset, I wish to thank Mr Costa Neves for being so understanding, as he has worked on the questions we are discussing with really great care and interest.
I am deputy chairman of the delegation to Slovakia, and we were in Slovakia last week.
Our programme included, among other things, a visit to the 'green frontier', the Ukrainian border near Kosice, where we saw that a very large number of refugees, especially from Afghanistan, were crossing the border, probably not with a peaceful purpose; it is estimated that 10% - 30% could have other activities in mind - of a terrorist or military nature, for example.
So I wish to ask the Commission and the Council, as a matter of urgency, to do everything possible to secure our borders, in particular, by immediately using the pre-accession support framework to make available the necessary apparatus on the borders that candidate States share with States not in the EU.
We are talking here about basic equipment such as night vision devices and motor vehicles, so that these frontiers can be better watched with immediate effect.
Secondly, the Committee concerned itself intensively with problems in connection with the support provided by the PHARE programmes and with the Toth case.
The Committee decided, from both a Slovakian and a European standpoint, not to put funds in reserve.
In Slovakia, the inevitable conclusions were reached.
The deputy prime minister with responsibility for this has resigned, which represents the political outcome.
The director dealing with the case has also resigned - a replacement has been appointed - and, in addition, the Slovak parliament has just passed a new law on financial monitoring and internal auditing.
So we will, I am sure, be able to take these funds out of the reserve by Second Reading.
