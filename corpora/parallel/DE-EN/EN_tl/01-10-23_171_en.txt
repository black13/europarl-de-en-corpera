Mr President, I will pass on your answer to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
He had asked me to wait for it.
On a personal note, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to our President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vande Lanotte, above all, who has been here with us throughout the whole of the discussions on the Budget.
Things like that do not happen all the time.
So, without wishing to seem presumptuous, I would again like to express my most heartfelt thanks to you, not only for showing us so much respect, but also for demonstrating your interest in working with us.
Many thanks!
