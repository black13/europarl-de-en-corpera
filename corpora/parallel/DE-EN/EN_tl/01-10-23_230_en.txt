Mr President, it is a great pity that Mr Barnier is not here himself, because the NUTS classification is not just a purely technical or statistical question, it is one of the most important political issues for our future cohesion policy.
It is about whom will receive European funding in future, how much they will receive, and about who decides how it will be spent.
These are pivotal issues for the future of the European Union and of the cohesion policy, and that is why this subject, which we are now discussing at the midnight hour, is more important than has been evident hitherto.
The Commission has always adhered purely to statistical criteria for the classification of territorial units and has not taken such political issues into account.
So there was ultimately always a tendency to distribute resources from the structural funds using a scattergun approach, rather than concentrating these resources in any efficient way on the regions in greatest need.
Looking at the candidate countries, the Objective 1 areas have been extended to include high-income regions and centres such as Warsaw and Riga, and these regions receive just as much by way of funding as the poorest regions of the enlarged European Union, Latgale and Masuria.
I am sure that cannot be right.
This runs counter to a credible cohesion policy and I regard it as being totally absurd!
That is why I would like to ask whether the same agency that grants the authority aid funding should also be the control agency.
As I see it, the proposal before us does not adopt a bottom-up approach.
