Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is, in our view, the Member States which have the primary task of creating the appropriate framework for more employment.
It goes without saying that the European Union can contribute towards it.
I believe, though, that dialogue between the ministers of the various Member States is particularly important here.
On looking into the matter more closely, we note that we have in some countries of the European Union almost full employment, but in others unemployment - and, in particular, youth unemployment - on a frightening scale.
I believe it to be a matter of extraordinary importance that the States should learn from one another and avoid making the mistakes already made by others.
We can see that the countries that perform best have created jobs on the basis of a solid financial policy and have got to grips with the necessary structural reforms earlier than others.
We must also ask ourselves the question: who, then, actually creates jobs?
It is not the state, it is often not the major enterprises, which indeed tend rather to retrench.
It is, far more, the small and medium-sized enterprises that create the most jobs.
If we want to be successful, the establishment of new enterprises is especially important.
It is a matter of creating the appropriate framework for them.
We must make it our concern that the European Union is not the institution that contributes to life being even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises or to making it difficult to set up new ones.
The European Union's activity must focus more on creating the conditions that will give these enterprises a better chance.
