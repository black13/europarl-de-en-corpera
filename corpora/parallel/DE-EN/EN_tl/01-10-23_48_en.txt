Mr President, we all stand for a higher level of employment, indeed for full employment.
But how?
There are considerable differences in how we answer the question as to how we want to achieve this objective.
Many advocate, to the exclusion of all else, additional measures for employees, but that alone cannot reach the goal.
We must indeed implement measures to benefit both employers and employees - or transpose such measures, as the case may be.
This means, though, that we, together, have to be consistent in ensuring that there is a durable improvement in the economic conditions for our small and medium-sized businesses.
Two-thirds of all European workers are employed in them.
Their productive capacity must be improved, and that by means of easier access to additional finance on more favourable terms and a distinct reduction in the tax burden.
