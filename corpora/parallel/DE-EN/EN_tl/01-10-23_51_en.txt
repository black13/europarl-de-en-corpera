Mr President, I join with Mrs Weiler in many of her assessments and conclusions, and also consider much of what has been presented by the Commission to represent definite progress.
Mrs Weiler, I would like to express my congratulations to you on this work, but also wish to point out three major problems that I find in the real world, which is not quite as rosy as it is depicted in some of the Commission's assessments or, indeed, in this report.
First among them is the strategy of full employment by 2010 on the basis of a 3% growth rate.
I found that illusory from the very start.
The problem with it, though, is that other ways of combating unemployment have been disregarded.
It is lamentable that even Social Democrats stay aloof if you advocate the reduction of working hours.
Scant regard is paid to elements of a third economic sector for social, ecological and cultural services or indeed to the greening of society.
The second problematic aspect - one to which Mr Andersson has just referred - is the split development of employment policy.
There are, of course, some positive trends.
Full employment in engineering and in technical and managerial occupations has increased.
Modernisation really does have winners.
The other side of the coin is, though, a clear increase in part-time employment, especially of women, among whom it has now reached 45.7%. in the EU.
The third problem is this: you have addressed the issue of the quality of work but, in my opinion, the social content of work is largely disregarded.
The law on employment contracts is 'made more flexible' but in reality it is relaxed.
We see the promotion of the low-wage sector.
The right of the long-term unemployed to choose their work is being limited.
It is precisely because these things are naturally long-term phenomena that we are, I believe, obliged to act with sensitivity in taking precautions, so that no new social division arises.
