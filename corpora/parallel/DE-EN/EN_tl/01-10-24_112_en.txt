Mr President, obviously the diverse manifestations of democratic resistance to the dangers of an uncontrolled expansion of the WTO's powers have given pause for thought.
It seems, however, that well-intentioned appeals are not going to prevent it from going down this path.
It is simply the case that trade in goods and money transactions are governed by the law of the market.
The market is, by its very nature, immoral.
Those who want to maintain their hold on the market have to make a profit or else they go under.
The WTO has obviously set itself the goal of cutting the market off from the demands of society at large and even from parliaments.
The opinions now on the table at least show an awareness of the problem.
It is right to take small steps.
However, far more ambitious steps must follow.
We cannot wash the coat of the bear which the WTO has become without getting the animal itself wet.
Our aim must be to work towards a new global economic order which distributes the wealth of this earth differently, justly and fairly, overcomes poverty, establishes and guarantees broad-based democratic cooperation giving parliaments a voice, and makes independent economic development possible for all countries.
The European Parliament should do everything within its power to challenge the Council and the Commission to do this.
