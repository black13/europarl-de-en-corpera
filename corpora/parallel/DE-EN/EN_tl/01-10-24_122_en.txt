Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Harlem Désir, on his very good, clear and extensive report.
Commissioner, if the decision-making process in the WTO is not made more transparent and democratic then, in the long term, the people of the WTO Member States will not stand for it, because we cannot have nation states increasingly referring crucial issues to the competent supranational organisation, while parliaments and, therefore, also society at large remain prevented from exercising their democratic right to monitor and participate in its work.
Events in the Dispute Settlement Body must also be seen in this light.
The Dispute Settlement Body needs to be thoroughly overhauled.
It needs to be transparent and changes also need to be made to its composition.
In the same way, it is necessary for us, finally, to give the developing countries the tools which will actually allow them to participate in the negotiations on an equal footing and then to assess the decisions which need to be made as they see fit.
There is, of course, a difference between a delegation arriving with 150 experts and a developing country having great difficulty sending its ambassador to the places concerned.
I should like to point this out once more here.
Otherwise, Harlem Désir has already said everything that needed to be said.
