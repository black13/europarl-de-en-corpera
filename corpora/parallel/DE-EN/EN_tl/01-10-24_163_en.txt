Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should, of course, also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Lamassoure, on his success in drafting a good report.
I am saying this, above all, because in Turkey, I often come across people making a certain assertion: those in Turkey who repeatedly accuse the European Parliament of being hostile to Turkey will now have to admit yet again that this assertion is not true.
Like the report of my colleague, Mr Swoboda, this report, too, is an objective opinion on the situation in Turkey.
As the rapporteur states, the flurry of legislative activity in the Turkish Parliament to reform the constitution really is laudable.
Given the current constraints in Turkey, our Turkish colleagues, some of whom are also here today amongst us, have really been very successful.
Now, however, they are asked to continue the work which they have begun.
The Ministries for Home Affairs and Justice in the Turkish Republic play an important role in this area.
The long-awaited implementation of the reform is urgently necessary, particularly now after 11 September, but also in spite of 11 September.
It is easy to ascertain through the Turkish media that people are still being tortured in some police stations.
There are still strange cases of people committing suicide while in police custody.
For as long as this kind of thing continues to happen in Turkey, and, for as long as Turkey is not prepared to meet the Copenhagen Criteria, there will obviously be no date for the start of accession negotiations and Turkey will remain the only country, out of 13 countries with candidate status, not to have started negotiating.
I hope that this last report will motivate those responsible in Turkey to move forward and, not only to talk about reforms, but also to really implement them.
