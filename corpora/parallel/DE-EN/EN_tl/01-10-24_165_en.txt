Mr President, what efforts has the Turkish government made since the Helsinki Summit to guarantee human and fundamental rights, to find a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue and to abolish the death penalty?
The latest amendment to the Turkish constitution does not go far enough.
The death penalty has only been partially abolished and the Kurdish language has not been recognised.
Is this a genuine reform?
I would answer, no.
Turkey must not be given any special treatment in the enlargement process.
I think that we run the risk of giving in to Turkey's wishes if we adopt the Lamassoure report as it stands.
The report is guarded on a number of issues so that we leave Turkey room for manoeuvre.
We must insist that a political solution be found to the Kurdish issue and that human and fundamental rights be guaranteed.
The time is right for sweeping reforms.
In my conversations with people on my trips to Turkey they have repeatedly expressed a wish for peace, brotherliness and freedom.
I, too, carry this message in my heart and will also do all I can in the future so that one day this wish will come true.
