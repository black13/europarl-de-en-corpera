Mr President, I think I was right to take my headphones off relatively early on.
It spared me somewhat.
Mr Lamassoure has submitted an excellent report, as numerous Members have said.
I should like to qualify the report as a fair report, because I think that Turkey, like every other candidate, is entitled to a fair report, meaning that we duly address all the shortcomings, but we also acknowledge any progress made.
I should like to call on our Turkish counterparts and the Turkish people to take note of the report as a whole and not just selectively, just as we are making an effort to take note of all the developments in Turkey.
Finally, I take the view that a Turkey that has made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria is preferable to a Turkey which has not made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria.
It is a Turkey that is motivating the forces trying to overcome the unacceptable shortcomings still remaining within the country in relation to the political criteria.
It is not in a position to expect political discounts.
We do, of course, realise that we rightly wish that all Muslim countries in the world were structured like Turkey and that we would then have fewer problems, especially in the light of 11 September.
But this discount does not mean turning a blind eye when it comes to the candidate countries.
On the other hand, however, Turkey is also entitled not to have any additional conditions imposed.
For example, I think that Mr Lamassoure has chosen exactly the right wording for the point on Armenia.
Having expressly referred to the genocide last year, we note this year that things are clearly moving in the right direction.
We realise that people are getting together to talk about the past.
My own country found this a very worthwhile exercise and I think that this is an approach which we should support in this specific case, so that good neighbourly relations can develop in the future between Turkey and Armenia.
