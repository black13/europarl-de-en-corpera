Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for the work which he has carried out.
Of course we welcome China and Taiwan, because I think we should be pleased, as the previous speaker said, that China and Taiwan are joining.
A whole host of reforms is being initiated, as the Commission has rightly pointed out.
For the rest, China will take up a key position within the WTO and this will also bring about considerable changes for the West.
I am fairly certain that this will present the Commission with further challenges.
For the rest, we are supporting the accession of China with considerable funds and I think we should do more here.
For the first time, Parliament has been consulted.
This is a result of excellent collaboration with the Commission and, of course, with the Council.
But I have one thing to say to Mr Gahrton: it is true that accession to the WTO is not without its opponents in China.
But I think that to overemphasise this in the report without, at the same time, trusting in the fact that China is more than capable of evaluating whether or not it is in a position to cope with accession is to underestimate China's capabilities considerably.
I rather think that the doomsday scenario which you have conjured up in your report is highly exaggerated.
I would like to see you evaluate matters in a somewhat fairer and more balanced manner in the future.
