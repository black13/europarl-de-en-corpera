Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, I have noted with satisfaction that preparations in Ghent for the Laeken Summit also included a debate on the complex subject of 'The Future of Europe' .
You, Prime Minister, announced that the Laeken statement on this theme would not be a classic statement but an ambitious one that would acknowledge the EU's weaknesses and its citizens' fears and would clearly point out the way to be taken by the enlarged EU in the world of the future.
I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will do everything possible to bring about a resolution in December that really will live up to this high aspiration.
In my judgment, there is an absolute need for the following to be taken into account when calling a Convention to prepare the next Inter-Governmental Conference: First, the balanced proportional composition of the Convention with representatives of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament analogous with the Convention to draft the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Secondly, members of the national parliaments and representatives of the acceding countries' governments must be involved to the full in the Convention's work and have at least observer status.
Thirdly, the composition of the Convention must ensure that the principle of political pluralism is guaranteed.
Political debates need arguments on both sides which alone ensure that the debates come alive and are interesting, and only if the most diverse political forces from the Member States really work together can a politically sustainable result be achieved which will then enjoy popular support.
Fourthly, there must be complete transparency in the Convention's work, both as regards the conduct of its debates and discussions and also public access to its documentation, which must be guaranteed by all means available.
There is, fifthly, a need for a purposeful and structured dialogue with civil society, and I hope that the Presidency's proposals in this regard will find support among the various governments.
