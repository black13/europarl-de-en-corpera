Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the decision of the Council at Ghent to give immediate humanitarian aid totalling EUR 320 million is unusually welcome.
The same applies to European solidarity in the campaign against international terrorism.
The next thing to do is to achieve a speedy halt to the fighting, above all to protect the population of Afghanistan.
The world is still in shock from the attacks on New York and Washington.
Two things strike me as being of particular importance, quite independently of the steps taken to date.
The first is the complete explanation of the background to these crimes and the publication of the results.
Without these, there is the risk that the attacks will give rise to legends which could poison many people's minds.
This would represent an enduring victory for terrorism.
What strikes me, secondly, is that the future reconstruction of Afghanistan presupposes, importantly, knowledge of the events in that country over the past twenty-five years.
As we know relatively little about this period, I propose that this Parliament should set up a group to look into the region and comprehensively document the past three decades in that country.
We could perhaps thereby take the first step towards a peaceful solution and a forward-looking outlook for Afghanistan.
