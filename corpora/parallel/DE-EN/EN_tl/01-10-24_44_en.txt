Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over and above all the constitutional issues, the present situation sees Europeans being asked the question: What is your capacity to act?
Is the European Union perceived as being able to act in the context of efforts to deal with this international crisis, or is it not?
To ask the question is to answer it in the negative, because the ones taking action are the Americans and, alongside them, partly the British and their allies, but not the European Union as such.
Nor should the British allow themselves to be deceived.
They too are only a small junior partner in the business and have nothing like the weight that Europeans could have if they acted together.
Only as a community will Europeans acquire capacity to act - they will not do it bilaterally, trilaterally or multilaterally.
So it was a gross error for the ruling Big Three to set off before Ghent.
Far from demonstrating European capacity to act, that is a trip down a one-way street, showing considerable lack of awareness of how Europe works.
Those who have acted in this way had better take good note of that.
We need capacity to act as a Community.
So we need the European Rapid Reaction Force.
Without such an instrument, Europeans will not be taken seriously in the world.
That is why it is ridiculous for us still to be arguing about how this instrument should be financed.
In this respect, the Community must prove its strength.
We also, however, need an instrument at home.
We need the capacity to combat terrorism across national frontiers.
Police work goes on in the Member States, but it must be clear to all that international terrorism can only be combated with any prospect of success by units that are in a position to operate without regard to national boundaries.
Action as a Community is what Europe lacks, and it is on that that we must concentrate.
