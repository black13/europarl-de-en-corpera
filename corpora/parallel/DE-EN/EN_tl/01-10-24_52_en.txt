Before the vote on Amendment No 17: Gr√∂ner (PSE).
Mr President, we had reached a compromise with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and they are now departing from it.
So we too will not now abide by this compromise, and I call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment No 17.
