Mr President, I believe Mrs Gröner has made a mistake.
We have not deviated from the compromise.
On the contrary, we are sticking to what we agreed.
We are not, though, voting in favour of the amendments that have been tabled after the compromise and with which we do not agree.
We have not deviated from the compromise at all, quite the opposite!
(The President declared the amended common position approved)
