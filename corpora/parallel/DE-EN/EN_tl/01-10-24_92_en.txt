Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council functions poorly, which is also bad news for all the other EU institutions.
It is bad for Parliament and it is bad for the Commission.
The lack of transparency and efficiency, which have often been referred to here, also affect our work and give us a bad image in the eyes of the EU's citizens.
That is why reform of the Council is urgently necessary, as must be emphasised again and again.
Mr Poos has produced useful and valuable suggestions as to how such a reform might now be possible without the need for a new European Treaty.
I share the view that people have a right to know who votes and which way when it comes to laws and regulations that affect their daily lives.
The Legislative Council urgently needs this public character.
I do not believe that the number of Councils on various sectors is the problem.
The problem is the deficient coordination within the Council and also within the governments of the Member States.
Changes must be made here.
I believe we must follow up this idea of sending a permanent minister to Brussels who would take over the coordination of government policy at national level.
On Monday, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs added further items to the agenda, for example, the issue of the Council Presidency when there are at least twenty-five Member States, or also how the European Council is to be defined.
What is that?
An organ, a super-board, or is it part of the Council?
This reform is urgently needed, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, and we hope that you can do something even before Laeken, and that, in Laeken, the Council will again be on the agenda with a view to the future Treaty on the Union.
