Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, extending the multi-annual guidance programmes by one year to keep them in force pending the decision on future fleet policy after 2002 is sensible and I think it has everyone' s support in principle.
The MAGP' s objectives are correct, but their implementation by the Member States still leaves much to be desired.
The Commission' s reports in the past have shown us that over and over again.
We have repeatedly criticised the failings in implementation and it is clear that the future fleet policy will have to remedy the situation.
That is why the Commission wants to make changes to the MAGP and FIFG provisions as well as extending them by a year.
I am opposed to some of those changes because I think these matters would be better resolved in the landmark decision about fleet policy.
In my opinion there is no point in making extensive changes in the last year of MAGP IV' s validity, especially when they could have negative repercussions for safety on board fishing vessels.
But if Member States are to continue to be able to apply for increases in capacity for measures designed to improve on-board safety and fishery product hygiene and these are to be paid for out of FIFG resources, something really must be done to ensure that those measures do not result in increased fishing.
This condition is absolutely essential.
We cannot have a situation where investments in on-board safety are prevented because the conditions for the application of the measures are not complied with or because many Member States are sometimes unable to ensure that they are or fail to do so.
We ought to be using the debate about common fisheries policy reform to find solutions to the dilemma between on-board safety and careful management of stocks that has again been made clear by this report.
No way must the one be at the expense of the other.
