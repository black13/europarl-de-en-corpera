First of all, I would like to thank you, Mr Gallagher, for your report on the extension of the fisheries agreement under discussion until the end of the year.
I am glad that you agree with the Commission' s proposal.
This will enable the Community' s fishermen to continue their activity in this region while - as the Senegalese side wanted - a further study of the fisheries sector is prepared.
The extension of the existing protocol also enables us to pursue negotiations for the multi-annual protocol without undue pressure of time and to bring them to a conclusion.
As you know, this agreement is a very important agreement for us.
At EUR 12 million a year, the amount of money involved is considerable, and in purely mathematical terms it means EUR 8 million for the eight months extension.
Apart from the considerable amount of money, the advantages for Senegal are not least that the agreement secures a major part of the raw materials required by the Senegalese fishing industry because EC vessels have to land part of their catches in Senegalese ports.
The Commission is unable to accept the present amendment because it is, as you know, a fundamental component of the Community' s external fisheries policy that the costs of fishing rights should be met partly out of the Community budget and partly by the ship owners.
That is included in all the negotiating guidelines for fisheries agreements.
The financial compensation payable is specified in the agreements themselves.
This is paid by the EU, while the ship owners have to pay the licence fees.
May I conclude by saying that the next round of negotiations for a new agreement or a new protocol is due to take place on 20 to 23 November.
