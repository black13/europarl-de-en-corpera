Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fraga Estevez, I thank you for your report on the new protocol under the fisheries agreement with Madagascar, by which we can safeguard the operation of our tuna fleet in these waters up to and including May 2004.
I am also pleased that you are able to adopt the draft.
The new Protocol refers exclusively to tuna and offers fishing opportunities for 80 vessels.
The financial contribution totals EUR 825 000.
I would like to emphasise that over 60% of this amount is allocated to specific measures and thus benefits the local fisheries sector.
These resources benefit, above all, monitoring and supervision, but also research and non-industrial fishing.
Also, this is the first time this Parliament has dealt with an agreement with an ACP state, providing for the satellite-based surveillance of all Community ships operating within the scope of this Agreement.
As regards Amendments Nos 1 and 3, I draw your attention to the interinstitutional agreements in force and most especially to the 5 July 2000 Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission.
In the context of this Agreement, we are complying with the demands of these amendments, which are therefore not necessary.
I cannot support Amendment No 2, as negotiations on a protocol to a fisheries agreement do not require their own new mandate.
What I have already said about Senegal applies correspondingly to Amendment No 4.
