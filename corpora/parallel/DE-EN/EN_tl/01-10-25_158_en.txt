Mr President, I would just like to tell Mr Blokland that it is not those who are absent who are in the right, but those who are present, and those who are not here should be ashamed of themselves.
I take the view that we should be proud of doing our duty.
We must, though, also be quite clear in our own minds that it is important to reintroduce Friday so that Thursday is made a correspondingly more attractive proposition.
