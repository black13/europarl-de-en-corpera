Mr President, by agreement with the rapporteur I would like to make an oral amendment.
I only have the English text with me now.
It should read: "Insists on the immediate abolition of the death penalty..." instead of "Reiterates its call for the immediate abolition of the death penalty..."
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On paragraph 10
