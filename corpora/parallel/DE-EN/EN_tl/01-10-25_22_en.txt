Mr President, I would like to point out that we, the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, tabled Amendment No 6 to recital A and that we want the words "supply constraints" in the fourth line of the English text to be replaced by the word "quotas" because that is the correct term.
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On Amendment No 3
