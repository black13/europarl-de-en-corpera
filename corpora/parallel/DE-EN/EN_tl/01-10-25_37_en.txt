Budget debates are great moments for Parliament because they afford us an opportunity to make a comprehensive review of past and future policy.
Unfortunately time does not allow me to do so.
I would therefore like to confine myself to just one point, that is the situation in the border regions of the Member States adjoining the candidate countries.
It is beyond question that today' s border regions will benefit from European Union enlargement in the long term since there will be totally new opportunities for economic, cultural, social and administrative regional cooperation.
Nevertheless, in the short term there will be tremendous pressure as they adjust to specific problems arising out of the very different levels of development, especially in the social field.
I need only point out that the earnings gap between East and West is around 60%.
This raises questions that did not arise with earlier enlargements and which take on a new dimension.
The anticipated problems on the local labour and service markets will not be overcome without a great deal of effort.
Large numbers of daily commuters will put enormous pressure on an already tight labour market - in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania alone unemployment rates in excess of 20% are quite common.
Cheap services with wage costs around 60% lower will be a tremendous challenge for SMEs and craft trades.
Local and regional governments and administrations believe that the Commission' s proposed programme of assistance to border regions fails to match the scale of the challenge.
I therefore welcome the inclusion of a special budget line for border regions.
But I also call for additional Union funding to be made available as quickly as possible to reassure the border region citizens affected that their concerns and needs are not going unnoticed.
We need a basis in law, and the Commission must create it very quickly.
