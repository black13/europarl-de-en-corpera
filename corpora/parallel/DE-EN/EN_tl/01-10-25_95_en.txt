Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to expressly welcome the Commission' s proposal for reforming the market organisation for sheep and goat meat.
The previous speakers have already given all the reasons why we so much welcome this proposal.
I would also like to thank our rapporteur most sincerely for his work.
I believe the revision of the premiums is one of the most important points.
The introduction of a fixed rate premium is a major step forward.
But I would like to stress that the figure proposed by the Commission is much too small.
This premium must also be an incentive for sheep and goat farmers and that means EUR 30 and no less.
The premium must also be the same for farmers regardless of whether they produce ewes or milking ewes.
A distinction between the two cannot really be justified.
I also believe that the EUR 9 supplementary premium for ewes and she-goats is particularly justified under the more difficult conditions in the less-favoured areas.
Beef and veal and sheep meat prices generally follow the same trends, which means there is no justification for treating the two sectors differently as regards the premium.
On the contrary, there is a deficit in sheep meat in Austria and in many other countries of Europe.
If we fail to create reasonable conditions and security for this sector, we shall drive sheep and goat farmers into other areas, such as beef and veal, or they will go out of production altogether.
Such a policy would be ill-advised.
Finally, I would like to say that sheep and goat farming should not be supported only in areas that have no alternative, but also in those where sheep and goat farming is traditional.
I therefore hope, Mr President, that the Commission and Council will follow these sensible proposals from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
