Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
He sums up very clearly to what an extent the success of a product, film in this instance, is dependent on the promotion of sales through marketing and advertising.
When American production companies set aside 30% of their budgets for marketing, it is not to be wondered at that European products lose in direct competition for customers, when they themselves use only 3 to 6% of their budgets for this purpose.
It follows that European film producers must do more to market their products.
We, as taxpayers, are also entitled to demand that they do so.
One could envisage state support for follow-up projects being made dependent on the filmmakers' efforts at reaching their public.
More subsidies cannot be the solution on their own.
Too much money was spent in the past on films that never reached their public.
Austria spends over EUR 30 million per annum on promoting films.
Taking the number of cinema-goers into account, every ticket to see a film is subsidised to the tune of EUR 1 000.
State promotion of film cannot have this as its objective.
