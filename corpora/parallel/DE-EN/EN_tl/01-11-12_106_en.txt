Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by thanking not only the rapporteur for this initiative, as all of you have done, but also the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has backed his initiative so strongly.
As you may know, the latest Europacinema conference began here in Strasbourg last weekend, and it is continuing through today and tomorrow.
The final panel discussion will be taking place in our rooms tomorrow.
There have been many discussions and many problems to resolve, such as: What is the problem, why is there no internal European market?
In discussing many specific problems, whether to do with nation-states or the subsidy issue, we came up against the same point over and over again, that the distribution system does not work.
We have a European internal market, but it is not accepted that this product, film, can really circulate.
It is at this hurdle that we fall.
Now as always, there is a national logic to film promotion, which also applies to a film's success: if it was not a box-office success at home, it will not be an international one either.
I have to agree with Mr Sichrovsky that an increase in subsidies would not help, but an increased subsidy from the country we both come from would help the market a bit.
It would be wrong to demand that producers should take greater risks.
There are no independent producers.
First, we must promote this market economically, we must engage in business development, so that this market can emerge at all.
Here, too, one of the demands the Culture Committee makes over and over again in many contexts would seem to be appropriate here.
We must endeavour to make business development, whether it originates from large or small enterprises, tax-deductible.
We will support this report not only for reasons of ideology, but also out of wholehearted conviction.
