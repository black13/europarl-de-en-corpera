Mr President, the report on the protection of animals during transport has evoked great public interest.
Various associations, but above all individual citizens, have watched attentively to see what steps, if any, Parliament will take to prohibit intolerable conditions in the transport of animals.
The report's concern is with the use of legislation to prevent animals in transit from being endangered or brought to a cruel demise.
Nothing, though, must be left to chance, but there must rather be firm negotiations when the report is elaborated.
Among the European rural model's special features, the expectations of society are a decisive element.
The BSE crisis and the consequences of the destruction of animals due to the foot-and-mouth epidemic have put a definite question mark against what had so far been achieved.
An estimated 250 million farm animals a year are transported across the EU.
The people involved have for years vigorously disputed how necessary or pointless this is.
This basic regulation itself contains numerous practical and legal provisions on the transport of animals.
It is clear that national authorities do not act in the same way everywhere, which shows how weak the animal protection clause really is.
There is a lack of seriousness, transparency and honesty in this area.
If, for example, hares living wild in Poland are caught with nets and transported into the EU in containers that are torment to them, just so that people can shoot them for sport as a leisure pursuit, that has nothing to do with sport and even less with the protection of animals.
I would be happy if the Commissioner were able to say that it does not.
At this particular stage of negotiations on the enlargement of Europe, this incident bodes ill for well-regulated agronomy as the basis for protecting Europe's environment and species.
The report before us opts, in this sense, for cooperation rather than confrontation between agriculture and animal protection.
