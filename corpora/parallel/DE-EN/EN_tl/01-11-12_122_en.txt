Mr President, Mr Maat's report is an important tool for thinking globally and acting more locally in agricultural and environmental policy.
Your report, Mr Maat, deserves our full support, as it does not make any compromises to the detriment of animal welfare and again emphatically brings to the light of day deficiencies which have long been well known.
There are particular expectations of the report since the vote in plenary which cut the budget for the export refund regulation.
The agreement with which this met naturally gives grounds for hope that the Maat report will be adopted as a whole, especially as it has made past misdemeanours in animal transport policy particularly apparent.
There are a number of points I would like to make, but time is too short.
Let me perhaps just say in conclusion that checks and supervision must be improved, and the amounts levied in fines must be harmonised and raised to a level that will act as a deterrent for transport businesses.
The same should apply to sanctions imposed on Member States.
We are all acquainted with the problems, the European public is right to be sharply critical of the European institutions and of the fifteen governments.
This report is to be highly valued also from the point of view of enlargement.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Council and of the Commission, it is high time that action were taken.
