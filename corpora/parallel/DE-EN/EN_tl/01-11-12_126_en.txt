Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we are handling the subject of 'Protection of animals during transport' .
This is a long-running issue, and I unreservedly support the report Mr Maat has presented.
We all know that there are already several directives on this in the European Union, and legislation to transpose it in the Member States.
We are all in favour of comprehensive animal protection and opposed to methods of transport which inflict needless suffering, particularly on animals destined for slaughter.
Were all these positive laws to be transposed and followed up everywhere, this debate would not be necessary.
That is, however, not the case.
Pictures of unacceptable transport conditions provide repeated evidence of this.
We should, though, not lose sight of the fact that there are a few good things to report on this area.
There are some examples of the transportation of animals which already meet the requirements of animal protection.
The idea of slaughter in the immediate vicinity of the place of origin is also widely being put into practice.
Slaughter as close to the farm as possible is something I greatly support.
Modern methods of preservation make the export of meat even to distant areas thoroughly feasible.
We are right to demand feeding and watering breaks during the transportation of animals.
We will also have to give future consideration to how to minimise stress to the animals when being unloaded or reloaded before and after these breaks.
We could certainly aim to have the vehicles transporting animals to slaughter equipped in such a way that the animals could remain on board the vehicle during short breaks and be provided for there.
Transport, space, the way in which the vehicles are driven, ventilated and heated, loading and unloading procedures have, if they are made suitable, the greatest effect on improving the protection of animals.
This report makes its contribution to that and I ask for it to be supported across this House.
