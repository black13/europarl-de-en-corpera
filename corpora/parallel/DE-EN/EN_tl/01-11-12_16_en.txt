Madam President, taking the language question first, I am informed that everything is in order so far and available in all languages.
I will now turn to the esteemed Mr Dell'Alba's comments and start by agreeing with him that this is a political issue, but then coming to a quite different conclusion.
This is not only a political issue but also an ethical one, and of the greatest significance for the Fiori report.
It had always been our opinion that the Fiori report should be considered together with both the Caudron reports.
As we have just decided, Madam President, to begin the debate with the Commission and the Council at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, there will be sufficient time in the morning to debate the Fiori report and the two Caudron reports.
If that were not the case, then we too would have doubts about proceeding with everything on the agenda as it stands.
Now, though, that the debate with the Council and the Commission on the international situation is to take place on Wednesday afternoon, we take the view that the Caudron and Fiori reports belong together.
It is, though, an ethical and a political issue requiring an answer now, and so we would be very grateful if it could remain on the agenda.
