Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Cashman, ladies and gentlemen, if, today, the window of the European Parliament is opened a little wider, as Mr MacCormick has put it, then Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman will have played a great part in it.
Thank you for your commitment and congratulations on the success you have achieved in making us more open.
I certainly do not see myself as groping in the dark, as Mr Bonde put it, but I do think we are on the road towards the light.
Tomorrow's resolution will also be our invitation to the citizens of the European Union to put our openness to good use, to look in on us, to, if you want to put it that way, take a look at the cards we hold, even to see behind the scenes.
Openness makes little sense, of course, if nobody is interested in the work we do.
We do not wish to complain about the lack of interest on the part of our citizens and voters, but we would like to seriously urge them to avail themselves of this new openness on the part of the European Parliament, as today's technology makes things conceivable which a few years ago would not have been possible.
With the click of a mouse, they can see the original texts we discuss in this House.
Even if press reports on Europe are sometimes incomplete, the interested citizen can nonetheless look straight in on us with the help of the Internet.
That is an opportunity, and because of it we strongly support this report.
I would have liked to say something to the representative of the Council of Ministers.
Unfortunately, he is not here, but there was not going to be much to say about transparency.
