Madam President, immediately following the vote on the 2002 Budget I asked how exactly Budget line B3-306 had been voted on.
My group's co-ordinator and I wrote you a letter asking for the vote to be re-scrutinised.
We have as yet received no reply.
I therefore wish to lodge an objection to the Minutes on this point in order to get the matter properly clarified.
The background to this is that we had voted on a reserve - the amounts involved and the explanations of them.
It was intended that we would vote on them together, with a separate vote only on one short passage in the explanations.
Then, though, there were suddenly separate votes on the amounts and the explanations.
That was not how it had been intended.
I therefore ask that this be looked into, and wish to put on record my reservations about the Minutes.
