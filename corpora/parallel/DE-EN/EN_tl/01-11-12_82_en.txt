Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will first thank the rapporteur, who has analysed this very technical report with great expertise and proposed a range of editorial amendments that we can all support.
We, likewise, welcome and support the Swedish initiative, which is before us now, to further develop the Schengen acquis.
Some parts of it have, however, already been overtaken by reality, as the breakneck speed of developments in European internal affairs and justice policy since the terrorist attacks on 11 September might well have made this report and this submission largely obsolete, at least as regards extradition policy.
Thus, the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs and of Justice, on 20 September, had already set in motion a simpler procedure for handing over criminals and for the mutual recognition of court judgments.
We welcome the fact that there is broad European agreement on criminal law and criminal procedure as well.
This will lead to better combating of crime on our continent and promote the Community legal area.
This being so, I could save myself further great speeches on the Swedish initiative, as Mr Marinho has already made the main points.
I would, though, like to enlarge on one point, namely that the provisions of the 1995 EU Agreement on simplified extradition procedures and the 1996 EU Agreement on extradition between Member States are, according to this proposal, to be extended to Iceland and Norway as a further development of the Schengen acquis.
So far, so good.
Yet, out of Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and England, none have, to date, ratified one of these agreements.
This is especially scandalous in view of the candidate states having undertaken to accept the Schengen acquis.
The Member States must at last become aware of their need to set an example, specifically as regards the transposition and ratification of EU acts.
