Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already voted once on this report.
Now, at second reading stage, all we have to do is find a solution to the opt-in/opt-out problem.
I will therefore be speaking only about that.
Looking at the various proposals currently before Parliament reveals, in my opinion, that they are different kinds of opt-out proposals.
Only the Commission's document would mean a real opting-in.
This means, then, that only the Commission's proposal would guarantee that citizens would themselves be able to say that they wanted 'spamming' , that is to say, to receive electronic advertising, or that they wanted to have the option of consistently refusing it.
All other options, that is, the various proposed opt-outs, do not, in my judgment, guarantee this.
So I cannot be greatly satisfied with what is offered here as a compromise, and I believe that, to live up to the title of this proposal, a text with some bearing on data protection would have to be passed, in which case you have no option but to take the Commission's line, support this proposal, and reject the other proposals that have been submitted to Parliament.
Nevertheless, I am in fundamental agreement with much of this report and find many of the points addressed in it sensible.
But that was voted on at the last session.
Now, it is just about the opting out and opting in.
I think that, if we are talking in terms of data protection, we have to support the Commission's proposal.
