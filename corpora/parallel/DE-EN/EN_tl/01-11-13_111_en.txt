The deficiencies of current agricultural policy are evident.
The existing system only serves to promote the transport of animals.
This trade is, at least in part, truly absurd.
For example, Spain imports sheep for slaughter from the United Kingdom, while at the same time exporting sheep to be slaughtered in Greece.
We must aim to abolish the promotion of the transport of live animals.
It is indefensible in the long term that EU funds are used for this purpose.
The only possibility of putting an end to the long-distance transport of livestock lies in the regionalisation of agriculture policy.
The watchword must be: production in the market, for the market.
This would also make it possible to effectively counteract the spread of diseases.
