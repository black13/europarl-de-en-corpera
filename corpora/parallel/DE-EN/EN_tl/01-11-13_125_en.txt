Mr President, the main problem with the Commission's proposal is that local public transport is subordinated to the objective of 'free competition' alone.
Some in this House may well welcome this, but I consider it a fundamental error.
It is the objectives of transport policy that local public transport must primarily serve.
It is also a European issue, how can the local public transport service improve the mobility of all citizens, including those who, not being car-owners, have no alternative to it, schoolchildren, large families, pensioners, disabled people, people on limited incomes?
Ensuring sustainable basic mobility in accordance with town and country planning is therefore the prime objective for local public transport.
Specific local situations mean that this can be achieved in a wide variety of ways.
So, to this day, I cannot understand why the Commission chose to do this by means of a regulation without considering the possibilities afforded by a directive, as this is a typical case where the subsidiarity principle applies.
I also wonder how it is that the Commission is also choosing the form of the regulation, at the same time as bringing out the White Paper on European governance.
According to this White Paper, it wants to reinforce local autonomy, and here it is interfering.
Hence the question as to how such a regulation can make real the principle of reinforced local autonomy in European governance?
Let me finally return to the offering of contracts for tender.
Of course contracts must be put out to tender.
But the process must highlight firstly transport policy, secondly environmental policy and thirdly social policy, which should lead to optimised mobility for our electorate.
