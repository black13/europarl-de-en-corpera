Mr President, ports, particularly seaports, are normally cosmopolitan systems and they are junctions in the TENs for traffic by ship and sea, which is in principle the most environmentally-friendly mode of transport.
The openness of seaports, though, bears no relation whatever to the system by which they are financed.
Far from it; I think opacity, very often intentional, is the right word to use for it.
To put it in nautical language: when it comes to financing seaports, the bulkheads are closed.
The present financial structures could be described as hazy and must be changed.
I believe that tomorrow's vote must be about transparency in financial relationships and in State finance, for that is the first requirement for fair competition between seaports.
Granted, that is not exactly easy.
Ports are under private, State, joint State and private, and public control, but all of them are enterprises in competition with each other, and so we need fair conditions.
Aid is unobjectionable, but it must be aid for all.
The problem is, I think, that competition between ports has to be organised.
In principle, it occurs within ports or should do so, if all the Community regulations are brought into play.
Pilot services are another issue.
We see them as a public duty, serving safety at sea and the safety of man and nature, and the Member States have essentially reasonable regulations on them.
I believe it would be possible to extend them in view of the recurrent accidents off the German Baltic coast.
One sometimes gets the impression that, when it comes to navigation, many ships use the Shell atlas and nothing else.
So, safety at sea with pilot services must not fall victim to the alleged pressure on costs exerted by competition.
I extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur.
I know that he has had a difficult job, but his shadow does not always have an easy time of it either.
