Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a directive on market access to port services was not acceptable.
The removal of constrictions on free movement of services within the Community does not in fact mean only liberalisation and privatisation, but also European harmonisation with due regard being given to Member States' rights to provide public services in defence of the common interest.
It is noticeable that the rapporteur took account of data specific to ports and attempted to include in his report not only requirements for safety, environmental protection and social standards but also the economic needs of ports.
The vote in Committee is evidence of the fact that opinion was not divided on group lines but that there were differences of outlook specific to different countries.
Removal of pilot services, cargo handling and passenger services from the scope of the directive is something I can go along with, as is the retention of licences granted to previous service providers and the setting of minimum standards for new ones.
The Commission's draft has also undergone radical amendment with regard to financial settlement for investments made and the transparency of the financial relationship between ports and State authorities.
Briefly, Mr Jarzembowski's report changes the Commission's document in the right direction.
As, though, I thoroughly share the view of many of my fellow Members, namely that port services should generally be left to the Member States, I intend to abstain in the vote.
