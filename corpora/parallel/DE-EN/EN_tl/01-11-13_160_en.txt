Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, I come from a small port, but nonetheless one with European credentials as regards the trans-European networks.
I will quite happily note in our logbook that it is not about seeing things in black and white when liberalising and creating free and fair competition, simply in order to adhere to a principle.
The unedifying dispute about duty free is still in my mind.
This discussion about ports is also about jobs, attractive business propositions and public profile, and I want to take part in it, we need to define transparency rules for the calculation of costs and the use of public funds by ports, in order to establish fair competition within ports and between them.
Only transparency about the flow of public funds and services will make it possible to compare the services offered by the various seaports and in that way demonstrate which works more efficiently.
Comparability of services creates competition, and transparency is, in consequence, indispensable if we want to have long-term liberalisation of the market in port services.
I will say in addition that, at this time, we should not yet liberalise the pilot services.
Pilots have, as at present organised, long maintained a high standard of quality and safety on sea routes.
These extraordinarily high standards would be needlessly jeopardised by liberalisation at any cost.
Every market structure contains components for which quality rather than competition must come first.
Of course, the pilots will one day have to adopt a new approach - one day.
Even they will not be able to resist the opening-up of the market forever, but as far as safety at sea is concerned, there are at present more pressing matters such as, for, example, the introduction of a 'black box' for ships.
Immediately forcing pilots to be subject to competition would, under certain circumstances, lead to a price war that could compromise the safety of shipping lanes in the long term.
