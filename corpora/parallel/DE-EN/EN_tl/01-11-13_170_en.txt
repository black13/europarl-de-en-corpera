Sir, neither the President of the Commission nor I myself have held any press conference.
We abide fully by what we agreed.
It is for that reason that the press conference is to take place at 6 p.m., after Parliament has been informed.
I regularly talk to journalists, as you well know.
There was, though, no press conference, and that is an important distinction.
As far as the Hungarian law on status is concerned, we notified the Hungarian government of problems with this law from the point of view of the acquis communautaire even before the law was enacted.
These problems were then taken into legislative account, so that we have no problems with Community law.
My estimation of the Venice Commission differs from your own.
The Venice Commission ruled that whether the Hungarian Status Law is contrary to international law or not is dependent on the way it is implemented.
We have therefore had discussions for some time with the Hungarian government and with the governments of neighbouring countries in order to ensure that Hungary's neighbours are involved in finding a way of implementing it on which they can all agree.
The Hungarian government is thankfully endeavouring to bring this about, and the Romanian and Slovak governments are also ready to play their part.
The Benes decrees have not to date been the subject of negotiations, since property issues, as you well know, are not covered by Community law.
As regards the acquisition of land, I expect something to happen very quickly in the relevant negotiations with Poland.
During my visit to Warsaw last week, the Polish government announced that it would be taking a flexible approach to this issue.
