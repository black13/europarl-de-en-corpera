Madam President, I would like to put three short questions.
The first is to Mr Verheugen: You have announced that there will be additional resources or an additional programme for modernising and adapting administration.
I would be interested to know whether these are financial resources deducted from other programmes for these countries on an anticipatory basis.
Perhaps you could define that a bit more exactly.
My second is this: Commissioner, the Court of Auditors' report that we discussed today criticises the Commission for the absence of definite criteria in its programmes to reinforce atomic power stations, that is, to increase the safety of their reactors.
Are you prepared to consider the possibility that the Commission is not drawing up any criteria, that is to say, any general criteria, but only criteria for checking reactor safety improvement measures, carried out with the support of Commission resources?
My third question, concerning Cyprus and Turkey, has already been briefly alluded to.
The Turkish Prime Minister has just made statements in what may be a new form, to the effect that, if it came to it, the northern part of Cyprus might be annexed.
Does the Commission have a clear, official and unambiguous answer to this?
