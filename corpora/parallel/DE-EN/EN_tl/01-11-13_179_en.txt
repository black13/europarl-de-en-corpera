Madam President, I have three questions.
I would first like to say that I find it a very good thing that the Commission is at last turning its mind to supporting the strengthening of administration.
But my question is whether it is also going to look at the need for administration to really involve the citizens, so that things that go without saying, here in the European Union, are also put into practice there?
My second question concerns the action plan and finance.
If you are allocating more resources from the Phare programme for the support of the institutions, does that then mean that resources are being removed from the other important area of social and economic cohesion, in other words that we are no longer supporting the halting of increasing social decay, which is a core problem in these countries, even though it is urgently necessary?
My last question concerns a point which the report does not mention at all.
Does the Commission intend to encourage the Council to publish a European programme for the Roma people, something which is in my view urgently required?
In almost all countries at present, the Roma minority's human and democratic rights are being violated as much as they have been in the past.
This can clearly not be resolved by these accession candidates on an individual basis; it is a European issue that must be dealt with by a European programme.
