Madam, it goes without saying that the degree of citizen participation that is normative in the European Union is also required of the candidate countries, and is a component factor both in the monitoring they receive and in the support they are given.
Secondly, the resources about which Mr Swoboda has already asked are not taken from the country-specific programmes, but are multi-country programmes, which relate to all countries and which, if you want to put it that way, are kept in the central reserve.
No one country therefore receives one single euro less from the projects which have been discussed up to now.
The burden is not therefore borne by other projects.
On the subject of a European Roma project: this has not yet in fact been included in the Commission's proposals.
Discussion of the subject is already in progress in some of the candidate countries, which are saying that this is a European problem and must therefore be dealt with by a European Community programme.
As far as I am aware, this approach is not shared by most of the Member countries.
In any case, a specific European Roma programme would require significant material resources.
I have to answer your question by saying that the Commission has not as yet made such a proposal, but is concentrating on helping the candidate countries with the implementation of their national strategies to integrate the Roma.
Perhaps I should point out that we have very strict requirements on this point and demand of all the candidate countries with a Roma population that they present and implement a medium-term strategy towards the social integration of the Roma and the removal of social discrimination.
As you know, we are giving these programmes very substantial support by means of pre-accession instruments.
