Madam President, Commissioner, you said that you had not held a press conference.
That appears to be the case, but can you confirm that you held a press briefing this morning, while the groups' press conferences were going on?
Secondly, should this question be answered in the affirmative, I would very much like to ask the President of the Commission whether he thinks that press briefings of this sort are conducive to cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, when we should be the first to be informed.
