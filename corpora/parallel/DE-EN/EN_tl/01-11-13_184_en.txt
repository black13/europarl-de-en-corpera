Madam President, Mr Swoboda's question on reactor safety raised the question in my mind of whether the Commission can make it clear not only to its own bureaux, but also to the Member States and their governments, and certainly also to the European Parliament, that we cannot, in negotiations, demand more from the candidates for accession that we ourselves comply with as Member States of the European Union.
I believe that this is not quite clear to all areas of all our institutions.
Perhaps it should again be highlighted in the coming year.
The second question I would like to put is this.
In your report, you are very optimistic that ten countries will have the chance to sign the Accession Treaty at the end of next year.
As you have expressed it, but I believe it needs to be expressed even more clearly: that is the assessment of today.
This means that, if countries fall behind next year because of poor performance on the political front, the list could well comprise fewer than ten, so that great individual efforts will be necessary and today's judgment will offer no security.
To this will, of course, be added the issues of implementation and of administrative capacity.
Your paper points out that work will be being done on implementation even after the Treaty is signed.
What certainty will there be, though, on the day the Treaty is signed, that administrative capacity will actually be in place when accession becomes effective?
