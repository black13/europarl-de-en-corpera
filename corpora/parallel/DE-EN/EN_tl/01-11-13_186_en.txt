Madam President, Commissioner, I have just been listening to what you have been saying about the enlargement of the EU.
I have heard a lot about the shortcomings of Turkey, about constitutional changes, the democratisation process and human rights.
My question is, what is there in the accession partnership document about the rights of the Kurds?
What is the situation with regard to the rights of 25 million people who have not been mentioned in this discussion?
I ask you, Commissioner, to tell us how the rights of the Kurds are affected and how you assess the political situation in Turkey as regards constitutional changes and the Kurdish question.
