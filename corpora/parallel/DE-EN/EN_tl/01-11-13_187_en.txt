Madam, I regret to have to tell you that the accession partnership with Turkey was not the subject of today's discussions.
Today we in fact discussed and adopted twelve accession partnerships, but not the accession partnership with Turkey, and that because it entered into force only in the early part of this year, and updating it after only a few months would make no sense.
We will therefore be proposing the updating of the accession partnership with Turkey only next year and will produce the assessment you have asked for in that context.
