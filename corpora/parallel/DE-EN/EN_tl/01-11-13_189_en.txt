Sir, for a start I cannot see that support for enlargement is decreasing either in candidate countries or in Member States.
The figures with which I am acquainted indicate the precise opposite.
Quite apart from that, public opinion on the subject is, if I may say so, extraordinarily fickle.
It evidently very much depends on who is asking, what is being asked, and when.
In this way, you can obtain quite different results in the same country at the same time.
I know all the surveys that are being done, and my analysis is that we must not work on the assumption that we are dealing with dwindling support.
Secondly, as regards communications strategy, the European Parliament, and you as a Member of it will be aware of this, has considered it right, for reasons it has made known to us, to make the funds available relatively late in the day, only, in fact, in the course of this year.
The truth is that all the measures could be put in motion only after the summer recess.
You cannot expect that I should be able to supply you with some sort of report on the results of a campaign that started only eight weeks ago.
I must make it clear that this is outside the Commission's remit.
The Commission made its proposal on the implementation of a communication strategy in April 2000, therefore only a few months after we took office.
That it took so long for this strategy to become reality in the European institutions is in this instance regrettable.
I do not believe, though, that it is too late, because only now that the results of negotiations are becoming evident is it right and necessary to fully apply this strategy.
This strategy is in no way about indoctrinating people or, as you have suggested, convincing them of advantages, but about giving them an objective basis on which to form their own opinions and judgments.
The Commission would indeed not be permitted to do more.
