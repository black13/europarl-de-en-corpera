Mr President, Commissioner, the safety of nuclear installations is a problem for the whole of Europe and primarily an environmental issue.
Safety is, in the final analysis, a European added value.
Could you consider encouraging the preparation of a Green Paper on the safety of reactors or nuclear installations, so that in future a relatively objective assessment of the subject may be guaranteed?
