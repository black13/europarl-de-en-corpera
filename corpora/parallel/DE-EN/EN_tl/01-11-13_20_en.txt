Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although money is not everything, the way money is handled shows if a policy is successful or not.
Those were the words of a former President of the Court of Auditors, Bernhard Friedmann, and if we take those words as a yardstick for this year's report, then we really have to ask just how successful the Union's policies are in practice.
The report before us summarises what we already know from many other reports: there is still a need for reform in financial management and the way funds are implemented.
There are dramatic shortcomings in many areas, which suggests that financial errors are endemic.
The Commission's tendency to blame irregularities and deficits the Court discovers chiefly on the Member States is unacceptable.
Of course the Member States cannot shake off their own responsibilities, if there are irregularities or fraud in the Member States, the Commission must act accordingly.
The recovery rate, that is the reimbursement of funds that have been lost, is not satisfactory.
It is not acceptable if Member States underperform in the fight against fraud because of lax controls and are then slow to get funds reimbursed as well.
Politically speaking, the Commission has final responsibility for the EU budget and it is accordingly also responsible for efficient implementation of funds and checks.
One of the things mentioned in the Commission's responses on last year's report is that new systems are being introduced which primarily aim to make it easier to check the efficiency of VAT collection in the individual Member States.
Given that significant shortcomings have also been identified in this area, we also have to ask how effective these control mechanisms are.
I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for its successful investigative work and I call on the Commission to take further structural reform actions so that mismanagement and financial errors become a thing of the past.
