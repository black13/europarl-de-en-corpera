Mr President, I like this report, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what he has said and, moreover, congratulate the Commission on its Green Paper, for, by it, the Commission is making us aware of our dependence on energy.
I can recall no debate in the past twenty years which has pointed out our dependence on imported energy in the way this Green Paper has.
Thank you again.
I would like to make two observations on nuclear energy.
Unlike many in my group, I take the view that it has a future.
I believe that we should also express that in a positive way.
Secondly, and this is perhaps even more important than the first point, I would like to observe that we have been given the task of developing a clean coal-fired power station.
I say this also with reference to our obligations as a result of Kyoto.
A clean coal-fired power station is not only of interest to Europe, but also to the world.
For let us not forget, as the Commission repeatedly emphasised, that in the next one or two generations, our dependence on fossil energy, at any rate worldwide, will be up to 80% and it is all the more important to master combustion technologies.
