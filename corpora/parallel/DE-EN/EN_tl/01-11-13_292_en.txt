Mr President, Commissioner, the Green Paper on the security of energy supply is fundamentally to be welcomed.
It deals with an acute problem, one directly linked with the world political situation, which is more extensively unpredictable than ever.
Despite the very large number of good statements, I cannot share the rapporteur's view that nuclear energy is a practical alternative to energy imports.
The reasons are well known.
Only recently, a study was completed, commissioned by Parliament, which comes to the conclusion that the reprocessing plants at La Hague and Sellafield discharge as much radioactivity over seven years as was emitted in the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
The problem of the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste has not been resolved.
Nor does nuclear fusion offer a solution.
It therefore makes more sense to invest in safe and renewable energy sources than in nuclear fusion, which can achieve results in 100 years at best.
