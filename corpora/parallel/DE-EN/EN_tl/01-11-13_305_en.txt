, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 11 October the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted my opinion on the White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy.
Harmonisation of chemicals policy across the EU is especially important, but the following three aspects are no less significant.
First, the practicability of the registration system.
The amount of data to be collected means we must keep a sense of proportion in order that the system is not congested from the start.
The principle of proportionality is also to be applied to the required definition of use, so that the manufacturer of a product must be able to restrict the definition to actually intended purposes.
Secondly, a clear definition of the substitution principle.
The definition of this principle varies from one Member State to another, if they have one at all.
If it is to be laid down in Community law, it will have to be formulated in a consistent and unambiguous way.
Thirdly, appropriate protection for test data.
Insufficient account is taken of the need to guard commercial confidentiality.
At the same time, the security data document should be under copyright in order to protect the applicant against misuse of the data obtained.
Mrs Sch√∂rling's report is to that extent unbalanced.
It takes too little account of the interests of medium-sized chemical businesses and of the industry as a whole, something that can lead to distortions in competition.
I therefore recommend adoption of the amendments resulting from the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which contribute to a better balance of the interests of all interested parties.
