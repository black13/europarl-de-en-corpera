Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the European Union must, with the passing of time, equip itself with a new chemical policy.
The one we have at present is unsatisfactory.
There had been advance indications that there would be a vast array of tests, but the overall test result is unsatisfactory.
The Commission's principled involvement is therefore to be welcomed even if we cannot support every aspect of its proposal.
There is, though, something of which I must warn you.
You, too, Commissioner, are on my mind today in particular.
When you introduced yourself to us, you announced that the experience of your own country led you to want to establish a new policy on chemicals in Europe.
My impression is that today, like Goethe's Faust, you have conjured up something you cannot control.
What the rapporteur, Mrs Sch√∂rling, has presented is not a proposal about environmental policy.
It is a classic export of pollution, as many enterprises that are already being marginalised by the European Union will move themselves very quickly even nearer to its boundary and indeed also outside the EU in order to save themselves these unimaginable impositions.
This cannot be a modern environmental policy.
Rather, we must take this branch of industry with us in integrating high but feasible standards.
I believe that the aspects already mentioned - temporary approval, obligatory regulation under 1000 kilos, the principle of substitution and regulation of use as well - are an attempt at multiple protection, for every owner of a medium-sized business is being enslaved, because only industry can now meet the obligations which your proposal envisages.
I believe that this proposal should be sent back to the Commission, but certainly not to the rapporteur, whom I otherwise greatly respect and who, on this occasion, has thoroughly disappointed me.
