Mr President, I represent a minority.
The new Recital 16 says that there is an obligation to report suspicions "if the legal counsellor is taking part in money laundering activities, the legal advice is provided for money laundering purposes, or the lawyer knows that the client is seeking legal advice for money laundering purposes".
That is going too far.
That is why I am voting against this.
It would destroy the integrity of advice.
It also has a second implication which has not up to now been the case under our existing legislation: in all three cases the legal counsellor or lawyer would be committing a criminal offence.
He would therefore also have to denounce himself.
That is totally unheard of anywhere in the world.
I am fairly sure that even in the Stone Age there was no law saying that.
For some inexplicable reason, the Commission has felt moved for the first time ever in law to adopt a legal provision whereby one must denounce oneself.
I certainly cannot vote for that.
Lessing comes to mind, who said that if enlightenment is only a small light glimmering in the darkness, there is at least still some hope in the world.
You have made the same mistake as with the OLAF legislation, which in the end has even penetrated into Members' offices.
You will be stopped there.
This could not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.
When we were debating the OLAF legislation, I said that the European Union as a whole had had a rush of regulatory blood to the head.
We seem to have a similar phenomenon again here.
I also regard it as a matter for great regret that the legal profession has shown so little backbone on this issue.
