Mr President, water is the Number One food.
I therefore consider constant use of water and protection of water resources to be indispensable.
One means by which this may be achieved is, as required by the water framework directive, a price for water that covers costs, comprising the environmental costs and the cost of infrastructure and of treatment.
Incentives are necessary for water to be continuously used.
Careful use of water is encouraged by having a basic price for basic services and increasing prices for use over and above that.
The basic price must also take social aspects into account, for access to water must be possible for the less well off in society.
One important area in which there is a need for action is that of agriculture.
The reduction of water subsidies in agriculture and the careful use of water resources will only be achieved by promoting rural development and finding new sources of income for farmers.
Water polluters must also be called to account, which means that the 'polluter pays' principle applies.
Every water consumer in Europe should additionally receive a statement of how much water he has used and how the price he pays for his water is made up.
I see it as an important question, how much of a market we permit and whether private commitment conflicts with public and regionally-organised water supply and careful use of water.
I believe that cooperation between public and private undertakings using private know-how and capital is an option when it comes to making the best use of water resources from an ecological and economic point of view, without regional supply zones being given up.
So here I am not talking about deregulation and competition at any price, but about ensuring efficient and environmentally friendly water supply.
