Mr President, the report works on the basic assumption that the easily-accessible fresh water reserves have been largely opened up, that long-term water use and savings can be achieved by using economic leverage, and that this would promote the responsible use of water.
This requirement can only be met on a world-wide basis.
I do not see implementation of the report's objectives on pricing as the high road that we should be taking.
Affordable prices are often saddled with negative associations.
The cost of clean water depends on the right investments, on technical skill and on better success than hitherto in allocating tasks in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle.
The Member States are free to come to their own decisions.
It will be difficult to keep to the timetable.
