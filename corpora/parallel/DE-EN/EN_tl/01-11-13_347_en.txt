Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Corbey, thank you for the work you have put in on this report.
I would very much like to start by asking you, Commissioner, why you have brought before Parliament a report on the implementation of the packaging directive when the revision of the Packaging Regulations is already before us.
I would very much like to know if there is a strategy for this, whether you need more time for a new debate on strategy and whether you are in the process of moving over from a product policy to a materials policy.
As I now observe, that is a vain labour of love, as you are now applying yourself to other things.
You are right, Mrs Corbey, to say that packaging waste is increasing, and so it is entirely right and proper for us to concern ourselves with these Packaging Regulations and with those to be enacted in the future.
I simply think that we must first discuss what has actually been done by the Member States.
Were the old Packaging Regulations from the Nineties right, or did we make mistakes?
Did we rightly see how things would turn out today?
Is there not a multitude of loopholes?
As you mentioned, databases are largely lacking.
Has transposition into national law really taken place punctually and in the way we intend, and is the hierarchy envisaged by the Packaging Regulations actually as flexible as we need it to be in the future?
I do not believe so.
Yet we must, now that the Commission has imposed on us this report on implementation, concentrate on these important matters.
It is unfortunately not our present task to consider what quotas have to be set for landfill dumping, recycling, and so on.
Let me make clear that I regret that.
There are a lot of other points I would like to make.
Having lost the first minutes, though, I shall admit defeat and carry on debating in the next round.
