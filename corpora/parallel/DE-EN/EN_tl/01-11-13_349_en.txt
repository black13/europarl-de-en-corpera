Commissioner, I would like to know why you are presenting us with a report on the implementation of the Packaging Regulations, because we all know well enough that the revised Packaging Regulations have already arrived.
My question is whether this is to do with a new strategy.
Is it the case that you want in future to leave product policy behind and turn your attention to the torrents of refuse?
