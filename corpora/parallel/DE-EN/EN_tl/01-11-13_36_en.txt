Mr President, I wish to congratulate and thank the rapporteur.
Because of your commitment, we have been able to see off the attack the Council and Commission were making on the fundamental rights and rights to defence of Europe's citizens.
It is not acceptable for defence counsel, solicitors, tax consultants and notaries simply to be turned into part of the public prosecution service.
It is also evident that the battle to maintain rights to defence is not over yet.
The directive still has to be transposed into national legislation, and we must continue to argue that it should not be subject to an excessively narrow interpretation at national level, thus restricting citizens' fundamental rights and rights to defence.
However, I can also assure you that I will be making representations to the appropriate Austrian authorities to make sure that precisely this does not happen.
