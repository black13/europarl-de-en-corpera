Mr President, I would first like to strike a critical note, because although the rapporteur explained the need for haste to the committee and I also understand that, I believe that there should not be fast-track procedures of this kind, because they can lead to botch-ups.
However, I would like to specifically exclude the rapporteur's report from that comment.
I am totally in agreement with the content of the report, because approximation of Community law as it applies to SMEs is also absolutely necessary if we are to increase legal certainty for cross-border contracts, especially in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union.
It would be irresponsible to create free trade areas without making provision for the necessary instruments to keep commercial trade on track.
However, it is my belief, and this is something that Mr MacCormick just touched upon, that the mature traditions underpinning the legal systems of the Member States impose certain limitations on the approximation of civil and commercial law, and that a failure to respect those traditions would inevitably lead to the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.
However, I believe that these problems have been adequately addressed and that it is also possible to achieve this objective, which we will therefore be supporting.
