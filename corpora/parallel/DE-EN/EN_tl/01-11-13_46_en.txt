Mr President, by and large I agree with the rapporteur, and in the limited time I have available I can only mention one or two rather unrelated points.
What we need to start with at EU level is coherent and homogeneous legislation.
That is very often not the case, because terms are used which have a different meaning in other legal texts.
Scarcely any academic research has been done into this aspect of Community law.
So the first thing we should do is to ensure coherence and homogeneity in our own legal texts, and I would urge you to set up an expert committee to do this.
That is one point.
The other point that I would like to address is how this relates to international civil law.
It seems to me that Mr Lehne has rather neglected this aspect in his report.
International civil law can make an important contribution to overcoming the difficulties involved in cross-border legal disputes, and as a rule, and I am choosing my words very carefully now, international civil law is certainly not inferior to Community law, certainly as far as legal culture and the quality of legal texts are concerned.
So if, as in the case of the directive on electronic commerce, you take issue with international civil law, the situation becomes very difficult indeed.
We therefore need to examine once more to what extent we can retain international civil law.
My final point concerns national regulations.
I think this is an area where we should not overreach ourselves.
That will be very difficult.
I believe that it would be best for us to have convincing law making in the European Union.
