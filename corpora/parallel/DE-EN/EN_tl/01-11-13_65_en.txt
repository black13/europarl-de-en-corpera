Mr President, this report on services of general interest in Europe deals with a field of tension between two significant blocs.
It is about the issue of a unitary competitive order in Europe, and about the self-government of communities or, in other words, about subsidiarity.
The focus of all this must always be the citizen, the consumer, and what services he receives, under what conditions and, above all, of what quality.
There are two points I find important in the communication from the Commission.
It always speaks of an economic activity, with 'an economic activity' being very hard to define exactly.
If we in this House discuss what an economic activity is, the thinking of a very large number of Members is shaped by their national origin.
Is an economic activity to be affirmed when an enterprise works in a particular line of business for profit?
Let me mention only ambulance services.
The second is the issue of checking for misuse.
The question here is not whether the Commission can check on this, but in what detail it should, so that over-restrictive requirements do not result in a definition of general interest by the back door.
What is important is that we should be given communal responsibility and that we use it to choose one or other type of competition by means of public tender.
I would like, finally, to re-emphasise one thing that is mentioned in the report, but not in the communication from the Commission, namely the market in water.
For us in Germany and Austria, water is an extraordinarily important area.
I believe that as a matter of urgency we should reject the opening of the market in water, brought about by means of a decision on an individual case in the European Union - and the Commission has already requested an assessment on the subject.
We reject this decisively.
Examination of the sector-specific situation is in any case needed first.
I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these steps.
