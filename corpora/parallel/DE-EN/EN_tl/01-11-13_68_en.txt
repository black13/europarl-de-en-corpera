Mr President, the EU is trusting in liberalisation to ensure that services of general interest are sufficiently available.
If that means increased and fairer competition in postal services, transport, water supply, social services and so on, this can only be agreed to.
If, though, simple considerations of cost mean that the quality of service drops, with ever fewer service providers being available and ever fewer people being employed, this proposal merits political resistance.
State monopolies must not be replaced by private monopolies.
Mr Langen, the rapporteur, has taken on board my suggestion that tasks of general interest should be acknowledged to be common European values.
They contribute to the European social model and to the sustainable development of the EU's regions.
The aim is to guarantee high standards of quality and safety, range of provision and continuity in a healthy price/service ratio.
As before, the Member States' offers for tender will independently determine which yardstick to apply as regards environmental friendliness, availability and social standards.
It is for the good of all citizens if these services are unambiguously defined in the context of a European law on the placing of contracts.
Exceptions from the internal market's competition and market regulations should include local, social and charitable services which do not work with their eye on profit and are committed to meeting the needs of the weak and those on the margins of society.
Citizens and service users are to be comprehensively involved in the Member States' and the Commission's efforts to make this agreement reality.
New regulations on services of general interest in the EU will only be accepted if transparency and involvement are ensured.
As a member not only of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but also of that on Employment and Social Affairs, I recommend that this House approve this report, which is excellent because it is balanced.
