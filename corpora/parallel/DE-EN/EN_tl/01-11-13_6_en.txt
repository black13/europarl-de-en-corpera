Mr President, the situation is well known.
It has not been possible to renew the fishing agreement with Morocco, so the fishing sector in Spain and to some extent in Portugal is now in a difficult position.
The Commission has also responded to the Council's request with the proposal for a restructuring programme, and I can tell you once again that we are not talking about the fishing agreement with Mauritania, but about a restructuring programme for the Spanish fleet and also for a part of the Portuguese fleet.
We are talking about paying scrapping premiums.
We are talking about social measures.
I think it is right for us to say that we will separate the budgetary issue from the legal basis, but the Commission is asking for the legal basis for this restructuring programme to be dealt with quickly.
That is why we support the request for urgent procedure.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
