Mr President, I too have had a mistake in the Spanish version brought to my attention by my Spanish colleagues, and I would like it to be corrected.
The word in question is determinar in the second part of Article 6(3), which should by rights be replaced by the word evaluar, that apparently being the correct translation.
I ask that this should be checked and, if necessary, corrected.
