Mr President, I would like to refer again to the vote, in which, alas, we lost the chance to vote on item 62.
I have again consulted the documents: item 62 is an addition to item 58, and we should in fact have voted on it by roll call.
Both my points of order were, unfortunately, ignored by your two assistants.
What is at issue here is that we make it simply and convincingly clear that the opening-up of competition in the water market cannot be achieved by means of general competition law.
I therefore want to reiterate this.
I stated in my opening statements that we reject this, and I ask that this be noted in the Minutes and that, if possible, Members' requests to speak should not be ignored in future.
