This financing issue is indeed directly linked with the subject we were discussing just now.
EUR 50 million will be made available from appropriations that were previously earmarked for fishing agreements.
It is quite evident that this is additional money that was not available beforehand for other external actions.
A further EUR 10 million will be made available from two budget lines with which there have also been implementation difficulties up to now, that is to say the budget lines for Latin America and for Asia.
The money will be implemented here in a concrete way, and there are promising signs that the extra EUR 60 million can be provided from the EDF.
I believe that it really would be a good sign if the European Union could make an early decision on implementing these financial appropriations.
As you know, the donors to the global health fund have promised over USD 1.8 billion, but so far those are just promises.
The European Union would be the first to make a concrete decision on financing.
I therefore ask you to vote for this request for urgent procedure.
We need a legal basis for making a transfer to the global health fund.
This House will naturally be kept informed at all stages.
We will, of course, come back to this several times during the overall budget process.
But if the legal basis could be rapidly decided upon now, and it would be a good legal basis that would enable us to make the transfer, then we would not need to explore any other avenues, because the budget situation would be very clear.
So I ask you to vote for the request for urgent procedure.
