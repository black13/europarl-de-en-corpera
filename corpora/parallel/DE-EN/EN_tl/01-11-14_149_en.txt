Mr President, I view the expiry of the Euratom Treaty as an opportunity for Europe to phase out nuclear energy.
Yet today's vote on the Euratom programme has endorsed follow-up funding for nuclear research.
This is set out in Amendment No 12, for example, which provides funding for research into the safety of existing reactors (with priority for reactors in the candidate countries), as well as reactors of the new generation.
In other words, it safeguards future nuclear power plants.
Yet research should be targeting non-nuclear energies, especially renewable energies, in order to make a contribution to the progressive phasing-out of nuclear energy in Europe.
This is why we rejected not only Amendment No 12 but also the entire Euratom programme in today's vote.
