Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Minister, nothing has been said in this debate which I cannot support.
Nonetheless, I would like to raise three points which, in my view, should be emphasised to a far greater extent.
Firstly, in the long term, we cannot expect other states to adopt security policies which are different from those we practise ourselves.
If we do not want proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this area, for example, a clearer signal must be sent out by the European Union and its partners.
Secondly, there has obviously been a paradigm shift and a change in strategy in the USA on the verification issue compared with the 1980s.
In view of the urgency of these issues in the wake of 11 September, the European Union's diplomatic restraint, which I have often understood, is inappropriate, and I hope that the USA's unilateralism, which has just been mentioned, will be overcome on the basis of their own experience.
The third problem is the most crucial.
It is wrong to point to the USA alone.
This paradigm shift has obviously taken place here in Western Europe as well.
If I look at the model under discussion for the Biological Weapons Convention as well, namely the monitoring organisation for chemical weapons, there is currently a financial crisis in which EU Member States also play a role.
We have witnessed deterioration in the monitoring provisions since the Convention was first adopted.
Perhaps this is symptomatic, Madam Minister: in May this year, I asked the Council for its comments on these issues.
I have still not received a response, and I suspect that we, too, are approaching this issue with insufficient vigour.
