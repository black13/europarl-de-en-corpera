Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cardiff process is essential for sustainable development.
The European Parliament, and especially its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has already carried out very good preliminary work here, and I think that in this House, transparency and, of course, dialogue can really be taken for granted.
We very often hold hearings here and make every effort to maximise dialogue with non-government organisations.
My question relates to this issue.
We have just concluded the WTO negotiations.
What opportunities do you see to coordinate the Cardiff process in consultation with the WTO organisations?
