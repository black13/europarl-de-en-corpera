Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally welcome the Commission's proposal for the Sixth Research Framework Programme, above all the Europe-wide coordination and the emphasis laid on basic research.
Two points cause me concern.
The first is that, when it comes to the definition of fundamental ethical principles, the mind of this House is divided between, on the one hand, banning embryo stem cell research outright and, on the other, permitting it.
Where the boundary lies between a mere heap of cells and a human life is something we all no doubt have to decide for ourselves.
It is a choice with far-reaching implications, one to be made on the basis of conscience.
I would remind you, though, that research on embryo stem cells is prohibited in several Member States, including Austria.
To use EU funds to finance research in one Member State which would be banned in another is unacceptable.
The second thing that concerns me is that research funds totalling EUR 1.2 billion are being made available within the framework of the Euratom programme, over two-thirds of which go to nuclear research.
Safety issues play only a subordinate role.
I consider increased research into non-nuclear energy sources to be imperative.
I regret that there is no reference to it in this report.
