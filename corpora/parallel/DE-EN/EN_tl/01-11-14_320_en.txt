Mr President, it is clear that the banks have been toying with this issue for years and have, at long last, thrown away this opportunity, making it necessary to introduce binding rules in a regulation.
It is not on for EUR 18 of bank charges to be debited for transfers of, say, EUR 100, and often this is done twice, once from the sender's account and once from the recipient's.
It is not on quite simply because the financial institutions have, for some considerable time, had the technical means to carry out transfers, honour cheques and make card payments quickly and at a reasonable cost.
We must be careful to ensure, however, and this has already been mentioned several times - that, as cross-border charges go down, domestic charges are not increased correspondingly.
Should this be the case then, in the future, domestic charges will also have to be laid down in a regulation.
We should clarify this too.
One snag is the fact that there are moves to postpone the deadline by two months.
On this point, I am afraid that I cannot go along with the rapporteur.
The banks have always been able to raise interest rates and bank charges overnight.
In the space of a month and a half it will now also be possible for them to lower their charges to a standard level.
I hope that there is not a majority in favour of the amendments concerned.
