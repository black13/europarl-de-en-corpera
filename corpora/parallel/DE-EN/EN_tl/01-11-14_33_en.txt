Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for the Sixth Research Framework Programme is an ethical minefield.
Amendment No 22, providing for Community funds for embryo research, is utterly unacceptable, being a flagrant offence against human dignity.
Embryos must not be degraded to the level of being research material.
Embryo research is banned in four Member States, including Germany.
We must not permit the use of Community funds to finance something that is punishable in these Member States.
Even research on embryo stem cells would offer an incentive to create even more surplus embryos, and we decisively reject it for that reason.
The proposal even offers support to germline therapy.
This would mean the European Parliament distancing itself, politically and scientifically, from the rest of the world, for nobody in the scientific community is demanding or promoting germline therapy, far from it, they are calling for it to be outlawed.
So I ask you to let us clear these ethical mines from the research framework programme and make the programme we adopt a responsible one.
