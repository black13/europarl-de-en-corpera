Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra on his clear and comprehensive report.
It is indeed time for the European Union to revise its strategy on relations with Latin America.
There is still a great deal of room for improvement, especially in the field of economic cooperation, and for us Socialists, this also includes Cuba, a country with which we must finally commence negotiations on a framework agreement, without any preconditions.
Economic cooperation must include and take account of appropriate social and ecological minimum standards; after all, we do not want to worsen the social inequalities in Latin America but help to defuse them, for these countries are still marked by massive variations in social conditions.
There are wealthy industrialised enclaves surrounded by regions with crippling poverty.
We therefore also call, in the field of structural development, for measures to achieve sustainable economic development which promote SMEs in particular.
Above all, wherever it is necessary and appropriate, the groups concerned and civil society, especially indigenous ethnic groups, must be included from the planning stage onwards.
This applies especially to the Puebla Panama project.
The European Union should only participate in this project on the basis of clearly defined substantive agreements.
Technology and knowledge transfer, but also the opening of the European market to the partner countries' products, are further steps which must be taken quickly.
This House wants an equal economic partnership with the citizens of Latin America, not just with a handful of major corporations.
