Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my side has admittedly lost in a key vote, but the process must continue.
We must now ensure that the Council forms an opinion.
If we prevaricate and postpone this issue, the Council can continue to hide behind its inaction.
I therefore propose that we reject the rapporteur's motion and now hold the final vote so that the ball is the Council's court.
We still have the second reading and the mediation process.
A delay at this point will not help: we want to move forward on this issue, and so I ask you to reject Mr Meijer's motion.
