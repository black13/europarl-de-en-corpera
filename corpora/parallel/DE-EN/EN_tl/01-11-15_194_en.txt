Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity of an explanation of vote to thank Mrs Lynne for her outstanding report, but also to thank Mr Karas for mentioning my exhibition and Mrs Petter who was responsible for putting it together.
This is a splendid initiative for disabled and traumatised children who are cared for by a children's centre in Munich.
This initiative will now be continued in Italy and France by a series of colleagues.
Mrs Lynne has spontaneously offered to take it to England too.
I am very grateful.
This is a good start to our preparatory work for the Year of Disabled People.
That is why I should like to thank all of those colleagues who are supporting this magnificent initiative from Bavaria.
