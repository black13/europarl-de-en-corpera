Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to comment on just two aspects, socially acceptable and economically reasonable restructuring in the aviation industry.
Madam President-in-Office, you were too generous in your comments just now when you said that the Council had in fact responded consistently.
I have my doubts about this, Madam President-in-Office, and I should like to urge you in the strongest possible terms to ensure that the same subsidies - whether it be for insurance cover, whether it be compensation, or whether it be possible restructuring aid - are granted or not granted in all of the Member States.
It is not acceptable for airlines to be supported in a particular way in one Member State and not in another when all are supposed to be competing fairly in an internal market.
This cannot work.
We want to establish fair terms of competition between the airlines.
As President-in-Office of the Council you must ensure that this is the case and you, Commissioner, must, if necessary, take the Member States to court if there are distortions of competition here which destroy the internal market.
Secondly, Madam President-in-Office, you rightly referred to the fact that restructuring is necessary.
Probably there will be a number of larger global players and some regional airlines.
They cannot be bound to Member State A or Member State B. We need a functioning European and global air transport market.
This can only happen, Madam President-in-Office, if the Member States cede their responsibilities for take-off and landing rights to the Community and if we administer the take-off and landing rights together.
Only then can we give our airlines a chance to compete on fair terms in the global market.
I would earnestly request that in the next few weeks you do all you can to bring your influence to bear on your Member States on these two points.
