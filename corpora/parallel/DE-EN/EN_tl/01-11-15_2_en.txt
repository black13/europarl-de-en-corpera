Madam President, I had not managed to reach my seat.
I wanted to make a very brief comment: my name does not appear on the attendance register and I wanted to say that I was present at both the sitting and the corresponding vote.
I know that this relates to Monday's sitting, but I did want to have it included in the Minutes.
Many thanks.
Obviously I did not sign in, but I was here and I did take part.
Thank you!
