Mr President, I very much welcome the tabling of the Commission's Green Paper on a strategy for the security of energy supply.
It is with great regret that I see that yet again too little attention has been paid to renewable sources of energy.
We will only achieve the Kyoto target if we give preference to these sources of energy.
I am therefore very disappointed at the vote on the Chichester report because here too nuclear energy is still the preferred option.
