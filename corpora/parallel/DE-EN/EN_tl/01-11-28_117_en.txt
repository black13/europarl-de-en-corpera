Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the Prodi Commission' s existing policy on fighting fraud can really only be described as hesitant and dilatory when it comes to the really crucial questions.
And I have very little hope that this will change, especially in the matter of the European Financial Public Prosecutor.
A Green Paper is all the Commission has planned for the remaining years of its term of office.
Your much-vaunted Commission reform programme lacks the crucial safety net.
Those who abuse their freedoms must be capable of being brought to account.
Your first duty ought to have been to clear up the old cases and call those responsible to account.
Instead, you are hiding behind a hesitant judiciary in Belgium and Luxembourg.
To prevent this sad truth from becoming so evident, you are following a policy of concealing information from Parliament, which you now want to get expressly embodied in the Financial Regulation.
You are claiming for yourself the right to decide whether informing Parliament about a procedure is in the European Union' s interest or not.
I would like to have seen you when you were a member of the State Parliament in Berlin, Mrs Schreyer, if the Governing Mayor had told you it was not in the city' s interest to inform you about certain things.
That is precisely how you are presuming to treat the European Parliament today and you clearly fail to appreciate that in so doing you weaken not only this Parliament but, ultimately, also the Commission of which you are part.
