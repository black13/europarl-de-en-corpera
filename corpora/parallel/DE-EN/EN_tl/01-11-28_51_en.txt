Mr President, Mr Leinen and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo's model of a Convention sets out an accessible and also, I hope, successful way ahead into Europe's future.
I also agree with your desire, in response to statement 23, for an enlarged agenda which, however, the Convention should set for itself.
Even such an enlarged agenda, though, offers little hope of achieving the desired result, namely a single basis for decision-making.
I am far more inclined to think that the possibility suggests itself of submitting to the Council various options which could also take account of the different positions.
I know that on one point I stand quite alone, although I am in the right.
I wish to reiterate my warning against setting an earlier date for the Intergovernmental Conference planned for Nice in 2004, because I am firmly convinced that the people would see it as an evasion of their vote.
If, as all sides in the House maintain, we really are striving for an open debate which is accessible to the public, then nothing could be better suited to that than to include the themes in the next European elections.
