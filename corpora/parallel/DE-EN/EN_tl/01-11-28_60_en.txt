Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no democracy without a Parliament.
Today again we find that the European Parliament is the principal integrating element in the European Union.
Nowhere else do Council, Commission and Parliament engage in public discussion, not always achieving unanimity, but openly, and, I hope, constructively.
Our three rapporteurs have presented excellent reports.
This Parliament has, since Nice, been pressing forward with a Community process which must burst forth in Laeken.
I share President Prodi's concern that the European Union is not yet adequately equipped to cope with enlargement, and so I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to check again, and check carefully, whether what was decided in Nice really does enhance the working capacity of the Council and of Parliament.
I doubt it.
The European Community and European Union have developed splendidly over the past nearly fifty years to date, and I hope that the next fifty years will be prepared for in such a way that we can work even better in the European Union over the next fifty years.
