Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually tragic that it took an event like the dramatic terrorist attacks in New York and in Washington to rouse Europe, and the European Council in particular, from slumber, but I am glad that we have managed in such a very short time to put together a package - a counter-terrorism package.
It extends from money laundering, by way of the freezing of accounts, to the measures we are discussing today.
I am glad that, at last, terrorism is defined as an offence in all fifteen Member States and not just in six, as was formerly the case, and can therefore be proceeded against.
I am glad that there is the hope of a European arrest warrant.
I hope that national animosities do not again lead to the postponement of this European arrest warrant, which we so urgently need.
Just go back to Parliament's proposal, when, I believe, the position we took up was a good one.
I am glad that we will make Eurojust a reality and that the enlarged powers to combat terrorism take us another step forward in the right direction.
I am glad that Europol will have joint investigative teams.
All this is very positive in that we are showing the public just what added value the European Union can have.
I demand, though, that currently unresolved points in certain areas be dealt with.
The Member States must finally be required, and with consequences in the event of their non-compliance, to supply Europol with information and to ensure optimum coordination between Eurojust and Europol and appropriate parliamentary management and monitoring.
Parliament has made some excellent proposals on this point, and I congratulate the rapporteur and the whole team of shadow rapporteurs.
I hope that the excellent work they have done will meet with complete support tomorrow.
