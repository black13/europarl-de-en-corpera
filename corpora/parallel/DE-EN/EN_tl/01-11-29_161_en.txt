Mr President, today the House has shown itself unworthy of an excellent report by a committee on human genetics.
A majority of this House, duped by an unholy alliance of socialists and liberals, has distorted a report, so that nearly all of us ended up having to vote against it in order to leave that outstanding product of the Committee on Human Genetics, the original text of the Fiori Report, standing as a beacon of Europe's protection of life.
I am proud that this Committee, in one year, drafted this magnificent report, which will stand as the product of a committee of real experts.
This House has yet to learn how to handle this report in a manner worthy of it.
I appeal to the citizens of the European Union and to the organisations in it defending human life, which are at last becoming as active as the animal protection organisations, to take a close look at how Members here voted and to enter into dialogue with us, so that this House may keep to the course it has taken since the Gergo report at the beginning of the 1980s, that is, to stand up for life - human life for human beings.
From conception to natural death, human beings deserve all the protection we can give, and without equivocation.
