Mr President, the debate we are conducting today touches on the fundamental questions of human existence.
Is there a right to life-long health?
Is there a right to natural children or a right to healthy natural children or, ultimately, a right to eternal life, healthy of course?
New techniques are available.
We are being promised cures to many diseases.
They are not proven as yet, at any rate not in the field of embryonic stem cell research.
Do we really want to be blinded by the interests of self-seeking researchers?
Do we want to allow ourselves to be used by industry and its commercial interests?
The term 'therapeutic clone' is a form of misleading packaging.
It can also be used reproductively.
Is the production of clones or the scavenging of 'surplus' embryos in order to use their stem cells ethically acceptable?
No, it is not acceptable.
It is more like a modern form of cannibalism.
But this debate is in fact already out of date, overtaken by reality.
There are serious alternatives, adult stem cells, stem cells from umbilical cord blood.
These techniques are already showing great success in practical use, far greater than embryonic stem cell research.
There are no ethical objections to such alternatives.
It is up to politics to set boundaries.
Science is not able to do that, because it does not want to.
We must decide.
We must be courageous in the face of all challenges.
No use must be made of embryonic stem cells, regardless of whether they are cloned or surplus.
No human germ line intervention.
No selection, no choice between life that is valued and life that is not, but support for research in the quest for alternatives.
Let us be courageous and set tight limits.
It is high time we did.
