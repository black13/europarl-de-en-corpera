Madam President, what Mr Heaton-Harris has just said is to some extent correct.
Mr Heaton-Harris was referring to a section about the interim solution of an internal public prosecutor, whereas the other amendments to the proposal for a directive have gone through.
I do not think that this referral back is necessarily the way to solve the problem created by the vote.
I cannot say, and in the light of the voting in committee, I cannot see how this report should be further amended.
