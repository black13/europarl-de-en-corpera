Madam President, there is really no need for me to speak now.
I spoke before the vote.
This amendment was, in fact, dealt with when Amendment No 10 was accepted.
I agree with Mr Corbett there because we have asked for adequate representation of both sexes.
That can, of course, also be fifty-fifty, it need not be two thirds one gender and only one third the other.
So the amendment we accepted goes further.
In that respect we have decided correctly.
