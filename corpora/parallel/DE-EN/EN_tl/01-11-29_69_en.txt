Madam President, number 18 is only a reordering.
It is followed by Amendment No 9 and I would like to say a brief word about that.
Firstly, this amendment is tabled not by the group but by myself, as rapporteur.
The purpose of the amendment is to make the text more logical and also to make the content of what it says about regulatory agencies coherent.
I discussed it with the various groups yesterday and obtained their agreement.
That therefore means that Amendment No 9 refers to item 19, and, in particular, to the deletion of the second part of the paragraph.
At the same time, the shortened paragraph is to be inserted before item 16, immediately after the heading 'Autonomous regulatory authorities' .
The word 'only' must then be inserted in the fifth line of item 16 so that it then reads '... only be approved if...' .
As I have the floor now, there is a translation error in the Swedish version of Paragraph 27.
It should read 'Committee of the Regions' and not 'Economic and Social Committee' .
