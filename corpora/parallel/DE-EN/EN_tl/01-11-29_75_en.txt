Madam President, after the motion for a resolution on Egypt had been prepared, we received a letter from the speaker of the Egyptian parliament which we would rather not have received.
For this reason I would like to table an oral amendment that the following be inserted after recital E:
"expressing its regrets concerning certain paragraphs of the letter from the President of the People's Assembly of the Arab Republic of Egypt on this resolution" .
I have spoken with the rapporteur about it and he has agreed to our tabling this amendment.
(The President declared that there was no opposition to voting on the oral amendment)
