Madam President, I voted against the Commission proposal because the Commission is using the reform of its financial management, which I also believe to be urgently necessary, as a pretext to weaken the European Parliament' s powers of control.
The EC Treaty provides that the Commission shall present the Parliament with all necessary information on request.
The Commission is now seeking to make that right to information subject to provisos in the Financial Regulation.
For example, in future, the Commission wants to check whether passing information to Parliament would be against the Union' s interests.
That creates the absurd situation where the party under scrutiny, the Commission, decides what information to put before the one who is to scrutinise it, Parliament, and what not.
That not only weakens Parliament, but it weakens the Commission itself.
In future, it will have to listen to the criticism that it has learned nothing from the past and is continuing to escape effective control.
