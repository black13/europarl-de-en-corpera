Mr President, the first human cloning experiments in the USA must be a warning to us to call a clear halt to all human cloning today.
The distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning is a semantic ploy.
In both cases, an embryo is produced, declared surplus, destroyed and used as a raw material.
We must therefore come out quite clearly against cloning because the deliberate creation of life for research purposes is a violation of human dignity.
Human beings must never be a means to an end.
Human life is not a consumable commodity.
It must not be reduced to a commodity and the production of human embryos for spare parts is incompatible with human dignity; for us, and we must make that clear today, human dignity clearly takes precedence over research.
Therapeutic cloning paves the way for reproductive cloning and has a bandwagon effect.
We must impose a clear ban on therapeutic cloning, otherwise there will be no way of stopping the risk of escalation in the worldwide consumption of embryos.
Embryonic stem cell research also involves the destruction of embryos.
Here, too, the main purpose is therapeutic cloning.
We must, therefore, send a clear signal today that we do not want a society where women become suppliers of eggs and embryos become lucrative merchandise.
Adult stem cell research provides us with a clear alternative to embryonic stem cell research, making therapeutic cloning unnecessary.
When it comes to patenting, too, we must quite clearly expect the Commission to put a clear end to the current situation, where it is unclear what can be patented, and give the Member States clear guidance here, because we must not reinterpret the discovery of human life as an invention.
Human life is not created by third parties.
We, therefore, need a very clear signal.
Europe must not be an ethical minefield.
We need clear ethical boundaries.
We cannot have loopholes in the law and human dignity must clearly be our guiding principle.
