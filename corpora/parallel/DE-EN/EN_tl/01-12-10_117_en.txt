Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by warmly congratulating the rapporteur and Parliament's Conciliation Committee, whose stubbornness has in the end produced a creditable result.
Almost two years of negotiations with the Commission and the Council within the framework of the conciliation procedure have at last enabled us to reach a compromise on regulations on the labelling of compound feedingstuffs.
When this House votes tomorrow on this directive, it can do so, I believe, with its mind very much at ease.
I see this directive as proof that Parliament must in future have a right of co-decision in agricultural matters as well.
As we are all aware, the crucial issues were the open declaration, the positive list and an evaluation report.
Parliament's main concern was to lay down exact regulations on labelling that would provide for compulsory details of both the quantity and quality of ingredients.
Even with the Council, which did not originally share this position, a compromise text could eventually be agreed on, according to which the ingredients must now be stated by percentage of weight with a margin for error and according to which farmers must be given the exact percentages if they request them.
This binding statement of permissible ingredients is the only guarantee that consumers can in future have greater confidence in farmers' products, and we farmers know how much we need consumers' approval and trust.
The positive list to be produced by the end of 2002 should make that possible.
On the positive side, I would like to make the additional observation that Parliament must also be involved in any future amendments to the directive.
