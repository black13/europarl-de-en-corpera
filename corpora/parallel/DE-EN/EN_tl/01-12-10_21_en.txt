Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barón Crespo's comments demand a response.
On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say that we expect that the Italian government, in which we have the greatest confidence, will help to ensure that we can finally reach an agreement.
We regard the fight against terrorism as a priority, and this is an issue on which there should not be any differences between the party-political families.
However, Mr Barón Crespo, I also believe this not an issue that should be the subject of party-political controversy, and we also know - please listen to what I am saying, I am trying to be very objective - that no result has been achieved on the party statute.
You also know that it was not those of my own political persuasion who contributed to this failure.
I would ask you, just as you are critical in other cases, to be critical of your own party when results are not forthcoming, as in the case of the party statute.
Your credibility would be greater if you applied the same yardsticks right across the political spectrum.
(Applause from the right)
