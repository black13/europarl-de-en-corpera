Madam President, I think it is pretty rich to compare the European arrest warrant with a party statute.
However, there are, of course, parties - particularly in Germany - where there is a close link between arrest warrants and their party statute.
(Applause and laughter) I would just like to say one thing to Mr Lisi: the entire 'Forza Italia' delegation has, at all the hearings on the Commission's proposals that have taken place in this House up to now, agreed to all the European Parliament's opinions.
So I wonder why the Italian Prime Minister, who comes from the same party as Mr Lisi - who incidentally approved all this himself - is now instructing his Minister for the Interior to veto offences which we all agreed should be prosecuted at European level.
I wonder if this could possibly have something to do with party politics, but not the issue that Mr Bar√≥n Crespo has rightly raised here.
