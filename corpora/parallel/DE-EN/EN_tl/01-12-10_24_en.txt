Madam President, Mr Poettering, you just mentioned the European party statute in connection with the European arrest warrant.
The only real connection is that they are both things we consider to be desirable.
However, I do not quite understand your criticism of my group.
You were talking as if it was my group's fault that nothing has happened so far.
As I understand it, the situation was rather different.
There were governments that wanted parties existing in only two countries to be granted this status.
Surely that cannot be so, the European party statute cannot be a way of providing back-door finance to national or regional parties.
I just wanted to establish that point so that no false impressions arise or misleading discussions take place.
