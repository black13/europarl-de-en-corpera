Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about the European Food Safety Authority today, there is one thing in particular that we need to say to the citizens of the European Union.
That is that we are convinced even now, without this Food Safety Authority, that the food people in the European Union are consuming is safe.
So safe, that I am convinced that it is among the safest in the world.
However, if we believe that a food safety authority would have advantages and lead to improvements in the European Union, there must be good reasons for that.
I would like to name three conditions that I believe need to be met to achieve such improvements.
Mr Bowis and Mr Whitehead have already touched on these points.
The first is the quality of the experts.
It is not acceptable for people the Member States want to get rid of to be sent to this authority as experts and scientists.
It is your job, Commissioner, to invite the Member States to send only the cream of the cream.
Secondly, to secure improvements we need transparency and openness.
Even more than the scientific committees, which have had a high degree of transparency since the BSE crisis, the Authority needs to ensure that it earns the people's trust.
That means that it must be open and transparent in its activities.
Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Byrne, we need controls.
It is also your job, the Commission's job, to convey to the Member States that supervision and control are the most basic tasks of the Member States, something you have criminally neglected in recent years.
If we want to carry on guaranteeing safe food, and perhaps even safer food, if we want to win back the people's trust, then we can only do this by meeting these conditions and by tightening up controls.
If we do that, the new Food Safety Authority will be a step forward for the European Union.
I call on you, Commissioner, to make sure that is the case.
