Mr President, I would particularly like to join in thanking the Commission, the Council and all those Members involved.
Thanks to their commitment, they have achieved considerable progress in the EU's telecommunications market.
However, in contrast to what the word suggests, the term telecommunications market represents something that has not been dealt with properly, particularly in the Council common position we have before us.
What I have in mind is digital television.
I very much welcome the fact that not only the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, whose views I am conveying here, but also the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have unanimously indicated that it is simply not enough for us just to talk about attempting to avoid the danger of a digital divide in the European Union.
I am not talking about access for people with disabilities, an area in which I think significant progress has been made.
I am talking about the principle of digital access for all, and also about the interoperability of equipment, application interfaces and services.
I very much I regret this, whilst praising the Belgian Presidency for everything else it has achieved, but this is the drawback of this outcome: the course is now being set for equal access via a common standard for digital television, and we naturally need to strike a balance between developing the market and public interest obligations, and these two points of view have been taken into account by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in their opinions.
That is why I am urgently appealing to the Council, in view of this need to take cultural considerations into account, to ensure equal access for all.
I call on you to improve this part of the text, and we will then all be able to give it our unqualified support.
