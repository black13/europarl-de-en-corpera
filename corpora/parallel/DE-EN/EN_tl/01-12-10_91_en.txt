Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this package is actually one of the things that are absolutely crucial to the Council Presidency, and I would like to congratulate them on the commitment they have demonstrated.
We need sensible compromises, and we need them in quick order.
This is a very fast-moving market, and so we need fast decision-making processes that produce binding rulings and, above all, more legal security as well.
It is on that basis that there will be long-term investment, which is what we need in the current economic climate.
Let me just remind you that there are, at present, eighty cases pending in Austria alone, of which only two were decided by the Supreme Court.
This can hardly be the way into the future.
As I see it, the authorisation directive is about harmonisation being a very positive thing, but also at the same time about the need to guarantee rights of access.
It must be possible for the authorities to be helpful in implementing these rights if one is paying for it.
In the access directive, the open interface is of particular importance.
The independence of the alternative operators, and especially of the interface, is something that we should not underestimate in the future.
The possibility of future dynamic development in this area is of the utmost importance to small and medium-sized enterprises.
As regards universal service, we need clear definitions of universal service provisions, especially with respect to what has to be financed by the operator and what by the State; and finance by the State raises the question of whether there is to be a public invitation to tender.
I believe that these liberalisation measures are of quite particular importance to the public - in both the internal and domestic markets.
I cannot actually explain to my constituents the difference between a telephone call from Kehl to Strasbourg and one from Strasbourg to Paris.
Here, I believe, there is a lot more work for us to do.
