Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whenever a debate draws to its close and as important a package as this one on telecommunications is adopted, one should be, indeed must be, permitted to look into the future.
In this instance there are a number of questions that present themselves at the same time.
Is the Commission already able to assess how much the market will now change - not only in the direction of more competition?
What effects can we expect to see on jobs?
Can you, on the basis of the package about to be adopted, already estimate whether the digital divide really will be reduced?
Would what is currently going on not be an ideal opportunity to actually put transparency into practice, both as regards costs and at the consumer end?
We are indeed currently finding that the new directives mean that we will have to deal with a flood of confusing information about telecommunications charges, and transparency should surely be at least as important in economics as in politics.
