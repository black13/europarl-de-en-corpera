Mr President, what I have to say is addressed particularly to Mrs Schreyer, the Commissioner.
A fortnight ago, you described me as a champion of the European State Financial Prosecutor.
I take that as a title of honour and might perhaps apply the term to you yourself, as we have now of course achieved what we wanted at the beginning of the nineties - a Green Paper and consequent Treaty amendment.
I believe, though, that the timetable has to be tightened up a bit, as what you have said indicates that such a State Prosecutor will be in place only in 2006 or 2007.
So, we are on your side, but, as we want to speed the process up, I would like to ask you to find the time to enable us to achieve the objective, and, with all the subsidiarity, please see to it that the process is not ponderous, slow or inefficient.
That is important; it will enable us to really move ahead with setting up the State Prosecutor.
The citizens out there demand it, and we are doing something for Europe if we make it clear that it is Europe's money that we are protecting.
