Mr President, I would like to pick out a few points.
Firstly, it is a fact that you, Mrs Theato, were the originator of this idea and have been pursuing it for a long time.
I believe that we are now at a stage when, as the Nice Summit showed, it really is important to be precise.
The question at issue was what exactly this meant, which is often taken as an excuse to say that the whole idea will have to wait.
The timetable looks more or less like this: the consultation will run until June 2002.
While a new treaty amendment is launched for the next Intergovernmental Conference, proposals for secondary legislation - that is, on functioning and on such issues as the admissibility of evidence - will be drafted at the same time.
The time available will be used for both purposes, so that we can as soon as possible not only give form to the idea, but also make the institution a practical reality.
