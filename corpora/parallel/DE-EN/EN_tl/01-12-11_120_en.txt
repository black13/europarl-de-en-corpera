Mr President, the Commission had indeed submitted a proposal to amend the Treaty to the Nice Intergovernmental Conference, and if that proposal had been successful, it could be said that the legal basis would have been created as soon as the Treaty of Nice was ratified.
The Council decided otherwise, and this proposal was not even put on the table for the negotiations.
Now we must in fact wait for the next IGC to carry out an amendment of the Treaty that will make the creation of the European Public Prosecutor possible, but, as I was saying, we will be making good use of this time and not just waiting; we will be using the time for consultation to find out the best possible model, and will then be discussing functioning, organisation, status, evidence gained from questioning, periods of limitation, in short, all the things that of course have to be cleared up.
I work on the assumption that we will be having very intensive and practical debates in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the issues that have been raised.
