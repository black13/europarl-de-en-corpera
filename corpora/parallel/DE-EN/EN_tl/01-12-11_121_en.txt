Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to address the timetable issue, and do so from the same angle as did the previous speaker.
I do not think, Commissioner, that you can in fact afford to wait until 2006.
You cannot do so in view of the revelation of two billion euros' worth of fraud and irregularities, and in view of the challenges, some of them financial, with which eastward enlargement is going to face both you and us.
I do think that speed really is of the essence here, and, indeed, you must not wait.
You know that as well as we do, you know our report and you know about the proposals that have been made, which have stated that you are well able to tackle an initial, introductory stage without amending the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Both the Council of Experts, which made proposals in 1999 towards reform of the Commission, and also the latest annual report of the committee overseeing OLAF have mapped out these two stages for you.
In view of this pressure, which really is needed, I ask you: why do you still hesitate?
Why are you again putting it off, until 2006?
Why are you so hesitant, why do you not take the plunge, as we urged, most recently in the BÃ¶sch report?
