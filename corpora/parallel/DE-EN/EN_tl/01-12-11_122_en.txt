Mr President, Mrs Stauner, it is not within the Commission's competence to appoint a Public Prosecutor, who can then carry out law enforcement in the Member States and bring charges in them.
That is not the case; rather, the European Union is founded on the Member States' agreement to cede competences to the European level.
The Member States have not as yet ceded the competence to establish a European Public Prosecutor.
The foundation for such a law enforcement competence must first be laid at the European level, in other words, a Treaty amendment is needed to do it, and an effective instrument needs to be created, one that can actually deal with cross-frontier crime in all the Member States efficiently, not only carrying out investigations, but also bringing charges that result in prosecution and, finally, punishment.
It is that procedure that we must apply.
You may well now say that you wish the European Union were different, but I must tell you that the Commission is the guardian of the treaties, and what we propose must therefore take due account of the competences.
This proposal really does, in my view, promise much for the future, and I hope that we can use it to convince even the sceptics.
