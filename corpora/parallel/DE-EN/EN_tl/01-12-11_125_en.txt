Mr President, we are dealing here with a relationship of complementarity similar to that with Eurojust, which I have described.
The European Public Prosecutor proposed here has to do with the protection of Community interests in the financial sphere, whereas Eurojust deals with other types of serious crime.
Of course there has to be a link here, for data exchange among other things, but always from the data protection angle.
We must look at it in a complementary way.
Secondly, the Public Prosecutor's appointment would involve various procedures.
On the one hand, a procedure must be devised for the appointment of the European Public Prosecutor, who would, as it were, represent all public prosecutors.
The national European Public Prosecutors or the Delegates want a decentralised structure and would then be appointed under the relevant law of the Member State.
I do not believe that Mr Heaton-Harris wants to protect fraudsters; rather, this is about what steps have to be taken for protection to be efficient.
I will say again that we have a Community Budget, we have Community finances and we have a common internal market, and to that degree we no longer have borders in the legal sphere, but we do still have seventeen different legal systems, as the United Kingdom has three different legal systems.
These, then, are real obstacles, which leads to the possibility of real defects in law enforcement, defects that we should overcome.
