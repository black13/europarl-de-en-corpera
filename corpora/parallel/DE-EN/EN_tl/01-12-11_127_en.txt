Mr Mulder, there are of course various possibilities for that as well.
One is that OLAF would continue in its present function of carrying out investigations under administrative law, in which case provision would of course have to be made for OLAF to present its results to the same Public Prosecutor, who would make use of the intelligence thus gathered.
Another possibility would be for OLAF to itself take over enquiries rather than being limited to an examining role.
We consciously refrained from giving that a prominent position in the current debate, but then it would have been said afterwards that we wanted to give OLAF a specific role.
This is, as it were, an issue that has to be worked out once we have the 'big picture' .
I can only reiterate that we are not now dealing with competing conceptions, but with a White Paper in the drafting of which OLAF played a part.
OLAF is always facing the difficulty of its having gathered evidence or intelligence and then having to wait to see whether a national state prosecutor's office will accept this material and work with it.
If we had a European Financial Public Prosecutor, it would be a really positive step forward for OLAF's work.
