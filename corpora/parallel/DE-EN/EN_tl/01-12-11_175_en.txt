Mr President, I do not want to rephrase my question, but to put a supplementary one.
Commissioner, if everything was the way you describe it and Doha really was better than Seattle, how, then, do you explain the numerous complaints by NGOs that they were disadvantaged in the run-up to the event, that they could not get visas issued to them and that they were deterred from active involvement by bureaucratic obstacles being put in their way or by being told that there were too few hotel beds?
Secondly, you have just described the narrow field of vision experienced by the European delegation, and how our delegation was composed.
That was not, however, what my question was about; I was asking, rather, about the extent to which civil society could consider itself represented there, my point being that the situation was quite different from that in a country in which there is the freedom to demonstrate and the corresponding possibility of self-expression.
If though, you do not see things that way, I would very much like you to confirm that a second time.
