Mr President, Commissioner, let me first congratulate you on your success in the Doha negotiations.
I believe that the European delegation, to which I belonged, did very well to bring the negotiations to their conclusion.
We stand a good chance of completing this round successfully.
Our hosts in Doha also looked after us extremely well, something which I think was a fundamental requirement.
What Mr Hans-Peter Martin is referring to, though, is the dialogue with the NGOs, a point I would like to probe further with reference to the Parliamentary Assembly.
I do not believe it is feasible for this discussion to be carried on every couple of years and at the same location.
Do you not think too that it would make more sense for parliamentarians from the various countries to be able to get together over a period of time and jointly to work through this subject, which is so crucial for the future, in a professional and detailed way?
