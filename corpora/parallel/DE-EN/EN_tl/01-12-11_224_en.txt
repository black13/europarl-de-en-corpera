Madam President, Commissioners, I will avoid polite flowery phrases, for you cannot talk up the outcome of Doha in such a way as to paper over the absence of any social component in world trade - at least from the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
It is not only that that is regrettable; we must not overlook the minimal acceptance of environmental and food safety, and the failure to accept the demand for clarification of the precautionary principle.
Now, though, to my main criticism.
The EU often happily talks about the social dimension as a part of our European philosophy, but all it has achieved as regards the issue of core labour standards as human rights in the workplace has been to return them to the position discussions had reached at the 1996 Singapore Conference, that is, they have been put on ice.
What has become of our social responsibility?
Perhaps this next observation will not be lacking in interest.
I basically welcome the fact that China has joined and that, hopefully, other countries will do so as well, but I doubt that it will become any easier to achieve basic human rights standards at work.
So the beginnings of an opportunity have certainly just passed us by.
I warn against taking conflict prevention too lightly.
If sensible steps are not taken to monitor it, globalisation will spark further demonstrations and more social conflict.
As Mr Mann has already pointed out, Seattle is not a thing of the past.
It can be resurrected, and we, in the safe haven of the European Parliament, should not banish that thought from our minds.
Commissioner Lamy, what are you thinking of doing in future to ensure that core labour standards are not only insisted on by the toothless ILO?
How can you help us, after what has happened at the WTO, to make a new start and move things forward?
