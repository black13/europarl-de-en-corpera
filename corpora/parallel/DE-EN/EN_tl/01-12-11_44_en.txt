Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly rather unusual to comment on a report that has already been voted upon.
Nevertheless, I am happy to make it clear, to avoid any possible doubt, what the Commission's position is on the report that has already been adopted.
Quite apart from the excellent work done on the preparation of this report, we are all agreed that by the end of the year the Council needs to reach a decision on amounts of subsidy and on the budgetary stabiliser, to ensure the necessary degree of certainty.
I support the substance of the proposed amendments to the compromise.
Firstly, I accept the possibility of being able to introduce compensation between the Member States as regards guaranteed quantities in the context of the Community maximum guaranteed quantity.
Secondly, I am in favour of an implementing system which makes it possible to give niche products from small producers a sufficient degree of flexibility.
Thirdly, in view of the results of an in-depth study of the functioning of this market organisation and of the supply of the common market with various types of seed, the Commission will submit appropriate proposals to the Council and Parliament under Article 37, which will include a reference to the setting of the maximum guaranteed quantity.
We will do this in good time to provide a basis for the successor system.
Furthermore, with reference to the way in which the budgetary stabiliser is applied, Parliament's proposal to reduce the amount of subsidy in the year after which the maximum guaranteed quantity is exceeded has a number of advantages and we shall therefore carefully examine this proposal.
