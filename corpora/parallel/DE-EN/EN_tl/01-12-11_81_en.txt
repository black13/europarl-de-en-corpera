Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to make a number of basic points with regard to the agencies.
The decision to deal with the agencies on an individual basis was an important one.
I have very carefully read through the amendments proposed by the specialised committees, and to those of you who sit on them I would therefore like to send out a signal.
I ask you, firstly, to take a close look at the agencies with a view to seeing whether or not they work well, and then read the report of the Court of Auditors.
Something else, too, about the new agencies.
I think policy is tending in the direction of creating even more agencies, something, which also appears to be the Commission's strategy.
In general terms, this is not to be rejected out of hand, but it becomes objectionable when it comes to finance, as the Commission does not include their funds in the calculations.
So if, in future, the Commission or the agencies, as the case may be, come wanting more resources, then heading 3 will not be able to take the strain.
