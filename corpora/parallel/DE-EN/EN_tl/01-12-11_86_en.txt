Mr President the reform of the common fisheries policy on 1 January 2003 will change this important economic sector for the better.
Of that I am convinced.
It was for that reason that the committee did not want to bring in any new Budget lines at the present time, with the exception of the flexibility reserve because of the Morocco disaster, which has been a heavy blow for the fisheries sector and raised many issues.
We did, though, seek a few small changes.
A: on food safety, especially with regard to genetic engineering, where there is an urgent need for scientific underpinning.
B: on the monitoring of fishing activity.
We need rigid controls and, perhaps, financial sanctions to deal with the black sheep.
C: genuinely to include the sector in discussions and in the legislative measures in accordance with the bottom-up principle.
Dialogue must be put on a formal basis.
To sum up: We thank the Commissioners and in particular Mr Costa Neves for their constructive and wise collaboration.
The Committee on Fisheries felt itself to be in good hands.
We wish to maintain fisheries for our benefit and for the benefit of the generations that will come after us.
I seem to have another minute to go, so I would like to touch on another subject.
I refer to Mr Turchi and Mr Prodi's statements about Galileo this morning.
I appeal to all of you not to block the road to further development.
Mr Dover, the amendments proposed to Mr Turchi's report on TEN 1999, above all by our British colleagues, should be rejected.
The justification for them is false, as the enterprises had, in a 'Memorandum of understanding' , taken a positive line on their financial participation as early as the beginning of 2001, without the political will having been present at that time.
Mr Dover, please think of the many jobs involved, as Mr Prodi has done.
