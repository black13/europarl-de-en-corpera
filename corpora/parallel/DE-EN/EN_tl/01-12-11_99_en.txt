Mr President, from Brussels' point of view, the budget for 2002 is coherent and comprehensive, despite the criticisms made by the European Court of Auditors, which I have been examining with great interest.
The Berlin decisions still offer some scope, particularly since there is apparently no need to maintain the levy on the Member States at its present level.
In the implementation of the budget for 2002, I expect the structural support funds for the development of rural areas to be spent in full and all surplus revenue to be reduced to zero before or during the year 2006 if possible, by ensuring that eligible projects are realised within the shortest possible time frame.
In response to another complaint that I hear time and again, I also expect guarantees that enough flexibility will be shown for projects to be replaced if necessary.
At the same time, I expect the Commission to reconsider carefully whether the intended lowering of the support rates for major investments in the least affluent areas is necessary and warranted.
