Mr President, I would like it noted as a matter of urgency that the case of Dr. Ganzert, an attorney from Wels, has been dismissed.
He is at present being held without good cause by the authorities in Nicaragua and has for three weeks been endeavouring to get permission to leave the country.
I wish, though, to thank you, Madam President, for writing to the authorities in Nicaragua and asking for him to be given an exit visa.
