Mr President, Mr Tajani, who has just spoken, makes me very glad that I have a minute less in which to speak, and that is the least I can offer, for what is a mere minute against Mr Berlusconi?.
After an intervention like that, I am glad Mr Schulz got a minute from me and was able to speak for longer.
Now, though, I really do want to deal with different subject matter, one that is very, very important to me.
For 16 months we have had an EU-wide problem that we have not yet been able to resolve.
It was terrible for us to have to face what happened at Dover.
Now we have another 13 people found in a lorry in Ireland, eight of them dead, among them two children.
Minister, I ask the Council, the Commission and Mr Vitorino, that in this area, above all, we should, as we must, carefully go over our homework again, in order to bring in the measures that are so urgently needed if we are not to find even more refugees dead.
