Mr President, I would like to clarify just two things.
The first is that, while chairing the sitting, I heard applause, but was not sure that it came from the gallery.
Secondly, when the honourable gentleman spoke up, I told him that he was in the right and also pointed out that I could do nothing about the gallery after the event, but it was made clear that applause is not permitted.
That is what has to be done under the Rules of Procedure.
