Mr President, I am very grateful to Mr Paasilinna, the rapporteur, for addressing his question to the Commission and thereby making a number of things slightly clearer.
I also wish to thank Commissioner Liikanen for the position he has publicly taken, but I would like to add that these reports - of which there are several, the whole package in the last couple of weeks - have put us under enormous pressure and that there have been a lot of misunderstandings because we have not always been able to inform each other of amendments that have been made.
I would like to point out that these misunderstandings have led to my name being used by the Greens to support the content of the compromise motions, although I had signed nothing for them.
Now I find myself back here again.
Pressure of time means, however, that I now agree to them and will not withdraw anything.
I only actually signed two amendments, not the others.
That I had signed the others had evidently been taken as read because of the way I had expressed myself.
This is not an accusation levelled at any individuals, but simply further evidence I wish to adduce to demonstrate what happens when we are under pressure of this sort through wanting to go public with this document towards the end of the year.
I do not want to have to work in this way again on such a thorny problem in the future.
It really is not on!
