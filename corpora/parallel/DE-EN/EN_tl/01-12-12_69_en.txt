Mr President, please permit me to address a question to the Commission before the vote is taken.
The text that the Commission originally submitted for a resolution envisaged the formation of an expert group on radio spectrum policy to continually discuss radio spectrum matters.
The European Parliament was to be involved in these discussions.
Legal and institutional considerations make it impossible to embed the founding of this group in the Frequency Decision, but I would ask the Commission whether they are holding to their original intention and establishing such a group by a Commission decision, that is to say on a voluntary basis.
If so, will Parliament be involved in the work of this Group?
