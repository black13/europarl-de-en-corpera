Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Cluster bombs, as we all know, are one of the most treacherous conventional weapons ever devised by man.
Civilians and aid workers fall victim to these bombs years after the conflict has ended.
The peace process often grinds to a halt because unexploded bomblets close off whole areas.
Refugees cannot return, because the area is no longer inhabitable.
These are the reasons why our group agrees with the statement made by the President of our Parliament and condemns outright the use of cluster bombs by the US army in Afghanistan.
This bombardment will set the peace process and economic development in Afghanistan back years.
I think it is irresponsible to continue this bombardment and I call on the USA to put a stop to it at long last.
I also call from this platform on all countries, especially those who have signed the UN Convention on Conventional Weapons, to apply an immediate moratorium at their next conference and pronounce a definitive ban on the use, production and supply of these weapons.
And I call on the Commission and the Council in its negotiations with the USA to urge them to subscribe to a ban on cluster bombs.
