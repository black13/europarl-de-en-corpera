Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one international agreement to protect the victims of international armed conflicts states that it is forbidden to use weapons, projectiles or materials and methods of war which may inflict unnecessary injury or suffering.
So much for the theory.
In practice, things are very different.
Unfortunately, there are malicious people in today's world who are unscrupulous in their decision to use force and who are unscrupulous as to which weapons they use.
But there are also people who have good reason - in order to limit and prevent force and terror - for having recourse to weapons, who have to have recourse to weapons on grounds which are perfectly in keeping with human rights.
Our call is to these people.
If you have to have recourse to weapons, even with good intentions, then those weapons should not, as this text states, be weapons which inflict unnecessary or avoidable injury and unnecessary suffering.
In this respect, there is indeed a connection with our lasting and extremely - not completely but extremely - successful fight against landmines, which are weapons in all but name.
I think that we should state our views in no uncertain terms in this case too.
Perhaps there are technical features which can be incorporated in order to prevent this sort of injury and unnecessary suffering.
But at least until there are, there must be a moratorium and that is what we are saying today.
We are sorry that these weapons are being used, including in Afghanistan.
But what is more important is for us to look to the future and for the European Union to come out quite clearly and unequivocally in favour of a moratorium in order - I repeat - to prevent avoidable injury and unnecessary suffering.
Europe must support such a moratorium unequivocally.
