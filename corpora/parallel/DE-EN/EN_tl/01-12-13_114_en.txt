Mr President, the international Afghanistan conference at Petersberg in Bonn led to excellent results last Wednesday.
The 29-strong transitional government will include two women.
This is a fundamentally important message and a first step towards social recognition.
With the end of the Taliban's reign of terror and its mediaeval regime in sight, the brutal suppression of women's rights will also come to an end.
They have been the main ones to suffer under the caste of self-appointed warriors of God.
They have been denied an education, training, career and the right to any say-so whatsoever.
They were banned from public life.
The painful result: only 5% of women and girls can read or write.
From now on, women will acquire equal opportunities in access to jobs, medical care and the right to vote on a par with men.
In Parliament and the government they need seats and a voice.
I am convinced that they will succeed in building up their own organisations so that they too can influence the economic and social decision-making processes.
They will be unstoppable in finding their new identity, but they need staying power and our support.
I hope that the women whom we honoured on 8 March 1998 in our campaign "A flower for Kabul" will be able to return to their professions as doctors, teachers, professors and managers.
On behalf of the PPE and as a member of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I support the proposal to make the 8 March next year Afghan Women's Day.
The European Union has supported Afghanistan alone to the tune of EUR 400 million over the last 10 years.
In future, we must invest more in programmes and projects for women.
As far as reconstruction is concerned, we call on Afghanistan's neighbours to take an active part in this process.
