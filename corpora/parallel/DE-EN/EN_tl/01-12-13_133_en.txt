Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, West Africa is in the process of structuring its cooperation in the form of a common market.
It is creating common regional, economic and political structures.
If everything goes according to plan, we shall be able to talk and hold discussions with parliamentarians from the new West African regional assembly of the regional parliament at next year's ACP assembly.
We shall be able to organise our practical cooperation.
But there are a few serious constraints, one of the most serious being the authoritarian regime of President Eyadéma in Togo.
We are calling for the immediate release and restoration of the democratic rights of Yawowi Agboyibo, who was arbitrarily arrested and is now serving a six-month sentence which he has done nothing to deserve.
Having served over five months of his sentence, the president should release him without further ado.
We are not calling for a pardon.
He did nothing wrong, he merely highlighted abuse in the system and he should be released from prison as quickly as possible.
We are devastated that the attempt by our President, Nicole Fontaine, to meet President Eyadéma in Paris last week and ask him, as a favour, to arrange for this release, proved fruitless.
Eyadéma is playing cat and mouse with us.
We can no longer allow provision to be made for more development aid here.
We support the Commission in suspending development aid.
But we hope that we shall soon be able to provide further humanitarian aid for the people of Togo and we also hope that democratisation will continue next year, despite all the obstacles, and that it will be possible to hold parliamentary elections and then presidential elections a year later.
We call on Eyadéma to put an end to this farce once and for all.
