Mr President, I have the floor for one minute.
As you are the vice-president responsible for reforming Parliament's work, I shall try and give you an example of what one can sensibly say in one minute.
All the groups are agreed.
A famous Bavarian cabaret artist once said after visiting the Bavarian regional parliament, that now he knew what parliamentarianism was: 'Everything has already been said, but not yet by everybody' .
Which is why I do not intend to repeat what all the previous speakers have rightly and quite correctly said.
All I wish to say is that I endorse the statements made by the previous speakers.
They are right, it is an outrage that Mrs Sana and Mrs Zana and Mrs Suu Kyi cannot come and collect their prizes from us.
That they are still being kept in unlawful detention, including by a country with aspirations to membership of the European Union, is unacceptable.
Thank you for listening.
