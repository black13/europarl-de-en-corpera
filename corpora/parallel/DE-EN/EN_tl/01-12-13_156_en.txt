Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is rather strange not to have the rapporteur here but I should like to congratulate him, nonetheless, because the PSE supports his report and will accept it as it stands.
We also support the Commission communication, although we take the view that listing current obstacles and postponing legislative proposals is not good enough.
We hope that the relevant proposals and an efficient action plan will be submitted to us at the spring summit.
One criticism we have is that the skills shortages proposed or, rather, identified in the high-tech sector are of course not good enough.
As Socialists, we want to give all employees the chance to benefit from mobility and to increase mobility on the European labour markets.
But we have to offer them these chances.
The new labour market should not be open just to small, special groups; it must be open to every employee in Europe.
Hence we need creative ideas and solutions from the Commission, not just a list of the problems.
We also need a detailed investigation of possible malfunctions on the labour market in border regions or in specific sectors, such as the building and transport industries.
Last but not least, we also need an analysis and a debate of the results of the school system in Europe because, unfortunately, not every country in Europe has done as well as it should.
