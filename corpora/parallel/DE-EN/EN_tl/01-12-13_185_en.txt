Mr President, I should like to put another oral amendment to the vote, which needs to be voted on first.
Recital C in the German version reads: "Whereas 14 million Union citizens regularly use a regional or lesser-used language and whereas there are more than 60 linguistic communities in Europe."
This should read "in the Union", not "in Europe".
In Europe there are about 300.
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution) President.
That concludes the vote.
