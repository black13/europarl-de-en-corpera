Madam President, rather than urging Iran to adopt a constructive attitude, I propose that we revise the text so that it reads as follows:
Urges all coastal countries to adopt a constructive attitude as regards the delimitation...'.
We have assured neutral experts that no one party to this border conflict or in this region can be specifically accused of obstruction and that they should all be urged to adopt a constructive attitude as regards the delimitation of boundaries in the Caspian.
