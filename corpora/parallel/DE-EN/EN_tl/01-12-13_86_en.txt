Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity, as Mr Fischler is still here but will surely not be able to stay for this evening's vote, to say that I am somewhat disappointed.
You cannot say that these paltry funds of between EUR 10 and 14 million - granted, we shall get a bit more next year - are satisfactory because 80% are being taken up.
I realise that we are making demands on the Member States and that a bit more will be done within the existing legal framework, but we also want a more flexible approach than is possible at present.
But I must say that I really am appalled to hear that not one representative in the Council - i.e. not one Member State - had any objection whatsoever; do they really think we need do nothing at all?
I think it is quite something that the Member States apparently feel no need to react to what the European Parliament has to say about your report.
But we and the beekeepers shall make sure that the Member States at least acknowledge what we have to say about the report, just in case they think there is no need to act.
As you know, we have not called for any all-powerful order, but we still take the view that we need direct aid regulations in the medium term.
You say they are not warranted at the present time.
You have heard the beekeepers, they take quite a different view and you must be fully aware of what is happening in this sector.
We shall also ensure that beekeepers are better informed about the facilities available under structural policy and measures to promote agricultural produce, but here too we have very limited funds for numerous quality products.
Mr President, I just wanted to say this to Mr Fischler because I already know what he has told us.
I had hoped for something more, rather than being hung out to dry!
