Mr President, I do not want to prolong the debate unnecessarily.
I would, however like to say that I am the deputy chairman of this committee and I was treated in exactly the same manner.
It is a sorry state of affairs when a deputy chairman is not even given proper notice of an extraordinary meeting.
This sort of treatment is quite simply unacceptable.
