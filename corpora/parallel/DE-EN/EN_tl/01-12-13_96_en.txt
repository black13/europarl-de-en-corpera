Mr President, this is the sixth and most sharply worded motion since the crisis broke in Zimbabwe.
We have the Council to thank for finally getting Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement moving since the last resolution.
We hope that contacts with Zimbabwe in this context will bear fruit, although we do not really expect this man to show the slightest interest in our measures.
On the contrary, he will get his own party to elect him as a presidential candidate in Victoria Falls this weekend and he is already preparing to make a farce of these elections.
For a start, he is now demanding proof of residency as well as identity cards as proof of electoral status.
A great many people find it very hard to provide such proof.
And now he wants to hold the elections in constituencies, rather than as nationwide elections throughout the country.
People who are not registered in the large towns where they work will have to travel home.
Most will not be able to afford to do so.
The aim is to ensure that as many people as possible are excluded de facto from the elections, because he knows that this will stop the majority of his opponents from voting.
There are 200 000 people currently starving in the Masningo province because Governor Hungwe has stopped food from being distributed by NGOs.
The Governor has demanded that the food be delivered to him first so that he can arrange for it to be distributed.
Then, of course, he will only feed his own people.
We must not let this man get away with it.
We must ensure that we take targeted measures to stop Mr Mugabe in time, and I call on us all to do so.
