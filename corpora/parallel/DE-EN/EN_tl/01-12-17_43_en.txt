Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even considered rather dispassionately, it is possible that the Laeken Summit will one day appear to be a waypoint at which the Europeans stopped stumbling along, found their feet again and set out to find a way out of the blind alley of Nice.
If this proves to be the case - we are just at the beginning of this process - then this would certainly be associated with the Belgian Presidency and your name, Mr Verhofstadt, and I am quite happy to congratulate you on this now in advance, just in case!
There are two reasons for this development, and it is useful to run over them once more.
What caused this to happen?
Certainly the strong, even damning, criticism of the outcome of Nice was a factor.
The European Parliament played a vital role here; this House was the source of the vast majority of the criticism directed towards Nice, although we recognise and acknowledge the fact that the formal conditions for enlargement were agreed on there.
My second point is that the events of 11 September and everything which happened in their wake have made it more than clear that Europe will only be taken seriously in the future if it acts as a community and that we need to get back on track and work towards developing as a community.
These are the two reasons.
Now we have the Convention which we wanted, and we are therefore also responsible for what emerges from it.
We must not overlook this.
The outcome of the Convention will only carry political weight if it is supported by as broad a consensus as possible.
That is why we need to make our contribution in the Convention to producing a draft treaty which has broad support.
Only then will it afterwards stand a chance of also uniting the Intergovernmental Conference.
