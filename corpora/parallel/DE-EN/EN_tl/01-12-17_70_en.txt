Mr President, Laeken has opened the door to the development of a draft constitution on the basis of the Community method.
The mandate is right for it, the procedure is suited to it, and whether something of the sort is achieved or not is up to the Convention itself.
Nor can I join in the criticism levelled at the composition of the praesidium, believing as I do that the people at the top will no longer be in thrall to anyone, but will have only their own conceptions of the Europe of the future.
This represents a great opportunity.
We should not find fault with a person's age if that is a sign of an independence that can contribute much to the matter in hand.
Apart from this, I think it extraordinarily important that the right technical conditions be achieved in this matter.
It is of the essence that the secretariat is appointed by the Council, but with the possibility of consulting the Commission and Parliament.
I believe it would be generous on the part of the Council to offer the Commission and Parliament truly balanced and equal representation on the secretariat in order to achieve the right working conditions on that basis.
The technical aspects at the outset are sometimes decisive as regards the content resulting at the end.
Of all enterprises, the European Council is surely the one most in need of reform, and it is making a start by concentrating on great matters such as the creation of the European Convention, in which it has been successful.
If, though, it loses itself in detail through the General Affairs Council or Councils of Ministers not getting things straight, it makes itself look ridiculous.
We again saw this, for example, over the issue of the agencies.
So we can only recommend to future Presidencies of the Council that the precondition for success on the really big issues is that they should not deal with every triviality at a sitting of the European Council.
