Mr President, the words 'entrepreneur' or 'employer' occur only once in the Laeken final conclusions, and that in connection with the protection of workers when an employer becomes insolvent.
I believe we have missed an opportunity here.
At the European level, we are engaged in turning the internal market into a domestic market, and Europe is home, after all, to 18 million small and medium-sized enterprises.
I am the President of the European SME-Union, and it is therefore a matter of concern to me that I should point out over and over again that our primary goals should include the safeguarding of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.
At the end of the day, it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that provide two-thirds of all jobs, pay 80% of all taxes and train 85% of young workers.
My second point takes us away from internal affairs to the international arena.
How do we envisage the European Union's future representation in international organisations?
In Parliament, we have now decided on this Committee on NATO.
How are we to proceed in matters affecting the World Trade Organisation?
There are many other areas; how does Europe intend to take a leadership role in the future?
The third point that concerns me is in fact the Council's secretariat.
I believe we should set up a body composed of the best minds in the secretariat as well.
It should be possible for the European Council, the European Parliament and the Commission to be equally represented on it.
Our objective should be for the ideas produced by the best minds to eventually bring us a result at which the citizens of Europe will rejoice.
