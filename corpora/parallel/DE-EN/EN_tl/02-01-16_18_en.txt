Mr President, I would like to point out, in addition to this, that we want to submit a second report.
We hope that the Commission is also of the opinion that there should be a compromise with the position taken by Parliament, whose Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well known to have voted the first proposal down, but which is now prepared to draw up a new proposal in the Katiforis report, one which we are keen to present to the whole House in February.
In February, the Council of Finance Ministers will still have enough time to come to a decision about it.
Accordingly, I have also written to the Spanish Presidency of the Council on the Committee's behalf, and have also informed the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rato of it during last week's meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
That being so, I do not think that the request for urgent procedure should be agreed to.
