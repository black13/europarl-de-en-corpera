Mr President, Commissioner, Galileo Galilei's words, 'and yet it does move' can be applied to European space policy's present situation.
I have my doubts, though, when I see the downright interminable tug-of-war about the establishment of Europe's satellite navigation system, Galileo.
So I am all the more pleased that there are some first positive signs that European space travel is to be given new momentum, something that is urgently necessary if Europe is not to lose its connection to this important and forward-looking high technology sector.
Whether the systems we are working with are for communication, navigation, or observation, satellites play a decisive role.
We should not make the mistake of comfortably relying on the existing systems of other, even friendly, nations.
We should rather be demonstrating our own capabilities in this field, which is the only way that we will have reliable operational freedom and that European industry will have a chance of a healthy future.
I speak from my own experience, having on several occasions been Parliament's rapporteur on the European satellite navigation system.
In Europe, the potential we have in this field is so valuable, that we should not simply leave it unused.
'Tackle it!' must be our watchword.
A political signal is indispensable.
The first stage on this road is the drafting of a coherent strategy for space travel policy, and the Commission has done very good work on this.
I emphatically support the proposed lines of action.
Europe must accord space travel more importance in future.
Let me sum up my priorities for European space travel in a conceptual pairing that may perhaps seem paradoxical: independence and cooperation.
Independence means our own strength, autonomous structures and jobs geared to the future.
Cooperation, on the other hand, represents the strengthening of the EU's relationships through compatibility and exchange.
Space travel should be given new impetus.
