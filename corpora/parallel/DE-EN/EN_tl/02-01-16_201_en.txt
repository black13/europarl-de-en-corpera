Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating you on staying in office.
It is you that we have to thank for your constant reference to religious values in the Convention on Fundamental Rights and for your reclaiming of them.
The phrase 'European values' is often an empty one.
It could, though, be a quite different matter with this report in our hands, because this report means that there is a chance of Europe demonstrating, in a very important area, that we do things differently to the others.
We can make outer space a space for peace.
Then again, that has a great deal to do with principles.
Here we have Amendment No 1, which says: '...which can also include a military application for peace-keeping operations.'
Space for peacekeeping operations - one might polemically say, yes, but against whom?
Against the little men from Mars, who are on their way here, or for the use - as Mr Chichester has hinted - of a military-industrial complex yet to be created in Europe?
That would be devastating.
It would be precisely the dependence on the military-industrial complex that so much characterises the last remaining superpower that we would be inviting in through the back door while still talking of European values.
That would be Pharisaical!
I would very much recommend rejection of Amendment No 1, but the adoption of those following it.
Particularly when Christian and religious values are at issue, values of which you, Mr President, have always rightly reminded us.
