Mr President, I get the impression that there will be speakers only against the urgent procedure, something I consider a very important step.
There is the danger that the Council will decide on its position before Parliament's has been produced.
I consider it a matter of urgent necessity that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs should deliver its opinion first, and that only then should the Council come to a decision.
It is for that reason that we should reject this request for urgent procedure.
