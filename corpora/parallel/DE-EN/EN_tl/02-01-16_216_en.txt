Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a directive on weights in international traffic, which is, of course, not only about weights, but also about dimensions.
This is a typical tactic, to have a heading announcing, actually very tersely, what is meant to be at issue, and then, in the directive in question, to proceed to expand on it as a matter of course.
I have already for some time now been following with a critical mind developments on European buses, because this wealth of detail was actually far from necessary at a European level.
We - and Parliament is at one on this point - are, at the end of the day, fighting for the principle of mutual recognition.
We should then, if at all possible, cause the principle of mutual recognition to prevail in fact.
Let there be harmonisation only where it is really, absolutely necessary.
I wish at this point to commend the directive as an example of how short and precise an overall provision on European buses should be.
What I would really like is for this directive to abrogate all other directives on European buses, thus enabling countries and nations to have buses of a design appropriate to their needs, as, of course, a village bus in Sicily's hot climate has to look different from a bus in London's rush hour or a bus that has to cover great distances in northern Finland.
This is where harmonisation is false, costing a lot of money and calling for unnecessary effort.
This is where the Commission urgently needs to do some thinking about which areas require voluntary self-regulation and which need standards to be laid down.
We have excellent standards committees, but only where they are absolutely necessary do we need framework directives.
