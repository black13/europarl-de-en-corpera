Mr newly-elected President of this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, are we, then, more stupid than our children?
Are we not in a position, in this technological day and age, to press two keys?
We have had the OECD's PISA survey, we have had appraisals, we have a new President, we have paid a lot of money for this system, for which we have had criticism for a long time, and now we want to vote as if this were the Stone Age!
(Loud applause)
