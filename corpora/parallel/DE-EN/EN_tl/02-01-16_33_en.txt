Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am no expert on the Rules of Procedure.
It goes without saying that I am always ready to accept the convictions of others when it comes to procedural issues.
When I hear though, as I do now, our esteemed Chairman of the Socialist group demanding a paper vote and claiming that to be the only correct form of secret ballot, I would like to refer, Mr President, to your initial statement to the effect that an electronic ballot is a secret ballot and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
If we now want to decide whether we are to vote electronically or with ballot papers - and I approach the issue very even-handedly, readily conceding that one can take one view or the other - then you must let us decide by show of hands, a simple Yes or No, on how we are to vote.
That is the only way to resolve this procedural issue.
I would recommend that we now decide in that way, and democratically, how we want to cast our votes.
