Madam President, I do not want there to be any misunderstandings about this.
Commissioner, I am obliged to you for your statement.
I was certainly not aware that you had entrusted this Commission official with the task of producing a conclusive report by 31 August, but I then learned of this, not from the Commission, but from other sources.
Do you, though, not think it a matter of trustful cooperation or proper administrative procedure that you should at least inform the rapporteur when a report completing the evaluation of a particular stage of an action programme is coming out?
It is at Leonardo that new accusations are levelled in this report.
I practically have to assume that you wanted to have your innocence certified by Parliament, and then, when perhaps in about another six months' time, it came out that yet more scandalous things had been going on, it would be easy for you to say: 'Oh please, Parliament sanctioned what we did!'
Please stick to the rules of fair play.
If there is to be a general report, I will not be able tell whether there is perhaps something about Leonardo I in it.
