Mr President, I had not actually intended to speak, but I do of course have something to say whenever the others have something to say.
I would like first to say a few words of thanks to you for the way you dealt with this issue.
As Mr Lehne said, a majority of our group was in favour of legal proceedings, but there were other opinions, such as that of the esteemed Mr Karl von Wogau.
I liked, however, the way you dealt with the issue politically, telephoning the President-in-Office of the Council, the Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar, and, of course, keeping in touch with the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi.
We, of course, have confidence in the Spanish Prime Minister; not only in that role do we trust that he will keep his word and that words will be matched by deeds, but also in his role as President-in-Office of the Council.
I also have something to say to the Commission.
So, Commissioner, please tell the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, that, tomorrow, when we deal with Mr von Wogau's report, with financial services and with everything we associate with 'Lamfalussy' , we expect the Commission to take up a position in defence of Parliament's rights vis-à-vis the Council of Ministers.
That is what we expect tomorrow.
If such a statement is not forthcoming, it will have serious consequences for our relations with the Commission, and so, Mr President, your action will no doubt help the President with his statement tomorrow.
Again, let me extend my express thanks to you for the way you have handled this matter politically.
(Applause)
