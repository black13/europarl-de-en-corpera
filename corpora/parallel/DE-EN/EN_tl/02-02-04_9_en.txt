Mr President, I wish to congratulate you on your decision not to make a reference to the European Court of Justice, as the creation of the European Company was one of the objectives for this parliamentary session, and is one of the five decisions for which the economy has been waiting.
For thirty years, this decision has been awaited; for thirty years, negotiations have been in progress.
To go to the Court of Justice now would mean this business being dragged out for another five or six years; for I am convinced that no firm would avail itself of this important new form under such uncertain conditions.
So I believe it wise in this case to refrain from making a reference to the European Court of Justice.
