Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, one victim of the recent bombings in the Middle East, in which Israeli civilians were targeted, has been the willingness of moderates to form coalitions.
I think one has to distinguish between murdering civilians willy-nilly, pursuing possible terrorists or, on the other hand, setting a 7-day deadline and positively inviting the radicals to promptly wreck the possibilities for dialogue.
Israeli settlement policy, which is to be continued, provides us with examples of this sort of thing, as does the hopeless existence which drives Arab Palestinian refugees to turn themselves into weapons, and the consideration of the idea that they should return to their original homes and thereby put a question mark against the State of Israel's long-term viability.
We also see it in the destruction of infrastructure on Palestinian territory, and that in areas that have nothing to do with counter-terrorism, but - as Commissioner Patten rightly said - destroy prospects for development.
It is for these reasons that we have to make it clear that we, the European Union, have to make a fresh start, and it is perhaps not right that you, Mr Solana, are going there to play for high stakes in a week's time, followed by the American representative the week after.
So we shuttle hither and thither and get nowhere.
Why do you not, for once, go there together in the same week in order to make clear that this is a joint European and American initiative to hammer the point home that we will no longer allow things to go on the way they are.
Both of you must go there together and take funds with you in order simultaneously to give hope and guarantees of security.
We must find a new point of departure, and we will not do it in the ways we have used so far, nor - and this remark I address to Mr Sakellariou and others - by adopting resolutions apportioning guilt in a one-sided way, because then we are destroying the opportunity to be intermediaries.
