Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, the reports you have presented today may not have been positive or optimistic, but they sketched a realistic picture.
I am very glad that, after a short, perhaps terrifying moment, the European Union has clearly demonstrated that it is not willing to sit back and let the Palestinian structures, supported moreover by funds raised by the European Union, be destroyed.
This is not about denying Israel the right to defend itself against terrorism, but about our strongest condemnation and rejection of excessive courses of action that really have nothing to do with counter-terrorism.
I am very pleased that this is what both representatives have done, clearly and unmistakably, and that they have made their position clear without falling prey to emotionalism.
That is important because the pro-peace groupings that are present both in Israel and in Palestine are waiting for Europe's voice to be heard.
I support all the efforts at joint action with the USA, but where this is not possible, we must be an identifiable, and indeed, readily recognisable, European voice.
My second observation, on the Balkans, may well be taken as underlining all of what has been said here.
I would only ask that particular additional attention be given to the situation in Albania, where things are not at present developing very well.
I wish to make it very clear that I cannot see us going down the road towards an association agreement with Albania if Albania does not concern itself with the country's stabilisation.
What has happened in the past weeks is, alas, no contribution to stability.
We want stability in the Balkans, we have done much, and with great effort, to achieve it, and let no power in the Balkans cause this stability to collapse again.
I would therefore ask you both to follow events in Albania, in particular, very closely, and represent our positions there with a great deal of clarity.
