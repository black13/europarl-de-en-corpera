Mr President, Commissioner Monti, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks to you first of all, Mr Monti, for setting this proposal before Parliament.
We very much welcome the fact that this proposal's first outing has brought you to Strasbourg, and this is much appreciated.
As became clear during discussions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I welcome many points of this proposal, including those on the sale of more than one make of car, original spare parts, access to technical information, and liberalisation as regards the separation of service and sales, but I have a query about how freedom of establishment within the internal market is to be regulated.
We in Germany have a regulation entitled the Group Exemption Regulation, which states that a regulatory framework should continue to exist, subject to a time limit.
That is something I welcome.
The content, though, amounts to liberalisation if all it says is that individual dealers may be restricted at national level but entitled to set up as many subsidiaries as they like within the EU internal market.
This modifies these rules and makes a nonsense of them.
It will create problems for us and we must discuss this.
Such is my first important question in this context.
