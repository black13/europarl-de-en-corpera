Mr RÃ¼big, the Commission did nothing of the sort, and indeed it cannot.
This was a political condition for the opening of negotiations with Bulgaria, one that was laid upon us by the Member States.
This political condition was formulated by the Member States in consequence of an assessment carried out by the industrialised States as early as the beginning of the 1990s, in the course of which the safety of nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe was subjected to examination.
This determined which of the nuclear power stations were seen by the Western industrialised States as incapable of being retrofitted at reasonable cost.
I am, at the moment, unaware of what standards the States applied at the time.
If you are interested, though, I would be happy to initiate the relevant research on your behalf.
The Commission did not set any enquiries in motion, but performed its political function of achieving a result with the Bulgarian government as regards compliance with a political condition for the beginning of negotiations.
