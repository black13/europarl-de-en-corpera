I congratulate you, Commissioner, on always being allowed to make statements on such scintillating subjects, first Temelin and now Kozloduy.
You must be a very happy man.
May I ask how much a decommissioning of this sort costs?
What happens to the contaminated materials?
Who pays for it all?
How long does such decommissioning take?
What actually happens if there is some sort of mishap before 2006?
Who pays then?
Who bears the costs?
Following on from your answer to Mr RÃ¼big's question, do you not also believe that we are yet again seeing how urgently necessary it is that we should have common European standards rather than always arriving at decommissioning dates by a process of rough estimation?
Blocks 3 and 4 in 2006 - that is what we have said now.
Should we perhaps not make that 2004 or 2003?
What happens then if something goes wrong in 2005?
