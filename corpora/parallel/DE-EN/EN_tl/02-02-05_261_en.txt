Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Olsson for his good and critical report, which does a thorough job of highlighting some difficult points.
The common concern of us all is, without any ifs and buts, the maximum possible safety of our food, which, though, should also look good and taste good.
To produce this food, we need farmers, we need agriculture and we need agro-food production.
That is still the case.
It is this fact that prescribes the frame of reference in which we are at present working on this own-initiative report.
The report rightly highlights a series of shortcomings, no doubt the most serious of which is the appreciable difference in the ways Community legislation is implemented in the absence of any common level of protection.
This is where, in my view, the Commission is meant to be able to intervene and should be in a position to do so.
The precautionary principle must be adhered to by any means available.
Current events in Bavaria and the Rhineland Palatinate show how important responsible controls are.
We must therefore hold fast to the imposition of strict sanctions when binding regulations are not complied with, but I counsel a more cautious approach where a scientific justification has not, to date, been found.
I cannot therefore go along with testing for BSE as early as 24 months, with the ban on feeding with leftover food, even if it has been treated in accordance with contemporary scientific knowledge, and, likewise, the idea of slaughtering the whole stock when a case of BSE occurs, which is something I reject.
There is an urgent need for more research into comprehensive food safety.
We need farmers to be well-trained, good managers, motivated and - which is most important - respected by society, and these farmers need a fair price for what they produce.
