Mr President, there has been a qualitative change in the form of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This shows me, though, how necessary it actually is to have secondary legislation on a basis that accords with the Treaties.
I just want to ask whether the Commission is now, at last, declaring itself willing to grant the competent committee in Parliament, the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, observer status on the Securities Committee and invite it to the meetings on a regular basis.
