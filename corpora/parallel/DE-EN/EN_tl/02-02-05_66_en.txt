Mr President, the debate we had this morning and President Prodi's statement, mean that we need to adjust the text of the resolution to conform with them.
I have an oral proposition, which I have here in French:
'takes note of the speech made in plenary on 5 February 2002 by Mr Prodi, President of
the Commission, which included the statement detailing the Commission' s undertakings
to Parliament' .
(The President noted that there was no objection to the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report Hughes (A5-0013/2002)
