Mr President, I wish to make an oral statement on the vote on the directive on working time in the road transport sector.
My delegation welcomes the adoption of the directive.
The improvement of road safety in general and greater protection for crew are both matters for concern across the whole of Europe and must therefore be regulated on an EU-wide basis.
The latest events in connection with the hauliers' scandal in Luxembourg and in my homeland, Austria, have shown that there is much wrong in the transport sector.
The plenary's adoption in January of the proposed regulation introducing an attestation for drivers was a proper indication of the desire to get the better of the illegal employment of third-country nationals.
The directive that the plenary has adopted today represents another important step.
The requirement to adhere to rest breaks and the laying down of maximum and night work times are making their contribution to safety on Europe's roads.
It is for that reason that we voted for the adoption of the directive.
It is, however, regrettable and disturbing that self-employed lorry drivers have not, for the time being, been included in the scope of the directive.
That is a problem.
It will probably give rise to new forms of pseudo self-employment.
