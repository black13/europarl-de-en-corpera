Mr President, it is right and proper that we should keep on highlighting the significance of SMEs for the European economy.
SMEs ensure growth and employment in Europe.
It is therefore right, and indeed important in terms of Europe's development, that the EIB should step up its support for SMEs or carry on with it.
Half of the total lent, about EUR 5.7 billion, was used for that purpose in 2000.
This amount should be increased or its continued availability ensured.
We must not stop the support measures.
It is also important that more risk capital should be made available to these enterprises, and this is something which I personally strongly support.
It goes without saying that the points of criticism made in the report must be taken seriously.
It is not acceptable for the EIB's own home page to list its activities in only two or three languages.
By so doing, the EIB is limiting its own significance.
