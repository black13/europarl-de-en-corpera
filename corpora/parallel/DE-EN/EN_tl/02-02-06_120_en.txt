Mr President, the United Nations Human Rights Convention meets in Geneva every year, and every year the Chinese leadership puts pressure on its trading partners in order to prevent Peking's human rights violations getting on the agenda.
A lot has changed this year.
The USA was not re-elected to membership of the Human Rights Convention and now has only observer status.
The EU can no longer, then, hide behind the Americans.
The misery of the Tibetans, the stifling of their religious and cultural life, the merciless persecutions and arrests that have gone on for decades are not forgotten.
Because these people refrain from every kind of terrorism, they are not permanently on the front pages of newspapers, and yet they are very much present with us.
As long as one and a half years ago, Parliament called for the Tibetan government-in-exile to be recognised in the event of the UN-sponsored Sino-Tibetan negotiations not leading to Tibet's autonomy.
An EU Special Envoy for Tibet was able to assume important coordination roles.
In his great October speech to this House, the Dalai Lama again expounded his concept of the middle way and urged Peking to take part in direct negotiations without preconditions.
It is, then, high time that the European Union itself got involved in Geneva, in order to bring in a resolution and win the support of responsible members of the Convention.
The Chinese must not deceive themselves.
We welcome their membership of the WTO and their contributions to the international coalition against terrorism.
Nothing, though, can justify the brutal treatment they mete out to religious and ethnic minorities in Tibet as well as in Inner Mongolia and in Eastern Turkestan.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, the Europeans' time has come!
Let us at last give substance and life to our commitment to uphold human rights absolutely.
