Mr President, we Greens especially welcome the report.
It is an excellent report, explaining without ambiguity the national parliaments' tasks and role in the area of legitimising and monitoring national governments' legislative activities in the Council, in intergovernmental cooperation, where this monitoring function is not at all adequate, but also in the involvement of the national parliaments in the development of a European constitution, summed up in the word 'Convention' .
It is interesting to note, in this context, how this issue keeps appearing on the agenda, for there is no conflict between Parliament and national parliaments, nor is their task unclear.
It occurs to me that this conflict is always engendered when the Council and the national governments want to resist Parliament's claim that it should become a fully-developed legislature.
It is then that the impression is conveyed that parliamentary democracy at European level would be to the detriment of the national parliaments.
It is a false argument, but a systematic one and a deception in the true sense of the word.
This discord between the parliaments is intended to maintain the Council's position of power.
Parliamentarianism in Europe is, however, indivisible.
The commitment to parliamentary democracy is made at the European level.
Parliament should therefore give a serious but wary reception to certain announcements made in advance by the Convention's president-designate, who has for weeks, via the press rather than by direct contact, and without yet being confirmed in office by the Convention, been giving voice to ideas about this constituent assembly which bear little relation to what Parliament demands or to the development of European democracy and parliamentarianism.
I strongly appeal to this House to play its part in making the Convention a working, parliamentary and public convention and not, as it has been to date, a legitimising fa√ßade for the Council.
