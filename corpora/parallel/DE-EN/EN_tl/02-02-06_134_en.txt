Mr President, the role of the national parliaments is admittedly laid down in the Treaties, but the democratic deficit, which is essentially a failure to monitor the relevant national government, has got greater as European integration has moved forward.
Deficient monitoring facilities and the governments' failure to supply appropriate briefings often make it impossible for the national parliaments to perform their function.
This development must be brought to a halt, and the authority of national parliaments to keep tabs on their governments must be reinforced.
That is why I particularly support the statements in item 1 of the report.
Improved cooperation between the national parliaments and our own is indeed necessary, especially in areas such as policy on the EU, which are founded on collaboration between one State and another.
There is one statement in the report which I, as a member of the Constitutional Convention, would like to emphatically underline, and that is item 17.
Proposals such as that made by the German Foreign Minister get no support from me.
The problem is the preponderance of the executive.
We need the European Union to be made, in a far-reaching way, more democratic and parliamentary, we need definite constitutional reinforcement of the existing parliaments, but we do not need another chamber.
