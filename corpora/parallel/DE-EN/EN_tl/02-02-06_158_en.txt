Mr President, Commissioner, the report before us clearly shows that, now as ever, the management of structural policy is deficient in various respects and, above all, that there is much room for improvement in it.
I have been carefully reading these reports for years, and the catalogue of defects is always basically the same.
Admittedly, an attempt was made to simplify regional policy under Agenda 2000, yet I still have criticisms of four key areas: first, a lack of efficiency; secondly, high administrative expenditure; thirdly, high liability to fraud and fourthly, a lack of evaluation.
I am committed to the fundamental European concept of solidarity.
It is also in the interests of the prosperous States to bring the poorer ones up to the Community level.
Despite that belief, I call for a far-reaching reform of the EU's regional policy, without critical examination of which the future of the enlarged EU, especially as regards its post-2006 financial arrangements, will be uncertain.
Do not misunderstand me: enlargement will cost a fair bit and people have to be told that.
How sensible is it, though, in reality, for the Commission, for example, on the one hand, to propose cuts in the CAP to the candidates for enlargement and, on the other hand, to make available more extensive structural aid by way of compensation?
These Structural Funds can only be used to their fullest extent if the applicant countries take on board the fact that their budgets are going to incur new debts.
Has the Commission really thought this through?
