Mr President, I would like to underline, in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Budgets, that Europe is meant not just to be a payer, but also, and in particular, a player.
I believe, in particular, that social conditions in Afghanistan are anything but satisfactory.
What matters is that women should be integrated into working life.
To do that, you of course need businesses, above all small and medium-sized enterprises and family firms.
Do you believe it might be possible for us, by means of our payments, to stimulate such things as the setting-up of businesses?
