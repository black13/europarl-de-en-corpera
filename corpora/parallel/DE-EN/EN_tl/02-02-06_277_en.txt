Mr President, my first point is that this is where one normally praises the rapporteur.
I cannot, unfortunately, do that on this occasion, as the rapporteur did not succeed in developing a discussion in the committee that would lead to a common position by Parliament on the Commission's proposals, nor, indeed, did he make the effort to do so.
I see this as a great pity, as a core report and a core position on the part of Parliament are just what is needed.
The Greens, by contrast, have a clear position.
They reject all attempts to protect vested rights and the exceptions to them.
Solidarity between regions must remain the supreme imperative, whilst there must not be such a thing as first and second-class Europe.
In consequence, the Structural Funds must primarily benefit the poorest regions, which just happen to be in the East.
That means that a phasing-out is at the same time an important instrument, and it also cushions the present regions in receipt of support.
Option 2 highlights the problems and offers a solution, and hence it is Option 2 that enjoys our full support.
At the same time though - and this is my next point - our group objects to the Commission's tactic of involving the candidate countries in the management of the Structural Funds at too late a stage and then making a saving at the end of the day.
Last week' s proposal strikes me as scandalous.
It economises on the cohesion policy rather than introducing it earlier, in the pre-accession process.
That is why we urge that a start be made now, with the candidate countries, on phasing-in, on setting up the payment agencies, on training in the management of Structural Funds, in order to make decentralised structural policy, rather than centralised project-based policy, the objective of the Structural Funds.
Future coalition policy must be characterised by sustainable development and participation by local actors, and we must make a start on this now.
