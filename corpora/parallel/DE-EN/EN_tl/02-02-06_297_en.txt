Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen - at least those of you who are still here - the PPE-DE group supports the entire content of Mr Hatzidakis' report.
We take the view that we may well support the Commission's proposal in principle, but that we do want to bring about some changes on a few points.
The traffic safety issue is, of course, decisive, and we need this regulation because traffic safety is not bound by national borders and heavy goods vehicles do, indeed, cross them.
In principle, we also need speed limitation devices for smaller vehicles, as we have had good experience of speed limitation devices in heavy lorries.
It is because these HGVs travel across borders everywhere that we need European regulations.
However, Madam Vice-President, we have to introduce the regulations in a slightly refined form and with longer time limits, for we are dealing here with major economic burdens laid on small and medium-sized enterprises.
We should therefore be more generous in the transitional provisions, in order that the burden on the economy may not be allowed to be too great.
Let me conclude by appealing to the Social Democrats and Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, who is herself a great expert on traffic safety.
As our Amendment No 12 demands, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, we need different speeds for small and large lorries.
So we are again asking you to support our Amendment No 12, so that we can permit a speed of 110 kph for smaller commercial vehicles.
If we impose the same speed limit on all HGVs, we are pre-programming traffic jams into the motorway system.
If we are to ensure traffic flow, we must make it possible for smaller vehicles to overtake.
With that in mind, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I ask you to support our amendment.
We will then have a great piece of legislation!
