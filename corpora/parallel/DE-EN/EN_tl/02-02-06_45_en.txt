Mr President, I think 11 September woke us all up and made us aware of the need for urgent action.
I also believe that we have acted accordingly.
I am myself from Germany.
Germany, Spain and Great Britain are examples in the field of counter-terrorism, of which they have had experience.
I think that is why we understand each other very well.
It is also for this reason that Parliament has done its homework and always supported the Commission and the Council when they wanted to adopt reasonable measures and submitted sensible proposals.
That has always, to date, been the way we have conducted ourselves.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, my problem is, though, that this is not just about combating terrorist organisations.
It has also become clear since 11 September that the combating of terrorist groupings is not sufficient on its own.
To take Islamic extremism in the European Union as an example, there are groupings that we do not describe as 'terrorist' but which our security agencies, for example, nonetheless categorise as organisations detrimental to security.
In my country, Germany, there are 30 000 adherents of an Islamic grouping called Milli Görüs, or, in Berlin, 'Islamic Federation' .
As they enjoy the right to provide Islamic teaching in schools, and thus to engage in the brainwashing of small children, I see them as being in several respects at least as dangerous as the terrorist organisations.
I therefore believe that an arrest warrant and a definition of terrorism cannot be enough on their own, and that it is precisely for this reason that we have to concern ourselves very intensively with the other causes of terrorism as well.
I work on the assumption that the Commissioner and the Presidency, being from Spain, are in a position to examine this danger very closely.
