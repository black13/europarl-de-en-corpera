Mr President, the widening gap between the world's rich and poor represents an enormous potential risk to all concerned.
Traditional development aid, which is taken more or less to be a sort of gift day in which the rich countries give to the poor ones, does not work.
What we need is an all-embracing concept of the peaceful development of the poor countries.
This is, of course, easier said than done, but we must remember that it is the countries with a wealth of raw materials, such as Angola or Nigeria, for example, whose people are the poorest.
That is not by chance; there is a system behind it.
We need to ask ourselves which, in this instance, are the donor countries and which the recipients - a question which, for me, has not been answered unambiguously.
The position of the developing countries is worse than in the days of colonial rule.
The key is fair world trade, in which raw materials have to be at the prices they deserve, and in which the net product must remain in these countries in order to develop their infrastructure.
