Mr President, certain Members of this House, and certain forces, tend to apply more stringent standards to a small country such as Madagascar, which we will be discussing shortly, than to a large country such as Russia.
We are, though, obliged to do the very opposite.
Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and has a special partnership agreement with the European Union, so, on human rights issues, we must apply stringent standards to this country even if it is a powerful one and partnership with it is in our own interests.
The Russians signed up to stringent standards when they joined these organisations, and now they must meet them.
What has been done to Mr Pasko is therefore wholly unacceptable.
Mr Pasko is a person who has acted in the interests of the people of the European Union, Russia, and its Asian neighbours in warning of dangers menacing the Russian people and all of us.
As a Russian democrat, as an environmentalist, and as a human rights activist, he deserves our support.
He campaigns for freedom of opinion and constitutional legality in Russia, and so, in contrast to those who are trying to silence him, he is a patriot.
This case in particular, then, obliges us to speak plainly and to demand that Russia's secret laws, martial laws, and military courts should disappear and that Mr Pasko be set free, not by being pardoned, but by the utterly unfair and unjustifiable charge against him being withdrawn.
There is one other thing we must say loud and clear.
There is a need to create the conditions in Russia for the restoration of nationwide independent media.
The closure of TV-6 is a scandal that cries out to heaven, and stands out as the conclusion of a coordinated policy engaged in by the Kremlin and by President Putin himself.
I therefore ask you to support this motion for a resolution.
