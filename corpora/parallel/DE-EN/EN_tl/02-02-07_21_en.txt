Mr President, I wish to make four points in connection with this report.
Firstly, I feel that the fact that this report has been produced is a very positive thing.
I also thank the rapporteur for her efforts.
Secondly, I take the view that Mrs Bonino's reflections are something we should all share.
What is lacking in the report is precisely the principal cause underlying the facts of this situation, which was analysed in the report, in part unsparingly; the cause of it, though, is not there.
Thirdly, it appears to me that we are, from the point of view of consistency, far too amicable, far too calm, far too balanced.
Appeals are made, recommendations are made, requests are made, things are emphasised, but, in my view, far too little is demanded.
I believe we must in future exert much more pressure on this issue.
We must exert massive pressure on these countries and the societies in them, even with the suggestion of sanctions - and I do know that the word is not quite the right one.
That means that we must convince them and give them to understand, that the failure to positively influence the placing of women on an equal footing in these countries will have consequences.
Fourthly - and here I pick up on one of the Liberal Mrs Dybkj√¶r's ideas - this is very much an issue for men too.
I am a bit of a black swan here today, but I hope that those men who are not here today will, when the vote is taken, do the right thing and advance the policy of this report a few steps further - and I hope that they will also do so in future.
