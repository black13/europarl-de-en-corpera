Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to congratulate Mrs Hermange and thank her for this fine report, which is every bit as good as its predecessor.
We share her analysis and also the criticisms she has raised in the report.
I wish also to thank you, Commissioner, for your ideas on the Barcelona Summit.
Only this morning, I was telling a party of visitors from Bad Hersfeld how much commitment you demonstrate.
Your agenda has enjoyed very strong support from Parliament, and especially from the group to which I belong, but we now expect definite proposals and initiatives, action plans and also - Mrs Smet - directives.
This will not work in the complete absence of directives.
Of course, we should make more use than hitherto of the new method of coordination, especially in discussions with the candidate countries.
I see that as an excellent instrument for getting these countries involved right now and also giving them the opportunity to set out to us their current concerns and needs, and what they have achieved.
Here too, I do not share Mrs Smet's opinion that these candidate countries lag behind on all these points.
I think we urgently need a reform of the European Works Councils directive.
If you have problems at the Commission, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, then just take the excellent report that Parliament produced last autumn.
We must also shape social policy along precautionary lines, and not always leave it until, so to speak, the child has fallen down the well.
The scandal surrounding lorry drivers in Luxembourg is only the tip of the iceberg.
The head of Luxembourg's government has said that there is an urgent need for action on the part of the European Union, and perhaps we should take him at his word.
The Spanish presidency is, unfortunately, rather hesitant, but, Commissioner, Parliament supports you with all the commitment it can muster.
