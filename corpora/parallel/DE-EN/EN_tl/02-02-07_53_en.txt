I wish to table an oral amendment to Amendments Nos 10 and 16, which are identical.
This is to do with the original text's stipulation that the Joint Undertaking's registered office should be located somewhere where it would be exempted from taxation.
For reasons of competitiveness, and other comparable reasons, this is of course not feasible.
In consultation with the groups, the text should be replaced by:
... "subject to the existing tax regimes and negotiations with the potential country of location".
(Parliament gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
