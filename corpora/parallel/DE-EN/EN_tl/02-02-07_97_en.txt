My group agrees with Mr Pohjamo's own-initiative report.
Positive effects have not yet been forthcoming, to the extent we had hoped, from the current provisions of the law and from the reform of the structural funds within the Agenda 2000 framework.
The following, in particular, need to be optimised:
the lengthy negotiations on programmes between the Commission and the Member States
the complicated financial provisions
the involvement of the regions in the implementation of programmes and projects
the expenditure on administration, and
the non-binding nature of the monitoring of project implementation.
Unless further structural changes are made in the administration of the Structural Funds, it will continue to be scarcely possible to resolve the problem posed by the decrease in disparities between the Member States not being reflected by a decrease in those between the regions within them.
Such changes must, in particular, cover the following aspects:
time limits on projects
discontinuance of the financing of projects, the realisation of which overruns the timescale envisaged
the redistribution of Structural Funds resources from countries not availing themselves of them to those which have submitted sufficient qualifying projects
greater weight to be given to infrastructure projects which promote employment.
Enlargement of the EU makes it a matter of urgent necessity that the Commission should produce, by 2003 at the latest, definite proposals to guarantee that present Member States should suffer no detriment as regards structural resources and that the countries that are candidates for accession should be treated equally in line with the tasks of a common structural policy.
There is no other way to achieve the objective of long-term reduction of existing differences in levels of development and the consequent enhancement of economic and social cohesion.
The amendments tabled by my group have also supported this statement of political objectives.
