Mr President, the rapporteur has presented an impressive report which makes it clear that the South Caucasus states are of key importance for Europe's security.
In particular, the fossil fuels and energy reserves known or suspected to exist in abundance in these countries, and their strategic position as the new 'silk route' for oil and gas, give them a global political dimension.
This is both a blessing and a curse for them.
At present, promoting social and economic development in these states is undoubtedly the imperative.
Against this background, the resources allocated by the EU naturally seem distinctly insubstantial.
It goes without saying that closer ties with the European Union are a desirable objective.
The EU must not renege on existing agreements such as the closure of the nuclear power station in Armenia.
As regards the fraught historical relations between Turkey and Armenia, we must avoid awakening hopes on either side that the European Union will assume the role of referee in this conflict.
