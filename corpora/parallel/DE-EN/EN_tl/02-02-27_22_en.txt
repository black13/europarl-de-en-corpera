Mr President, I thank you for the commitment you demonstrated in saying, with regard to the Convention's task, that we must decide what sort of society we want and what it will demand.
My question is this: is it to be that society in which everything, including social issues, is governed by the market?
Or is it to be one in which social justice continues to be vigorously advocated and given form, with society itself taking its share of responsibility for it?
Is the Europe of the twenty-first century to remain a Europe of solidarity, not only within the framework of the European Union itself, but also through cooperative partnership, for example with the states that will not only be joining the European Union, but are, moreover, still European, but not yet Members?
