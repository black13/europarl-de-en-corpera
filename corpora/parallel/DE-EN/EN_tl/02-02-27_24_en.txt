Mr President, enlargement presents us with really interesting tasks.
I believe it to be important to the public that we should build visible bridges, one example of which is the bridge between Vienna and Bratislava.
I believe that we should in fact, as part of the TEN programme - the Trans-European Networks - start on the building of visible bridges.
I wish to urge the Commission to do everything possible to enable the public to see that these bridges are a guarantee of Europe's future.
