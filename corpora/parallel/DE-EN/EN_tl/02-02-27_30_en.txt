Mr President, I will reply to Mr Mulder's question by saying that 2003 will of course also see a great deal of the foreign policy budget being taken up, because European policy is being faced with ever greater demands.
We will be able to raise the funds needed for Afghanistan, as promised at the Tokyo donor conference, from the foreign policy budget.
New things may also, for example, be required of us in respect of Cyprus.
If the successful outcome is actually achieved, with a political process leading to Cyprus's accession to the EU in 2004, this will mean that we will have to make preparatory funds available in 2003.
That, then, will be a new requirement - and let me add that I hope this will be so.
The Council has decided, within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, to send a police task force into Bosnia from 1 January 2003 onwards, and this too will make demands on the European budget.
I believe that we should work together on this, affirming that we also want part of this mission, being a joint action, to be jointly financed, and that is something we have to make clear.
Mr Mulder, we had the opportunity to talk about this yesterday.
The Commission has proposed a new financial instrument for crisis operations, and I am gladdened by the many expressions of support there have been for this in Parliament.
Together, perhaps, we can convince the Council that the right response would be to fund such emergency measures on a Community-wide basis.
