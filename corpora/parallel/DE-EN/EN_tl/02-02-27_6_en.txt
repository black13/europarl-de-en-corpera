Mr President, on behalf of all members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I would like to make a heartfelt plea that we should not, as planned, have a combined debate on culture, education and youth on Thursday morning, as these three topics should not be thrown together.
There may well be points of contact between them, but they need to be dealt with separately.
I ask that these three topics be dealt with in the same time as set aside for the joint debate, and I believe that this is something that this House would support.
