Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner.
We and those responsible, all deserve a pat on the back for this marvellous programme.
Allow me to start with what has become a rather lovely tradition, that is, by scattering roses over the rapporteur; well done, Doris!
We agree with the criticisms and I shall not enumerate them again; perhaps I should but one minute does not give me enough time.
What is my brief here?
Obviously to canvass for this marvellous programme.
It is not a glossy brochure, it is grass-roots policy in the flesh, it is a European answer to numerous questions.
But the answers which Socrates gives are not quite enough.
Socrates does not resolve any fundamental problems.
Socrates helps, it airs political questions and brings them to the public's attention, but does not absolve the Member States of responsibility.
I would gladly hear more from our Member States on this, not just on Socrates, but on their responsibility, on what education means for Europe.
I would be glad to engage in a public debate on a European area of education with the people in charge of education.
Do you know what we have achieved with Socrates, quite apart from the tangible results?
The names of old Europeans are being used: Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig - these old names trip off the lips of young people as easily as the words to a rap song.
We really have achieved what we set out to do.
Doris Pack said that Socrates is there for us from the cradle to the grave.
I would therefore like to see us start a bit earlier, not at school age, but with infants.
Because, as everyone has said, learning foreign languages is so incredibly important, it is of immense importance to all of us and we know that it starts in the nursery.
Perhaps our next step should be in the direction of the kindergarten.
