Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Socrates, together with a number of other programmes, really is the European Union programme which builds Europe from the bottom up because, as Doris Pack has already told us, this programme allows generations of young people to experience Europe for themselves and gain a European perspective which stays with them for the rest of their personal and professional lives.
That is why it is vital for Parliament to take the Council and Commission to task during these procedures and, of course, to make its own contribution.
I should therefore like to address two points on which I would be grateful for the backing of other committees, especially the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The first point is the question of decentralisation.
It has proven its worth, but the national agencies have a counterpart in Brussels; in future, this role will be filled by the executive agencies.
We will need to work with these executive agencies as well as we have worked, thankfully, with the national agencies.
So I urge the Commission and the Committee on Budgetary Control to create the conditions for such cooperation during consultations concerning these executive agencies.
My second point is the question of financial control.
We also need the support of the Committee on Budgetary Control if we really are to achieve the objective of awarding small sums in aid without incurring high administrative costs.
The Commission should be given the necessary support here through Parliament in general and the Committee on Budgetary Control in particular.
