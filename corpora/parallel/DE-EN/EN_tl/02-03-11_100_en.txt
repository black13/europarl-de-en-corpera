Mr President, the post and the postal services are indeed not just any old commodity and not any old service; they are, rather a very sensitive article, one that also needs to be handled with care.
In the first round, the Commission did not, I think, comply with this request which had been addressed by Parliament, and the Common Position with the Council is, I think, a good compromise, which does justice to both the public interest and also to the interests of the people and employees it affects.
Faced with the scepticism that has been expressed, we also need to articulate clearly what we are voting on this week.
It is only from 2006 onwards that things will get exciting.
We then want the Commission to inform us how the universal service is to be financed.
There is no blank cheque; instead we are getting a study.
There is no automatic behaviour here; instead we want to know in the most exact terms - for that is the crucial thing - whether, as for example Mr Mastorakis put it, people in rural areas on islands are to continue to get a good postal service.
That will be the case only in 2006.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, as I think he has brought the various Parliamentary interests and the Council together, so that this week, I believe, we can manage to get a good majority for a good compromise.
