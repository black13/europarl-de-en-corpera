Mr President, it is precisely because I am concerned with internal affairs policy that I observe that the European Data Protection Supervisor plays a most important role in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice.
It is he who creates public trust in the institutions of the European Union.
He must work where the majority of the institutions are permanently based, that is, in Brussels - if that is the point at issue.
If he works elsewhere, the impression is created that he is of only negligible significance.
If the public get the impression that the Data Protection Supervisor is nothing more than a paper tiger, they will not trust the European Union.
If they have no confidence in the way their data is protected, our internal affairs policy will never enjoy the public approval it needs for freedom, security and justice to be allowed to grow.
That, though, is our objective.
We want internal affairs policy to have a European added value, which will be achieved only if the citizens put their trust in us.
It is for that reason that we, and, in particular, the Commission, must show them that we take data protection seriously and that it is not in a merely symbolic sense that we are putting it centre stage.
