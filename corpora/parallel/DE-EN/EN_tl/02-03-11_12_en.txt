Mr President, for the sake of clarifying the proceedings, let me say that our group is very committed on the issue of Chechnya, and if, today, we support the motion to remove the topic from the agenda for this week's part-session, that does not mean that we are not going to continue to be committed on the issue.
We want first to await the visit of a parliamentary delegation to Moscow and then return to this topic in an in-depth debate in May at the latest.
I would like to make that explicit today.
We remain committed on this issue and our attention is entirely focused on Chechnya.
If, then, we are in favour of removing this topic from the agenda for this sitting, that does not mean that our commitment to the issue is any the less.
