Mr President, I want to tell Mr Poettering that I am in absolute agreement with the proposal he has made.
I do think that, if we want to have a proper debate on Chechnya, we must not have it as a matter of urgency with one or two minutes available, but in the context of a statement on this issue by the Council and the Commission, so we could have a serious discussion about it.
Apart from that, I do not wish to respond to the constant attacks by Mr Dupuis and his crowd, such as, for example, Mr Pannella and the rest of them.
