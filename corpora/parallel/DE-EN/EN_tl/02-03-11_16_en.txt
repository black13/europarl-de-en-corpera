Mr President, I wish to make one thing clear: my group did not actually want to ask for the removal of this item, but we were informed that the PSE Group had asked for it and then we said, very well,?
Just listen for a moment!
I always listen to you.
So we said that, in order to have a large majority in this House and to remain committed to the topic, we favour removing it for this week, but finding in the immediate future an appropriate procedure in order that we may get to grips with this topic in a way it very much deserves, with the Council and the Commission present if necessary.
It is only on this basis that we are in favour of dealing with this topic, not as a matter of urgency this week, but at a later juncture and in a far more appropriate format.
That is the condition we impose.
