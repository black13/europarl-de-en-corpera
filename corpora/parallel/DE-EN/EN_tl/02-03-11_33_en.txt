Mr President, at the weekend I was disastrously misquoted in a German newspaper.
Had I really said the things that were printed, I would have made myself liable to prosecution.
Checks have been made, and have established that the newspaper certainly did not act out of malice.
The error is due to a circuitous chain of communication, which itself results from Parliament being walled off to an exaggerated degree.
Mr Kuckelkorn wrote to you as long ago as 17 January to point out the problems brought in its train by Parliament's alleged need for security, which has been taken to the point of absurdity after 11 September, and he counselled common sense.
With others of my fellow MEPs, I associated myself with this letter by signing it.
To date we have received no reply.
It may be that translating it is taking time.
So, today, with the help of immediate interpreting, I ask you directly: When will we stop caging MEPs for their protection from their immediate surroundings and from the public?
