Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our European constitution, our Treaties, state that we are responsible for improving the workplace environment in order to protect the health of employees.
I have the impression that this has often been forgotten, especially in the context of this public debate.
The ignorance of the press - sometimes the quality press - also confirms this view.
In addition to the usual objections from industry, massive lobbying was, of course, carried out by the music industry as well - not the dark forces, but quite specifically the music industry.
This outcry raises three interesting points.
Firstly: The general public's lack of awareness that since 1986, employees in the music industry have been covered by a directive which is still in force.
All employees are covered, except for seamen.
This is now being rectified.
Secondly: It reveals the lack of monitoring in the Member States, for if better monitoring had been carried out, the groups affected - employers and employees - would not be in such a state of shock today.
Thirdly: It also shows, of course - and I say this critically - the very poor representation of employees' interests.
I would like to send the Commission a copy of a letter which I received from the Swiss Musicians Federation about a hearing in 1996, which shows very clearly, Mr Pronk, that damage to hearing is always to be taken seriously, regardless of whether someone works in the construction industry, ceramics, or a music company or orchestra.
(Interjection: Or even in Parliament!)
Or even in Parliament, but fortunately, most of our colleagues are not as noisy as that!
Of course, there are rules at national level.
As a left-wing traditionalist, too, I believe that the state and the employer have a duty to protect workers from workplace hazards.
This is precisely our task, and in my view, with this directive, we have achieved this goal.
