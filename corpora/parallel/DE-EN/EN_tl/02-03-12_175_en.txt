Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would simply like to pose two questions to supplement the comments made by Mr Hatzidakis.
If we call for new instruments, the question we will be asked is this: What are we doing with the existing instruments, and why are they not sufficient?
That is the reason for my two supplementary questions.
Firstly: Do we not already have the option of taking action against Switzerland?
I believe that what Switzerland has done with regard to the restructuring of Swissair into Crossair, Swiss Airlines or whatever is clearly a subsidy case.
Even if the treaty has not yet been ratified, there must be opportunities outside the treaty to proceed against Switzerland.
When will you do so?
Secondly: If we take action against unfair practices relating to ticket dumping outside the EU, can you tell us what you propose to do to combat internal price dumping within the European Union in the immediate future?
There are increasingly frequent cases of airlines offering tickets below cost price in order to control the market.
Do you intend to tackle this problem as well?
