Mr Gil-Robles, I regret to say that we appear to be at odds over this matter.
Firstly, as regards the Association Council, there was full agreement between the Member States and the Commission on what we should say about this issue, and also between the Presidency and the Commission.
There were no conflicts here; rather, there was a common position.
On the fundamental issue, let me reiterate: our policy is clear and unequivocal.
The child's interests are the priority.
Until the system in Romania guarantees that international adoptions take place in accordance with our required standards, I shall continue to oppose any re-opening of the gates to allow international adoptions to take place without restrictions.
I have said to you that special permission may be granted in cases when adoptions had already been initiated before the moratorium came into force.
The Commission will vigorously resist - I repeat - vigorously resist any situation in which the corruption which we witnessed in Romania has any chance of re-emerging.
I repeat, I believe it is better to tell prospective parents that they must wait a little longer until we have a system which provides an absolute guarantee of protection to the children, rather than run any kind of risk.
