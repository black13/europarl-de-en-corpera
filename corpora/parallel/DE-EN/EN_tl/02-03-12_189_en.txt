Baroness Nicholson, I am aware of the problems you describe, and I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the very resolute and determined action by the Commission with regard to the protection of children in Romania has resulted, not least, from the consistent pressure applied by the European Parliament.
It was this House which repeatedly called on the Commission to reject any compromises on the protection of Romanian children, and the Commission is firmly adhering to this course.
I fully agree with Baroness Nicholson that international adoptions are by no means the best instrument to protect children.
Nonetheless, I believe that in the Romanian case, they are an option which we should not rule out entirely.
