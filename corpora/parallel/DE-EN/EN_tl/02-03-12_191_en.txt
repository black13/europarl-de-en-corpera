Commission.
Mr Medina Ortega, on the first point, I can tell you that the Commission has allocated substantial human and financial resources to improving conditions in Romania's childcare institutions for many years.
I am sure that everyone in this House is aware of the appalling conditions in these institutions directly after the revolution, and, indeed, for many years afterwards.
Thanks to the help we provided, much of it as pre-accession funds, steady improvements in the situation have been achieved.
Nonetheless, we are still a long way from a situation which we could describe as satisfactory.
This is why these measures will be continued on an intensive basis.
On the second point, I fully agree with you.
This is precisely the aim of our efforts in Romania and in conjunction with the Romanian Government - to ensure that the system governing international adoptions is fully and unequivocally in line with the standards required by the European Union and international law.
