Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that the imposition of punitive duties is a very powerful instrument which may threaten the economic survival of individual undertakings.
That is the reason for my question: Which methods could you envisage in future to protect enterprises from the adverse effects of such measures?
Would compensation, tax relief or other options be a possibility so that individual enterprises do not have to bear the consequences of a dispute settlement procedure?
