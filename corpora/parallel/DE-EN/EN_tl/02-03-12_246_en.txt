Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the quota buyback programme in the tobacco sector was introduced to make it easier for producers wishing to switch away from tobacco to embark on conversion.
For specific types of tobacco which face steadily declining markets, the buyback price was increased significantly so that producers have an incentive to cease cultivation.
With regard to the acquisition of quotas from the buyback programme, however, the other tobacco farmers who wish to purchase the quotas have priority.
We can only buy back the quotas which are not bought by other tobacco farmers.
For the coming three years, the Commission has submitted a proposal for a Council regulation which sets the premiums and quotas until 2004.
Among other things, this proposal provides for a restructuring of the Community Tobacco Fund in order to finance studies in the Member States on the opportunities for conversion of tobacco production to other crops outside the tobacco sector, and on the initial experiences of this conversion.
In this proposal, the Commission has also announced a further proposal for the first half of 2003, which will be based on the guidelines contained in the Commission communication of 16 May 2001 on the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development.
To this end, it is essential to ensure that there is precise information available on possible alternatives and the socio-economic impact of phasing out tobacco subsidies.
A study is therefore also being undertaken at present to evaluate the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco.
This study should be ready at the end of this year.
It assesses the socio-economic impact of tobacco cultivation in the various production areas.
