Mr President, that was not really a question, but of course the Commission is well aware of the effects of this quota buyback programme.
However, I must also point out that this is an entirely voluntary programme; no one is forced to buy quotas.
For this reason, we also cannot raise any legal expectations should the phasing out of subsidies for tobacco cultivation take place at a later stage.
However, I would also like to point out that we will have an opportunity later this week to discuss the future of the common organisation of markets in raw tobacco in great detail during Thursday's debate here in the plenary.
The three-year extension and its implications will be a key issue in the debate.
