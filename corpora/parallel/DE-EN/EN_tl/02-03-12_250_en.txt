Mr President, Ms Izquierdo Rojo, let me answer with due stringency.
Firstly: it is quite clear, also from what was agreed at the summit, that the phasing out of tobacco subsidies must be accompanied by an appropriate range of alternatives.
This means that we can only implement the phasing-out process if we are able to offer genuine alternatives.
That is my position here.
We want to use the Community Tobacco Fund in the coming years for precisely this purpose, so that we are able to try out options and genuine alternatives and see what works and what does not.
Only then will a decision by the Agriculture Council and an opinion by Parliament be necessary, based on a Commission proposal which will draw on the findings of this year's study.
And only then can this phasing out be implemented in practice.
This is exactly why we intend to undertake a study, at local level, of the options available in the most-affected regions: in Granada, in Estremadura, in Thrace in Greece, and a number of other regions.
We will not be fobbed off with far-fetched ideas; we want to investigate the reality.
I think that this is an entirely fair approach.
