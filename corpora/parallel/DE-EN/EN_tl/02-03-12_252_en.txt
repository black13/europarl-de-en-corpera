Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without going into the issues raised by the honourable lady, I would like to point out on behalf of the Commission that matters concerning the bilateral relations between Morocco and an EU Member State have no bearing on the European Union's comprehensive strategy on the Mediterranean countries.
These relations are governed by the Barcelona Process.
In line with the principles which were endorsed by all the EU Member States and our Mediterranean partners in Barcelona in 1995, trade in agricultural products will be progressively liberalised by all parties.
Against this background, the Community then concluded an Association Agreement with Morocco in 1996 which provides for reciprocal concessions on agricultural products.
The Commission and Morocco recently initiated formal negotiations in order to rework these concessions with a view to deepening the liberalisation process.
