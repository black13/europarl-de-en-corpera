Mr President, Ms Izquierdo Rojo, let me make it clear: I began by pointing out that a distinction must be made between Spain's bilateral relations with Morocco and the European Union's relations with Morocco.
In my reply, I also mentioned the very negotiations you refer to, which were held on 15 March.
The only detail I omitted was the date when they took place.
However, I really must remind you that the procedure for liberalising trade in agricultural products with Morocco was established as early as 1995.
The purpose of the current negotiations is merely to decide on the next step in this liberalisation process.
It must be clear that liberalisation must be a two-way street.
It is not merely a matter of agreeing on the concessions we should make to the Kingdom of Morocco; the question is also which concessions the Kingdom of Morocco will make to us in the trade in agricultural products.
For example, if you look at recent trends in the trade in agricultural products, you will see that interestingly enough, Morocco's imports such as grain from the USA have increased very substantially.
With regard to the trend in imports from the European Union, the opposite is true.
This is not a one-way street, it is a two-way street.
Of course, we must also be prepared to make further concessions.
Our approach to the negotiations is very constructive.
After all, the talks have only just begun and still have a long way to go.
They are scheduled to close at the end of this year, so there is still enough time to make progress.
