Mr President, Mr Sepp√§nen, ladies and gentlemen, on 17 December last year, the Council adopted the Commission proposal to allocate appropriate financial aid to fishermen and vessel owners who had operated under the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco, in order to enable them to undertake conversion of vessels and activities.
A total of EUR 197 million will be allocated to the programme: EUR 170 million in this year's budget and EUR 27 million in next year's budget.
The funds are to be used as follows: The share of aid to be allocated to the scrapping or permanent conversion of vessels to activities other than fishing must represent at least 40% of the global amount.
A maximum of 28% of the total amount can be used for the permanent transfer of vessels to a third country with or without the creation of a joint enterprise, or for the modernisation of vessels.
At least 32% of the total amount of aid must be allocated to social measures such as retraining for fishermen who have lost their jobs or part-financing of early retirement schemes.
Thus the permanent transfer of vessels to Morocco through sale or creation of a joint enterprise in Morocco is also eligible for funding.
However, the premium for the creation of a joint enterprise amounts to just 80% of the scrapping premium, and the premium for export of a vessel amounts to just 50% of the scrapping premium.
Furthermore, vessel owners who purchased their ship with Community aid and who now wish to export it or transfer it to a joint enterprise with a Community subsidy must repay a proportion of the subsidy received for the original purchase.
The amount to be repaid depends on the age of the vessel.
In the case of a five-year-old ship, for example, half the subsidy must be repaid.
