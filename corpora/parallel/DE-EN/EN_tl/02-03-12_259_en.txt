Mr President, the situation is really quite clear: This is a specific programme which was adopted in order to address the particular problem arising from the non-renewal of the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco.
Within this specific programme, the conditions which I have outlined apply.
Outside the framework of this programme, there are only the Structural Funds for the fisheries industry, which govern all scrapping measures and where the same conditions apply universally.
The additional funds and improved conditions for the scrapping or sale of vessels only apply in this individual case.
