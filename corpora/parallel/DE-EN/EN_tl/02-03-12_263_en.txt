Mr President, we are indeed the largest market, and we are by far the largest importers of products from the developing countries.
In my view, we should also remind ourselves sometimes that the European Union alone imports more agricultural products from the developing countries than the USA, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia put together.
We therefore have every reason to hold our heads high when dealing with the other developed states.
Furthermore, as you are aware, we have agreed on an open-door policy for products from the poorest countries of the world.
With regard to exports, a key factor in this context is that we can only reduce export refunds in sectors where appropriate reforms of the common agricultural policy are taking place.
If you look at the structure of export refunds, you will see that we spend by far the most substantial proportion of funds on exports of milk products, sugar and sugar products.
Why?
Because the gap with the world market price is still very high in these sectors, and this price can only be reached by carrying out reforms in these two sectors.
On the other hand, in the last two years, we have more or less phased out export subsidies on grain, and massively reduced them on beef.
Given the pace of the common agricultural policy reforms, further reductions in export refunds can therefore also be anticipated.
