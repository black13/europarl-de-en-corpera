Mr President, Mr Casaca, stringency is one thing, but coherence is another.
Let us take the milk production sector as an example, as I have already mentioned.
Under our current organisation of the market, we have a commitment to guarantee a specific price for skimmed milk powder and butter.
As long as this commitment is in place, we can only export butter and skimmed milk powder with appropriate subsidies.
As you probably know, there is currently no political majority in the European Union in favour of reforming the existing organisation of the milk market.
It is therefore a little over-simplistic merely to point out to the Commission that reforms are required.
That is something which should be drawn to the attention, first and foremost, of the Member States.
With regard to sugar, the situation is as follows: We have pledged, also to this House, that we will undertake a study of competition in the sugar industry this year and that depending on the findings, the Commission will then exercise the option included in the extension of the common organisation of the market in sugar: we can utilise the review clause which it contains and then make further proposals in line with this clause.
The reform process, too, is set to continue.
As you know, the next step is the mid-term review in June this year, but in some sectors, further measures are already planned, for example in the olive sector, the fruit and vegetable sector, and in many others too.
