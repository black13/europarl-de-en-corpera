Mr President, Commissioner, I am taking up this position on behalf of the Home Affairs Committee - we may well have the lowest outgoings in terms of the EU's overall expenditure, but, on the other hand, we have, since 11 September, been working in an area that should have a very important role to play.
It is for this reason that I am very happy that both rapporteurs were very frank and that Mr FÃ¤rm ended up by accepting our proposals and taking them on board.
This also shows that, after 11 September, we are dealing with concepts such as the combating and prevention of terrorism in such a way that we are taking this matter very seriously and are making our readiness clear to strengthen our own European authorities in this field such as Europol and Eurojust, and our will to be successful through them in this area.
My Committee saw as a second important point the theme of enlargement and the important issue of how we deal with borders in the first place.
This was not just through a desire to reinforce borders.
Of course, we do not want people to die at them - the Home Affairs Committee is very sensitive in matters concerning the combating of illegal immigration, and looks closely at what is actually achieved in this area and how effective is the form that the measures take.
On that, there are naturally certain things that we expect of 2003.
Yet, despite counter-terrorism and police efforts on the one hand and action taken by border guards on the other, there is one thing we do not want to forget under any circumstances, that, in a democracy consisting of 15 states, soon indeed to be 25, in the European Union, we also have an obligation to the people who travel to the European Union and live together with us.
This has led us to make a number of proposals relating to integration policy.
I am very grateful to my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets for their willingness to accept these proposals.
