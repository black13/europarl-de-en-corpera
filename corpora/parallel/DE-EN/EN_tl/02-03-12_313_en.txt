Mr President, what has happened to Mrs MÃ¼ller should actually have repercussions.
The word 'duress' occurs to me, as a lawyer.
I am full of admiration for her, and I shall most certainly be supporting the common position.
I also feel, however, that this position touches the limits of moral acceptability.
You see, I come from a country where vitamins are still available in pharmacies only.
When anyone goes into a chemist's shop and buys vitamins, the chemist will say, 'Don't take too much, and please read the enclosed instruction leaflet'.
It will cause great confusion in my country if that all changes.
It will create the impression that vitamin supplements are really quite harmless after all.
This is not the case.
Vitamins have side-effects.
The impact, of course, is not immediate.
It is like when you drink too much.
Not until you come staggering out of the pub do you begin to feel the effects on your health.
It may have tasted good, but it will catch up with you at some point.
We are far more aware than we were ten years ago that vitamins do indeed have adverse effects.
I really do find it irresponsible to set them loose on consumers in this way.
To tell you the truth, Mrs McKenna, I am deeply disappointed.
I thought you would be encouraging us to eat oranges, lemons, bananas, curly kale and other health foods.
No, you are recommending artificial substances to us, substances that are simply mass-produced by an industry where many people earn great fortunes.
I fail to understand your thinking.
