Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome the Commission's initiative to introduce uniform European rules on the use of animal by-products.
Optimum control and traceability of animal by-products are vital prerequisites of greater consumer safety.
In particular, I support the amendment which was adopted in committee on the use of kitchen waste for animal feed.
The feeding of untreated kitchen and restaurant waste has often been regarded in the past as a possible source of swine fever and foot and mouth disease.
For this reason it is especially important that all such untreated catering waste which is transported into our countries should be eliminated.
It undoubtedly makes sense to process catering waste in accordance with strict regulations, so that the entire operation can be supervised down to the smallest detail.
Our declared aim in all of this must be maximum safety for consumers.
Strict processing regulations, by which I specifically mean rules governing sterilisation and the destruction of potential pathogens, and firm European regulations on traceability and control are indispensable and reduce the risk of the spread of epizootic diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever.
Consistent checks by producers, but also by farmers, must supplement the system.
The vital thing is that farmers and consumers must be able to rely on the safety of feed products.
This requires a system for the conditional authorisation of catering waste for use as animal feed, a system that can be closely monitored.
This is why I firmly support the amendment tabled by the Environment Committee.
