Mr President, the completion of the internal market in electricity and natural gas is a wonderful opportunity for further development in the European Union in terms of the economy, the environment and also society.
For a long time now it has been clear that the energy issue plays a central role, above and beyond security of supply.
It is inextricably linked to the fate of our generation and future generations.
The rapporteurs recognised this and have extended the Commission proposal to make it more forward-looking.
Slowly but surely, more and more people are realising that the future lies in renewable sources of energy.
They are the only sources which will guarantee a clean and secure energy supply in the long term.
That is why we need to lay down some ground rules for these renewable sources of energy.
The most important point here is that the true cost of supplying all energy is reflected in its price.
To achieve this, when energy is supplied from traditional nuclear and fossil fuel sources, the external costs for insurance and the subsequent costs in terms of pollutant emissions need to be internalised.
We need undiscriminatory access to the networks for electricity and also for biogas.
This is a new concept which has been accepted here for the first time.
We need fair transmission charges for all sources of energy and in a free market we also need the primary energy sources to be labelled.
We owe this to our consumers.
I would even go so far as to say that it is not only bills that should be labelled; energy sources should also be disclosed in the energy supplier's promotional literature.
