Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as early as March 2000 the Lisbon Council advocated liberalisation of the gas and electricity sectors.
The Commission tabled a comprehensive proposal to make this desire a reality.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy enriched this proposal by including other relevant points, stressing the need for greater emphasis on renewable sources of energy and the right of all suppliers to have unrestricted access to the network.
The Committee also beefs up the role of the independent regulatory authorities and counters possible distortions of competition with provisions on ownership unbundling.
I am in favour of these measures.
I should particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 43 to the report.
Here electricity providers are required to disclose to the final consumer the composition of the energy mix supplied in the bill and in advertising materials.
This minimum information makes an essential contribution to creating transparency and provides a basis on which consumers can exercise their necessary freedom of choice in the completed internal market.
