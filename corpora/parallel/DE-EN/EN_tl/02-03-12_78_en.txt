Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, liberalisation must bring benefits.
I was pleased to see that the rapporteurs identified this as a key point.
In our view, it is important that the benefits are not offset by new taxes and that we create a system which guarantees a sustainable and secure energy supply, in terms of both the environment and business management.
Just as I will decide this lunchtime whether to eat a schnitzel or a salad, thus determining the energy supply for my personal energy balance, in the future I also want to take advantage of the free movement of goods to be able to decide whether to have solar power or hydroelectric power.
But perhaps it will not only be a choice between one or the other; it would be nice if I could say, in the future I want to be able to use 50% solar power and 50% hydroelectric power in my private house or in my company.
Here I attach the utmost importance to there being no cross-subsidisation.
In particular, for instance, we do not want the final disposal of nuclear waste to be cross-subsidised from other sectors.
We also want a universal service and compliance with public service and environmental obligations; this will of course be achieved through public calls for tender, so that good service is guaranteed and efficiency is central.
An external certified body should be responsible for assessing quality in the electricity sector.
In the future, you see, we also want renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy-saving measures to be focal points.
In the future, there must not be any discrimination in the network price on the basis of quantity of electricity or method of generation.
Nor should cross-subsidisation of any kind be admissible.
