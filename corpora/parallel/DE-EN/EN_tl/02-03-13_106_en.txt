Mr President, the Council common position on the liberalisation of postal services guarantees that there will be a controlled opening of the market in these services in Europe.
We need to adhere to the planned target dates and weight limits, as they will make it possible to liberalise the postal sector, with all the advantages to be gained from fair competition, in a gradual and organised way.
As always, if areas of public services are to be liberalised, the opening process needs to be carefully controlled and implemented with regard to security of supply and social issues.
The compromise worked out in committee concerning the production of regular reports on the application of the directive as a source of information for future development is therefore to be welcomed.
Nevertheless, the economic, social and territorial consequences of the liberalisation process need to be taken into account when making policy.
It is, however, questionable whether it really is right for the directive to make recommendations to the competent social partners, as has been suggested, for example, in one amendment.
