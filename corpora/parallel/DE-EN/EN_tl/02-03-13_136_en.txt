Mr President, I would like to state that I voted for the Paulsen report and above all for Amendment No 10.
I basically believe that we need to pay close attention to hygiene regulations and enforce them very strictly, and that standards need to be raised accordingly.
Nevertheless it does not make sense for us to destroy reusable waste - and that is what catering waste is - and by destroying it to create further costs for the public, when we could in fact make use of it in a sensible way.
I am pleased that the European Parliament has agreed with this approach, even if it has been by a narrow margin.
I hope that as things proceed we will also get the necessary agreement of the Commission that reusable waste should not be indiscriminately destroyed, which also involves extra costs, but that it should be possible to use it and recycle it.
