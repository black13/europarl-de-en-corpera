Mr President, I am very grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to table an oral amendment and to explain what is behind it.
Unfortunately, it did not scrape past the required 314-vote mark.
That is a pity as far as the amendment is concerned, but it does not alter the fact that in compromise Amendment No 25 Parliament has called on the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal.
That means that the codecision procedure will be invoked and that we can deal with this by means of a regulation of our own.
I wish to call on those Member States that have not so far called for a ban to make sure that these substances, which are dangerous if they are not properly treated, are properly disposed of.
I expect that during the transitional period until a regulation governing all this is submitted, the Commission will use its control functions to make sure that we do not have a repeat of the disasters that we have already experienced - foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever - which can be caused by untreated catering waste.
