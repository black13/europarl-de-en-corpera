Mr President, I voted against the report before us because it does not live up to the expectations created by the title.
The main focus is on religious fundamentalism, with other forms of fundamentalism only being given a brief mention.
Even if religious fundamentalism is the most significant form and stands out from other forms, it is nevertheless essential to recognise all forms of fundamentalism if a meaningful debate is to take place.
The threats posed by fundamentalism are growing in a way that the events of 11 September suggest involve an enormous contempt for humanity.
However, to do justice to the situation we cannot limit ourselves to religious aspects alone.
Just as people obsessed with a fundamental order are to be found in all walks of life, this way of thinking is also prevalent throughout society.
The logical consequence of recognising this can therefore only be that we should examine this whole area and not concentrate on just one form of this phenomenon, even if it is the form with the most adherents.
