- It is vital for us to deal with this topic thoroughly, because many women suffer from fundamentalist discrimination.
However, the report before us does not do justice to these problems and creates the impression that fundamentalism is the hallmark only of certain religions.
The political, social and ideological fundamentalism directed at women with such devastating consequences for their quality of life has been ignored.
Narrowing the scope of the report in this way is contrary to the Christian ethical order of values.
This one-sidedly anti-religious approach means that an opportunity to deal appropriately with this important subject, "Women and fundamentalism", has been missed.
The report is unbalanced, contradictory and undifferentiated, and accordingly totally undermines the battle against discrimination against women.
Freedom of religion and protection against discrimination are key aspects of fundamental rights that cannot be played off against each other, and that is why I voted against this report.
