Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my thanks for the positive atmosphere in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because not only this report but also those that follow - especially the legislative reports in the area of financial services - require a high degree of willingness to cooperate and need to be seen in the context of attempts to strengthen economic and monetary union as the motor of the European Union.
I therefore view the Trentin report in conjunction with the report already adopted on the economic consequences of 11 September.
We certainly always debated them together in committee.
I do not need to repeat that.
I stand by the Lisbon objectives.
Yes, they are ambitious - but we need ambitious objectives, because if we just tread water and are complacent we will achieve nothing.
However, we will only achieve these objectives if we do our homework.
That applies not only to the European Parliament but also to the Council and the governments of the Member States.
We need to get over this period of weakness, as it says in the report.
But to get over a period of weakness you have to take measures and not just wait.
We have to recognise that we have a great deal to do and cannot just wait for an upturn in America.
We have to become independent from America's economy.
For me, that means we need a properly functioning internal market, in other words we must do everything to implement in good time the directives that have already been adopted, to eliminate obstacles to the internal market, and to achieve greater coordination in the internal market despite the variations in competence, in order to remove distortion of competition.
Our objectives are an action plan for financial services, structural reforms, observance of the Stability Pact and the principles of the social market economy.
