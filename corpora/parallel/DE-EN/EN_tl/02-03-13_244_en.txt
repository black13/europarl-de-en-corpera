Mr President, according to reports in the German press, Chechnya's position is becoming more critical.
Major reports have appeared in our newspapers which indicate that Russian military death squads are operating in Chechnya and that one village turned to the United Nations for help as it had been visited a total of 33 times for "cleansing operations".
I urge you to ensure that an EU delegation should inspect the position in Chechnya on the ground and check what is actually happening there, because journalists can still only visit if accompanied by officers.
As long as there has been a Council of Europe presence in Chechnya, there has not so far been an EU presence.
Which is why I am asking if you would consider sending an EU mission to Chechnya.
