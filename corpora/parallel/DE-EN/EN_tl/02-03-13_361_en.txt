Mr President, Mr Carnero's report to this House is an important one, and if this call for the EU to be given a legal personality is acted upon, that would be a qualitative leap forward in the unity that Europe represents for the citizens of our countries and also for the EU's partners throughout the world.
No one understands the difference between the European Community and the European Union.
It is complicated and confusing and also has many drawbacks.
Mr Berthu is quite right in saying that this request forms part of the major overall reform that we want.
Merging the three pillars and streamlining the decision-making structures are all things that we have already approved in the Leinen-MÃ©ndez de Vigo report and in various other reports.
The question of legal personality is a cornerstone that is needed to bring the whole thing together.
This cornerstone was missing and we are providing it now with Mr Carnero's report.
I very much support this.
The Convention is an excellent opportunity to do this work.
We need Europe to have a single voice in the world.
Mr Laschet and others have already mentioned examples of this absurdity: in some cases the Community is represented, but not the Union.
It really is very complicated.
But it is also important for justice and home affairs policy.
I just asked him to say that we have agreed to make EUR 5 million available for Europol.
That is a good thing, because we want Europol to function, but the funding cannot be accepted, because Europol cannot accept money from the Community budget, but only from the Member States.
This demonstrates the absurdity of this situation, and I hope that our representatives and others involved in the Convention will take a step forward as regards legal personality and that the rights of our citizens will finally become binding, so that they can take the Union to court.
On that note, I wish this proposal every success and say thank you to Mr Carnero.
