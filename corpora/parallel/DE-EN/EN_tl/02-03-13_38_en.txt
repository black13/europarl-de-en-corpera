Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Foreign Affairs Committee has commissioned a legal opinion on the issue of the Bene?
Decrees.
This greatly gladdens my heart.
I see them as not only a bilateral problem; they continue to be applicable in law, and the question therefore arises of whether they are compatible with Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Previous progress reports have, unfortunately, had not a word to say about this.
Commissioner Verheugen has given it as his opinion that the Bene?
Decrees are not merely a legal problem but a political and moral one.
The ethnic cleansings and expulsions in the most recent wars in the Balkans have without doubt revealed a European dimension.
What is at the heart of the Bene?
Decrees is no different.
The international jurist Felix Ermacora came to the conclusion, in a legal opinion on the Bene?
Decrees, as recently as 1992 that they were incompatible with current international law, thus indicating that they cannot be reconciled with EU law either.
It is with real excitement that I await the outcome of this opinion and the reaction of the Commission and the Council to it.
