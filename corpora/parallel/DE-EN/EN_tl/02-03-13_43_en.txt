Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my prepared statement by thanking Commissioner Verheugen for discussing the subject of the Bene?
Decrees and thereby, as Parliament has already done in many resolutions, clearly pointing out that this issue very definitely possesses a European dimension.
Commissioner, you were right to observe that problems of a legal, but also political and moral, nature have arisen and are certainly of relevance to the process of integration.
I will now also expressly welcome and support the encouragement you have given in this House to the Czech Government and the Czech public to do everything possible to put a stop to such discriminatory effects in the legal field as may still result from these Bene?
Decrees, and thus remove potential obstacles on the path to enlargement.
I greatly regret the remarks by some Members to the effect that enlargement is inevitable.
As if we were now to have to do everything in our power to move this process further forward, because it would otherwise be unstoppable!
This process is not only unstoppable, it is also explicitly desirable, and to be desired, moreover, with the utmost ardour!
In particular, enlargement incorporating the countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and those to the North, overcomes the historic burdens laid upon us by Yalta, at last overcoming the division of Europe, and benefiting us all, especially countries such as Austria and Germany, who will profit directly from the growing markets at their front door!
