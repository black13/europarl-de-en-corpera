Mr President, our group, too, thanks you for your statement, and we are right alongside you as regards a peace settlement, or the attempt at one, in the Middle East.
This debate is not about the Middle East, as we want to discuss enlargement, but it is our profound conviction that we will be successful in the fight against terrorism only if we, that is the United States of America and the European Union, support the peace process between Israel and Palestine with equal determination and in the same way, something on which there could be stronger signals from the West, to which we belong.
I am much obliged to you for your initiative.
