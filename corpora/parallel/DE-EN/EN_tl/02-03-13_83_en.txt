Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Amendments Nos 1 and 10, which were adopted by a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, relate to a ban on the use of catering waste for feeding and to its disposal and use.
The rapporteur has now tabled Amendment No 25, which is a compromise amendment.
However, with one exception, these amendments are mutually compatible.
The problem is that they refer to different dates.
The amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy refer to 30 June 2002.
Mrs Paulsen's Amendment No 25 says "before the entry into force of this regulation", and that is what we are voting on now.
I would like to table an oral amendment to the effect that in the two amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy the date should be changed to "before the entry into force of this regulation".
Yesterday, the Commission said that it would not take on board either Amendments Nos 1 and 10 or Amendment No 25.
So there will be a clash between us anyway, and that is why it is important for us to vote on all three amendments in this way.
However, even if this oral amendment is defeated by the required majority - and I am saying this now so that I do not have to speak again later on - we can still vote on these amendments, because this date does not tie the Commission's hands.
It has the right of initiative and can decide anyway.
It is simply a recommendation, and if that does not go through, then I am in favour of us still adopting all three amendments.
