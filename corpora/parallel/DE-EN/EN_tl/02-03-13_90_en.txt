Mr President, we have of course made some decisions about the electricity part that mean we now have to be careful not to contradict the gas part too much.
That is why I would like to speak at three different stages: first now about the block vote, then later on about Amendment No 162 and then once again on amendments Nos 149 and 184.
These are not comments on the substance, but rather comments about the adjustments.
I would like at this point to comment on the first block: we have just rejected the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party's Amendment No 173 in a roll-call vote.
The problem that we have here is that in committee we did not make a decision on this subject as regards electricity, but we did in the case of gas.
The Liberal Group has now tried, in parallel, to do the same thing for electricity as we have already done for gas.
We rejected that.
However, we now have Amendment No 147, which belongs to this block, and which covers exactly the same substantive point that we rejected in the case of electricity.
We are bringing forward something for gas that we do not want to bring forward in the case of electricity - the progress of market opening, as proposed by the committee.
However, we still want to defer the opening of the gas market somewhat as compared with electricity.
We are now creating an inconsistency around precisely this point.
That means that by analogy we should be opposing Amendment No 147, but I simply do not know how we do that procedurally speaking, because in the voting list that is included in the block.
That is why you, Mr President, have to decide now whether we should take Amendment No 147 out and vote on it separately; in that case, by analogy with the vote just taken, it would also have to be rejected.
I hope that was confusing enough for you!
