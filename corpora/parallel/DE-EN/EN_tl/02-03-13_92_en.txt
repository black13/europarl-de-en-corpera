Mr President, this a bit simpler than just now.
It is just about correcting something.
The intention of Amendment No 162, a joint PSE and PPE-DE amendment, is to bring what we agreed for electricity in line with what we are now agreeing on for gas.
It is word for word what we agreed earlier on for electricity.
But because of the way the voting list works, that means that we first have to vote against the committee's amendment and then vote for Amendment No 162.
However, a mistake has crept in along the way.
This is exactly what we agreed for electricity on Article 8(5).
Amendment No 162 now also reads "Article 8(5)".
However, for gas it is not Article 8(5) but Article 7a(1), and so of course that needs to be inserted there from the Minutes; this is just a technical adjustment.
