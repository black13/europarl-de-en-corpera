Mr President, this is about another adjustment, but this is rather more complicated than the one we had just now.
You do not really need to listen at all, just do as I suggest, that will make things perfectly simple!
(Laughter)
But enough joking.
We have just voted on the relevant part in relation to electricity.
This is found in the committee's amendment.
The amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party attempts to remove the discrepancies between Article 14, which relates to the gas sector, and Article 22.
I must say that this is certainly necessary if we are to be rigorous here.
However, if we now only voted on the PPE-DE's amendment, the key point concerning the electricity sector would be lost.
Conversely, if we were to vote as shown here in the voting list, according to which if Amendment No 149 is accepted Amendment No 184 becomes redundant, then we would once again have the problem of a lack of consistency with the other article.
That is the reason for the following proposal, and I have agreed this with the mover, who can confirm this.
We should first of all vote on Amendment No 149 from the committee, and the PPE-DE Group will then withdraw its amendment except for the part that eliminates this inconsistency.
This would then be added to Amendment No 149.
We would then have eliminated the inconsistency between electricity and gas and the internal inconsistency in the case of gas.
(Applause)
