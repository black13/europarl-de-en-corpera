Mr President, two minor drafting errors have crept in here.
The first error is in Amendment No 48.
It should say "the competent authorities", in the plural; there was not any disagreement between the Council and Parliament about this, it was just an error in the wording of the amendment.
Similarly, we made a small error in Amendment No 52, in which two words have been omitted from the written version.
However, in the case of Amendment No 52 in particular, this goes a long way towards meeting the wishes of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I would therefore ask you to approve the two oral amendments and to vote accordingly.
