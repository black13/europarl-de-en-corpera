We need to look at the 'tobacco' sector as a whole and take a balanced approach to the various areas (CAP and the environment, economic and social cohesion, public health).
Studies by the Commission into this are under way and their results and findings will need to be incorporated in specific proposals.
We should not delude ourselves that, if we reduce tobacco growing, everyone will stop smoking in the EU.
We must accept that tobacco will then be imported from third countries, where we cannot do anything about tobacco growing, while jobs are being lost in the EU.
We have a duty towards the people who earn a living from growing tobacco and we must offer them reasonable alternatives.
Restructuring measures could be funded from the new area within the Community Tobacco Fund, the budget for which needs to be increased by 3%.
I also call for information and awareness campaigns to be stepped up on the damage which tobacco consumption causes to health.
