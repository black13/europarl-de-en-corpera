Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares Parliament's concern about the current situation in Columbia and also shares the view expressed in the resolution, that negotiations are the only feasible way of helping to resolve the long-standing conflict in Columbia.
This position has been expressed in numerous statements.
The direct role which the individual Member States have played in this respect also deserves recognition here.
The Commission also welcomes the proposed support for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota.
We have already helped here and we shall continue to offer our help in the future.
The Commission is also supporting the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Colombia.
The Commission is standing by its commitment to the peace process, hence Commissioner Patten and the Columbian foreign secretary recently signed an agreement on financing initial peace work.
We intend to continue supporting Columbian civil society in its efforts to establish peace through regional development and peace programmes.
The Commission is currently examining in which specific areas projects can be funded.
At the same time, we are offering the victims of the conflict our direct support in the form of humanitarian aid, which is being distributed by ECHO and non-governmental organisations.
