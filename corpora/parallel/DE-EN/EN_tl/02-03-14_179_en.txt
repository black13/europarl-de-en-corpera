Mr President, I concur with the previous speaker; 23 million people live in a democracy in Taiwan, an established democracy, and Taiwan is by no means a country which causes us continual headaches.
Nonetheless, it is the topic of this urgent debate.
These 23 million people and their democratic society are excluded from international organisations.
This is not a country which is first and foremost an aid beneficiary; it is a country which actively supports international organisations.
Taiwan has been actively involved in the WHO.
It would be a mistake if this country were unable to join the international community, which is why we could make a start by giving it observer status and letting it work with other international organisations in the future.
Perhaps there is some sort of half-way status which Taiwan could be granted.
My question to the Commission is, are you prepared to support Parliament here?
