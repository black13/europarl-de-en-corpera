Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is not just a political and economic success story; we have also achieved health standards which many other countries can only dream of.
A good, healthy constitution is important to everyone here on earth, but it is only through access to information and medical care that public health can be improved.
And there is much that can only be done jointly and in synergy.
I am thinking, for example, of infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and others.
The World Health Organisation and its current complement of 199 members have nailed their colours to the mast and are committed to improving health throughout the world.
Health is a valuable commodity which everyone has the right to enjoy, which is why I take the view that, in an area which affects everyone, no one who wants to help improve the welfare of people in their own and other countries should be excluded.
Taiwan has expressed a desire to help the WHO, both financially and technically, which is why I think there is not just good cause, it is imperative that Taiwan be granted observer status at the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly.
I have first hand experience of the political problems and tensions affecting Taiwan and, as in most cases, it is not just one side which is to blame.
But I am firmly convinced that we should not be led by political differences to stop a country joining international efforts in the health sector and I therefore call on the House to support this joint resolution.
