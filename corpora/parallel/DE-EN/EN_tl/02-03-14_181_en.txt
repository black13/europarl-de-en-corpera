Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission does, in principle, support Taiwanese efforts, and not just in the area under debate; it supports all its efforts to become involved in the work of international agencies and organisations, provided that there are sufficient economic or other relevant grounds for such involvement.
However, its involvement must be compatible with the status of Taiwan and the EU one China policy.
We pushed for Taiwan's membership of the WTO and, together with the United States, we helped oil the wheels of its accession.
We have also supported Taiwan's involvement in several international organisations, including the OECD, its involvement in the Kyoto agreement on simplified, harmonised customs procedures and its involvement in several international fisheries organisations.
We are well aware of what Taiwan has achieved in the health sector and its increasing commitment in international aid and health operations, which is why we are in favour of extending contacts between Taiwan and the World Health Organisation, provided that the rules of the WHO so allow.
Unfortunately, however, it looks as if Taiwan does not meet the criteria set out in the WHO constitution for membership of the organisation, because only states can join.
There is some legal uncertainty as to whether the WHO rules would allow Taiwan observer status at the World Health Assembly.
We and the Member States shall be considering the legal situation in order to formulate a suitable position in the run-up to and at the forthcoming World Health Assembly in May.
We are also prepared, with the Member States, to re-examine the possibility of Taiwanese involvement in the work of the WHO in some other form, mainly through non-governmental channels, provided that any such involvement complies with the relevant WHO rules.
