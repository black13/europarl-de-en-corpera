Mr President, as a neighbouring state, Moldavia is a sort of foster child to us.
We have long hoped that, even with a Communist regime, this country would stick to economic development and the road towards the European Union.
That hope has now been dashed and the Communist government knew that it was playing with fire when it introduced the Russian language and made it compulsory to teach a Stalinist slant on history.
Language and culture have already sparked one military conflict in this country, which was only quelled within a few days thanks to a broad social compromise, with stability being established in the country through long-term action by the OSCE.
The government has now destroyed all that, and in one of the poorest countries in Europe.
I think it is wrong that the government is now trying to keep dragging out excuses.
We have seen this over the last few days, with the government maintaining that others are responsible for the political crisis.
It is responsible because it has tried to revoke this compromise, in one of the poorest countries in Europe.
If this country now falls into political crisis, just when it is on the verge of becoming a neighbouring country, it will also affect us, which is why I think the government urgently needs to give in, reverse these decisions and do something about creating economic and political stability in this country.
