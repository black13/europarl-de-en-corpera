Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union in general and the Commission in particular condemn human rights violations in Tunisia and are monitoring the trial against Hamma Hammami and two other members of the Communist party very closely.
On 9 March this year, a representative of the EU presidency attended the court hearing as an observer.
The Foreign Ministry was notified of his attendance in advance.
We welcome the postponement of the trial to 30 March to give the defence more time to prepare its case.
The Commission shall continue to follow developments at the trial very closely through its delegation in Tunis.
The EU is taking every opportunity to strengthen the human rights dialogue with Tunisia.
At the most recent meeting of the association council on 29 January this year it expressly urged the Tunisian authorities to step up their efforts towards pluralism, democracy and the rule of law.
