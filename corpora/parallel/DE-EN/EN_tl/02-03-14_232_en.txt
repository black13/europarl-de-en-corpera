Mr President, we have had hot-headed arguments in the groups about speaking times and about which subjects can be included on the urgent list and which cannot.
We have wrangled over minutes and then we end up finishing half an hour early!
Something has gone dreadfully wrong with the mathematics and I would be most obliged if you would examine how we can make full use of the sitting time up to the vote.
