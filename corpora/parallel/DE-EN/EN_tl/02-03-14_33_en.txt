Mr President, it all depends on what the honourable Member understands by the term guarantee.
What we are doing in this proposal is as follows, as I have already explained: in order to be able to take account of the Commission communication to the European Council, we must develop alternative forms of employment for people at the same time as phasing out tobacco subsidies.
We do not just want to apply a wait and see policy here; we want to test out various alternatives in a sort of pilot stage and see what the best and most promising alternatives are.
Some of the 5% funds which I referred to will be used for this.
If you take a close look at the Commission communication on sustainable development, you will see that what we are starting to do is to phase out tobacco subsidies and develop suitable alternatives in the areas affected at one and the same time.
That is what I explained and that is exactly what we want to do.
