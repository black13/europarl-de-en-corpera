Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Lage for his support for our proposal.
It is true that fisheries play a very important role in the economic and social development of remote regions and a system of aid for marketing specific fishery products from these regions was introduced back in 1992.
This aid helped producers to offset the additional costs of transporting their products to mainland Europe.
What we are now proposing is to extend the present scheme by a year, that is, until the end of 2002.
Why a year?
The Commission will be submitting a report to the European Parliament and the Council in June of this year on the implementation and efficiency of the measures which currently apply, together with a detailed appraisal of these measures.
We can then make any adjustments needed on the basis of this appraisal when the common fisheries policy is revised.
Now to the proposed amendments: Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern the legal basis.
We have suggested Article 37 of the Treaty because these measures are no different from the provisions of the Treaty on Community policy or general principles.
However, we cannot agree to extend the scheme indefinitely.
The whole point of the extension, as I have said, is to give us time for a detailed appraisal of the measures taken so far.
I must therefore reject Amendments Nos 1 and 3.
Nor can I accept Amendment No 2, because the Commission report will not just reflect the results of the study; the report which we present will also need to take account of the impact of the measures and their application by the Member States.
Amendment No 6 is problematic because, as I have said, the study is just one of numerous documents which we may need to take into account in a proposal for a new regulation.
It would not therefore be appropriate to mention it separately in the regulation.
However, I can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5.
Thank you for your attention.
