Mr President, I am dreadfully sorry, but I did not invent the procedure.
The proposed amendment arrived very late last night.
Just so that Mr Cohn-Bendit also understands: the two which were accepted were relatively straightforward.
The others, as the rapporteur himself explained, are very complicated amendments which run through the entire text and I would be more than happy to explain them to you in detail if you cannot follow them.
In any event, we are opposed.
