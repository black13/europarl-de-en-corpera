Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the wording adopted in Lisbon was courageous, ambitious and high-flown - the EU was to become the most competitive and dynamic economic area in the world by 2010.
These good intentions were very welcome, but the outcome of the Barcelona Summit was less so.
The long overdue complete opening of energy markets was not forthcoming.
Instead we got a lazy compromise.
A properly functioning internal market is the key to growth and employment.
The 'Neue ZÃ¼richer Zeitung' neatly summed up the outcome of the Barcelona Summit in one sentence: 'Europe caught between ambition and action'.
I agree with Mr Solana's critique of this kind of conference diplomacy.
Mountains of paper are generated, private and not so private discussions are held, and all in all a great many good intentions are announced, as is the desire to play a major economic and increasingly political role on the world stage in the general interest.
The delay in the liberalisation of energy markets is an example of how far removed Europe is from being able to act.
Especially in a core area like the internal market, I regard this as being extremely damaging in terms of economic policy, and, as Mr Evans put it, ridiculous politically speaking.
