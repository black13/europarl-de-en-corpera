Mr President, I greatly welcome the ARGO action programme.
It is my firm conviction that it is only through greater cooperation between the authorities of individual States that the existing discrepancies in the application of Community regulations can be removed.
Proof that the inequality of treatment in the Member States has to be done away with is provided above all by the great number of petitions addressed to Parliament.
In recent years there have been 468 petitions alone on the subject of inequality of treatment in this area.
It really is time to do more about this issue.
Another improvement in comparison with the present Odysseus programme is the explicit inclusion of the visa issue, another area that has seen the submission of numerous petitions.
The electronic exchange of data is of particular importance to cooperation across Europe, and I call for the creation of a common database for the whole of Europe, a database that must be accessible to the competent authorities in the Member States - if need be, to third countries as well - and also to the competent agencies of the European institutions.
In this context, the protection of privacy and the confidentiality of information must be safeguarded unconditionally and to the fullest extent.
Alongside that, we must ensure that the authorities in the individual States provide information within an appropriate period of time when asked to do so by the Committee on Petitions.
This obligation is the sole protection for the petitioner's legitimate expectations.
Delays in passing on information, which have occurred up to now, cause petitioners unacceptable detriment, something which can, in my view, be prevented only by the Committee on Petitions being enabled, in cases of urgency, to bring negative conduct by the authorities to the public's notice.
Bad publicity is no doubt something that every public body wants to avoid.
