Mr President, the proposal for the ARGO action programme falls short on crucial points.
It is, though, to be welcomed that the proposal for Odysseus' successor programme allocates funds, among other things, to improving the training of officials, but what use is a programme of training, exchange and cooperation if no change is made to the overall conditions that have prevailed to date?
The situation cannot go on in which asylum seekers are turned back at the EU's external borders by the relevant border authorities, as they have been hitherto.
The situation cannot go on in which they run the risk of going down a chain of deportation and ending up back in the country where they were persecuted.
As the Commission proposal for a Council Directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States envisaged, their applications for asylum must be examined by an independent authority in the Member State in question.
Asylum seekers must be able to have recourse to the law when administrative decisions go against them.
That is the least that we can expect of a state founded on the rule of laws such as our own.
Let us not forget that border officials can be as well-trained as you like, but all that good training is of no use if they are entrusted with tasks that cannot but overwhelm them, such as deciding on the welfare or otherwise of asylum seekers.
