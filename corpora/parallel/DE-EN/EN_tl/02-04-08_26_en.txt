Mr President, as this is the first time you have been in this situation, my reproach is not directed at you; in recent years, though, I have known many Vice-Presidents of this House who said in discussions of this sort on the issue of Question Time that they would endeavour to ensure that it did not happen again and that it was an exception.
It is, though, increasingly becoming the rule.
I can give you statistical evidence that this is a fact and so I ask you as a matter of urgency to put Question Time back at an hour when it is absolutely certain that it can take place.
It used to be held at the beginning of the Tuesday evening sitting and was always on time.
It has regularly been wrecked, every other or every third time, since being moved to the afternoon.
Nowadays we are regularly stopping at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday through apparently not having anything to discuss until 6.30 or 7 p.m.
We do not sit on Fridays, yet we do not have time for Members to exercise their elementary right, guaranteed by the Treaties, to ask questions.
This is absolutely unacceptable, and I am asking not only that this be changed, but also for the restoration, as soon as possible, of the Question Time with Commissioner Busquin and others, which many of us have carefully prepared for.
We do not want to be sent written answers drafted by civil servants, but to be able to ask supplementary questions, as is the custom in parliaments.
