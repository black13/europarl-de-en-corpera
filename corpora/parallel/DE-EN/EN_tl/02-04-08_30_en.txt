Mr President, extraordinary situations sometimes do call for extraordinary actions.
I would have liked the President of the European Parliament, after the vote on Wednesday, to call for a lunchtime demonstration in support of peace in the Middle East.
We have a wonderful atrium, which is at other times the venue for celebrations.
We have a wonderful square in front of the building.
All our aides, all our people here, would be able to join in.
All we need is a microphone, and if that is too much of a problem, then I would do my bit to get one.
I believe that an extraordinary action of this kind would send a strong signal that Europe is not willing to accept this spiral of violence in the Middle East.
Those were powerful images on Wednesday of all days, the most significant day for a peaceful solution in the Middle East.
I ask you, with your colleagues in the Conference of Presidents, to give some thought to that.
