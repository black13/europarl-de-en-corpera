Mr President, I will just come back to Mrs Read's remark and Mr Helmer's statements.
Mr Helmer obliges me to make a remark that I actually did not believe I would ever have to make.
I speak as one who, in this House during Mrs Fontaine's term of office, was often harshly critical of her.
I find myself now constrained to say that when Mr Helmer writes in his newsletter that Mrs Fontaine's statements bordered on Marxism or socialism, I must contradict him in the most emphatic terms.
Nicole Fontaine deserves many things, but to associate her with Marxism or socialism is false.
It is, Mr Helmer, as if one were to associate you with clever remarks.
That would be just as erroneous.
I must say that we cannot allow Members or representatives of this House to be smeared in this way, for, alongside the facetious comment, the recommendation that a representative of Parliament should call her book 'Mein Kampf' equates her with historical parallels which make it unacceptable in any way whatever.
I find that even in this House we have to be able to censure such a thing.
I will just ask the following of the ladies and gentlemen in the PPE-DE Group.
This House envisages that politicians of the same political orientation join together in a group - how can the PPE-DE's people actually sit together with such a man in the same group?
