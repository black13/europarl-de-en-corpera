Madam President, this Dutch initiative is fundamentally to be welcomed.
An initiative of this kind towards European cooperation in more effective prosecution of crime deserves support, especially when the crimes in question are as detestable as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
I aimed to keep the initiative on exchange of information among the contact points as simple as possible, something which the Germans and the Dutch supported in Council.
That being so, I would have considered it right to refer, in Article 2(2) to the law on judicial assistance between Member States currently in force and laid down in bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Whatever the rapporteur may think, such an agreement does indeed exist between all the Member States; it is the one that was adopted by the Council of Europe on 20 April 1959.
Over and above that, there is a new judicial assistance agreement dated May 2000, which is adapted to more modern circumstances but has not yet been ratified by all the Member States.
This new judicial assistance agreement would already represent a marked simplification, and would also make the creation of a new procedure superfluous.
Now, the rapporteur was in agreement with the reference to the existing agreement, but was not willing to support the deletion of the procedure in Articles 3 to 6, which was to be newly introduced.
As I did not want to risk the committee adopting such a contradictory report, I finally refrained from submitting the amendments I have referred to, but I still have serious misgivings.
Equally, though, I would like to emphasise that I see the creation of a European network of contact points as extraordinarily important.
I also hope that the success of this network and of this important initiative will not be impaired by procedural disputes.
I congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report.
