Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why are the proposals now put before us so important?
Some Member States have indeed so far neglected to adequately back up Community regulations on environmental protection with the threat of sanctions.
It was thus that the number of violations in the environmental field identified by the Commission rose from 612 in 1999 to 755 in 2000.
As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to add that such cases are increasingly brought to light as a result of petitions being submitted.
It is our EU's citizens themselves who have developed a feel for environmental concerns and who increasingly report such offences or who turn to us in search of help for frequent lack of protection on the part of their Member State.
It would, then, be great if governments could demonstrate something like the same degree of environmental awareness as do their citizens.
In 2000, the Commission took Member States to the European Court of Justice in connection with 39 cases, and so it is time for us to respond on an EU-wide basis.
In doing so, it is not our intention to annul national criminal law - the directive applies only to activities in defence of Community environment law and the regulations by means of which the Member States have hitherto transposed it.
We are laying down only minimum requirements for the protection of the environment through criminal law, so that the retention or creation of stricter safeguards is left to the Member States.
What this directive combats above all is environmental pollution that is attributable to private individuals or corporate bodies, in which respect inducement must incur a penalty in the same way as active behaviour and failure to act where there is a legal duty to do so.
Environmental offences still appear to be regarded as excusable peccadilloes in some Member States.
That must come to an end.
The directive, like the framework decision, is necessary, appropriate, and proportionate to that purpose.
