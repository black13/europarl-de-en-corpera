Madam President, we can agree to this request for urgent procedure if this is dealt with at the second April part-session, when we will also know how the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market interprets the law.
Although we do not agree with changing the legal basis, we are prepared, subject to these conditions, to discuss this at the second April part-session.
