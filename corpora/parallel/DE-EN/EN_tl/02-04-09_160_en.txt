Mr President, dividing the world into good and evil is not a very helpful definition when it comes to an active peace policy, especially if good and evil are defined in a one-sided way to suit particular interests.
Every military conflict has a history.
For example, we should not forget that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was supported and promoted by multinational oil interests, which is no secret.
Back at that stage the dangers that could result from support of that kind should have been pointed out.
The United States is now threatening to attack Iraq and possibly even other states such as Iran and North Korea; that is an incredibly dangerous game to play, and one that can easily get out of control.
The European Union needs to play a stronger role than it has up to now as the guardian of international law, something that requires us to have a high degree of independence and the courage of our convictions.
