Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Patten said that we should not underestimate the non-military aspects of the common foreign and security policy.
Quite right!
On the other hand, it is quite right to say, as Elmar Brok and Gary Titley have done, that our military expenditure is marked by a high level of inefficiency, particularly from a European point of view.
At present, procurement policy in many EU Member States has descended into a state of uncertainty and chaos.
That is an open secret.
We need the Council and the Commission jointly to appoint a person responsible for defence, and in particular for military procurement.
He or she would be accountable both to the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, Mr Solana, and also to Commissioners Patten and Liikanen, and would be charged with developing a common defence and procurement plan.
Commissioner Patten, the main issue here is not increased expenditure for military equipment, it is the question of a mutually acceptable procurement policy in the EU Member States that is above all appropriate for European defence.
That is what security, efficiency and thrift dictate.
