Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister Sharon promised his people that he would create greater security and peace.
In fact, his policies have lead to less security for Israel and less peace for the region as a whole.
We in Europe too should criticise what Israel has done, because we should measure Israel by the yardsticks that we have in common, those of constitutionality and the protection of human rights.
However, that statement should not obscure what this conflict is really all about.
It is about the right to exist, the very principle of Israel's right to exist, and not about that of the neighbouring Arab states.
One aspect of a secure existence is a life free from terror.
The Israelis have always been denied the right to a life free from terror.
Israel has constantly not only been threatened by terror, but terrorism has also been put into practice by organisations like Hamas and Jihad, who have been able to ply their bloody trade in the Palestinian areas almost with impunity.
Some responsibility for these acts of terrorism clearly lies with the Palestinian leader Mr Arafat, who has never firmly distanced himself from terrorism, let alone effectively fought against it.
The inadequate measures taken to combat terrorism have destroyed a great deal of trust.
We Europeans should not let our influence be diminished still further by creating the impression that we are no longer capable of distinguishing between cause and effect.
No conflict can be solved through terrorism and violence.
Accordingly both sides must end this violent conflict.
Israel must withdraw from the Palestinian areas.
The acts of terror by the Palestinians must cease.
We need to make demands of both sides.
