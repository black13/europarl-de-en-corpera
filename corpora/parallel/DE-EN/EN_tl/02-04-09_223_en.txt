Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I believe that it is vital for the Council to take a rapid decision on what we will be approving at second reading tomorrow.
The rapporteur has been very cautious.
He has not gone too far at second reading, because we want rapid results, as, let us be honest, it is a long time since the Erika II sank.
So we need to take measures without delay and I would like to point out that transponders are not only suitable for monitoring but first and foremost also for rescue purposes.
So if a vessel really gets into trouble at sea and can no longer set off an adequate distress signal, it can be reached and rescued more quickly by using transponders.
Our requests to the Council with regard to equipping vessels with transponders and voyage data recorders are really very modest.
We can only hope that the IMO will agree an accelerated timetable in the autumn, one that we can implement without delay.
Commissioner, the vital thing here is for us to react more quickly, and Mr Sterckx has been kind enough to give you three years to sort out compensation for ports that accommodate ships in distress.
The Erika need not have sunk if it could have entered the port, and it is therefore a reflection of the situation here.
We need ports that can accommodate ships in distress, but if those ports are to allow ships to enter, we need compensation arrangements.
Commissioner, I urge you to sort out those arrangements more quickly, because ports will then be far more willing to accommodate ships in distress and a case like that of the Erika II can be avoided.
