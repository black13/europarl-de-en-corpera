Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, on this milestone in environmental policy.
I would like to comment on two great causes of concern.
The first is that existing collection systems could be destroyed.
I do not share Mrs Jackson's viewpoint, in fact I believe that they could continue to operate.
But it would not be unreasonable if some change were necessary after ten years.
Secondly, cities and municipalities are terrified that it will be incredibly expensive for them.
However, it need not cost the municipality anything at all, because they would of course be able to recover the cost from consumers via waste charges.
I regard it as being very dangerous to take over costs from producers at least from the collection point.
In view of the late hour, I will take the liberty of becoming literary: I almost regard this as an un-European way of doing things.
One final word about Finland.
I am sorry for the Finns that things are in such a mess there, but it not the only thing to go wrong in Finland.
They even want to build a new nuclear power station!
