Mr President, this is the second reading on restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances.
I believe that we should be asking ourselves what we actually need this incredibly important product for.
PentaBDE is used exclusively in the manufacture of flexible foam for furniture and upholstery.
This is certainly a highly important area.
The Council common position is generally in line with the Commission's amended proposal, and I am delighted that the Council welcomes the amendment removing the derogation for octaBDE with a pentaBDE content of less than 5%.
It is also to be welcomed that the Council has partly accepted an amendment demanding that octaBDE with a pentaBDE content of over 0.1% should no longer be tolerated in view of the restrictions on the use of pentaBDE.
During the second reading in committee, my group fully supported all four amendments tabled by the rapporteur, as we also did at first reading, the aim of these being to achieve a ban on octaBDE.
We will of course also support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4.
As I am only speaking on behalf of Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, I shall take the liberty of using her words as regards the remaining amendments, which my group will not be supporting.
She felt that the other amendments were 'pure nonsense'.
