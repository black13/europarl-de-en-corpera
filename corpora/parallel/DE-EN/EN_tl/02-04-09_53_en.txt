Mr President, the EU's institutions continue to provide opportunities for major irregularities in the conduct of financial affairs.
The reason for these is still the weak points in the legislation, cooperation between national authorities that is poor or utterly lacking in coordination, and excessive laxity in monitoring and in imposing penalties.
This is again confirmed in the reports before us on the discharge procedure for 2000.
The Court, for example, did not name Member States that were negligent.
These Member States, whose lax monitoring undermines the combating of fraud, should not only be shown up, but should also make good the damage their laxity causes to the EU.
OLAF's work in connection with the travel expenses affair was equally inadequate.
In order to stem fraud, though, we also need radical reform of Europe's VAT system, for example, by abolishing the deduction of tax within the enterprise chain at national level as well, as it at present strongly favours VAT fraud.
