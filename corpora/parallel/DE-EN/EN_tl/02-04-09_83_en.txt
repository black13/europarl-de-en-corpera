Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor only in order to point out a small textual error that has crept in during the proceedings.
It is in Amendment No 15(1)(d).
The word 'relevant' needs to be inserted before the word 'premises'.
There are different versions of the text; in some of them the word is completely absent, whilst in others it has become 'any'.
I therefore ask for it to be corrected to read: 'relevant premises, land, or means of transport.'
