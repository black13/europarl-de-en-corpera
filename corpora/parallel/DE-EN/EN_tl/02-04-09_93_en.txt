Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report, although Austria was originally opposed to a directive.
I really would like to thank the rapporteur.
I welcome her work, by means of which a most effective option has been put in our hands, partly through Article 2's listing of all offences.
Another reason for me to vote in favour of it was that the Commission had declared in its document, albeit without binding itself, that it would consider preparing legislation that provided for sanctions under criminal law on illicit activities in connection with nuclear materials.
If there is any real threat not only to the environment but also to human beings, it is that posed by atomic waste.
I think it simply ridiculous that we have a whole list of offences without a single sanction being provided under criminal law for deliberate or even negligent acts and damage in the nuclear domain.
I strongly urge the Commission, which is now no longer present, to submit a directive on this as soon as possible, and I will be repeating this call in a question.
