Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted today against giving discharge to the Commission in respect of its management of the 2000 Budget.
My decision to do so was determined by the following considerations: EUR 11.6 billion, that is 14% of the overall Budget, have not been paid out.
I take that as a clear indicator of the Commission's mismanagement, and also as a trend, as the figures show an increase over 1999.
The 20% of the resources that have not been used in a regular manner is equal to double the previous year's figures.
The Court of Auditors has, for the seventh time in succession, refused to issue a statement of assurance.
New charges in the so-called van Buitenen report have been known to the Commission since August 2000, but no work has been done on them, and they have not been laid before Parliament, thus blocking my report on the Leonardo programme.
In the plenary debate yesterday, Mrs Schreyer, the Commissioner responsible, showed no capacity whatever for grasping the Commission's shortcomings, preferring to shift responsibility for any irregular outflow of resources onto the Member States, something with which we are abundantly familiar.
The Treaty establishing the European Community, however, speaks of the clear responsibility of the Commission.
Mr Kinnock, the Commissioner responsible for internal reform, does, admittedly talk a lot about reform, but, as the Court of Auditors has established, the reform process can as yet point to no measurable progress.
The Commission under President Prodi is, for the first time, attesting on its sole responsibility to the management of the 2000 Budget.
It can no longer pray in aid of the misdemeanours of its predecessors.
I have therefore, as in the two preceding years, voted against the discharge resolution.
