Mr President, my group has abstained in today's vote on the discharge for the Parliamentary budget.
This was essentially for the following reasons: we share with the drafters of the reports and of the amendments the view that clarity, transparency and regularity must prevail or be created, specifically when the position and responsibility of the groups in Parliament are at issue.
We do believe, though, that this cannot be done within the scope of a single discharge resolution, but that it calls for in-depth discussion and negotiations.
The same is true of the legal status of the assistants and the protection afforded them.
