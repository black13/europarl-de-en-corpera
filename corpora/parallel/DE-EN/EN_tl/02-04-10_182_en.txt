Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur has mentioned that it was not exactly easy to draw up an opinion for Parliament.
It contains a diversity of ideas, and I would like to pick up two main points, which refer to the procedure involved.
I can see the danger in the open coordination process being conducted only by officials and so-called experts without public discussion.
This topic is far too important to be permitted to be left exclusively to a closed circle in which far-reaching options are decided on.
We MEPs must therefore be involved in this issue as representatives of the public interest.
I will take this opportunity to reiterate the demand that we should have an interinstitutional agreement on the method of open coordination.
In conclusion, addressing the Commission and the Member States, I will repeat that we must achieve definite progress on the problems that bear down on Europe's people.
Pensions are one example of these.
We need a speedy revision of Regulation 1408/71 on the coordination of social security schemes.
We need simple rules on the transferability of occupational pensions.
We need solutions to the taxation of occupational pensions, which cannot be founded on open coordination alone, so Parliament must be brought in to represent the interests of Europe's people.
