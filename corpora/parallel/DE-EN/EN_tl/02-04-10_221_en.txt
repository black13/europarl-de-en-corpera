Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, and Mrs Damião, to whom many thanks for this very balanced report, I think it was not very easy to develop an approach for the future - which is what your report, my dear Elisa, has nevertheless done - from the many and various national regulatory arrangements in the EU.
It is precisely because asbestos is one of the most hazardous materials to work with that the most harmful types of it have been banned in almost every country in the world.
All the same, we occasionally have to contend with difficulties, and indeed with the dangers being minimised, even on a worldwide scale, as for example at present in the WTO with Canada.
From 2005, there will be a ban in Europe on the use and marketing of all types of asbestos.
That notwithstanding, Commissioner, we see your initiative for reform as necessary, as reform was overdue on specific points and aspects.
I therefore do not understand the position of the PPE-DE Group as just put forward by Mr Pérez Álvarez.
Of course it is sensible to extend protection to users and residents as well as workers.
We all know schools, sports facilities, and even European Union buildings, that have had to be closed due to contamination with asbestos and then laboriously and expensively renovated.
One important new essential is prevention, that is, education about the dangers of asbestos, and the greater responsibility of employers - not only the major employers, but also the small ones, including subcontractors, with atypical employment relationships of course included.
That too I see as being necessary.
Europe should set an example in the development and use of alternative materials.
That, rather than the export of asbestos to the rest of the world, is where our future lies.
