Mr President, Europe is, after all, about unity in diversity, and so I would like to put the following question.
How do you think the right of veto will develop?
This is a major and very important area for the smaller States.
Do you believe - and this also relates to the Convention - that the Council will in future consider the retention of the right of veto in certain areas indispensable?
