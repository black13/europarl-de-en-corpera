Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Ayuso most warmly for the work she has done.
The Common Market Organisation for agricultural alcohol was voted down in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We are convinced that the Commission should withdraw this proposal and revise it.
Whilst the Spanish Presidency would very much like to wrap this issue up during its term of office, I do not think this will be possible, quite simply because Parliament will not have produced a position for the Agriculture Council in due time.
There are three key issues; firstly, for example, the title of the act.
Is a Common Market Organisation appropriate, or a simple regulation?
Secondly, to what extent do we include synthetic alcohol?
Thirdly, is there the need for a regulation on state aid?
As discussions currently stand between Parliament and the Commission, these issues have not been resolved.
If the Commission were to abandon its dogmatic position on the Common Market Organisation, it could surely agree to the regulation providing for the purely statistical supervision of synthetic alcohol.
This way ahead would be possible even without extending the legal basis.
I reckon that a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers could adopt the lightweight Regulation that was originally called for.
I continue to be highly sceptical about the aid provisions, on which many questions remain unanswered.
On the issue of universal land use management across the whole of Europe, which includes the sparse areas, and also on the twofold task of agriculture, which is both the cultivation and raising of agricultural products and the care and maintenance of the cultivated landscape, we must support producers of agricultural alcohol through the production of corn, potatoes and fruit.
My appeal to the Commission is this: please, let us not needlessly wreck a system that works.
