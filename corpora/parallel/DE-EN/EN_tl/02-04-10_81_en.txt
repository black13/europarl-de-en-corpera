Mr President, I can well understand why the rapporteur is asking this question.
On the other hand all that this is about is a different legal assessment of the relevance of the Financial Regulation.
We believe that our amendment is clearer on this point.
But it actually does not make much difference which of the two amendments is adopted.
That is why I would request that we first vote on the Liberals' amendment and then on ours.
We believe that even taking into account the oral alteration we have a rather clearer amendment.
It will not, however, be of great consequence to either party, whatever is adopted.
