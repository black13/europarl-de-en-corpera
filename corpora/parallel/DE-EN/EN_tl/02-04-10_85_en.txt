Mr President, I should like to speak against the proposal, because it seems to me that Mrs Theato's reasoning is full of contradictions.
You see, on the one hand she said that she wanted the report to be referred back to committee, because she wanted to grant discharge to the Council soon.
But on the other hand it is well known in this House that in her very group there are those who have serious reservations about doing this at all.
At the same time, Mrs Morgan has made a proposal that would take away a lot of the pressure and difficulties associated with this particular issue and would constitute an elegant solution to this problem.
Incidentally, I would point out that we also need to make decisions on a whole series of other institutions, and I do not think that, on the basis of this contradictory reasoning, we should throw away an opportunity to resolve this problem elegantly.
We would be quite happy to address the questions raised by Mrs Theato next year.
