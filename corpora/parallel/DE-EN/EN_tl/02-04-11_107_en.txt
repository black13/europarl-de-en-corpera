Mr President, it is somewhat regrettable that the European Union does not have the competences in the area of culture and education that we might wish.
Mrs De Sarnez's report is for that reason a slight and modest start at getting appropriate steps underway in the international education market.
I hope that this initiative will be followed by many others.
One of the items listed is the inventory of student mobility, the obvious problem with which is that many students are already not taking the road abroad because they will later have substantial difficulties with recognition.
My own region, which is bilingual and at home in both Italian and German language areas, is also affected by this, but gets into difficulties simply because of the lack of recognition.
We hope that our young people, and many others from elsewhere, will be able to avoid these difficulties in the future.
