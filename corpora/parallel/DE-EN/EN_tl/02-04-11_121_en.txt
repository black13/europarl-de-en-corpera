Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are right: a serious political crisis is at hand in Moldova.
I do not share the opinion of the Council of Europe's rapporteur, who believes that there is still a chance of the government itself finding a solution to this political crisis.
I suspect that, following the vote on the lifting of the immunity of two opposition politicians - something I regard as irregular - the ruling parties see themselves as victors and do not grasp what three months of mass demonstrations mean, namely that they have forfeited the confidence placed in them and that they themselves are no longer in a position to lead their country out of the crisis at the present point in time.
I fear that the crisis in this utterly impoverished country will escalate and thus make it ungovernable.
I therefore believe that immediate action by the Council and the Commission is required and that they should not wait until the chestnuts are back in the fire.
It is my view that the following must be done.
The EU, the OSCE and the Council of Europe must form a troika to mount a short-term mission to the country.
This mission must reach agreement with the government as to what steps have to be taken in order for the crisis to be resolved.
Sanctions will also have to be discussed so that the government does not take these steps half-heartedly.
The steps required include, in my view, exemption from punishment for those who have protested peacefully in the past or may do so in the future, the withdrawal of all resolutions on the Russian language and on the teaching of history, the revocation of all the measures that amount to censorship of the media, and the securing of basic conditions for political and economic development.
