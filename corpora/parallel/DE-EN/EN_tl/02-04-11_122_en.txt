Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen - few on the ground though you may be - Moldova is a country with which the European Union has a privileged relationship.
It is also a TACIS recipient country and a country that may still be unstable, but is giving repeated consideration to strengthening its relations with the European Union and to perhaps, one, day, joining it.
Developments in that country are, though, deplorable in the extreme and give grave concern not only to us but also to most of its population.
There were, in any case, 80 000 people on the streets on 31 March, showing that quite a few are still going back on the streets to demonstrate despite repression and obstruction.
What worries us is the relationship between the government and the opposition, which is neither healthy not democratic, nor, in our view, acceptable.
We are, of course, concerned above all at the disappearance of a number of opposition politicians, including a number of highly prominent members of the opposition party and parliamentary deputies.
Some of them were threatened or assaulted before disappearing altogether.
That, as has already been said, is absolutely incompatible with democracy.
That other members of the parliamentary opposition have been threatened with the suspension of their immunity is also a cause for concern on our part.
That procedure is part of everyday normal life, but the way things stand in Moldova makes such suspension contrary to democratic practice.
This being so - and I do not want to repeat all that has been said by Mrs Schroedter - we cannot continue to be bystanders.
We must act, and act together.
It is not on for things to be done in the middle of Europe - and Moldova belongs to this Europe of ours, and is to be respected by us as such - that belong to the darkest days of dictatorship.
We find them unacceptable.
