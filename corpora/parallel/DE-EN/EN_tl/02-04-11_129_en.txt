Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that, some dozen years ago, the National League for Democracy gained an overwhelming election victory in Burma.
Since then, though, the will of the people - of all ethnic groups, let it be emphasised - has been trodden underfoot.
For a dozen years, the elected president has been under house arrest, citizens who prove to be disagreeably uncooperative have been thrown into jail, forced labour convicts have been mistreated, women have been abused and ethnic minorities harassed.
Trafficking in drugs, small arms and human beings are the order of the day.
For a dozen years, the international community has been pressing for a return to democracy - so far, unfortunately, in vain.
Yet the EU troika's indication of its willingness to enter into discussions - without, though, tying these to concessions - is right and should be welcomed.
The UN Special Envoy's efforts at getting dialogue started with the elected president and the SPDC and seeking out a starting point for democratic change are particularly deserving of support.
That Razali Ismail's visit, originally scheduled for March, has been delayed, gives little cause for optimism.
Those who lose by this are the people in the bitterly poor country, for whom things are constantly getting worse and of whose fate the democratic part of the world must not lose sight.
That it will not is also guaranteed by the European-Burmese Office, funded by the European Union and run in cooperation with the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, which has experience of promoting development and democracy.
This gives us hope for new impetus to perhaps take us a bit further forward, even if we will need staying power.
