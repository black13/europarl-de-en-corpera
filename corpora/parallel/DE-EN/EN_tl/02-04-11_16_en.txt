Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by offering my very special thanks to Mr Beazley for this report, because I think he has summed up Parliament's opinions in a particularly constructive way.
You can tell that by the fact that we adopted this report unanimously in committee and that, today in Parliament, there are no amendments to this report left, and that on a topic that involves a very large number of problems and unanswered questions.
So many thanks for it.
The work we are going to do will be on a very good foundation.
Our ongoing efforts will be particularly important because the future convergence of the media - television, computers, the Internet - will mean that we will have to find new ways to really guarantee that young people and human dignity will be protected.
The proposals submitted by the Commission are therefore very much the right thing, and the Member States' support for them is urgently needed.
I would like to again go over the three points that I see as being the most important.
We need, firstly, new and more highly-developed models of self-regulation, enabling the industry and the responsible Governments to work together on a common basis.
It is for this purpose that the model of jointly-coordinated self-regulation has been devised, and we need to develop it further.
Secondly, it is not standards harmonised on a Europe-wide basis that we need, but Europe-wide minimum standards, particularly for video games and the Internet, in order to offer young people real protection.
And, thirdly, media education is needed not only for children but also for their parents.
All these tasks require involvement on the part of the Council, and it is to them, and for that, that I appeal.
