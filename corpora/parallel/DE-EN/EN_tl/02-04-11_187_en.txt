I did not want to say anything on this point, but rather on the agenda, in order to address an appeal to the bureau and to the Conference of Presidents concerning the use we make of our sittings.
On Tuesday, Mr President, Question Time was omitted because we had such a full agenda, which was actually contrary to the Treaties and to the Rules of Procedure.
Yesterday, Wednesday, Questions to the Council were cut by 35 minutes because the agenda was so full up.
We have had a less tight agenda today and are finishing as early as 5.36 p.m.
I wish to ask that the sittings be organised better.
We are no less numerous today than at the earlier part-sessions, when Thursday's sitting went on until 6.30 p.m., or fewer in number than we used to be on Fridays - or maybe perhaps we are -- and there are no fewer of us here today than there will be tomorrow, which is Friday.
So I ask for better use to be made of Thursday afternoons than hitherto and for action on the principle that those who leave have only themselves to blame.
