Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this interesting report.
Collaboration at the academic and cultural level in Europe does of course need to be improved, but educational differences in certain areas, which produce different results, form part of Member States' national traditions.
This only becomes dangerous if education fails to reach a certain standard.
In the past, for example, this often led to the situation in which graduates in medicine from one Member States were not, because of educational standards, permitted to work in others.
Crossing borders when changing from one university to another also becomes impossible if the same minimum standard is not guaranteed.
The announcement of academic and cultural cooperation with candidate states is, however, particularly to be welcomed.
We who live on the border with Eastern Europe know these countries very well.
Many here will be astonished to learn that, in the twin areas of culture and education, we might even have a few things to learn from the Eastern European candidate states.
