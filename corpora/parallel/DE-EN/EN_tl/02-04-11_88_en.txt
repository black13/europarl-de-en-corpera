I have just voted in favour of Mr Gra√ßa Moura's report on the EU's strategy towards China and have consequently supported various amendments.
Thousands of nuns and monks are continuing to be persecuted, imprisoned and mistreated.
Tibet's cultural and religious autonomy is being denied.
There is systematic settlement by Chinese people, so that Tibetans are increasingly becoming a minority in their own country.
The report is right to take up Parliament's repeated call for the appointment of an EU special representative for Tibet.
It also recalls the resolution of two years ago, in which Parliament called on the EU Member States to recognise the Tibetan government-in-exile within three years in the event of the Tibetan situation stagnating or getting worse.
There is no alternative to a peaceful solution in the form of negotiations between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama - without any preconditions.
As president of the Tibet Intergroup, I see complete autonomy for Tibet as a core objective.
Such a bilateral solution should also be advantageous to the Chinese, who are concerned about their international reputation.
Its starting point is the Dalai Lama's five-point plan and the speech he gave to our plenary meeting on 24 October 2001.
What I find most lamentable is the attitude of the EU, which did not put China's human rights violations on the agenda at Geneva, preferring to deal with them in the context of the dialogue between the EU and China - and hence behind closed doors.
