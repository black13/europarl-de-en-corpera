Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is to the expertise of the delegations to the Conciliation Committee, and to their willingness to make progress on the issue of the protection of workers' health and safety that we owe the reaching of an agreement without the need for a formal conciliation procedure.
For this I would like especially to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, and the Spanish Presidency of the Council.
This instrument introducing measures to protect workers from risks in the workplace arising from vibration represents an important step in the improvement of workers' health and safety.
All workers in the Community are now ensured a minimum level of protection, which the individual Member States are able to go beyond.
As you know, it was decided in 1999 to divide the original Commission proposal, which had applied to all of the four areas of vibration, noise, electromagnetic fields and optical radiation, into four individual proposals.
The first step has now been taken and brought to its conclusion.
As the second reading in plenary at Parliament's March part-session showed, we can also point to good progress in the problem area of noise.
I am relying on Parliament and the Council to start work shortly on the regulations on the other two physical agents - optical and electromagnetic radiation - so that we can at length complete the legal framework for these important aspects of health and safety at work.
