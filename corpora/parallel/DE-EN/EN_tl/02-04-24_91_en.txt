Mr President, the annual report on human rights in 2001 shows comprehensively that the human rights position across the world has deteriorated dramatically.
There have been 250 conflicts since the Second World War, and 86 million people have been killed in them.
Mr Van Hecke, our rapporteur, deserves our thanks for not having shied away from also addressing the present-day consequences of 11 September.
We are faced with the incomprehensible phenomenon of the crimes of 11 September being taken as an excuse to abrogate human rights that had been won over centuries of struggle, such as the Geneva Convention and the rule of law over nations.
Crimes are thus being used to abrogate international law, which is part of civilisation's cultural riches.
To such an extent has this become the case that we can observe something like a reversion to 'might is right' on an international scale.
To combine, as one sees fit, martial law with something alleged to be criminal law is utterly intolerable.
It is to be feared that the next step will be for the law of the strongest to even acquire some sort of legitimacy.
The European Union must counter these developments by demonstrating the courage of its own convictions to a high degree.
It cannot be acceptable for states to consciously place themselves outside the international judicial order, with the effect that they are thereby actively stimulating the spiral of violence and accelerating it still further.
