Mr President, considerations of time have hitherto prevented me from congratulating the rapporteur, but today it is out of conviction that I refrain from doing so.
Let me say at the outset that I support Mr Pirker's viewpoint, to which I refer in order to avoid repetition.
The report raises a number of issues which, as I see it, have not been resolved.
How will an equal distribution of applicants for asylum in the EU be achieved if standards vary because Member States are obliged to retain higher standards?
How is unrestricted freedom of movement for third-country nationals while their application for asylum is in progress to be reconciled with the public's need for security and with concerns that the procedure should be speeded up?
How do we explain to our citizens a regulation that ensures applicants for asylum access to the labour market as soon as possible, whilst they themselves may be unemployed?
If the way the EU worked were as transparent as we would all like it to be, one would end up wondering how our citizens would vote in response to proposals of this sort.
