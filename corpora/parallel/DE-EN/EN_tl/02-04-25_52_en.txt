Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was not in Monterrey, but I often travel in the ACP countries in Africa, where it is forcefully brought home to visitors how poor countries groan under the burden of debt.
The Cologne initiative on the remission of debt, though, can help alleviate this burden and inject new resources to bring about social benefits.
That is the object of the Council resolution and the Commission communication on the implementation of the HIPC Initiative.
Both of these are covered by the very balanced and excellent report which Mr Mantovani has presented, which sets out the new lines on which we, representing Europe, have to focus.
This, though, will not alter or reform the international financial architecture, for which there is a compelling need, quite apart from the question of how much is available in terms of resources, for there must be a paradigm shift in development cooperation, especially with the poorest countries.
That will not come about if we carry on as before; rather, we too are called upon to change our approach here too.
