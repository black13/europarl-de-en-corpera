Mr President, during her period of office, Mrs Fontaine introduced a rule, at the express wish of this Parliament's plenary, according to which speeches designated as points of order are to be made after the vote on the agenda.
Must I conclude from the practice you have introduced that you are again changing this rule and that, before every future plenary, I shall have to worry about what matters raised in my constituency I am to talk about here at 5 p.m.?
I believe this issue is of great interest to countless other MEPs assembled here who do not come from a certain part of the world.
Perhaps you could let me know.
(Applause)
