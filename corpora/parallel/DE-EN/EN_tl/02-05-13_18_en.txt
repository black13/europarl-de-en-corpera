Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rules of Procedure do not allow further proposals for the topical and urgent debate to be tabled at short notice.
Our delegation for cooperation with Georgia was in Georgia last week.
Since local government elections are taking place there on 2 June, we have enquired as to whether these elections are being conducted correctly.
We have learned that two parties have already been denied permission to take part in the elections, and we have also learned just now that a further party, namely that of the former president of the Parliament who left the Shevardnadze Party to found a new one, is also not being allowed to participate in the elections.
We should simply like to state the fact openly here and then, naturally, discuss the matter with the Commission and the Council.
We consider this a matter of great urgency, even though our May part-session does not allow any more urgency debates, for the local elections will already be over in June.
We are of the view that a reminder needs to be given about this.
We should like, however, to be given still more precise information by the Council and the Commission, for we are extremely concerned that elections are being held but are not being conducted democratically.
We should like to support Georgia's cause, but the bottom line is that democracy must prevail there.
I should like to have this recorded in the Minutes.
