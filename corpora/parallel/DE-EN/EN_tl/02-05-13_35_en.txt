Mr President, the word 'transparency' already has a noteworthy career behind it.
If, today, you go into modern search engines, you find 223 000 examples of its German equivalent in less than ten minutes.
No one would confuse the words 'transparent' and 'perspirant'.
'Transparent' is what your shirt may be, while 'perspiration' is what is sometimes seen under the arms.
If you search for 'transparency' and 'European Parliament' you find just 908 examples and, if you ask people out and about what they associate with 'transparency', they say it is what we still do not want to make transparent.
Moral: transparency which does not also bring the right people out in a sweat is worthless.
If this report now talks in terms of a milestone's having been reached on the road to more transparency in the European Union, that is something I would contest.
It is more than just nothing, but it is not much more than a pebble.
What we really need is transparency that is actually experienced.
A European transparency initiative - of the kind I have talked about on a number of occasions in Parliament - is in the process of being developed.
It goes beyond the self-congratulation syndrome of the European institutions and is aimed at making, if at all possible, all documents - even those in which people are really interested - publicly accessible.
On the basis of Regulation 201/204, we urgently need this examination that has already been talked about.
If we are concerned to be credible rather than hypocritical, I think our aim must be to do everything we can to copy the freedom of information act in what will hopefully be a future United States of Europe.
We can also learn more from Sweden in this area.
We all of us know that there is no democracy without transparency.
