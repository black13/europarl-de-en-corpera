Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem we are discussing is not Mrs Berger; the problem is the Council, and the discrepancy that we experience so often, between that which is aimed for and what actually results.
The Commission and the Council have set themselves and Parliament the goal of creating a coherent legal framework for electronic commerce, which is intended, over the coming years, to substantially push forward the integration of Europe's financial markets and enhance the capacity of Europe's financial services sector to compete across the world.
It is my - and our - opinion that this Common Position by the Council on the proposal for a directive on the distance marketing of financial services does insufficient justice to the endeavour to create a single European internal market.
The great gulf between what we ask for and what is implemented is to the detriment of all parties concerned, including, I believe, the consumers.
The objective that this proposal for a directive has in view - the guaranteeing of a high level of consumer protection in order to safeguard the free movement of financial services - means that the Member States should not be given the option of implementing other - perhaps more extensive - provisions in the areas harmonised by this directive.
I will give one reason why I call for this.
Recognising the possibility of withdrawal from contracts with effect from the moment they are entered into is not compatible with the provision of immediate cover, which is much in demand on the part of customers in the field of non-life insurance.
The regulation envisaged could have adverse effects on the services on offer to consumers.
An internal market requires harmonised regulations, and the objective must not be undermined by means of regulations which differ from one country to another.
We therefore ask you to adopt our amendments.
