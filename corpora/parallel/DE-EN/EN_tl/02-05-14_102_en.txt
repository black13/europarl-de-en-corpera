I wish to emphasise at the outset that I am unreservedly in favour of Parliament working in a transparent manner and also of all its documentation being made accessible to the public.
I nonetheless voted against Mrs Maij-Weggen's report.
Parliament has a political task, and, in the conciliation procedure between the Council and Parliament deals with political questions - sometimes sensitive ones - and the work of the delegations can even touch on live political issues.
I consider it irresponsible for us to make 'working documents' accessible to the public.
Official documents and working documents are quite different things.
The conciliation procedure in particular deals with the political implementation of different positions taken by the two institutions, Parliament and the Council.
If all the thinking set down in the working documents is made public at the outset, then we can give up politics.
The Council will be delighted to know in advance what Parliament has in mind.
