Tourism's future lies in the development of sustainable tourism which takes account of ecological considerations and promotes them.
In Austria, which is a tourist destination, the principle of sustainable development is of primary importance to the tourist sector.
Protection and maintenance of the countryside and of sensitive regions have demonstrated their potential for the future and are characteristic of our country's practice of what is termed 'soft tourism'.
I therefore expressly welcome the Commission's initiative to develop and implement an Agenda 21 to promote sustainable development of tourism in Europe.
It is to be hoped that this package of measures will mark a further step towards realising a European form of tourism that respects the environment and conserves resources.
