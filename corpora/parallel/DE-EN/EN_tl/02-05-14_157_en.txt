Mr President, I too voted in favour of the Stenmark report and would like to add that we all know that the costs of enlargement cannot at present be estimated, but that we have to take care that they do not exceed their limits, as the European public will take an unsympathetic view.
That means that we must make savings.
We often, and passionately, discuss the costs of translation, which are high and likely to rise in future.
We should instead be working towards being able to reduce the costs of a seat for Parliament.
The public does not understand how we can presume to say that we can solve Europe's problems when we are unable to agree on a location.
