Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's seat and meeting place on historic ground here in Strasbourg is certainly significant.
I do think, though, that this historical significance, by reason of which this long fought-over plot was sought out in the first place, gives us another task for the future: to enable Europe's citizens to continue to understand what Europe is all about.
Today, the man in the street asks us on various occasions why we cannot agree on a place to meet; this argument from history might well have been justified in the past, but cannot, I believe, have any validity in the future.
I believe it will be far more meaningful to make clear to people our desires for the future and the decisions we take about it here.
It surely cannot be that we are, at one and the same time, deciding on packages of austerity measures while spending a third of this House's costs on travel.
