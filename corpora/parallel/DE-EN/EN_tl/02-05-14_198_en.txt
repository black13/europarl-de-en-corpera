Mr President, the world has changed in recent years, and unfortunately not always in the direction of greater peace and security or more partnership and peaceful coexistence.
Since the Second World War, the peoples of the world have given the UN Security Council many rights and a high degree of responsibility for security and for maintaining peace.
Even if the Soviet Union no longer exists as a victorious power and as a former second superpower alongside the USA, Russia, as its successor state, is not an unimportant country.
Russia has nuclear weapons, it has boundless resources, and it has played a key role in shaping European and world history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
The expanded European Union has greater scope for partnership with Russia if the residual fears stemming from the Cold War can be overcome and if, for example, economic cooperation with the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe can be harnessed and not deliberately excluded.
If we wish to move away from a policy of conflict throughout Europe we should not create new confrontational situations based on a new geographical strategy.
We should instead offer Russia a genuine and practical partnership.
In doing that we certainly should not treat the number of meetings and summits as some kind of yardstick.
No, what we need to measure is real results.
Our area of common interest is so great that cooperation and economic partnership with Russia is the only reasonable way forward, which in the long run will be of benefit to both sides and will promote security and lessen social tensions.
