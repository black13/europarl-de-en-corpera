Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Hoff for her excellent report.
I think that it is much better than the first report, it is significantly better than the Commission document, and I very much hope that this report will go down in the history of this House, because it goes a great deal further and the cooperation involved in its preparation was outstanding.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for largely accepting my amendments.
There is of course a danger of us constantly hearing the same eloquent but trite speeches about how important cooperation is, and about how special Kaliningrad's situation is.
However, for the people of Kaliningrad there is a genuine fear, a fear based on reality, that the situation will deteriorate as regards transit arrangements, freedom of movement and cooperation between NGOs, leading to greater poverty and escalating unemployment.
That is why we need new approaches to the instruments available, new approaches to minor border traffic, new approaches to economic cooperation, new approaches to transnational cooperation and above all - and, Commissioner, I would like to appeal you once more about this - new approaches to the use of financial instruments.
A joint action plan also needs a joint fund.
