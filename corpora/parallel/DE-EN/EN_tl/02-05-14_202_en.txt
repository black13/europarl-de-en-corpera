Mr President, there can be no doubt that the EU-Russia Summit provides a great opportunity for a historic partnership.
This partnership, which needs to cover both economic and political matters, is one of the key requirements for a peace and stability policy in the twenty-first century.
Europe and Russia are a great deal more dependent on each other than might appear to be the case at first sight.
Whenever there has been strife between Europe and its individual states on the one hand and Russia on the other, this has had a major impact on world politics.
The present situation demands that we should create a starting point that prevents such conflicts arising in the long run.
This requires us to establish mutual respect and a basis of trust.
The Chechnya conflict is of course a major problem.
Above all, we need to be wary about unilaterally condemning Russia without taking into account the overall background to this conflict, such as the role of financiers, arms suppliers and raw materials interests.
