Mr President, thank you for giving me an opportunity to depart from the agenda and to address a comment to my colleague Magdalene Hoff.
We as the Group of the Party of European Socialists and as German Social Democrats in particular wish to thank Mrs Hoff for coming here today.
Despite her severe illness and the fact that she is confined to a wheelchair, Mrs Hoff, who has been a Member of the European Parliament since 1979, refused to forego the opportunity of presenting and defending her report in person, with the help of my colleague Erika Mann.
We Social Democrats who as German Members of Parliament have for many years had the pleasure of working with her, have only one thing to say: we are proud of our colleague!
I would like to present her with a bouquet of flowers, with your permission, Mr President, because there is no provision for such a thing in the Rules of Procedure.
I hope that I will be joined in this gesture not only by my Social Democrat colleagues but also by all Members of this House, who can be proud to have a fellow Member of her calibre in their midst.
