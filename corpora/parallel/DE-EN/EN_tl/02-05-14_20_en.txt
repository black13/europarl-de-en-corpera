Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is due to the imminent departure of the French Vice-President, Mr Noyer, that we are today debating the nomination of Mr Lukas Papademos.
On behalf of my group - and, I believe, on behalf of the whole House - I would like most warmly to thank the departing Vice-President for the excellent work he has done, as also exemplified by constant dialogue with Parliament and the favourable reception he gave to our arguments and proposals.
As its chairman has already said, the nomination of Lukas Papademos is supported unanimously by the committee.
There are, of course, reasons for this; his life, with a career in academic research and teaching, as well as a role as Governor and Vice-President of the Bank of Greece foreordain Lukas Papademos for this position.
If I may refer only to his two positions in Greece, he made, as Vice-President of Greece's central bank, a substantial contribution to the complete liberalisation of capital markets.
Apart from that, it was he who, as that bank's Governor, took Greece completely into the euro zone.
Let me also say that the hearing established beyond doubt that the new Vice-President of the ECB sees no contradiction between price stability on the one hand and growth and employment on the other; on the contrary, price stability is for him a precondition for the creation of growth and employment.
He therefore sees no reason to amend the treaty by which the ECB was set up.
Price stability is the task, cause and objective of the European Central Bank's policy.
I thank him for his proposals for greater transparency in announcing the European Central Bank's decisions in order to strengthen public confidence in the euro, and for his clear commitment to the European Central Bank's independence and to rejecting political interventions.
Together with the Council, we have made the right decision.
We wish him every success.
