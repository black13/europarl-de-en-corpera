Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to say that I regard the Commission's budgetary policy as a great achievement and to pay tribute to the competence with which it is implemented.
However, I believe that Basel II will be one of the biggest problems in the future, in fact the greatest danger for small and medium-sized enterprises since the Second World War, if we do not do our homework properly.
What do you think the impact of Basel II will be on the 40% of companies in Europe that do not have any equity capital, what will the impact be on tax revenue and what will the effect be on the candidate countries?
My second point is that at present our budgetary policy involves us dealing with countries that have both budget deficits and also high unemployment.
What programmes do you think would help to get these problems under control again?
