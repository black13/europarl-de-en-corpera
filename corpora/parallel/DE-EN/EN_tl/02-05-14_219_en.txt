Commissioner, in your report today you referred to the difficult revenue situation in the Member States, which is partly due to the structural reforms proposed by the Commission.
Is it not time to start concentrating more on structural deficits when considering deficits in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the stability and convergence programmes?
Or should we simply be insisting on qualification of expenditure as is the case in the USA when public finances are being discussed?
