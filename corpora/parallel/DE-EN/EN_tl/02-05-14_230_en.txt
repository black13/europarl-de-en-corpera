Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the publication of our Green Paper we, the Commission, have held wide-ranging discussions with all interested parties on the future of the common fisheries policy.
Many of the ideas that arose during these discussions were then taken on board in our proposals.
As part of the discussion of the proposals between the various cabinets, some new issues arose, issues that required in-depth responses and in some cases further analysis.
As I see it, we need to be in a position to undertake genuine reforms.
Another point here is the need to go into all issues in detail.
After all, this is ultimately not just about the Commission accepting my proposals, but also about an in-depth justification, particularly with a view to taking the wind out of the sails of potential opponents of reform.
We must make sure that the reform package is comprehensive and solid.
We have now made good progress with our work.
I am confident that I shall be presenting these proposals to the Commission at the end of this month.
Normally, the draft would only be deferred by one week, but for various reasons this period has been somewhat extended, partly because I was not available at certain times.
I intended, and indeed still intend, to present the draft to the Commission without any substantive changes in the proposals.
It is then of course up to the Commission to deliberate on this and to agree on a position acceptable to the majority of the Members of the Commission.
One last comment.
With regard to the procedure for rotating the Directors-General, I can assure you that there is no link between this and the proposals for reforming the common fisheries policy.
Preparations for a broadly based rotation have already been in hand for some time, and the fact that the rotation issue and the reform package have come at the same time is pure coincidence.
To suggest anything else would be quite wrong.
