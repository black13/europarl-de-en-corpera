Mr President, Mr Stevenson, I think there were two parts to your question.
The first was about timetabling.
Let me try to be as clear as possible: at the end of this month, or to be precise on the last Wednesday of this month, I will be presenting the proposal to the Commission and it will be discussed within the Commission.
That much is clear.
What is more, this does not have any effect on the delay in the decision-making process, because even if we had agreed the Commission's proposal three weeks ago, the timing of the first discussion in the Agriculture Council and also in this House would have been the same.
With regard to your second question, I would like to reiterate what I have said and assure you that I am certainly not willing to be persuaded by anyone to go beyond the framework of the discussions on the Green Paper and to discuss the Commission's proposals.
My intention is still to propose a substantial reform and no one from outside is or will be able to influence my position, and certainly not in any unacceptable way!
