Mrs Migu√©lez Ramos, I would like to remind you that in my introduction I clearly indicated that we originally brought forward a Green Paper a year ago, and that provided a basis for a wide-ranging debate.
The proposals that I intend to present will of course take into account the various comments, contributions and discussions that have taken place over the last few months, as far as that is possible and as far as it can be reconciled with the objectives for reform.
However, it will not be possible for any instructions to be given to the Commission.
The Commission is proceeding totally independently over this and accepts all responsibility, and it is in that spirit that it will be presenting the proposals.
