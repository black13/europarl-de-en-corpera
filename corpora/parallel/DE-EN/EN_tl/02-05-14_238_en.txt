Mr President, the issue of fisheries reform needs to be kept quite separate from the application of the rotation principle in the Commission.
I am in fact also a member of the Commission's 'reform group', and amongst other things I have always been in favour of this rotation principle applying to A1 and A2 officials, so that these top-level Commission officials should be regularly rotated.
There had already been a discussion at an earlier stage about Mr Schmidt possibly leaving during 2003, and I made it clear then that any change in the Director-General of Fisheries I had selected, and with whom I have a very good working relationship by the way, should take place either at the beginning of the reform, or at its conclusion, including the first phase of implementation.
I think it is irresponsible for us to be having a change in top-level posts now, just when contacts with the Member States in the Council, with Parliament and above all contacts with the stakeholders are to begin.
With my agreement, the Commission decided that this change should take place now, at the beginning, and that Mr Schmidt should be included in the package adopted.
It is highly regrettable that there have been communication problems and that Mr Schmidt was only informed of the Commission's decision at such short notice.
But I repeat that this has no connection with fisheries reform.
