Mr President, Mrs Zorba, ladies and gentlemen, I can only assure you once again, and I have also checked with the appropriate departments, that there will indeed be an action plan of this kind.
I totally recognise your concerns in connection with the forthcoming Olympic Games.
That is why we need such an action plan, which will take particular account of the need for doping checks and anti-doping measures.
