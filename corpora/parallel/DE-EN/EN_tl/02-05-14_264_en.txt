Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez, you are quite right in saying that with the Structural Funds we virtually end up refunding the Member States' expenditure.
That means that if no invoices are available, no payments can be made, whereas the LIFE programme works through direct implementation.
Last year there was some delay with certain invitations to tender.
Unfortunately, I am not in a position to tell you what the actual implementation rate was.
I will be very happy to let you have specific figures - very precise and detailed figures - in writing.
