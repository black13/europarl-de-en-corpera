Mr President, this is not a simple ethical issue.
It is about the taking of human lives for research purposes.
That is why I would like to put a very precise question to the Commissioner: can you guarantee that no European taxpayers could find themselves paying, through their taxes, for research that would be subject to legal penalties if it were being carried out in their own Member State?
