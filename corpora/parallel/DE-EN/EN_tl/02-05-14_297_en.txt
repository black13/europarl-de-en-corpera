Baroness Ludford, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 5 July 1994 on the Anastasiou case, Cypriot goods have privileged access to the EU market if accompanied by a certificate of origin issued by the relevant authorities in the Republic of Cyprus.
At present, Turkish Cypriot exporters based in Northern Cyprus are required to use the stamp of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
This Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not recognised under international law by any state in the entire world except Turkey.
That is why this stamp cannot be used as proof of the Cypriot origin of goods in accordance with the regulations.
On 5 August 1994 Cyprus's President Klerides formally notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations in writing that if the procedures laid down under national, European and international law were adhered to, Turkish Cypriots could export their goods in accordance with the same conditions as the population of the remainder of Cyprus.
This letter accordingly gave a clear political undertaking on the part of the Republic of Cyprus to issue certificates of origin at the request of Turkish Cypriot exporters.
It is therefore up to the Cypriots to reach agreement on how Turkish Cypriots are in practice to obtain certificates of origin issued by the Republic of Cyprus.
Baroness Ludford, I am sure that we both agree with all the Members of this House that it will only be possible to find a solution to this incredibly difficult problem as part of the solution to the Cyprus question as a whole.
That is why it is one of our objectives to solve this problem, which is also very unfortunate for Turkish Cypriots, so that the Cyprus question can be resolved this year before we take decisions on accession.
