Mr Duff, we are not refusing to trade with the Turkish Cypriots.
I very much agree with you that from the Commission's point of view the increased involvement of the northern part of Cyprus in trade is if anything highly desirable, because it is a very regrettable situation that the Greek part of the island is developing positively and rapidly whilst the Turkish part is sinking ever deeper into poverty.
We are not refusing to trade.
The problem is that the Turkish Cypriots are being prevented by their own 'authorities', and please note the quotation marks, from fulfilling the necessary requirements, by which I mean the certificates of origin that cannot be issued by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus but only by the Republic of Cyprus, which is recognised under international law.
There is nothing the Commission can do to change this perfectly clear legal situation.
We would undoubtedly be breaking the law if we were to behave any differently in this case.
