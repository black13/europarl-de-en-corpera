Mr Hatzidakis, I quite agree with you.
At present it is impossible to judge if the direct discussions in Cyprus about the resolution of the conflict will have the desired outcome.
The Commission fully supports the direct discussions between the leaders of the two communities and their declared intention of finding a solution by the end of June 2002.
The Turkish Cypriots have been invited to take part in the accession negotiations as part of the Cypriot delegation.
This invitation has been on the table since 1998, but the Turkish Cypriots have so far unfortunately not accepted it.
The present situation in Cyprus in no way alters the planned timetable for expansion.
The Helsinki Strategy remains equally valid.
The desired outcome is to solve the conflict, but that is not a prerequisite for Cyprus's accession.
The Council will make the final decision taking account of all relevant factors.
The Commission does not intend to send a note to the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, Rauf Denktash.
However, the Commission is willing to continue the dialogue with Mr Denktash.
I myself have had three detailed discussions with Mr Denktash during my period of office.
These discussions covered all the key political issues around Cyprus's accession to the EU and the resolution of the conflict.
