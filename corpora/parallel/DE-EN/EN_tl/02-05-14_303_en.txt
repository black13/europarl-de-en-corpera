Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
Every word I used was important.
The present situation in Cyprus in no way alters the planned timetable for expansion.
That means that the decision on accessions will be taken in Copenhagen at the end of this year, as planned.
As I can safely assume that the negotiations with Cyprus will have been concluded by then, and, as you know the negotiations with Cyprus are going extremely well, the decision about Cyprus will of course also be taken at the end of this year.
One of most important political messages I had to send during my most recent visit to Cyprus and also during my most recent visits to Turkey and Greece was that the timetable for expansion would be respected regardless of the situation in Cyprus.
