Mr Posselt, as far as the Commission is aware, Decree No 5 of 19 May 1945 has not been formally rescinded.
That decree is one of a number of decrees that has not had any fresh impact for a considerable time now.
The Commission regards it as being obsolete.
Censuses have been held in Czechoslovakia on the following dates since 8 May 1946: 1 March 1950, 1 March 1961, 1 December 1970, 1 November 1980 and 3 March 1991.
A census was also held on 1 March 2001 in the Czech Republic founded in 1993.
