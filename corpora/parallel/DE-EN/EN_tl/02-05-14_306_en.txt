Commissioner, this decree seems particularly important to me, because it also touches on a non-material but vital issue, that is to say 'National Reliability', which collectively takes away the rights of entire ethnic groups that following 1929 did something perfectly legal, by which I mean identifying with a defined language group.
Just a few months ago, at the German-Czech Coordination Council in Berlin a representative of the Czech ODS party denied that representatives of the German minority who were present were loyal to the Czech state.
So this is a very topical subject and I would like to ask you a very specific question: has the Czech Republic officially informed you that this decree is no longer in force?
