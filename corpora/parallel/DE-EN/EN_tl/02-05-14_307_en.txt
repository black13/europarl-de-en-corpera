Mr Posselt, you know as well as I do that when it comes to decrees concerned with expropriation and with nationality issues, there has been a whole series of declarations and decisions both by the Czech Constitutional Court and the Czech Parliament unanimously saying that these decrees no longer have any current effect.
The Czech parliament chose an expression which is translated into English as 'extinct', but the Commission prefers the term 'obsolete' here.
