Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are, by voting on the report on the Sixth Framework Programme, laying the foundation for projects to be supported to the tune of a total EUR 17.5 billion, which is a considerable amount of money.
What was made clear, as early as first reading, by the incredible number of amendments, is just to what an extent views differ in this House on what form the Framework Programme should take.
Diametrically opposed positions are appearing now at second reading when it comes to the definition of basic ethical principles.
Opinions differ to too great a degree for there to be ready compromise, in the Community of Fifteen, on the boundaries of stem cell research.
We will certainly be concerning ourselves more in future with questions of bioethics.
I have my own difficulties with the use of embryos for research.
Most of all, I cannot approve of European research funds being used to promote something which, in many of the fifteen Member States, is illegal.
