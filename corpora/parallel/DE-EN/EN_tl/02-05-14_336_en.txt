Mr President, I believe that the proposal we have before us for a Council regulation in which animal-health rules are to be made more transparent and the existing directives brought together in a single text represents a further step towards simplifying agriculture policy in this area and above all towards creating a legal basis for controls on various activities.
I certainly hope it will work out that way.
However, I would also like to make a special plea for scientific research into products of animal origin to be continued on living animals in the case of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease for example, and that this should then be applied in an affordable way.
High new technical and organisational standards need to be practical, and by that I also mean affordable.
I also particularly have in mind food imports from third countries.
At the same time - and I am just finishing now - we need to provide sufficiently serious support for the many consumer protection organisations.
