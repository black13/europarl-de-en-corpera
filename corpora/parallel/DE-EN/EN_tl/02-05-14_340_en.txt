Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schnellhardt has presented two expert and in-depth reports which clearly improve the Commission's proposals on food hygiene.
In future, food producers and processors will have to document all steps in the production and processing chain.
This obligation also extends to the feedstuffs used and the state of health of animals.
This means that in future consumers in the EU will be able to trace food and food ingredients from the shop counter back to the producer.
A transparent production chain will thus be guaranteed both for major companies and for SMEs.
At this point I would like to make a particular point about SMEs in the meat processing business.
In the European Union, there are around 150 000 small-scale butchery workshops with a total of over 1 million employees and an annual turnover of around EUR 60 billion.
It is these small workshops that ensure local supplies and maintain a variety of products in rural areas.
They use their special skills to produce local specialities and make an important contribution to Europe's delicatessens.
The close contact between them and the consumer creates confidence in the quality and safety of their products.
That is why we need to pay special attention to the needs of small businesses and to come up with suitable and practical legal arrangements for these companies, which offer people in Europe so many jobs and training opportunities.
I have tabled an amendment jointly with the rapporteur which relates specially to single-place slaughter in butcher's workshops because in addition to rules governing slaughter lines in large slaughterhouses we also need to take account of the conditions that prevail in small-scale slaughter operations.
If sufficient care and expertise is applied, single-place slaughter can be carried out in perfectly hygienic conditions.
That is why I urge you to support Amendment No 133.
