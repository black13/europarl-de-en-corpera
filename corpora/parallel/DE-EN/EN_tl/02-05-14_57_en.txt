Mr President, it is clear that the costs of enlargement are at the present moment difficult to estimate, but it must also be clear to us that they must not, in future, be allowed to exceed their limits.
The economic data for our EU as regards employment and economic growth are not particularly good, and, in addition, the fiscal burden in Europe, which is to be borne by the citizen, has reached an all-time high of 46%.
Put in clear terms, this means that the Member States will have to manage without tax revenues from 2003 until 2008, as prevailing tax rates are too high and must be reduced absolutely.
That is also what we in this House have committed ourselves to.
At the same time, the Member States' budgets will not be able to cope with any additional burdens, the payment of higher contributions being one example.
The EU's citizens will not accept higher tax burdens.
If we decide on them all the same, the political landscape of the EU is likely to change in the future and probably not to Europe's advantage.
It is highly likely that, at the next elections, the voters will tell us what they think about it.
