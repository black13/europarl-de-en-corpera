Mr President, I would like to respond to the Commissioner's position by saying, in my capacity as rapporteur, that it corresponds completely with my recommendation to this House.
Let me say, for the information of Members of this House, that, at any rate in the German version produced by our interpreters, whenever the Commissioner spoke of amendments, the word was rendered as 'articles'.
The numbers that the Commissioner has cited refer, however, to the amendments rather than to the articles of the original text.
My group asked for these to be voted on separately, but I can withdraw this request.
A mistake has been made.
This means that Amendments Nos 13 to 23, which were to be voted on separately, can now be voted on en bloc.
