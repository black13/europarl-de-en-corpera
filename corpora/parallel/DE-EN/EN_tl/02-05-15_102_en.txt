I welcome the differentiated approach taken by the Commission in order to guarantee a high level of health protection using specific hygiene rules for food.
That these rules also apply to wild game on sale to consumers in large quantities is only logical.
Nonetheless, we really must make a distinction between commercial marketing and the private consumption of game bagged in small quantities.
Hunters who give away or sell small quantities of game directly to the local retail trade after the hunt cannot and should not have to meet the same requirements as large meat-processing factories.
We need specific rules for hunters which reflect common practice.
However right and welcome these new rules are, private hunters must be exempted from them.
Our hunters already know a great deal about game hygiene and diseases.
Trained hunters already take full responsibility for the healthy state of the game which they provide and will continue to do so in future.
The European Parliament Committee on the Environment has accepted several proposed amendments which allow flexibility in the marketing of game and game meat without jeopardising food safety and I urgently call on the whole House to support these amendments.
