Mr President, Madrid is a summit of Heads of State and Government.
But may I take this opportunity to point out in all modesty that the European Parliament has cultivated very close relations with Latin American parliamentarians for years now; in fact, the longest-standing relations between the European Parliament and other parliaments are with Latin America and date back to the early 1970s.
How Latin America develops over the coming years and decades will also depend to a very considerable degree on its relations with Europe.
I think that we underestimate our potential.
I should like to make the point here that relations with Latin America must, above all, include a scientific and technical dimension, an industrial dimension, as we have with the United States -why not with Latin America as well?
May I remind you that Europe's two biggest scientific institutes are in Latin America: the ESO or European Southern Observatory in Chile, which has done a great deal for astrophysics in Chile, and our space centre in Kourou, because French Guyana is also on Latin American soil.
I also advocate intensive dialogue involving industry in Europe and Latin America.
Something along these lines began with Mercosur and could be extended to the whole of Latin America.
Mr Patten rightly referred to Kyoto and climate policy.
If I had the time, I could work out what emissions trading might mean in the future for Latin America.
The President has signalled to me that I do not have the time.
If I did, I would work it out for you and you would be astounded at the possibilities it encompasses.
In short, we have a great many opportunities for relations with Latin America.
We must use them, not just talk about them!
