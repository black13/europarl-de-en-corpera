Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of recruitment is important because it is a question of objectivity.
Whether we like it or not, we need criteria for recruitment.
We know that age, quotas for women and quotas for countries are often used as recruitment criteria.
My question - and this qualification needs to be set out - is: are there any plans to obtain professional advice here in the future, perhaps to instruct recruitment consultants to deal with this question, so that the best possible staff can be recruited in the future?
