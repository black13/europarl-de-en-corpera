Mr President, I had the honour of initiating both the police academy and the border police and the House adopted my report on them almost unanimously back in 1998, which is why I am delighted to see that things are now beginning to move four years later.
However, I have two specific supplementary questions.
First, the headquarters of the police academy: when do you think the location will finally be decided and which Member States have applied for it?
My second question concerns the border police.
Will the feasibility study be submitted to the European Parliament in June so that we too can debate it?
