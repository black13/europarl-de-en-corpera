Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to join those who have congratulated Mr Lamassoure on his excellent report, and, if time permits, to take up three points in it.
The first has to do with the subsidiarity principle and the monitoring of how it is adhered to.
I would have liked us to have granted right of action to those regions that possess the right to enact legislation.
I do not know whether we will find a majority in support of that, but I would think it right and proper, and a step in the right direction, to at least grant that right of action to the national Parliaments.
Taking the review clause as my second point, I consider it of extraordinary importance that Mr Lamassoure makes it clear that this can work in both directions.
I believe that future negotiations will depend on that to a very significant degree.
Thirdly, the report refers to improvement of the legislative process, which must, for a start, involve the legislative function being, as Mr Lamassoure proposes, more clearly demarcated from the executive - and that includes the terminology used.
It involves the EU's lawmaking being relieved of the burden of technical details.
I would like to add that the agreements reached between the three institutions on the basis of the proposals in the financial services area are not yet adequate to deal with democratic control, but that they can at least serve to point the right way ahead.
