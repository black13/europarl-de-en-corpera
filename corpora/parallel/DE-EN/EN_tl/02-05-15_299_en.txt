Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Lamassoure, to whom many thanks, people in my country understand things very well, as 53% of them think that the European Union will become more important in the next few years.
At the same time, seven out of ten of them assert that too little account is taken of the interests of the individual citizen.
I attribute this tension to the fact that the realities of the decision-making and opinion-forming process not being sufficiently clearly and transparently communicated.
Mr Lamassoure's report is helpful precisely because it very clearly highlights the mutual involvement and interaction between citizens, communities, regions, nations and Europe.
The EU is not somewhere else; rather, we all make up Europe.
No decisions are reached without the agreement of the Member States, and therefore without the national parliaments, when they see themselves as monitoring what the representatives of their national governments do in the Council.
Clear competences lead to clear responsibilities and clear parliamentary authority and thus to the decision-making process becoming more transparent.
I also think, though, that we have to make it clear that differing competences must not be allowed to lead to the blocking or delaying of jointly-agreed objectives such as the four freedoms, the financial services action plan or the internal market.
Differing competences must not be allowed to lead to the Commission's competence as guardian of the Treaties - in such matters as the Stability and Growth Pact - being nullified.
Not all the problems faced by our countries' regions can be resolved through Europe.
Co-decision by Parliament leads to greater transparency, more democracy, better control and hence to greater proximity to the public.
