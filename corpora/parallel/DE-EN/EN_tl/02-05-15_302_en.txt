Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the present allocation of competences between the EU and the Member States seems almost made to measure for populists of whatever stripe.
Whenever someone in the Member States wants to evade responsibility for something that is important and necessary, but unpopular, they can, with a true ring of conviction, shrug off responsibility onto the EU.
'My dear fellow-citizens, I would far rather do it another way, but Brussels will not let me!'
You can tell the voters anything you like, as they do not understand the allocation of competences.
In any case, the public are puzzled by the way powers are apportioned.
Never in the last fifty years has it been easy to understand, and today it has become incomprehensible.
The system of restricted prerogatives has become an unrestricted supermarket of European policies, an unworkable situation that we want to use the Lamassoure Report to fundamentally change; it is all about making things orderly, systematic and comprehensible.
Much of it, indeed most of it, appears to be well done.
There is one topic that I consider especially important, and I am glad that the rapporteur has taken on board one of my suggestions.
This is to do with future prohibition of what is termed the misuse of legal form.
In the past, when power to enact regulations or directives was lacking, the European institutions all too frequently resorted to sleight-of-hand and invented an action plan, a measure, a pilot project and more of the same thing.
The missing competence thus ceased to be a problem.
If we henceforth block this gate of entry into national powers, we will be closing Pandora's box, and thereby, I hope, making Europe a bit more straightforward and comprehensible, and therefore more acceptable in the eyes of its citizens.
