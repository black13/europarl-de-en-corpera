Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually also of the opinion that this report represents a genuine step forward in the debate on the competences of Europe - not only intellectually, but also politically.
I will thank Mr Lamassoure not only for thinking deeply, but also for listening intently during our debates.
Above all, I see this report as carrying two messages.
As MEPs, we also want to be given definite responsibilities.
Our defence against the charge of centralist interference is that it is clearly laid down what we are competent to do and what we are not competent to do.
The second message contained in the report is that we want more Europe in external relations, and more Europe in the worldwide representation of European interests, but that we are also ready to do without one thing or another in internal matters and leave detailed rules to the Member States.
It is interesting that a success has been made of decentralisation in recent years, not only in all the EU's Member States, but also in the acceding countries.
Even enterprises that work on a global scale act according to the principle of 'small units and big networks'.
Hence it is in our own interests that we should, as MEPs, concentrate on the core competences we possess and should also give that outward expression.
The Commission has been remarkably bold in this respect; you, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Barnier, and your fellow-Commissioner Mr Vitorino too, have had something to say about this yourselves.
This report offers our citizens - even the Euro-sceptics - a modern, effective, and transparent Europe.
