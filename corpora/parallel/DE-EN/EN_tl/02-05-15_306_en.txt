Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, our lengthy debate today has demonstrated that one topic on which we are taking a very positive line is the role of the regions in the European Union, and this has now, of course, been recognised in the Lamassoure Report.
It is planned that a special report on the role of the regions should be introduced, but I do think that our long debate might also have the result that, tomorrow morning, we get together and reconsider whether what we have just said might yet, in rather more definite form - on which point various groups have submitted amendments - be incorporated into the report.
The second point I would like to address concerns the powers reserved to the EU.
Mr Lamassoure quite rightly pointed out that external economic relations certainly belong in this category, being a very important area, and one in which the state of affairs is such that the Commission can arrange things properly, with the Council of Ministers helping with the orientation, but Parliament, in utter contrast to the US Congress, has almost no opportunity to influence matters.
The practical cooperation that we engage in with the Commission is excellent, but I believe that things must not remain the way they are.
We need to come off better out of the dividing-up of these competences, as this is a matter of particular importance to this institution of ours.
Perhaps some consideration, which is certainly necessary, could yet be given to this topic as well in the Convention.
In any case, I think the regions are an important subject.
Let me thank Mr Lamassoure very warmly for his excellent report.
We are, though, in my opinion, a bit too timid when it comes to the regions.
We might be expected to do a bit more.
