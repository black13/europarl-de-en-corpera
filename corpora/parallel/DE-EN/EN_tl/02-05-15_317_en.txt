Mr President, we have today well-documented accounts, attested by experts, of the Gulf War and of the events that led up to it, which show that this war was preceded, or accompanied, by a massive campaign of disinformation.
The possibility cannot be excluded that various items of information on Iraq are still being disseminated for strategic reasons.
This should not be imputed to the rapporteur, nor is it a justification of Saddam Hussein.
We must not forget, though, that, until he invaded Kuwait, Saddam Hussein was a very good friend of the West.
Today, the people of Iraq need peace, and sanctions, as a senior UN official reported only recently, are leading to a kind of genocide in that country.
I dare say that the report in its present form will not help to alleviate the suffering of the people of Iraq.
The amendments tabled by Mr Wurtz and Mr Sakellariou are very much to be supported.
