Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on this report.
They rightly assume that we need a proper partnership between Europe and the USA.
And partnership means that both partners have equal rights, although they need not and perhaps should not be identical.
For example, we have different concepts of security and security risks.
We place greater emphasis on the economic, social and ecological aspects of security and security risks and we need to introduce this into the debate.
But we Europeans must admit that security does not come cheap and that perhaps we need to spend even more in order to achieve it.
However, it would be a mistake to say that we need the same level of military spending as the United States of America.
No, what we need most of all is more efficient spending.
What we need is more efficient civil spending which accounts for a higher and probably more significant - by which I also mean materially significant - proportion.
And that will only happen if we move towards common European defence structures.
I hope that Mr Elles is willing to move with us in this direction and create common European defence structures one step at a time.
