Mr President, I basically want to state my views on two proposed amendments in the Schnellhardt report, namely Amendments Nos 129 and 82, and to confirm that I voted in favour of them.
On balance, this is a very even-handed report and I congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his hard work.
I think it is clear from Plenary's acceptance of these two amendments that a sensible compromise can be found between the need for European rules and the use of common sense where small quantities are involved.
In addition, subsidiarity can also be sensibly applied to hygiene rules for hunting and I trust that the provisions in question will find their way into national regulations.
