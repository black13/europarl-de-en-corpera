Mr President, I wish to endorse Mr Posselt's comments.
On the one hand, we have a packed agenda for Tuesday and Wednesday.
We have night sittings and virtually no opportunity even to meet the visitors' groups who come here.
We have very little opportunity to do any of the paperwork which still arises during the week of plenary.
On the other hand, we have the scrappy arrangements on a Thursday afternoon, when time is wasted.
If I look around, I see far more visitors in the galleries than Members in the chamber.
There are empty seats everywhere.
I believe that it will damage the reputation of this Parliament if we continue with such uneven timetabling.
I would urge you to give this matter very careful consideration when drawing up the timetable for next year.
I have a draft copy in various versions and it seems to me that we should be dealing more efficiently and more economically with the time available to us.
I would very much appreciate it if you could give this matter serious thought and take it into account during planning.
Secondly, I would like to address a question to Mr Nielson, with your permission.
Mr Nielson, you were just talking about the budget arrangements which are the basis for your endeavours in the field of food aid.
Of course, I would like a little more explanation on this point, if I may.
I have been dealing with the budget in the committee which I represent for months.
We know that it is still with the Council at present, but Parliament, too, has a number of items which it would like to include in the budget.
We see that it is taking time.
Nonetheless, perhaps you could give us a clearer idea of what this means for you and your area of work.
I think that would be helpful for us.
