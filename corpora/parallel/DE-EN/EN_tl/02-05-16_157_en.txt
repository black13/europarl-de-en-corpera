Mr President, in Germany there is a sea shanty which begins with the words: "We were lying off Madagascar and had the plague on board".
Looking at the state of the country at present, you have the feeling that the whole island of Madagascar has the plague on board.
Not only is the humanitarian and economic situation at least as catastrophic as described in the motion before us; it is also mired in a bloody civil war and power struggle which threaten to split the country.
To make matters worse, floods have hit Madagascar in recent days.
Since yesterday, there has been massive flooding in Madagascar.
It really does seem as if the country has plague on all sides at once.
That is why we have an urgent humanitarian duty towards Madagascar, an ancient kingdom with a rich history, immense cultural diversity, and a natural beauty which is unique in the world.
I think that firstly, we should supply emergency relief to the flood victims and, secondly, take immediate action to alleviate the critical shortage of medicines.
Thirdly, we have a duty to provide help for economic reconstruction following the wholesale collapse of its industry, and finally, Mr President, we have a duty to mediate in this civil war and above all to support the efforts of Senegal's President Wade within the African context.
