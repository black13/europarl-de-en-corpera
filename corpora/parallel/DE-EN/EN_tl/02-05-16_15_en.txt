Mr President, of course it is depressing that so little has been achieved since the Earth Summit in Rio.
This excellent report confirms that.
I would like to highlight one aspect in particular.
I think Johannesburg must start here.
I think that in this House, we sometimes fail to recognise the opportunities afforded to us in this context by the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely the co-decision procedure.
We must wield this instrument with far more determination and vigour.
Indeed, in my view, the greater our resolution in influencing the passage of European legislation on environmental matters, the greater our credibility will be in Johannesburg and, of course, at future conferences too.
We must recognise that we need rather more self-confidence here and must sometimes endorse more stringent yet feasible demands.
We must also reject any notion that nuclear power has a role to play in future.
