Mr President, like the Northern Ireland conflict, the conflict in Indonesia is far from being a religious conflict.
The fanaticism merely disguises itself as religion.
In reality, these are ethnic conflicts with a very deep root, namely the Indonesian Government's Transmigrasi programme which attempts to resettle the population of the main islands to the other islands on a systematic basis.
The evidence for my theory can be found in the Moluccas, the old Christian Spice Islands, where there are conflicts between Christians and Muslim immigrants.
In Borneo, there is a similar conflict between adherents of the animist religions and the incoming Muslims.
In Aceh, the same problem occurs between the indigenous Muslim subjects of the old sultanate of Aceh and immigrants from the main islands such as Java and Sumatra.
In my view, it is essential to point out to the Government that it must halt this migration and shelve the artificial resettlement programmes, for otherwise, this massive country, which stretches from Australia to the Asian continent, will no longer hold together and will disintegrate.
