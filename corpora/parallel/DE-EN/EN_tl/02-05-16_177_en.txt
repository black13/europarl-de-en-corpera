Mr President, in the 1980s, there were violent clashes between Hindus and Sikhs, and in the early 1990s between Hindus and Muslims in Bombay and Uttar Pradesh.
Now violence has erupted in Gujarat, where murders, massacres and burnings alive by both sides have claimed around 1500 victims since February this year.
The Hindu nationalist parties justify their radicalism by referring to the spread of Islam in neighbour states and its influence on India.
The Indian Supreme Court's ruling of 13 March gives cause to hope that the violence will end.
The Court ruled that the land on which Hindu fanatics tore down a mosque to build a temple in 1992 may not be handed over to the radical Hindu organisation WHP.
Constitutional guarantees, such as the Muslim marriage law which upholds the traditions of Indian Muslims, are an expression of India's religious freedom and freedom of opinion.
Secularism is enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution of India.
Article 25, which guarantees the freedom to practise and propagate a religion, also imposes an obligation on the Indian State to protect all its citizens.
The ideal of peaceful co-existence between different ethnic communities and cultures is upheld as a principle.
The Indian Government has deployed a number of units of the army in an attempt to send out a clear signal to the world community that it is willing to end the violence.
It has also offered the relatives of the victims the prospect of an aid package amounting to around EUR 35 million.
The international criticism of many of the completely inadequate measures taken to deal with the radical movements has been acknowledged by the Indian Justice Minister in recent days, especially since India signed international human rights agreements a long time ago.
The PPE-DE Group believes that such insights should set a precedent.
