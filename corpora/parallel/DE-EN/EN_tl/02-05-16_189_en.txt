Mr President, I have another brief question for the Commissioner: is the Commission prepared to lobby actively to persuade the Council that the terms of reference of this high level troika which is due to visit southern Africa must not be watered down and restricted, but that the discussions and negotiations with Zimbabwe's neighbours in the region must genuinely reflect the gravity of the situation?
