Mr President, this afternoon, the debate was suspended twice for more than a quarter of an hour, firstly before the topical and urgent debate, and then again after that debate.
I just wanted to say this: I would ask that in future, whenever this occurs on a Thursday afternoon, the Sittings Service should amend the timetable by automatically adding an extra 20 minutes.
If it were to allocate 20 minutes more speaking time than before, this would work out exactly.
If, for once, everyone who was supposed to speak were actually here, as I would hope, the worst that could happen would be that the vote would take place at 5.45 p.m. instead of 5.30 p.m.
Until now, we have voted at 6.30 p.m. anyway.
I would be very grateful to you, Mr President, if you would tell the Sittings Service that they can be a bit more generous in their timetabling.
I was cut off relatively promptly by the previous President twice this afternoon.
I respect that, but in such instances, there should not be any gaps in the programme later.
