Mr President, the first sentence of paragraph 19 is translated incorrectly in the German version.
What our rapporteur Alain Lamassoure actually says in his own language is that the Union's own competences must remain small in number.
In German, it says here that the Union's own competences must remain limited.
That means something different.
If the Union has a competence in the area of customs policy, this competence is full and not limited.
The German version should therefore state: ".. takes the view that the number of own competences of the Union must remain limited".
I would ask for this correction to be made.
