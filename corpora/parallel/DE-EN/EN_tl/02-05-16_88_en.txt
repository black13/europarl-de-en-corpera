Mr President, I am aware that this explanation of vote is likely to be lost amid the general confusion, but perhaps it will be enough for the record.
The adoption of Mr Rothley's report on the fixing of book prices puts a temporary end to what is sometimes a very unwelcome development.
We owe a great debt of thanks to Mr Rothley and, indeed, to all those who have contributed to this process and ensured that despite our adherence to competition, culture is still considered an important asset and - prompted in this instance by the fixing of book prices in Germany and Austria - enabled a sensible rule to be established in future in this area, which has now been copied by France as well.
The attempts by this Commission and its predecessor to give far more priority to competition than culture have fortunately been shelved recently, and in this respect, I think we can claim to have taken a positive step.
