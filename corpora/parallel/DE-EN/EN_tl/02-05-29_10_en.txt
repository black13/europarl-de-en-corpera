Mr President, I would have kept my peace, had Mr Schulz refrained from making these comments.
I have no wish to make a snap judgment of the conduct of the government referred to by Mr Schulz, let alone the conduct of a member of the Commission.
But, my dear Mr Schulz, your comments would have had more credibility had you also criticised the fact that, when it was in line for a blue letter, the German Government put so much pressure on the Council of Ministers that in the end the letter was not sent.
You would have been more credible had you also had something to say when a member of your party in the Commission - I shall not name names because I do not want to open a can of worms - infringed Commission regulations.
Please be assured that I have no wish to rake over old ashes.
But you are being selective in your complaints and that casts doubt on your credibility, although it does not undermine what may well be well-founded criticism of the conduct of individual governments or Commissioners.
That is all I have to say.
We agreed that Commissioner Fischler should make a statement today.
Commissioner Fischler is most welcome.
But we should not make party political capital out of his statement.
(Applause)
