Mr President, here we are today discussing five initiatives from the Member States, and the Council is again conspicuous by its absence.
These initiatives may well be a good thing in themselves, but they are increasingly creating problems for us.
The problems arise because they are founded on a legal basis which often turns out to be absolutely unusable and we are then consulted, even if we do not absolutely have to be, as with the salary rise for the employees of Europol.
Let me say to the Council: Give them a decent income, so that Europol's staff are paid according to their performance, and so that they are motivated rather than frustrated.
You address problems, but end up proposing solutions that go against further integration.
Here again, I am referring to the Europol Convention.
We need quicker decisions, decisions reached by the Council on a majority basis.
These initiatives create difficulties for us when more and more new institutions are created, meaning more bureaucracy and more expense, but nobody can explain to us what added value these new networks, institutions and facilities bring to the European Union or to security.
Rather, these initiatives give the impression that activities are being announced without any desire to strive towards real solutions.
This plethora of initiatives increasingly clogs up our work in committee, with the result that tomorrow will probably see four of these five initiatives having to be rejected and one of them adopted only if amendments to it by Lord Stockton and others among us can actually be accepted.
All in all, that does not make for a good day for this form of parliamentarianism or for initiatives of this kind.
We have to consider whether future initiatives like these will require us, perhaps via the Convention, to take a new path in order to achieve sensible solutions in the interests of security and also of Parliament.
