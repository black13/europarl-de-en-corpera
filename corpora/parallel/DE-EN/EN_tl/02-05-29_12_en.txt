Mr President, two points.
First, we did in fact agree in the Conference of Presidents to discuss both issues.
We wanted to discuss them separately but we were told, no, it had to be in conjunction with the Commission statement.
You just have to agree at some point on what it is you want.
We are prepared to discuss it one way or the other.
But what we do not agree with is someone telling us, every time we decide something, that it has to be done the other way round and then turning it all round again!
Secondly, on the question of government intervention.
It may come as a surprise, but you are right to criticise the German Chancellor and he is right to criticise the government ...
(Interjection from Mr Poettering: then he should do both!)
... that is what I am saying!
Except that the Commissioners do not represent their governments, they represent the interests of the European Union.
The ministers represent governments and we have to make that perfectly clear to all our governments.
So instead of sitting here trying to represent parties and governments, let us join with the Commission in representing the interests of the European Union.
Agreed?
Agreed!
(Laughter, applause)
