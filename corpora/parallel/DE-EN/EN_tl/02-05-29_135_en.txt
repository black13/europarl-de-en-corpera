Mr President, both reports and most of the amendments are based on a political will to carry the Berlin decisions forward and to shape the enlargement of the Community on the basis of this European agricultural model.
The main issue is to maintain payments under the common market organisation, with quantity regulation needing to be achieved, as planned, by means of financial compensation.
This long-term approach has been one of the main pillars of the success of the common agricultural policy and it should not be underestimated.
It is certainly appropriate to increase competitivity at national level by means of cooperation models for developing rural areas as an economic factor in professional farming.
This presupposes high-quality production and a high degree of ecologically sound farming.
The main substance of both reports is that the multifunctionality of the European agricultural model needs to be secured in the long term.
Moving away from this model would mean standing still with regard to an approach that our citizens in the regions have only just begun to adopt.
What is lacking is a broad social debate about whether the risks of multifunctionality can be accepted.
I think they can.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I am against any economies of scale.
This is not something that the European agricultural model has called for up to now, and that is a testament to the common agricultural policy's scope for development and general possibilities.
