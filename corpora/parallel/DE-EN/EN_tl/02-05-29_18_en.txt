Mr President, I too have a procedural suggestion: not to comment further on what Mr Poettering has said.
That is no easy task and anyone who knows me knows that I shall have to exercise an inordinate amount of self-control!
The election campaign is due to start in Germany in a couple of weeks' time.
Mr Poettering has made it clear here that it has already begun.
Which is why I shall say no more.
But to have to bolster a motion in Parliament under the rules of procedure, which our group put on the agenda and the merits of which I have justified, by criticising your own government in order to be credible, takes the biscuit as far as party political statements goes!
Which is why it is you who are lacking in credibility!
We call for a vote on our motion.
