Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, exactly one year ago, on 14 May 2001, the Council authorised the Commission to launch a WTO dispute resolution procedure in order to prevent unfair competitive practices by the Republic of Korea.
Not only has there been no improvement since then, if anything the disparity has become even greater.
International competition is still being grossly distorted by South Korea's price dumping, meaning a further loss of world market share for the European Union.
There is a danger that these structural imbalances will become even more marked.
For example, South Korea's shipyards are making enormous efforts to get orders for certain types of ship, such as cruise ships, which up to now have been Europe's domain.
These continuing problems are putting a strain on a sector of European industry that has had to cope with a difficult adaptation process in recent years.
That applies both to capacity reduction and to the need to step up quality and productivity in the remaining yards.
The regional impact of this structural change has been and continues to be at its most severe in the peripheral regions.
If the very existence of Europe's shipbuilding industry is not to be jeopardised, the protection measures proposed by the Commission for the duration of the dispute resolution procedure are vital.
That is why it is important for the Council to approve time-limited protection measures of this kind immediately.
Furthermore, the procedures for levying anti-dumping and countervailing duties need to be consistently applied in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Up to now, threats have had no discernible effect on South Korea's behaviour.
It is now time for clear-cut action!
