Mr President, in the light of a very recent incident, I should like to make a statement, raise a security issue and warn everyone entering and leaving this House.
At about 6 p.m. yesterday evening, my assistant and I were mugged by a group of four or five young men at the visitors' entrance to the House.
My assistant's handbag was grabbed and her hand injured.
We were in the courtyard, in the security zone controlled by security cameras.
The attack was clearly filmed and I suggest that we all study it carefully.
I screamed and called for help and chased the perpetrators as far as the park.
Only once my assistant had picked herself up and gone into the House did she receive any support or help from the security staff.
From which I conclude that our security around the entrance is far from guaranteed.
My question is: why did the security guard not come to our aid?
He must have heard me and he did hear me.
What has Parliament done since the last such incident?
I call for a safety precinct or no-go zone round the House and at the access to the Eastman building, which we also use for our parliamentary work.
We cannot have gangs of muggers striking terror here in the House, while all the security service does is to search and harass our visitors, our assistants and sometimes even us.
