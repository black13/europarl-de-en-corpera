Mr President, there is just one thing to add to the important points raised by Mrs Kla√ü.
The whole incident was filmed.
So the time has come for you, Mr President, to take disciplinary measures against everyone who was in the vicinity on behalf of the security service and failed to intervene.
You should also file charges with the relevant criminal authorities on the grounds of failure to provide assistance!
