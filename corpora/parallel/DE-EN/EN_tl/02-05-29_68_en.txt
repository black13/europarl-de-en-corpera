Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur and everyone involved in this report.
I should also like to thank the Commissioner, who held a plethora of individual talks for the purpose of hearing our views and arguing his own.
That alone illustrates how sensitive this issue is.
We have before us a regulation which contains a derogation from competition law.
We believe that this derogation cannot be maintained in the long term.
Anyone who takes the view that freedom of establishment is one of the four freedoms and that competition is a fundamental factor in strengthening the internal market must say yes to both and to the basic idea behind Commissioner Monti's proposal.
And we shall do so.
But the point is, how can we bring the interested parties around to the idea of freedom of establishment and more competition?
The interested parties are the manufacturers, consumers and, in between them, the small and medium-sized businesses represented by dealers, workshops and sales.
We believe that it therefore comes down to the how and when of the changeover.
What Parliament has proposed are longer transitional periods, greater legal certainty and measures to maintain confidence, a yes to competition and protection for investments and new regulations for terminating agreements, even going as far as compensation if good faith is abused, together with a longer period and stronger form of notice.
Commissioner, we have said it all, the transitional period until 2005 and a facility for review were the core elements of the debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
What we now ask is that you accept that we support your basic line but that you meet us half way on implementation on the basis of Parliament's resolution.
