Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Party of European Socialists requested that today's agenda include a statement by the Council and the Commission on the common fisheries policy at the beginning of today's sitting.
Not only did it request this statement, it also requested a statement by the Commission and the Council on the common fisheries policy and on how the decisions behind the common fisheries policy are taken.
We requested this statement because the public is under the impression - an impression which the Spanish Government and its Minister of Agriculture have helped to create - that a Member State's government exerted an influence or pressure on one or more members of the Commission when these decisions were being taken.
That alone would be highly significant, given the relevance of this procedure to European law, which is why an explanation by the Council and the Commission on the matter, by which I mean on how these decisions are taken, would appear to be in order.
And we are doubly convinced that an explanation is in order following the article on the Commission's decisions in today's press and the massive criticism of the Commission's decisions voiced in an open letter by the Commissioner in question, Commissioner De Palacio, who was clearly put under pressure by her government and who obviously did not attend the crucial meeting of the Commission in person.
We saw the smoke at the time and now there appears to be a fire, which is why a debate in Parliament is called for, but not before the Council and the Commission have made a statement.
The Council is not here but could easily make a statement on its understanding of how these decisions come about at the forthcoming plenary sitting in Strasbourg.
But the Commission representative might at least add to today's statement on the common fisheries policy an explanation of how these common decisions are taken .
