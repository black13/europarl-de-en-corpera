I have not voted for the compromise motion of Article 15(1) proposed by Mrs Paciotti and Mrs Palacio.
The amendment to Article 15(1), which involves obliging the Member States to take steps to benefit national security among other things, is one that I regard as unbalanced.
Where the mandatory storage of data is concerned, the rights of national legislators are insufficiently restricted and their duties are inadequately defined.
The amendments made in Council mean that the Member States can require communications companies to systematically file all liable data from all users and make them available when authorised persons so request.
These amendments neither specify important criteria, nor do they specify which data are to be stored, nor over what period of time, nor who is to bear the costs (themselves dependent on the quantity and time period involved) associated with the storage and processing of the data.
This is left to the Member States.
Moreover, it is not clearly set out what requirements, standards for liability and security measures are to apply to those enterprises to which the storage of data is entrusted.
These issues are at present a matter within the third pillar.
Information has come into my hands indicating that a framework decision on mandatory storage is at present in preparation.
The topic is also being discussed with all the parties involved (among others, law enforcement agencies, communications companies, and persons involved in the protection of data) in the Cyber Crime Forum set up by the Commission.
(Statement of vote cut short in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
