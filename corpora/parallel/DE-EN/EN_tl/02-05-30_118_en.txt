I greatly welcome the decision to include the autobahn through the Fichtelgebirge in the Trans-European Networks.
Eastward enlargement, from which the border regions can derive great benefit, must not be allowed to be held up by traffic jams.
At the same time, there is a need to create an efficient road transport infrastructure to avoid the strain imposed by slow traffic.
The doubling of cross-border journeys is still something we have to reckon with.
