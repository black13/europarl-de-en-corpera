Madam President, I would like to say, with reference to Mr Konrad's report on the opening up of the motor trade and automotive services, that I take a thoroughly positive view of the initiatives taken by the Commission and by Commissioner Monti.
It was for that reason that I collaborated with the rapporteur in several attempts at finding new ways forward and making proposals, some of which were incorporated, in order to meet consumers and above all small and medium-sized enterprises halfway, and to support our smaller and weaker trading partners for the sake of more healthy competition.
I believe this to be necessary, and that there is no justification for the lobbying tactics and political interventions that were used to maintain certain monopolies.
I hope that the future will see further steps taken in this direction, founded on the compromise that has been adopted.
