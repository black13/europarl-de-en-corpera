There is no doubt that the Madrid Summit possesses political weight, as the states assembled at it represented 870 million people and one-quarter of the UN states.
The few partial successes such as the association agreement with Chile and Mexico have not made the balance sheet since the 1995 Rio Summit a convincing one; I doubt whether Madrid will, despite all its avowed intentions, achieve a breakthrough in improving the quality of relations between the EU and the Latin American and Caribbean states unless the following three issues are considered in a dispassionate and constructive way.
1.
Latin America is an interesting trading partner for Europe.
The German economy alone achieves a surplus of EUR 3 billion from trade with it, but the real beneficiary is the USA, which is engaged in pushing forward its geostrategic and economic interests by means of the ALCA free trade area and safeguarding them against external competition.
Europe is acting to its own detriment if, by failing to speak out against this or offer alternatives to it, it consigns Latin America to domination by North American corporations and banks.
2.
Nowhere more than in Latin America are the adverse consequences of untrammelled globalisation shown so blatantly, heralded by the growing pauperisation of great segments of the population, even including the middle classes, and also by the crisis in Argentina's financial system and government.
The Porto Alegre World Social Forum constitutes an opposing force, whose influence is also being felt in Europe.
