Mr President, the Commission has made a proposal, and Parliament has no amendments to put forward.
Those Member States that want to apply coal subsidies have to decide on this themselves and take responsibility for it, even bearing in mind that the subsidies are very high, and that the money involved could perhaps have been used to promote other, forward-looking, industries.
The European Union is being asked only because it has to rule on the compatibility of these subsidies with the European market.
A qualified majority in the Council is required for that, Madam Vice-President - and it is you personally that I am addressing, if you would be graciously pleased to listen to me.
It must not appear as if an essentially superfluous unanimity in the Council is being concocted, as is currently being attempted through an unparalleled deception after the example of the fraudulent Conference of Nice.
It is not on for manifestly illegal subsidies by other Member States to be sanctioned by means of a unanimous resolution, with, for example, French, Italian and Dutch subsidies to freight carriers being declared not to be detrimental to the common market.
That adds up, per annum and per lorry, to a subsidy of EUR 7 000 to the benefit of freight carriers in some countries and to the detriment of those in all the others.
That such a thing can be unanimously sanctioned in the Council, thus contravening the European Treaties, is a scandal!
Madam Vice-President, a policy of that sort flagrantly violates the Treaties, and does so with consequences that are incalculable.
I note that the conditions specified in the Treaties for such permission to be granted, even unanimously, are not fulfilled, and I call upon the Commission to contest these fraudulent outcomes of Council meetings in the European Court of Justice and, if possible, to put a stop to them.
