It is not, unfortunately, the first time that today's topic occupies us, nor, unfortunately, has anything changed for the better in the past months.
Although the Commission, when examining the competitive forces on the international stage, established that dumping was being practised and that competition was being blatantly distorted, the Council and the Commission have to date been neither prepared nor able to give the European shipbuilding industry effective support.
It is of course all too easy to point only to South Korea's policy of giving subsidies.
The existing situation is in every respect the result of the policy of global competition for sites, as advanced in the WTO by the Member States and by the Commission.
We have just heard the news of the bankruptcy of the modern shipyard at Stettin in Poland.
Thousands of jobs have been lost in a country preparing to join the EU and in any case faced with far-reaching upheavals.
Nobody in Europe can or should hope to profit from this.
Many of Europe's shipyards are located in less-favoured regions.
This has to do with the cataclysmic consequences of an employment policy and an industry policy whose significance for the regions affected is far more than merely economic.
That is why we cannot and will not accept the Council's and the Commission's failure to take practical action, and we expect further international efforts at resolving the problem.
