Madam President, I am able to agree with Mr Cocilovo, and also to go some of the way with Mr Sterckx.
We are dealing today with a slight reworking of the TENs.
The really major revision will be in 2004, when we will certainly put our heads together and draw up sensible amendments for them.
Thanks are due to the rapporteur for the work he has done, but also for the unsparing conclusion he draws.
What is crucial is that, of the fourteen Essen projects, three have been completed, which means that the Council had at that time bitten off more than it could chew.
Not listening to Parliament, it was guided by obstinacy rather than wisdom.
Nobody, not even Parliament, can lay down the law to a Member State when it comes to when and where this or that project is to be put into effect.
But, when a Member State says that it wants to have a project certified as being of European Community interest, then that Member State must comply with European conditions.
That is why the rapporteur's proposal - that, if a project is not completed within a specified time, it is taken off the priority list - is very good.
This proposal by the Commission is realistic and sensible.
It deals with environmentally friendly forms of transport, and, so, tomorrow, we should support it accordingly.
I can tell the Council that they would be well advised not to conjure up any conflict between the institutions on this point.
It would not be worth it, as we have already made a whole series of changes to the TENs.
That means that we should work together well...
(The President cut the speaker off.)
