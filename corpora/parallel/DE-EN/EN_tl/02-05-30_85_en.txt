Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to note when voting that Amendment No 1 must be based on the English version.
The German original text does not reproduce the resolutions passed in the Economic Affairs Committee.
This is due to an oversight.
That being so, we will, when voting, be voting for the English version.
I ask you to take note of this.
