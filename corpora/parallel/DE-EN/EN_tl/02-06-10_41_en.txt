Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Banotti for pointing out that we have had a problem with bacteria of this sort before - two years ago, in fact - and in the days before the Friday plenary sittings were done away with.
As this topic is back on the agenda in this part-session, I find it very interesting that these same bacteria should choose this of all times to put in a reappearance.
This is not to say that I do not take this matter seriously, or that thorough checks should not be made, but I do take the view that an objective examination should be carried out rather than inflaming emotions and mixing up different issues that have nothing to do with each other.
If there really is a problem with the building, then, for God's sake, we will just have to move into the Palais de l'Europe across the river.
We could be accommodated there for this part-session on a provisional basis.
I really do, though, want to take a stand against the ballyhoo and hysteria with which this serious topic is being treated.
