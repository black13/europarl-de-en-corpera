Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating both rapporteurs on this debate and on these reports.
Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would like to say that fourteen committees submitted opinions, so just reading all that and sorting through it was a great labour, Mr Corbett.
Many congratulations on your achievement.
For our part, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control worked on two issues.
One has to do with the Court of Auditors, and you have taken it on board in its entirety, notably the appointment of the Court's members as carried out by us in the committee and in plenary, which has been customary ever since Mr Lamassoure and Mr Bourlanges produced their reports in 1992 and 1995 respectively.
For the sake of the rules' clarity, that now has to be firmly established.
The second issue has to do with OLAF, and gave rise to much controversy as to how members should be treated by OLAF or should act in regard to it.
At the time, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control had delivered an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which, however, found its way into plenary by another route.
Our opinion was thus dropped at the time.
This then resulted in a complaint.
I think that now the time has come when we can consistently and properly put members in such a position as regards how they deal with OLAF and act in relation to it, that they are not lumped together with the administration.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has now tabled an amendment on this, and I wish to support it.
In the final analysis, it covers the amendment by the Committee on Budgetary Control which you have been unable to deal with in your report.
I would be happy if we could vote for it, and then we would no longer need the complaint and the appeal.
