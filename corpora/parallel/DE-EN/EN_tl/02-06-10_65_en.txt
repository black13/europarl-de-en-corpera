Mr President, following the Maastricht Treaty, I was joint rapporteur on the adjustments to the Rules of Procedure that became necessary.
I know just how laborious that is, and so my thanks and congratulations to Mr Corbett are all the more heartfelt.
Let me make a general comment before I deal with three points raised by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The objective of strengthening plenary and having the great political debates carried on here is a good one, but if you want to do that, you have to give the committees greater responsibility.
That is possible only if you raise the hurdles on the route from committee to plenary.
That is absolutely imperative.
What Mr Corbett and the committee are proposing is going in the right direction.
Perhaps we will have to go a little further in the future.
There were, and are, three points of importance to the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The first is legislative initiatives.
Outside, we call for Parliament to have the right to initiate legislation, a right which we have only in a very limited form.
The obstacles put in our way by Parliament itself are quite appalling.
To take just one example, an initiative by me on discrimination in legal aid was stuck in the Conference of Committee Chairmen for many, many months.
These are the obstacles you have to demolish.
The second point has to do with the votes to confirm the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole.
Here, the procedures in the Member States are utterly different.
In Parliament's present position, I consider a secret ballot rather than a roll call to be, in both instances, a very important safeguard for Parliament.
As a final point, I concur with what has been said about OLAF.
A large number in my group will give it their support.
