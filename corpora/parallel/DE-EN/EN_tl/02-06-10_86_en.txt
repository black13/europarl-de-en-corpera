Mr President, masochists still in the visitors' galleries, masochists here in plenary - all twenty of you! - what is being played here is 'Much Ado About Nothing'.
Is what is going on here in plenary 'As You Like It'?
Is it even 'What You Will'?
Surely not.
That is why we want to alter our Rules of Procedure, but we do not really dare to.
We will just go a little bit in the direction we have to go in, at a time when it is no longer great industrial armies, hosts of workers, or political parties' foot soldiers that count, but networks, connections and the individual.
We had to have Rules of Procedure in which individuals had as many rights as possible.
They do not.
Yet Mr Corbett is a bit daring, for he knows the Rules of Procedure inside out, or rather, he is allowed to take the risk.
Well done!
What we do not yet, though, trust ourselves to have, is an open debate.
Why not?
What are we ourselves afraid of?
Of people actually watching us?
Of them no longer seeing themselves as masochists, but rather really experiencing here what they learn at school, what democracy would mean if it were lived out?
It cannot be that.
But we can work at it, and that is why what we are debating here at the moment is as important as changes to the offside rule in football.
This is an abstract debate behind closed doors, now being played out again briefly by a number of Members, but with very wide-ranging effects.
I do think that we should support the attempt, at least, at considering how we can allow debates to be held which have an effect on the public and in which individual MEPs have rights too.
If we were to carry on that way, it would also mean that 'All's Well That Ends Well'.
That too is a play by Shakespeare, which he wrote in 1601.
If you are a sceptic, you look to 1610, when only the tempest is left.
Is that what you want?
