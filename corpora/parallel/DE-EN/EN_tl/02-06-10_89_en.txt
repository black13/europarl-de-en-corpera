Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rules of Procedure are the instruments which Parliament uses to regulate its work.
They are, in a manner of speaking, the calling card that we present to the world outside.
Being the only institution in the European Union to possess democratic legitimacy, Parliament is committed to the greatest possible transparency and clarity in the way it works, so that the citizens out there can also judge our working processes with an understanding of the thinking that underlies them.
It is only through those processes being as clear and simple as possible that we will achieve the public acceptance of our work that we desire.
A member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, in particular, sees any MEP's main right as being that of putting questions to the Commission and having them answered.
This right, of vital significance for the control of budgets in particular, is enshrined in Article 197 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities and in Rule 44 of the Rules of Procedure.
It is an expression of Parliamentary control over the administration and must not be restricted.
Attempts have, though, been made in the past to limit this right, for example by the framework agreement of July 2000, which restricts every MEP's access to documents and items of information.
It was not least for this reason that Parliament has decided to alter this framework agreement as soon as possible.
I take this opportunity to remind the President of his task in this respect.
I am very glad that the report before us makes clear, in a supplement on Rule 44, that the content of questions for written answer is the sole responsibility of the questioner.
This excludes the possibility of their being examined beforehand by the President or by a body of any kind.
In the past, this too was at least a matter of doubt.
