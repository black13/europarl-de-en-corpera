Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we have today shown such unanimity with regard to the Roth-Berendt Report.
I hope that our great strength of conviction will also turn out to have had an effect on the Commission.
I am in favour both of banning testing on animals and the marketing of the products tested.
I believe that the transitional periods have been extended too far.
It is for this reason that I would have preferred even shorter transitional periods.
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that this sort of trade in animals is going on, and only a couple of days ago, in the South Tyrol, the part of Upper Italy that I come from, a transaction of this kind was thwarted.
We were able to block the convoy and rescue the animals.
We know that that is not the solution.
The solution is regulation by the law.
I hope that we will put such legislation into effect as soon as possible.
Our contribution to it has now been made.
