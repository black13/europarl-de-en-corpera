Madam President, when I welcome parties of visitors to Strasbourg, I discover that the majority of these members of the public assume that MEPs are all elected under the same procedure and that we are all paid the same for the work that we do here.
They are all the more surprised to learn that these things are laid down on a national rather than European basis.
Elections to Europe's Parliament are conducted nationally with 15 different procedures which will be 25 once enlargement has taken place, and although we are doing the same work here, the way we are treated varies widely.
This makes it high time for us to get a European statute on MEPs and their work and, of course, for the procedure for European Parliamentary elections to be standardised to make it representative of Europe as a whole.
I also thank Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, who has made an important contribution to our next step towards a uniform election system.
I also want to point out the remaining loopholes that the Council has left.
One of them is the absence of Europe-wide lists in European elections.
We are all aware that the last European elections were almost purely national in character, dealing with internal policy disputes and having very little to do with what we are doing here and with what we are here for.
It is only when we have Europe-wide lists that the European parties will make the effort, and will endeavour to mobilise the public without reference to national borders.
This has not been achieved.
We urgently call on the Council to introduce Europe-wide lists when the electoral system is next revised.
I also agree with Mr van den Berg that it is impossible for us to vote from Thursday to Sunday, with the result being announced only after the votes cast on Thursday have been recorded on Sunday evening.
What has been put before us is a first step, and a good one.
The second step must be taken as a matter of urgency.
