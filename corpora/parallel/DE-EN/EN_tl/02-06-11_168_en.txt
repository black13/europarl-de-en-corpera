Mr President, we have to concede, and confess before every summit, that the sustainable development situation has got worse since the last one.
We are running the risk of the public, who play a crucial part in all our environmental decisions and projects, slowly becoming resigned to it.
The European Union's credibility in Johannesburg will be dependent on what we achieve here, on our ecological requirements and, not least, on the way we vote here throughout the year.
The industrialised states, above all the fifteen EU states, can very definitely be considered rich in economic terms, and if they are not in the lead by miles, we cannot demand that the developing countries make sacrifices.
I believe that what happens at the so-called environmental summits is not as decisive as what we bring to pass in our practical work between the summits and how we get it across to our citizens.
