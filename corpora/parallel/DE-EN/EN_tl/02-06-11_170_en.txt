Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want right now to join in the weeping and wailing over the fiasco in Bali, and I also propose to leave out the points that have already been addressed.
I would like to draw attention to the core areas which, notably with the Cotonou Agreement, we have resolved to do something about, first among them being the war on poverty.
That means seeing to basic services and health care, providing clean water for all, giving all children basic education, and, if possible, facilitating the participation of adults in educational programmes.
Now that is not an end in itself, but rather something without which, in the final analysis, it is impossible to gain an understanding of the problems that affect every society and everyone's quality of life.
Those for whom every day is a struggle for survival are not readily going to be won over by lofty objectives.
It is our responsibility to liberate them from the need to spend every day in search of food.
It should be noted in this context that women have a key role to play in all development, and that there must be forceful demands made in Johannesburg for us to help put women in a position to take an active part in the process of development and actively contribute to the improvement of living conditions.
All over the world, it is women who support development processes that lead to changes in civil society.
I would also like to mention the need to facilitate access to global communications in order to make social benefits possible.
In conclusion, I will not conceal my concern at the conduct of the Spanish Presidency, which is evidently aiming to abolish the Development Council.
That would send all the wrong signals to Johannesburg.
