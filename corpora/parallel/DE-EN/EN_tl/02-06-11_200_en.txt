Mr President, Commissioner, I have a question on the prohibited substances.
It is the case that, in future, certain substances will be banned in the European Union, as they have been in the past.
How will the Commission guarantee in future that these substances will be tested for in the Member States?
How are products containing these substances to be prevented from getting onto the market, as products containing nitrofen are at present managing to do in Germany?
They have been banned for some considerable time, during which nitrofen has not once been tested for.
When it was discovered, it was done so fortuitously.
