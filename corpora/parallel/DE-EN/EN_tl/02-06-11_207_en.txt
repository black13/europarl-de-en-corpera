Mr President, Commissioner, all credit to your consistent approach!
It is sometimes helpful in federal systems for their states to be forced to take consistent action in these matters.
I have three questions to put to you.
Firstly, do feedingstuffs not also have to be checked regularly, and not just the foodstuffs that, as it were, result from them?
Secondly, must this not apply particularly to imports from countries in which sprays containing nitrofen continue to be used or where large stocks of them are still available?
Thirdly, if you are - as you have hinted - resuming checks for nitrofen, are you working on the assumption that traces of nitrofen will be found in other countries and in the conventional farming sector as well?
