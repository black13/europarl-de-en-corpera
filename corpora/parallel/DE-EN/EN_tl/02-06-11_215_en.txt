Mr President, that remains the case.
I understand why Members from other countries are displeased.
Let me say as a German that I think what has happened in Germany is a scandal, and our farmers are the ones who are suffering from it.
Mrs KÃ¼nast, our Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture, has done nothing except make announcements at the top of her voice.
Functioning channels of communication need to be created, and very soon.
This has not been achieved.
At the time of the Lannoye report, our group wanted mandatory reporting by the authorities to start at an earlier date.
We asked for 2003, and 2005 was what we got.
What I want to ask the Commissioner is this: what do you think about that in the aftermath of this scandal?
Should we not, after all, impose this obligation on the authorities earlier?
