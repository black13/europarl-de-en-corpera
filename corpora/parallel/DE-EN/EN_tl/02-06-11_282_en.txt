Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the following assessment is of great and special importance for us, as bankruptcies have gone up over the past year by an average of 19% in the European Union, and in Germany by 32%.
As regards the impact assessment, Commissioner, will you now have it worked out in the planned Green Paper on entrepreneurship, what European legislation has contributed to it and what can be done so that there are fewer bankruptcies in future?
