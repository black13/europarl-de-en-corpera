Thank you, Commissioner, for giving such comprehensive information.
Mr Wuermeling and I are generally concerned about this as, in the border regions from which we come, the increase in the volume of traffic is not merely between 40% and 50%, but in excess of that figure.
People living along the main roads in border areas have to cope with traffic jams, noise and gas emissions.
When they travel to work, they constantly do so trailing behind HGVs from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
As a supplementary question, I would like to ask, as you have mentioned that railways are to receive special support, whether, in the meantime, measures have been taken or supported to transfer freight from road to rail in border regions, and whether you have had discussions about this with the German railways.
That is my supplementary question.
