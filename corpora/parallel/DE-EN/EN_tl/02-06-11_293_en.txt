Madam President, I am very grateful for that reply.
I must start by apologising for my somewhat late arrival, but I am glad that I managed to get here.
As you will be aware, we are reforming our Rules of Procedure, a process in which I play a part as a shadow rapporteur, and people are getting very touchy about it all.
I would like to start by thanking the Commission for committing itself to plugging the gaps between the trans-European transport network in the European Union and the TINA network in the candidate countries.
That is very important.
It has submitted proposals for completing the trans-European networks and has also made financial commitments in this connection.
This is, in my view, a very good thing.
In the regions we live in, individual infrastructure projects are now, of course, the subject of heated debate.
The reason why I am putting this supplementary question is that we still do not have a more or less reliable indication of by what percentage freight traffic, in particular, is expected to increase.
It would be very important for us to know that, as it would also be for the public, for whom new transport links bring disadvantages to be endured.
