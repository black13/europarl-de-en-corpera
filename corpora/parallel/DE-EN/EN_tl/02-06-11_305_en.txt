Mr President, the conciliation procedure on the Equal Treatment Directive has produced a respectable result, for which heartfelt thanks are due to our rapporteur, Mrs Hautala.
I am convinced that this amended directive will prove to be a milestone in the improvement of women's career opportunities.
It was quite literally at the last minute that we managed to come to a compromise on the definition of the concept of sexual harassment in the workplace, one which prohibits any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature violating the dignity of the person affected.
For the first time direct and indirect discrimination come within the scope of an EU law, with binding effect in fifteen Member States and soon in ten more.
It also constitutes a breakthrough of massive dimensions that women may not suffer any disadvantage in employment in connection with pregnancy or motherhood, and that they are accorded the right to their former job or an equivalent post after maternity leave.
It has taken a tenacious struggle to give paternal leave to fathers and the protection of the directive to adoptive parents as well.
The Member States and the candidate countries now have until 2005 to see to it that businesses are required to set up independent units to draw up equal treatment plans, also to take preventive action and equip themselves with the resources they need to do this.
Real sanctions are to be imposed for non-compliance.
It is an open question whether the arrangement in Germany, with a voluntary joint commitment by the federal government and the employers' associations which goes in this direction, will meet the high standards of our EU directive.
If businesses do not noticeably redouble their efforts to promote women, it is inevitable that the way ahead will be via a referral to the European Court of Justice.
