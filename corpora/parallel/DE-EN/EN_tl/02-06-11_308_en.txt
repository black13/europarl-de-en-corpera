Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, amendment of this directive had become urgently necessary in order to do justice to the Treaty of Amsterdam, which includes new provisions on equal opportunities for women and men, but many wide-ranging rulings by the European Court of Justice - for example in the Kalanke and Marschall cases - also provide grounds for adapting the directive.
Both in Parliament and with the Council, we have striven long and hard for a workable compromise, never losing sight of our objective, which is to safeguard equal treatment for men and women as regards their access to work.
The definition of sexual harassment was being honed right up to the end, although opinions can still differ as to whether it should form part of a legal text.
A compromise was reached on the setting up of one or more independent units to analyse and oversee the transposition and implementation of the directive.
Units of this sort, which can also form part of existing facilities, are worthy of support.
The directive also deals with the rights of adoptive parents in those Member States in which adoption leave is recognised.
The right to return to a former job or to an equivalent post at the end of maternity leave has also been incorporated.
The Member States will now be obliged by this directive to introduce a range of binding measures on equal treatment, but businesses should not, in my view, be left to implement these on their own.
To do it, they will also need support.
It is only when the family, the raising of children, and the care of the aged are the responsibility of men and women equally, and only when men avail themselves of educational leave for family commitments as a matter of course, that we will have moved nearer to the goal of equal opportunities, equal rights and equal duties.
