Mr President, in 2001, 55% of the European Union's blood products originated from donors who were remunerated for their effort.
Of the plasma used to supply the EU market, 73% originates from people who receive remuneration for donating it.
It is only through these donors that full supplies of plasma products can be kept up.
Secure supplies of blood products save lives and must therefore be given absolute priority.
The Common Position is a good basis for this.
A ban on remunerated donation is not feasible in terms of health care provision.
I can see nothing immoral in this - quite the opposite.
I remember my own student days, when we students derived part of our income from donating plasma.
