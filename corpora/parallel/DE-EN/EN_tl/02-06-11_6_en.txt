Mr President, I cannot go along with the Liberals on this.
I would inform you,
my dear Mr Schulz, that is simply because the Liberals indicated yesterday that they intended to reject it, and so I assumed that the honourable Member was among their number, but that is obviously an oversight.
But that which is not, may yet be!
Turning to the matter in hand, I would like to inform you that this second Ayuso Gonz√°lez report refers to the Council's compromise proposal, which does not provide for a common organisation of the market, but only for a market regulation.
This will result in Article 10 being dropped, as Article 10 states that national subsidies are prohibited in an organised market.
That has lapsed, and so I ask you to agree to this urgent procedure.
