Mr President, people who suffer from the bleeding disease of haemophilia are gravely concerned, as, if payment for blood donation is actually banned, there may be serious difficulties with the supply of blood products.
Indeed, some people could even die.
Half of all the plasmatic clotting factors currently used in the European Union comes from remunerated donors; either they have made their donation in the EU or their plasma has been imported.
It can readily be imagined what a threat it would be to patients if new legislation meant that the supply of these products were to be halved.
There is at present no evidence that medicinal products from unpaid donors are in any way safer than those from donors who have been paid.
The fact is that the medicinal products authorities in Europe have been checking the safety and effectiveness of all plasma products in the European Union and this has not led them to see the payment of donors as a problem.
There is something else.
Contrary to prior expectations, the provision of genetically manufactured Factor 8 - which is only one of the blood clotting factors - has been constantly beset with problems.
That precombinant synthetic blood clotting factors would bring with them a boundless range of low-priced compounds, as the pharmaceutical industry originally asserted, has quite simply not, to date, been demonstrated to be true.
The products have become more expensive and also hard to obtain.
It is a cause of dismay that between 400 000 and 500 000 people around the world are dependent on clotting factor compounds; only 10% of them are provided for to the standard of the industrialised countries of the West.
Of the world's haemophiliacs, 80% have no supplies.
If we now dispense with remuneration, the position of these people - who do not live in the European Union - could get much, much worse.
