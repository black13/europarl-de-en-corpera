Mr President, I wish, on behalf of my group and also in consultation with all the shadow rapporteurs and with the coordinators of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to ask that my two reports on the rules on participation in the Framework Programme and the Euratom Programme and on dissemination of their results should be adjourned to the July part-session.
Yesterday evening we succeeded, after intensive work, in reaching an agreement with the Council.
It was not possible to have this agreement formally voted on in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and so I now ask for consideration of both reports to be adjourned.
