Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since time is short, I should like to focus on just one issue which has been mentioned several times already today, namely the presidential decrees.
In this context, the Czech Parliament's declaration of 24 April 2002 is helpful, since it states that the presidential decrees cannot be the basis for any new legal relations today.
However, there is one issue which concerns us, and that is whether discriminatory elements still exist in current Czech law, such as an act dating from 1992 on the restitution of property confiscated from its owners under Communism, which makes the restitution of property contingent on continuous Czech citizenship.
We must establish whether this provision conforms with European law.
The same applies to what is known as the 1946 Criminal Indemnity Act.
In addition to clarifying these and other issues, a number of other problems will arise even after Czech accession to the EU.
I am convinced that a clear signal from those who were expelled in 1945 and from their descendants would be helpful.
This signal should make it clear that the property relations which emerged after the Second World War are inviolable, and should not be violated.
If this signal were sent out, Czech fears could be assuaged, and people who are currently consumed by these fears could use their energies productively to prepare the Czech Republic for EU accession in 2004.
