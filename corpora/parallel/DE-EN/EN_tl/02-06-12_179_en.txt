Madam President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is very pleased that the chapters on the internal market and the related chapters have already been negotiated successfully.
In this respect, we can claim that the internal market already exists.
However, we are still concerned about the shortcomings in the administrative and judicial systems in the future Member States.
I would like to tell you something which I found out at the weekend in Prague, namely that the process of registering a foreign commercial company in the Czech trade register takes about a year - unless you are prepared to pay EUR 2000.
In the internal market, no gap should open up between rights and duties as a result of the failure to enforce environmental, social and consumer standards.
We need fair competition, also in the enlarged internal market.
I should like to thank Mrs Sommer for her report.
It provides a strong impetus towards fruitful cooperation and cohesion at the interface between East and West in the border regions.
Giving priority to SMEs is something we strongly support, and we hope that this will be implemented in forthcoming calls for proposals.
