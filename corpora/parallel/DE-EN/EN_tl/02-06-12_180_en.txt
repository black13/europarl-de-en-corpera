Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my task was to draft a horizontal report on industry, external trade, research and energy for twelve candidate countries.
That was difficult enough in itself.
Providing a comprehensive overview of the report in just one minute now is impossible.
I therefore draw attention to the short justification provided in my report.
Anyone interested should have a look at it.
I should like to mention one issue which is very close to my heart, and wish to underline rather more pointedly than my colleague Willy GÃ¶rlach that as I come from a region which has been part of the European Union since 1990 and has experienced a great deal of solidarity in the last twelve years, I have a very clear appreciation of the efforts made by the candidate countries, especially the Central and Eastern European countries, to become eligible for accession.
What I would now ask of us all - from the European Union, especially the Council and particularly from two countries which have always been the driving force in this European Union, namely Germany and France - is to remove, as soon as possible, the obstacles which stand in the way of union with these countries and enable us, myself included, to conduct a European election campaign on both sides of the Oder and Neisse in 2004.
