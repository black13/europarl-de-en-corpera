Madam President, I was just about to impress the Commissioner, Mr Fischler, but unfortunately, he is absent at the moment.
However, if all goes to plan, we can land a very big fish at the end of the year, which makes a change.
In fact, the fisheries sector is ahead of agriculture in the enlargement process, which also makes a change.
The fisheries chapter has already been closed with all candidates, albeit with some restrictions in the case of Poland and Malta.
Nonetheless, here too, some positive developments are emerging now that Poland has withdrawn its demand for special rights of access, for example.
As a result of enlargement, the coastline will increase significantly in length and the number of actors in the fisheries sector will increase.
On a day-to-day basis, we do not anticipate any major problems, but there may be some difficulties which we will have to take on board.
In particular, there is a lack of more effective administrative structures, a standard register, effective controls, genuinely harmonised hygiene and environmental standards, and measures to tackle flags of convenience.
However, we should be able to deal with these.
I am confident, therefore, that we can resolve these problems and set a course towards an enlarged European fishing industry.
