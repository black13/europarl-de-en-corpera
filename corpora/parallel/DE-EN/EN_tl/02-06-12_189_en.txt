Madam President, the border regions adjoining the future Member States of the European Union need our undivided attention now and even more after enlargement.
Everywhere, especially in my country, the border regions are marked by extremely high unemployment and dying villages and towns.
Young people are leaving because they see no future there.
The only way we can halt this negative trend is to support those regions, modernise the infrastructure, create transport links and make small and medium sized enterprises fit to meet the challenge.
Because it is they who create the most jobs.
If the EU and the Member States themselves encourage and support the border regions, which are suffering massive problems, and that help must include preventing low-wage dumping and unfair competition, then a sense of cross-border neighbourliness will grow and that will be to everyone's advantage.
The historic task of enlargement must succeed.
We have no alternative.
