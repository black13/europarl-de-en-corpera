Madam President, from the Committee on Industry, External Trade and Energy's point of view it is of course important, now that Sapard is entering its operational phase and money is actually flowing, that that money should be used for developing the rural environment and less for agricultural production capacities.
I would like to mention just two key figures: one is the 15% of agricultural production in the candidate countries, and the other is the 50% of cultivated agricultural area that can be further capitalised.
So it would be wrong to continue trying to improve production structures.
It would be better to create alternative sources of employment in rural areas, either crafts or small-scale industries.
All in all, it is important that any possible expansion of production should not add to the already high levels of overproduction in our agriculture but that we should in that event find the right ways of developing craft trade and small-scale industry structures in the candidate countries' agriculture and rural areas.
