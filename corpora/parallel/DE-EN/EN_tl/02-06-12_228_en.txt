Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to talk about the administration of the EU structural fund, something which is more than in need of improvement.
This is not only in the light of enlargement, as the 12th Annual Report on the Structural Funds 2000, the Cohesion Fund and the Instrument for Structural Policy for Pre-Accession shows, as the rapporteur has rightly said, that there is substantial underutilisation of commitment and payment appropriations.
Despite the lowering of targets, concentration and simplification of planning, take up of the new forms of intervention for the structural fund planning period has been much slower than was intended and was desirable.
Even if EU Finance Ministers are currently pleased at every euro that is not spent at EU level, since it eases the burden of the EU Member States' net payments in the short term, they are economising in the wrong place because EU money is urgently needed especially in times of rising unemployment.
The reasons for the difficulties must be sought both in the Member States and in the EU Commission.
In some cases there is a shortage of suitable projects.
Not infrequently the problem is the necessary cofinancing.
But appreciable administrative bottlenecks are also a reason why the Member States are unable to take up funding.
According to the Annual Report 2000, not one intervention was approved in connection with the new Community initiatives, and as a result 0% of the budget plan was implemented in this area.
That is atrocious!
In future, the Commission must ensure that the new planning period starts on time and it must insist that the Member States do their groundwork early.
On the other hand, the Commission must also intensify its scrutiny of the implementation of programmes and inform the European Parliament in good time of all irregularities found.
