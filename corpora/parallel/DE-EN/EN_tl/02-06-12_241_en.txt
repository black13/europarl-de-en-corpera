Mr President, I congratulate the Council and Commission on having endured a five-hour marathon of listening to everything the European Parliament wants for the accession process.
As you have heard, we have a lot of comments and requests concerning this historic project.
I myself am a member of the Romania delegation and an acting member of the Bulgaria delegation.
So I have just one point to make: these countries are naturally very anxious that they should not be forgotten.
If the door opens for ten countries in Copenhagen at the end of this year, then in Bulgaria and Romania they will want to know where they stand.
I would like to ask what signal we will be giving these countries at the end of 2002.
Is there a timetable for the second round?
Will there also be more aids for accession so that we can improve the process of adaptation?
That need not always be money, Mrs Schreyer.
There are other forms of aid.
We must not forget these countries.
The first accession process is only the first stage.
