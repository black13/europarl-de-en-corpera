Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we meet this afternoon under the banner of 'enlargement of the European Union'.
The speeches made by Members confirm my belief that we are all agreed on one thing, namely that we want enlargement of the European Union, and we are working at every level to realise this objective in a responsible manner.
The timetable is an ambitious one.
The end is in sight, although chapters on such things as agriculture and regional policy have yet to be sorted out.
Let me, in this context, refer back to yesterday, when farmers from the present Community demonstrated in front of the parliament building.
They presented the concerns that they have about their future and demonstrated about the mid-term review of Agenda 2000.
What they were concerned about was a fair chance for their businesses, and thus for their families, in the future.
What made the greatest impression on me was the solidarity our farmers showed with their counterparts from the future Member States, despite the adverse situation they themselves have been put in by falling prices for milk and cereals.
This was for me an appeal for everything possible to be done for the people in the present EU and in the candidate countries not to be left alone with their concerns and needs.
So we too have to talk about their problems.
Let us take Sapard as our first practical example.
The flow of funds here is quite inadequate.
They should be kept for agriculture and rural areas.
Secondly, the funds that continue to be needed for the development of rural areas must be provided by all the structural policy measures and not just from the common agricultural policy.
Thirdly, full harmonisation is absolutely necessary in the internal market.
I will stop there and thank you for listening, as there are a few people who have been waiting a very long time already.
