Mr President, I will be even more brief.
I just want to thank the House for what I feel has been an extraordinarily constructive and helpful debate, which the Commission also sees as an encouragement to pursue its present course, in which certainty of Parliament's support is a great help to us.
This debate has thrown up a large number of questions, but we would need another hour if I were to try and answer them now.
So, with your permission, Mr President, I would ask you to let me answer in writing the questions raised in this debate.
