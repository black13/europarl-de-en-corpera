No, pour un fait personnel - on a personal matter.
I do not know what that is in German, but you, as Vice-President, should.
A personal attack has been made on me.
Mr President, I have been in Parliaments for thirty-seven years, so I know what a personal attack is, and that one is permitted to respond to it.
I ask you to let me have the floor, so that I may answer this personal attack.
If you had listened to me, this matter would have been sorted out long ago!
