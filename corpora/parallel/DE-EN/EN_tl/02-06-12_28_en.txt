Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, a brief word on the Kashmir conflict.
This conflict over one of the most beautiful mountain regions in the world now needs to be addressed on a long-term basis.
The need for a solution has never been greater or more promising that it is now; but this dialogue between India and Pakistan will only get started if everyone on the sidelines, the EU, the USA, Russia and the UN, treats both countries on the same footing.
The explosive force of the Kashmir conflict, which is rooted in historic events - already three wars in the region, terrorism, propaganda, rampant nationalism and Al Qaeda - could be disastrous, but it could also be restrained with the help of moderate forces in the area and a policy from outside which respects both sides.
I warn you - and this is very important today, especially following the war in Afghanistan - not to take sides.
