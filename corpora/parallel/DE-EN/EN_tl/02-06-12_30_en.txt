Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I intend to confine my comments to the conflict between India and Pakistan.
Mr President-in-Office, you rightly noted in your speech that this conflict threatens to destabilise and endanger the whole region.
Concern about this immense danger has brought all of us responsible for foreign policy in nearly all the groups to a common position, as expressed in the resolution on Seville.
We call in this resolution for both countries to make every possible effort to deescalate the situation and join in constructive dialogue in a bid to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible.
Both sides clearly have a responsibility to defuse the conflict, which is why I welcome the measures taken over the past few days by India, which has decided to lift the ban on Pakistani aeroplanes using Indian airspace, appoint a high commissioner for Islamabad and order its warships back to port.
We also expect President Musharaf to continue and step up his efforts to stop the infiltration of terrorists via the line of control in Kashmir.
If he honours the promises made in his speech on 12 January this year, then a huge step will have been made towards resolving the conflict.
I was in Kashmir a few weeks ago and went to an Indian post 3 400 metres up on the line of control, so I know what I am talking about.
The war against terrorism can in fact only be effectively waged on the Pakistani side.
Pakistan is responsible not just for catching terrorists before they reach the border, but also for meting out appropriate punishment and taking them out of circulation.
One last point which plays a very important part in the whole dispute is the need to strengthen democracy.
India is a democracy and we hope that Pakistan will be too if free elections are held in the autumn and put a democratic government in power.
