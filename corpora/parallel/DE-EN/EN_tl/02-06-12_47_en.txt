Mr President, honourable Members, the new version of the financial regulation is one of the largest and most comprehensive pieces of legislation during this parliamentary term, which is why I should like to thank you on the Commission's behalf for the excellent collaboration which we have enjoyed with the European Parliament and the Council and, most importantly, with the two committees, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I should also like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Dell'Alba and Mr Hulten, on their very clever handling of the negotiations and the positive results for Parliament.
My warmest thanks on behalf of the Commission.
