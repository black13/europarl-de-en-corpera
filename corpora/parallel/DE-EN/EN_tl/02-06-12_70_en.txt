Mr President, that is not what we agreed on this point in the debates in committee and in the group.
The point is, we do not start this sort of procedure unless there is some prospect of obtaining the required majorities further down the line in this difficult procedure to establish human rights violations in Member States.
That is why we are opposed to this oral amendment.
