Mr President, the services have pointed out that the proposed amendments are identical.
However, that is not the case in all the language versions and, even in the English version, there are interesting differences between the version in the committee report and the version now before plenary.
The point is, do we call for the High Representative to be present at foreign and security policy debates or do we word it more politely by saying he should be invited.
I think that, as we are talking about foreign and security policy, we should opt for the diplomatic wording, as contained in Amendments Nos 120 and 174.
