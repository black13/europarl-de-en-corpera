Mr President, I should just like to make a brief comment here.
The fact of the matter is, we should be obliged to examine the financial impact of committee reports.
Rule 159 refers at one point to legislative reports.
We have already adopted the wording for that.
Article 160 refers to non-legislative reports, but we should ensure that the same wording is used in both cases because, materially, it makes no difference if a financial statement is drawn up for a legislative or a non-legislative report.
In this respect, having voted on Amendment No 88, there should in fact be no need to vote again here.
