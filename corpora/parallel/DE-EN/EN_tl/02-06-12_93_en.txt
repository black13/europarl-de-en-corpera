I voted against the recommendation in the Dell'Alba report and, hence, against the new financial regulation.
This new financial regulation no longer makes provision for any independent financial control before payments are disbursed from the EU budget.
This is a violation of the EC Treaty, which requires independent financial control.
With no such ex-ante control, the risks of irregularity and fraud will increase.
The Commission has received warnings to this effect for a long time, most recently from its own accounting officer, who was promptly removed.
The Commission will have to pay a heavy price for refusing to take these warnings seriously.
