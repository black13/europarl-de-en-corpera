As long as nuclear power stations are operated in Europe, the highest priority should be given to protecting the health of EU citizens and their environment.
We have, by adopting Mr Schwaiger's report, made an essential contribution to nuclear safety being able to be researched in even greater depth in the future.
I have in mind especially the safety of existing reactors in Europe and in the candidate countries.
Even before enlargement, there is a need for Europe-wide safety standards to be created for nuclear power stations, so that we can provide the citizens of an enlarged EU with a high degree of safety in this area.
I see it as a task for the Joint Research Centre to lay the foundations for common safety standards of this kind.
It is for this reason that the delegation of the Austrian Freedom Party has voted in favour of this report and of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 in particular.
