Mrs Ayuso, the rapporteur, has drafted a text that is much closer to the proposal for a compromise between the Council and the Commission on ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin.
Treating this matter as an urgent subject of major importance in Strasbourg now opens up the possibility of our vote being followed by an agreement at last.
Only thus can we give our farmers and traditional small-scale distilleries the security that they so urgently need in order to be able to plan ahead.
There is no sense in discriminating against the producers of agricultural alcohol while leaving synthetic alcohol unaffected.
It is for that reason that we referred this matter back to the Agriculture Committee weeks ago.
The changed language in the new Commission proposal at last allows the Member States to enact their own supplementary regulations at national level.
Only this will make it possible for small distilleries in the EU to survive.
The cultivation of potatoes and cereals for the purpose of extracting alcohol and the utilisation of fruit from flourishing fruit meadows ensures the continued existence of these valued cultural landscapes, which, without national supplementary regulations, will be in extreme danger.
