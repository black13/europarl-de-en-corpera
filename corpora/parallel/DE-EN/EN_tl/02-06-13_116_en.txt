Parliament's Agricultural Committee voted unanimously on the CMO for ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin.
I reject any COM in agricultural alcohol and call for a 'lenient regulation'.
I therefore support, on the whole, the proposed compromise brought in by the Spanish presidency of the Council, that is, without the articles on subsidies.
If the present German regulations were to lapse and new promotional opportunities to be created by granting area payments, that would constitute a completely new approach, one that would be neither of equal financial value nor capable of being an effective promotional instrument.
The production of agricultural alcohol currently provides an additional income for many family-run farms, which thus see it as a secondary means of support.
This is indeed about fruit and caring for cultural landscapes - it is also about the many small and medium-sized enterprises that need the distillery on the family farm for the important additional income it provides as a secondary means of support.
I therefore ask the Commission to take on board the Spanish proposal for a compromise and Parliament's position.
