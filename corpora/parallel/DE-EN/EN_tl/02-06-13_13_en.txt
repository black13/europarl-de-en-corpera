Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Petersen, Commissioner, to put it briefly and to bring matters down to a common denominator, I consider one single commitment by the automobile industry to the protection of pedestrians to be utterly inadequate.
This is all the more the case in view of the dramatic incidence of serious traffic accidents which make it impossible to regard as appropriate the deadlines envisaged for implementing the recommendations regarding impacts involving the lower leg and head with the front or windscreen of the vehicle: 1 July 2005 for all new vehicle types, 1 July 2010 for 80% of new vehicles and 2012 for all new vehicles.
I do not want to be misunderstood.
I am not, as a matter of principle, opposed to commitments in general, but in this specific case I see it as necessary to produce a binding framework directive.
That would be a preferable way of going about it.
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report reflects this problem.
Attempts have been made at negotiating a compromise, but, unfortunately and apart from any compromise, a whole array of shortcomings remain.
You, Mr Koch, looked only at the positive side of that; I am now considering it from another angle.
Excessive delays prior to the commitment's implementation, the reduction of tests from four to two, the commitment to equip vehicles with daytime running lights, the provision that the implementation of phase 2 should be subject to technical feasibility, which gives no guarantee that the objectives will actually be achieved, the failure to adopt a ban on fitting front and rear bullbars after a vehicle is purchased.
We of course support the equipping of all vehicles with ABS, as we do the introduction of a range of electronic active safety devices.
Making the first move is always better than doing nothing.
This one can help cut down on accidents.
So, despite all my reservations, I will vote for this report.
