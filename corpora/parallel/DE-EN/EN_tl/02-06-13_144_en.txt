My group supports Mrs Sommer's report, as it takes up the specific problem of the situation which will face 33 million people living in 23 of the European Union's border regions after the accession of the central and eastern European countries.
We are also glad that a range of proposals submitted by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have been incorporated into the report, for example the emphasis on the need to provide more funds to promote SMEs, and the call for an increase in the EU share in co-finance in order to take account of the calamitous gaps in terms of development.
We share the rapporteur's fundamental conviction that the EUR 195 million in funding allocated by the Commission are far from adequate, and we support to the utmost the demand for additional financial resources.
This is all the more the case as the funds currently available are being found by means of reallocations, whilst at the same time the finance ministers of various countries can look forward to billions from the resources of the Structural and Regional Funds not being utilised and therefore being refunded.
We regret the fact that it has not been possible to bring about the acceptance of a legal basis specifically for the promotion of border regions, without which the longer-term funding of measures will be impossible.
By way of contrast, we welcome the orientation towards dealing more effectively with the connection of the regional transport systems to the Trans-European Networks.
