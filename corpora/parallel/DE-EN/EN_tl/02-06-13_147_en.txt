My group supports the report by Mr Turco, who has done good work.
The Structural and Cohesion Funds are European Union instruments of extreme importance for bringing the EU's less-favoured regions up to the level of development of the prosperous ones.
We take the view that these instruments of European incentive policy enable EU policy to have the greatest direct and visible effects on people's quality of life and must therefore at all costs remain part of future policy after enlargement.
Support given by stronger regions to the weaker ones, in a spirit of solidarity and without reference to national boundaries, is symbolic of European unity.
We therefore oppose any discussion of even the partial renationalisation of regional and structural policy, as this would undermine the principle of solidarity and it is not foreseeable where such a policy might lead.
We are of course aware of the serious problems involved in realising structural and regional policy, and see the Commission and the Member States as sharing responsibility.
The poor implementation rates and constantly increasing backlogs, totalling - incredibly - EUR 112 billion in 2000, give grave cause to consider the possibility of a radical re-examination of the procedures and structures that have been in place to date.
