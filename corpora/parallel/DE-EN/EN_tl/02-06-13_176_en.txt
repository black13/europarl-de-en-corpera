Mr President, yesterday, on the initiative of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) the first World Day against Child Labour was proclaimed.
Two hundred and fifty million children are regarded by their parents as an investment in their whole family's survival.
They are exposed to the heaviest physical burdens from an early age, thus being robbed of a carefree childhood.
Not only are they put to work as cheap labour in plantations, quarries and mines, but they are also exploited by the manufacturers of sports goods.
Now of all times, when the World Cup is on in Japan and South Korea, it should not be forgotten that many footballs are made by children.
As long ago as 1998, FIFA undertook to outlaw the use of child labour in the production of officially licensed products, but the world's richest and most important football association has now had to admit that it cannot guarantee this.
The PPE-DE group, like all the other groups, condemns every form of child labour.
FIFA and the sports goods manufacturers must at last introduce a code of conduct and then monitor the way it is implemented, if this deplorable state of affairs is to be brought to an end.
Industry and organisations should work together with governments, as Mrs Martens and others of our fellow-Members have just emphasised.
The European Union and the ILO must check that these working guidelines are consistently adhered to.
One step in the right direction is the 'Red Card for Child Labour' campaign started during the African championships in January this year.
We call on FIFA, national teams and the sports goods manufacturers to do everything possible to make the 2004 European Championships in Portugal the first international football tournament free of child labour.
Over and above that, I agree with the ladies who spoke before me that the fight against the causes of child labour - poverty, poor education and inadequate training - has to be stepped up.
