Mr President, Malaysia could, in many ways, be a model for much of Asia, and indeed of Europe.
When one considers the constitution created by the nation's wise founder, Tunku Abdurahman, under which the various states are in a federation, with the nine sultans electing a common Head of State every five years, and diverse races and religions living together without violence and largely without conflict, one might say that Malaysia had what it takes to be a model state, and, in economic terms as well, decades in succession saw repeated and outstanding development, despite the setbacks in recent years.
It is, then, all the more dramatic a development that Mr Mahathir's regime is beginning to take on the characteristics of an autocracy.
First he attempts to act against dissent in the name of politicised Islam.
Then again, he misuses the fight against terrorism, and its Islamic variety in particular, to take further action against dissidents, albeit under another label.
At one moment he tries to win worldwide acclaim as the representative of democracy; the next he is a brutal autocrat, withholding even the minimum rule of law.
That is what is at stake with this Internal Security Act - that appropriate judicial review should have to take place; that proper evidence should have to be produced; that detention should be under proper conditions; and that the law should provide proper means of appealing against detention.
Political detainees in Malaysia enjoy none of these things.
It is for that reason that we have to make use of both the next EU-ASEAN summit and the next EU-ASIA summit to push energetically for a partner as important as Malaysia to respect human rights, return to its roots, renew the peaceful coexistence of the various religions and ethnic groups, and, at the end of the day, for the disappearance of the repressive measures that have been constantly stepped up in recent years, have resulted in a growing number of political prisoners, and are incompatible with Malaysia's status as one of the European Union's key partners.
