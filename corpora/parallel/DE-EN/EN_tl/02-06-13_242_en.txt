Mr President, I have just two technical corrections.
The first is that recital K speaks of 3.5 million Congolese, a figure about which nobody can be certain, and so we ask that it should speak simply in terms of millions.
The other point has to do with paragraph 5.
This mentions an agreement as having been signed on 19 May, but it was rightly pointed out in the debate that it was signed on 19 April.
We ask that both these points be corrected.
