Mr President, my words are also addressed to the voters present, who have come here today in the expectation of an interesting debate, and to the Commissioner, who has just yawned.
As yesterday we did not even manage to decide what minimum would make lively debates possible, I shall henceforth be taking the liberty of stating the number of members present when I address them, so I greet fifteen ladies and gentlemen.
This is about the Internet, that is to say the alternative to the performance laid on for you here, and about direct access for you to something that can constitute the democratic opinion-forming process.
We are talking about eEurope; have you tried it out yet?
Have you yet visited Parliament's website, or the Council's, or the Commission's?
If you did, did you feel the way I did?
You feel as if you are facing a wall full of binder files.
Some people get aroused by the binder files, but most do not.
It is children and young people who are looking for something different, seeking information and debate.
That is possible; Europe has the chance to make it so, but we - by which I mean also we in this House - have to work like crazy on the design of our websites and also on their subject matter.
The most important information is not there.
That having been said, the Internet is of real importance to democracy.
That brings me to my ceterum censeo: apart from that, there can be no democracy without transparency!
