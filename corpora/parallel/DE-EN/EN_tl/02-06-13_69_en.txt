Mr President, I too have something to say about paragraph 47, but it is something rather more important.
There is something wrong with it.
It contains the words: '? a treaty concluded last month between the Republic of Yugoslavia and Macedonia', but the treaty was concluded last year.
It sparked the crisis in Kosovo.
I ask that this serious mistake be corrected.
