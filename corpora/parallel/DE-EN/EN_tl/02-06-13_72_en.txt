Mr President, in negotiations, we accepted the text in its original version.
We recognised the undoubted error of not calling a state by its name, and so the correction was made to its present form, 'The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', which is the state's official name.
We think Parliament would only be making itself ridiculous if it were, on the grounds of particular sentiments or political tendencies, to call a state by a name other than that which belongs to it.
