Mr President, however we express ourselves privately or as a matter of personal preference - for my part, I always say 'Macedonia' - we have to use the official name in Parliamentary documents.
I therefore see this as being about the official use of language rather than about voting.
So we should not be having a vote on it at all.
(Applause)
