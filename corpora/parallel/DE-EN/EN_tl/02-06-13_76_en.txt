Mr President, we have just voted on texts referring, for example, to 'India' rather than 'the Republic of India' or anything else of the sort, and so this text reads 'Macedonia'.
If somebody wants to change this for reasons that are recognisably political, that is an oral amendment, and has to be dealt with under the relevant procedure.
