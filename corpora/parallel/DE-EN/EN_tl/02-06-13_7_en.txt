Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by very warmly thanking Commissioner Liikanen for the very important and forward-looking step the Commission has taken.
We are all aware that, when problems crop up, the simplest way to deal with them is by means of incentives and assistance.
The Sixth Framework Programme for Research, which we have adopted, contains many incentives to achieve improvements by the use of scientific methods.
My second point is that we have standards, whether national or European, which give pride of place to the principle of mutual recognition and thereby make competition in the market possible.
The next stage, which is new and in fact sensational, is a voluntary commitment, whereby very strong pressure is brought to bear by both parties.
An amicable settlement has to be reached, and additional criteria can be introduced in order to actually enforce such settlements.
On the one hand, we have a simple contract, as originally planned, which of course involves risks and obligations for all parties to the contract and creates a number of problems, and on the other, we have the very slimline directive we are working on now, which we will use to do nothing more than draw up a timetable and lay down methods of supervision and assessment so that Parliament and the Commission can keep an eye on the progress made.
What I would like, and I believe that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would like it as well, is for this directive to amount to no more than one page.
That would serve as an example of how we are constantly up to date in laying down principles and demonstrating how our work in lawmaking can also be slimline and forward-looking.
Thank you, Commissioner; you have done an excellent piece of work.
