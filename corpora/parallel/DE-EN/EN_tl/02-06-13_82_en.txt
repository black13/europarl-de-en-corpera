Mr President, I would very much like to table an oral amendment to the Liberals' Amendment No 38, in which it is stated that the candidates for accession are to start with the transposition of the laws against discrimination.
However, I propose that they should speed the transposition up, which would include those candidates that have already started on this.
In other words, I propose that 'to start preparing' be deleted and replaced by 'to speed up'.
