Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission recommended on 12 March 2002 that the energy networks should be included in this amendment to the Regulation.
What lies behind this is the proposal to amend the guidelines on the trans-European energy networks, on which Mr Beysen is the rapporteur in the Industry Committee.
The Commission is proposing an increase in the maximum rate from 10% to 20%.
Investments are to ensure a high degree of security in energy supply, which is to be accomplished by an increase in investment, which is meant to resolve the many and varied problems occurring in the planning and realisation of infrastructure development.
The aim is to create a real internal market in energy, including those regions that are not at present included and covering strategies that have not yet been implemented.
These include the candidate countries.
The Committee agrees to the Regulation with, inter alia, a number of additions, which I will enumerate as follows.
The investments envisaged should be made in projects that are necessary for the EU's economy and that are commercially profitable.
Competition must not be distorted.
The possibility of any increase in the Community funding allocated to energy networks in the Financial Perspective for 2002 to 2006 must be excluded, and the Commission is to produce a regular report for Parliament, detailing those projects whose completion can be expected to be speedy by reason of the increase from 10% to 20%.
I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for his ability to take on board the Industry Committee's proposals with only slight variations.
I would like especially to thank Mr Beysen, Mr Mombaur and Mr Turmes, who put a great deal of dedication into completing the report, sometimes by their amendments and suggestions.
I would also like to thank the bureau and, most especially, the Commission.
