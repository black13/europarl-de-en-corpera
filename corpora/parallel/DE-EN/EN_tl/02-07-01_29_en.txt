Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask your understanding for my not making use of all the five minutes available to me.
I do not think it is worth it in a case like this one, in which we are dealing with something relatively trifling.
Let me tell you at the very outset that the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends, at my suggestion and by a very large majority, that immunity should not be waived in this case, in which the honourable Member concerned is accused by the Public Prosecution Service in Athens of having used his position as an MEP to exert influence on his female companion and induce her to make defamatory statements about her former husband.
The Greek State Prosecution Service made explicit reference to the honourable Member's position as an MEP when it overruled the Athens Public Prosecution Service's rejection of the original application for criminal proceedings.
Let me refer to the report in saying that the assertion made by the plaintiff - that is, the ex-husband, who laid the original charges - appears to stand up, as the copy of the judgment submitted to us - the reference number of which eludes me - contains evidence that he did in any case, even bearing in mind his position as an MEP and the consequent status that position gave him, give at least moral support to the offence of defamation.
Under normal circumstances, we in the Committee treat a case of this sort on the assumption that we are dealing with a case of what is termed fumus persecutionis, which means that the possibility cannot be excluded that the prosecuting authority, in this case the Greek State Prosecution Service, is acting against one of our colleagues because he is an MEP.
It was in this perspective that the great majority of the Legal Affairs Committee took the view that immunity should not be waived in this case.
I ask the House to come to a similar decision and vote tomorrow against waiving Mr Korakas' immunity.
Thank you for your attention.
