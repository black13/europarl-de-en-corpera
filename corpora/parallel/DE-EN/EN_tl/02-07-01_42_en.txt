Mr President, Commissioner, this report by Mr Savary on restrictions for heavy goods vehicles is one with which I am in complete agreement.
It is a good compromise, and one that I support.
For a start, the Member States can impose restrictions on heavy goods vehicles within the time-spans that have now become customary, namely Saturday, Sunday and national public holidays.
Secondly, the scope envisaged has been chosen on the principle that there should be no discrimination between domestic and cross-border traffic.
The directive governs only cross-border traffic on the trans-European transport networks, the Member States having the right to enact legislation to impose additional limits on domestic traffic using the road network as a whole.
Thirdly, and in addition to the derogations under ordinary law, the national authorities have a margin for manoeuvre to enact supplementary derogations for the trans-European transport networks used for cross-border transport of goods.
Fourthly, sanctions and the monitoring of the system of restrictions remain a matter for the national authorities.
The rapporteur has, among other things, taken on board two important amendments.
The first of these has to do with the creation of a European apparatus for road traffic information, and the second with the extension of the derogation to flowers and fresh horticultural products.
On this very important point, Mr Ferber, our opinions differ.
Adoption of this directive will create legal certainty, so that different arguments will no longer be able to be brought before different courts.
Road safety will be enhanced, and the detriment to people and nature will be minimised.
Member States that already take a more liberal approach will not be compelled to introduce more restrictive measures, and those with tighter restrictions on convoys of heavy goods vehicles will not be forced to liberalise them.
