Mr President, Commissioner, it is perfectly legitimate for the citizens of countries in Central Europe not to want to be steamrollered by a transport policy that is carried out one-sidedly on roads, but it is understandable that the countries on the edge of the EU should call for equal rights for their haulage companies.
The EU must attempt to find a balance in this area.
In the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, the EU set itself two objectives, which in fact put enormous reform pressure on transport policy.
Maastricht made traffic safety an EU objective, and in Amsterdam the EU also undertook to guarantee that the public's quality of life would be protected.
Restrictions on transport may well improve, to some degree, the protection of the affected citizens and the environment in vulnerable regions from noise and pollution, but, in the long term, only determined support for rail travel can achieve the dual objective of securing the quality of life of the public in Central and Eastern Europe and giving the countries on the edge of the EU good access to the internal market.
Turning to the directive itself, I welcome the introduction of comparable statistics, but the unbalanced guidance on EU transport policy at the present time leads me to think that we still need extensive rights for the Member States, to enable them to defend themselves against an unbalanced EU transport policy.
