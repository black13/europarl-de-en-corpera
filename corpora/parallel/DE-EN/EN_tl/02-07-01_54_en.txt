Mr President, these documents submitted by the Commission, the one on the levying of excise duty on biofuels, and the other on their promotion, tend to contradict each other somewhat.
The intention in one directive is to introduce a tax on biofuels, which would take away their present competitiveness against fossil fuels.
The aim in the other directive is to promote biofuels in order to build up their share in overall fuel consumption to a marked degree.
The promotion of biofuels is without doubt an essential component of Europe's future energy supply, being sustainable and environmentally friendly.
The amendments by the Environmental and Economic Affairs Committees, however, by raising the possibility of complete exemption from duties, make the two proposals compatible.
One crucial point, that of their environmental impact, has been addressed in discussion of biofuels.
The call has been made for the entire ecological lifecycle of biofuels to be evaluated.
In principle, this is right; but, for the purposes of comparison, fossil fuels must also be included in such an assessment, and their complete lifecycle evaluated in order to achieve objective and comparable results.
This should then also be dealt with in discussions with the Council, where we have proposed a compromise.
Assessments of whether actions are ecological are probably much better reached when working towards obligatory or indicative targets.
We will indeed reach a compromise, but one of the most important preconditions for it is the agreement of the Council.
