Madam President, it has to be said that biofuels have immense inherent potential for innovation, with all its positive side-effects, but let us not deceive ourselves about the great initial costs that there will also be to cope with.
'Biojuice', in itself, has a pleasant ring to it because it somehow appeals to our ecological conscience, but lauding 'biojuice' to the heavens as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a bit exaggerated.
In that respect, we have to keep our feet on the ground.
A product which promises net improvements of 45% at most obliges us to put more support measures in place in other areas.
The same goes for fiscal incentives.
Even if the same potential and the same financial resources as are envisaged in this area were to be invested in thermal insulation for example, energy requirements could be reduced by three times as much.
From a purely ecological point of view, then, the appropriateness of biofuels is at least up for discussion, but we cannot deny that this product has a future.
Innovation is inherent in it.
Yet, when looking into the future, we also have to take into account the fact that this provides a way ahead especially for the candidate countries, with large areas of agricultural land.
However, it is in this sector that policy is moving in the direction of maximising production, and probably doing so with the aid of genetic manipulation.
Do we want that as well?
If we do, then OK.
In addition, there is still doubt about the cost-benefit ratio from the consumer's point of view.
I hope that is something we will be able to resolve.
If, for example, the price of crude oil drops on world markets, the cost of producing petroleum will also be down, and producers of the agricultural raw materials may, or indeed will, require additional subsidies.
This is not a time for euphoria, but the proposed compromises between the groups certainly give us a chance.
