Mr President, as is only right, Parliament is largely united on this issue.
No doubt, any problems are on the Council's side, and I only hope that we do not have a repeat of what happened many years ago when Mrs Scrivener, who was a Commissioner at the time, submitted a similar package and the Council ended up rejecting it.
I hope there will be a better outcome this time.
A number of speakers have rightly pointed out that there are cheaper ways of making CO2 avoidable, and there can hardly be any dispute about that.
On the other hand, biofuels have a range of advantages to offer that should not be underestimated.
As we produce biofuels, so our energy dependence will diminish.
I believe that the burden they will lift from agricultural policy is an argument that will carry particular weight in consequence of the addition of the countries of Eastern Europe to the enlarged EU.
I speak as someone who has had a certain amount to do with technology when I say, thirdly, that I believe it will give technology a certain boost, in that new processes and techniques will be developed, and businesses can rest secure in the knowledge that they will be supported throughout the years that they are working on biofuels, as is only right and proper.
I want, though, to draw attention to two things that this directive will certainly bring in its wake, and which - as I have already said in committee - will not be to everyone's liking.
The biofuels directive will of course increase biologists' desire to create more efficient renewable raw materials with a low environmental impact, and step up their efforts at doing so.
That should not be forgotten.
We will also have to import biofuels, which means that Europe will become a new market for countries such as Brazil, Argentina and the USA, and we should be careful not just to create a market for others, but also a market for ourselves.
