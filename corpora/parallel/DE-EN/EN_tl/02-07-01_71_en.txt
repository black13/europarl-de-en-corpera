Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'ecological' and 'biological' are the buzzwords of the moment, and they are often hollow ones.
It is surely not enough simply to prefix the word 'fuel' with 'bio' and thus create a biofuel that is 100% biological.
On this I am in agreement with the criticisms voiced by Members of this House.
What, though does 'biological' mean?
For me, it means an all-embracing eco-balance sheet, one that covers cultivation and production, as well as the output of gases.
I would therefore ask you to evaluate normal fuels in the same way, without succumbing to the temptation to apply double standards.
Any eco-balance sheet must, in my opinion, include an economic evaluation of biofuels, which must be compared with conventional ones.
Here we have the chance to build up a market of our own in the European Union, which would mean an increase in EU jobs in production and processing.
But a market of our own also means independence - that we would no longer be dependent on global markets and affected by world economic crises.
This Europe of ours will never achieve complete independence in the field of fuels; our consumption is too high for that.
But we can at least make a start on operating and securing our fuel market ourselves in the future.
As has often been mentioned, the cultivation of renewable raw materials could be an additional - and welcome - source of income for agriculture in the European Union.
Good use would be made of land that had been set aside, which would be a source of important and new produce.
Let me conclude by noting that every new market needs to be supported politically, financially, and - very importantly - with ideas, if it is to establish itself on a long-term basis.
It is my contention that at least 50% of wind farms would not have been built without subsidies, and heaven knows that not all of them function efficiently.
Let us do all we can to get the reports through; I ask Members to support them.
