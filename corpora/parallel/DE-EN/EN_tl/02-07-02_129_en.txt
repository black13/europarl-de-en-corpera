Mr Duisenberg, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to divide what I am going to say into four parts.
First, I want to thank the rapporteur for a highly comprehensive report which not only evaluates the ECB's report, but also enlarges on it and adds demands for future action, some of which originated in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
Secondly, I want to thank you, Mr Duisenberg, and the Executive Board for your good cooperation with Parliament and especially with our Committee, although there is room for improvement on both sides.
For our part, we are endeavouring to step up dialogue and make it more exciting, to put questions in clearer terms and elicit more definite answers from you, whilst expecting that you will engage in more public information work.
The public does not always find it easy to discern the thinking behind the ECB's decisions, but we are all aware that its policies directly affect purchasing patterns and the currency; hence the need for more public information to achieve greater transparency, acceptance on the part of the European public, and the stimulation of the economy within the framework outlined in your speech.
We want to congratulate you not only on the work you have done and on the balance sheet you have produced, but also on what you did in the aftermath of 11 September, when the ECB's measures on interest rate and liquidity policy, agreed in consultation with the Federal Reserve Bank, made a good impression as an immediate response to the attacks and one by which the threat of a financial crisis could be successfully averted.
Congratulations also on the successful introduction of euro notes and coins, which faced us in this House with the problem of having statistics indicating, on the one hand, that the introduction went without a hitch, and, on the other, that there was great public uncertainty, on which paragraph 18 of the resolution is intended to have an effect.
I would like to take the opportunity of my speech today to make it clear that the Stability and Growth Pact has played a part in the success of the euro and of the ECB, and that we resist all attempts at reinterpreting and nullifying the Stability and Growth Pact, which arise from short-sighted opportunism in response to day-to-day political events; the aftermath of enlargement will call for further structural and other reforms in politics and in the ECB.
We hope that your work will continue to meet with such success and that you will also prove equal to these challenges.
(Applause from the right)
