Mr President, that was not the position taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and it is unfortunate that Mr Trakatellis has not kept to the usual practice of presenting the Committee' on the Environment's report, but has, regrettably, reproduced his own position.
I find that very annoying and regrettable, and ask you, Mr President, to see to it in future that rapporteurs represent the position of their committee.
If they are unable to do that, they should give the report back to somebody else, rather than present their personal opinion as the committee's position.
