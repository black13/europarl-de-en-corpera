Mr President, the traceability of foods from the field to the supermarket shelf is a must.
At the same time, there must be a voluntary quality assurance procedure for producers, which offers our millions of consumers high safety standards.
Unfortunately, the procedure used in the Member States is too disparate and too unclear.
Without strict controls there will be no way of preventing all forms of abusive labelling.
Consumers want natural foods and are against the use of any technology in the production of food.
Labelling and traceability do not automatically guarantee safety.
The greatest danger lies in the procedure for licensing genetically modified organisms in the food chain in the Community, if this contradicts the general product standards laid down in WTO rules.
The Commission's plans for reforming the CAP are proliferating daily.
The planned amendments are a challenge to the Member States' right of codetermination and to their interest groups.
And farming is being turned into a sort of employment agency, with administration and control systems gaining in importance over good, professional practice.
The new size reductions required are yet another political blunder and are therefore unacceptable.
This report looks a long way into the future and so should a reform.
