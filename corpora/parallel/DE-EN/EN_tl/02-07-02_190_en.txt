Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the social responsibility of enterprises presents a real challenge.
Enterprises, though, consist of employers and employees.
What worries me is that bankruptcies increased by 19% in Europe and by 32% in Germany last year.
That means that, in Germany alone, 50 000 companies closed and over 100 000 workers lost their jobs.
I would therefore be most interested to know which representative organisations of employers you intend to bring together here and if you will be discussing models of optimum training and further training once you have done so.
