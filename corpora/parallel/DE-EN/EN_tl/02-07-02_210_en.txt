Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, commercial chains are generally well capitalised, which is obviously not the case with the small and medium-sized enterprises in competition with them.
On the contrary, most small and medium-sized enterprises have no capital of their own and no venture capital.
What effect do you think the Basle II negotiations will have on this?
Have you already drawn up a sort of Basle II opening balance sheet for each country in order to see how these new rules will impact on our small and medium-sized enterprises?
