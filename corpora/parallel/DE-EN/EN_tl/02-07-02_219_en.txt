Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the following to say in response to Mr Posselt's question: the Commission is not aware of any application from the Czech Republic for an exemption from the acquis communautaire on EC food laws for Utopenec sausages.
The Commission therefore assumes that the method of manufacturing and distributing Utopenec complies with the Community's food safety laws or at least will do so at the time of accession.
Nor did the Czech Republic make any specific application to register Utopenec as a traditional or local product during the course of negotiations, although it did so for other products.
However, the Czech Republic has notified us of its intention to make further applications for registration once it has acceded.
As far as Slivovitz is concerned, the manufacturing method used for it does not comply with the Community definition of fruit spirits set out in Article 1(4) of Regulation No 1576, because ethyl alcohol, i.e. industrial alcohol is added to Slivovitz.
According to the regulation, a spirit drink to which ethyl alcohol is added loses the right to use the generic name fruit spirit in any form in its presentation.
The Community therefore takes the view that Czech Slivovitz cannot be granted a permanent derogation from the definition for fruit spirits.
The Czechs could continue to use the name Slivovitz for these spirits, but they would either have to label them as spirits or change the manufacturing process so that they comply with the rules for fruit spirits.
