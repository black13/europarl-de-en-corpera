Mr President, my dear sir, I should be glad to comply with your final request and let you have a list of products for which applications for derogations have been made; that is a perfectly straightforward matter.
As to your second question on whether all the food standards are complied with during the manufacture of the sausage, the Czechs do of course still have time to make changes before they accede and, as they have not notified this as a matter for negotiation, they will have to do so.
For the rest, I am most obliged to you for raising this question here, because the fact of the matter is that eurosceptics in the Czech Republic keep spreading these false reports in the international press and there is absolutely no foundation for them.
