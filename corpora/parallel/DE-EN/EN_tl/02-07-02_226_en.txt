Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
First may I thank Commissioner Lamy for his strategy on this issue.
One the one hand, consistently enforcing our rights at WTO level is, I think, an essential starting point.
On the other, at the end of the day, the lack of competition for steel products on the American market is pushing prices up and causing quality problems, which in turn means that European industry has a better chance of selling processed products from the European Union.
Do the statistics already show that European products are now being sold much more successfully on the American market?
