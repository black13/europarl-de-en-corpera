Mr President, my dear sir, thank you very much for your invitation to visit you in Andalusia.
I love that part of Spain, as you know.
We must make the necessary arrangements, although basically I am, of course, prepared to visit Andalusia in the same way as I travel to numerous other coastal regions in the Community.
But back to the subject in hand.
I understand your concern about small-scale fisheries and it is true that these smaller ships tend to be at a competitive disadvantage compared with large ships.
When we decided on the fisheries reform proposals in the Commission, we also said that we were prepared to discuss continuing help for these small in-shore fishing fleets in particular with the Member States, and of course with Parliament, during Council negotiations.
We take exactly the same view here.
I too feel that we must do everything we can to sustain these small in-shore fishing fleets.
