Mr President, honourable Members, my dear sir, the question of how to guarantee sustainable fisheries in the Mediterranean is, without doubt, a very important one.
May I reiterate that you will see in the proposals which we have submitted that we plan to table a separate communication to Parliament and the Council dealing solely with an action plan especially for the Mediterranean.
It deals with far more than the question of the industry or the large ships which also fish in parts of the Mediterranean.
The problem here, unfortunately, is that we have far fewer scientific data on the Mediterranean than we do in comparison, for example, with the north-east Atlantic and there is no institution which compares with the ICES for the north-east Atlantic.
So the first problem is how or where we can obtain the data needed to make reasonable management decisions.
The second problem in the Mediterranean, as you quite rightly said, is that the Mediterranean is fished both by Community ships and by those of other countries bordering it.
In the Aegean, as we all know, there are repeated problems with one of Greece's neighbours.
We also need to see if we can introduce and involve third countries in regional management in this area.
And finally, we then need to look into the specific social and socio-economic aspects of Mediterranean fisheries.
But one thing is clear: compared with the Atlantic, the proportion of small ships is several times bigger in the Mediterranean and most fishing is done by these small ships, not big ones.
