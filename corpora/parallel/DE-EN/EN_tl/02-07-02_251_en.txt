Mr President, honourable Members, the Atlantic Dawn is duly entered on the official Irish fishing fleet register and has therefore also been entered on the Community fleet register.
However, the activities of this fishing vessel are a matter for the Irish Government, not the Commission.
The Member States are required to comply with the targets for fishing capacity and fishing effort set for them in the multiannual guidance programme.
As long as these values are not exceeded, the Member States can deploy their registered ships as and how they choose.
The Atlantic Dawn is entitled to fish in European waters under the Irish quotas.
As far as MGP targets are concerned, Ireland has already exceeded capacity targets in its pelagical segment, which is why the Commission instituted infringement proceedings against it.
Ireland then reduced its capacities in this segment and notified the Commission that it would withdraw further fishing capacity by the end of this month in order to attain the target.
We shall see if it in fact does so during the course of this month and shall monitor these developments very closely.
