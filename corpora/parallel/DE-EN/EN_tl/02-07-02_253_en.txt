Mr President, may I briefly reiterate exactly what is at issue here.
The fact is that the Irish Government applied for this ship, which is a very big ship, one of the biggest ships there is, to be included in the fleet register, but it took some time at the beginning for Ireland to comply with the terms of registration.
According to the notifications received by the Commission, these terms were met or the Irish Government stated that it would meet them.
It then turned out that MGP targets were being exceeded in the pelagical segment.
At which point we instituted proceedings.
The Irish Government then notified us during the course of these proceedings that it was making further capacity reductions so as to ensure that it did not exceed overall capacity in this segment in the future.
If it does so, we no longer have any grounds on which to institute proceedings.
But, at the end of the day, this is a decision for the Irish Government.
If the Irish Government feels that it is better from its point of view to allocate the corresponding quotas to this huge ship, and hence smaller quotas to smaller ships, there is nothing we can do about it.
We have no legal authority to do so.
