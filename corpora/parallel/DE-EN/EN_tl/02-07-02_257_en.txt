Mr President, as you quite rightly said, the question which the honourable Member just asked is in fact identical to the question raised by Mrs Jackson.
I am quite prepared to answer these questions jointly now.
Perhaps I should do so straight away.
The fact is that a size restriction of 9 500 GRT was introduced for the pelagical segment in the agreement with Mauritania, thereby preventing the Atlantic Dawn from fishing under the Mauritania agreement.
However, that has nothing to do with flags of convenience.
The Atlantic Dawn then made private arrangements and is fishing in Mauritanian waters under a private licence.
The owner of the Atlantic Dawn obtained this licence directly from the Mauritanian Government and it is therefore beyond our control.
We can only monitor the part covered by the agreement.
Any agreements over and above that which the Mauritanian Government concludes with other countries or private individuals are beyond our control.
In order to clear up any misunderstanding on the question of infringement proceedings, I said that Ireland is outside the MGP targets for the pelagical segment.
Which is why these proceedings have not been withdrawn.
But the Atlantic Dawn has been properly registered, which is why proceedings against the Atlantic Dawn have been suspended.
