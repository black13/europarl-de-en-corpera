Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Podestà Report on implementation profiles is a very important one, and I would like, at the very outset, to express my thanks to Mr Podestà, the rapporteur.
Anyone who knows me will know that this is not one of my usual ritual practices, but I do think Mr Podestà deserves thanks for taking over the task from our erstwhile colleague and general rapporteur for 2002, Carlos Costa Neves, and for taking over the job I started to do in 2001, observing the implementation of the Budget over the course of the year.
That is a laborious business and far less appealing that the work on the forthcoming Budget year.
How the Commission implements the Budget and makes use of its resources for the purposes that we decide on at the end of the preceding financial year deserves proper scrutiny.
Looking at the course of a Budget year, one sometimes wonders how closely the intentions of the budgetary authority have been adhered to.
A Budget year can positively teem with supplementary and amending budgets and much carrying-over of appropriations.
Closer examination reveals that, taken as a whole, the appropriations carried over add up to a redeployment of funds from one line to another totalling some 1% of the total Budget.
Not that much, then, one might think.
But, as several Members of this House have pointed out, a lot of funds are not spent at all!
From the 2001 Budget, the Member States are getting EUR 15 billion back, that is, over fifteen times the total of appropriations carried over.
Even though we cannot generally accuse the Commission of disregarding our policy intentions, all of us together - by which, in this instance, I mean not only the members of the Committee on Budgets, but also the members of the specialist committees - have to support the Commission right through the year and see to it that they do not lose sight of our policy intentions.
Trust is a good thing, but control is a better one.
