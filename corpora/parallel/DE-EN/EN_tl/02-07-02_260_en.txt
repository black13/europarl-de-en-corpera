Mr President, I do not need five minutes for such straightforward questions.
The fact is that the Atlantic Dawn was not subsidised by the Community and no Community money is therefore involved.
However, I should point out that this is not something which only applies to an Irish ship.
Dutch ships, for example, are fishing in Moroccan waters under private licences and here again we have no authority to intervene.
We have to abide by national laws here.
We cannot go marching into Mauritania or Morocco because they have granted a private ship a licence.
