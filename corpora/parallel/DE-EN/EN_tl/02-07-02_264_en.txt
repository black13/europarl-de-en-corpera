Mr President, my dear sir, the assertion that Denmark fishes six times as much as Spain and France together sounds more like rumour-mongering to me, but there is little point, I think, in our hurling figures at each other.
I suggest we proceed as follows: we shall send you data on the extent and specific quantities of industrial fisheries in writing.
Then you will have it all down in black and white.
I think that is the easiest thing to do.
The question you touched on in connection with relative stability is an altogether different matter.
There are basically two issues here: first the continuation of the twelve- or six-mile zone and, secondly, relative stability in relation to the allocation of TACs and quotas.
As you well know, until now there has been a special provision, which is a throwback to the accession treaties of Spain and Portugal and which expires at the end of this year, and please believe me when I say that, once this provision expires, everyone - including Spain and Portugal - will be subject to the same laws and therefore the same principles when it comes to setting TACs and quotas and the same principles will apply to access to fishing-grounds.
We shall be making the arrangements, we shall be taking care of this and the first time it will affect you will be when the TACs and quotas are set at the end of this year for the coming year.
