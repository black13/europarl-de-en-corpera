Mr President, my dear Madam, I would be delighted to discuss this issue because the Commission takes the overall view that there is no sense in using large sums of Community money to buy new ships and that it would be better to use the money so that poor, small fishermen facing serious economic difficulties have more of a chance in the future.
This is one of the basic concepts of our proposed reform and I am sure we shall have plenty of opportunity to discuss it.
