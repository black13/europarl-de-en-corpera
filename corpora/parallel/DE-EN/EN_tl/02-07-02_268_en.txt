Mr President, my answer to this is as follows: of course the Commission knows how many farms grow tobacco in the European Union.
There are around 100 000 tobacco farms.
As for the distribution of workers in the tobacco sector according to the criteria mentioned by the honourable Member, in other words, how many of these are young farmers and how many are women, unfortunately we have no statistics on this and there are no figures I can quote in answer to your question.
