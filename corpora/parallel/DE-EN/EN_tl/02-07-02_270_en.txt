Mr President, my dear Madam, I too am sorry that I am unable to give you any information on the number of women working in tobacco cultivation, believe me.
But, unfortunately, the Statistics Office does not have the figures needed to differentiate between male and female workers.
Perhaps we could take the initiative of approaching the Statistics Office and suggesting that these data be broken down by gender in future.
On your other question: I fail to see why the accession of Poland to the European Union should cause any particular problems for tobacco cultivation per se in the European Union.
The problem we shall face within the European Union in the future will basically be determined by the fact that there is a Parliament initiative to stop subsidising tobacco cultivation.
I can see that this may be a problem, because it will obviously have social consequences on the farmers in question.
But the accession of Poland to the Community will have little effect on cultivation.
There is one other important point you should bear in mind here and that is that different types of tobacco are cultivated which do not compete directly with each other.
