Mr President, my dear Madam, I quite agree that jobs done by women are very important in the fisheries sector, and not just in processing.
A great many women work in the processing industry and in the canning industry, but they are also playing an increasing part in fishing itself.
It is well worth considering special measures for women here, especially in connection with fisheries structural policy and the future of fisheries structural policy, which is all about setting subsidies, just as we have done in rural development policy.
I would rather not promise any separate document here and now, but I shall consider the matter, give it due attention and notify you of whatever action we propose.
