Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele have submitted a detailed report which should clearly help to improve information and transparency and freedom of choice for European consumers.
Priority is given to human and animal health.
But the most important criterion must be that this framework legislation is practicable.
More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe with excessive red tape.
We need, first and foremost, a practicable regulation on the accidental and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in products which are not genetically modified.
The threshold value of 1% in the Commission proposal is reasonable and realistic and a useful guide for manufacturers and consumers.
The threshold value is important if various forms of cultivation are to exist side by side because cross-pollination, for example, is technically impossible to preclude in nature.
The second important point is that only products which are scientifically proven to contain GMOs should be labelled; it makes no sense to label ingredients extracted from genetically modified plants, such as oil, sugar or flavour enhancers, when there are no GMOs in the final product.
Nor should we label meat, eggs or milk from animals fed with GM feed at any point, because this is misleading for consumers.
I am in favour of product-based labelling and expressly opposed to process-based labelling because it is technically impossible to control.
We should only label where we have proof and can therefore control labelling requirements.
