Madam President, Commissioners, the reports by Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele belong together and a great deal has already been said about that in today's debate.
Most people in Europe are against the use of modern biotechnology outside the laboratory, but there are varying shades of opinion.
Surveys have shown that most people feel they have too little information to make a clear judgment.
Around 86% of those surveyed in the European Union said that they would like to know more before eating genetically modified food.
Researchers concluded from their results that there is a market for genetically modified food in Europe, provided it offers clear advantages.
However, consumer freedom of choice is paramount.
Consumers want to be able to decide freely between GM products and conventional products.
We have debated the new labelling directives most intensively today.
As far as I can see, we should only label products where we have proof and can control labelling requirements.
If the presence of genetically engineered changes in the product itself cannot be proven, as in the case of meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on genetically modified feed, then I think there should be no labelling requirement.
And another very important point for me: I do not like the idea of incalculable liability risks for companies, which is why practicable limit values are essential.
I would therefore advocate a single limit value of 1%.
The Commission points out in its working paper that zero tolerance is impossible in practice; several of my fellow Members have repeatedly addressed the imponderables of nature and I have nothing new to add to what they have already said.
