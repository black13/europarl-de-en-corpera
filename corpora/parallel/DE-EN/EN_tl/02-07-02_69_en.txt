Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the progress made by the European Union in combating illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings is to be welcomed.
This is particularly the case with respect to improved safeguards against fraud and the securing of the EU's external borders.
It is intolerable that over 500 000 illegal immigrants should find their way into the EU every year.
They are a constant source of criminality, oppressing and enslaving people, endangering the life and limb even of children.
Those who traffic in human beings must therefore be punished as severely as those who deal in drugs.
Both shamelessly exploit human misery for financial gain.
Eastward enlargement has proved the occasion for the German Federal Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, to bring off the flop of the year with his intention to take the candidate countries hostage to the internal reform of European agricultural policy.
The European Union's current inability to do its homework in good time is not a reason to jeopardise the reunification of Europe.
The fact that the Americans are currently massively increasing their agricultural subsidies means that Chancellor Schröder's threat to suspend direct payments to European agriculture would have a catastrophic effect on its competitiveness.
It is precisely in difficult times like these that Europe must keep on course.
Your proposals, Mr Aznar, like those of the Commission, Mr President of the Commission, are a sound basis on which to further develop of the European Union, but the outcome of the second Irish referendum continues to hang over eastward enlargement like the sword of Damocles.
This is where the European Union has to improve its overall image in order to reach people's hearts.
