Mr President, Commissioner, we have heard much that is on the credit side, but a number of drawbacks have been enumerated, and there I would like to join in.
The report shows that much is left to be desired in terms of practical application one and a half years after the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women came into effect.
Action in the areas of social rights, economic life and participation and representation has produced nothing in the way of positive outcomes, as the difference in income between women and men in the private sector is still around 25%.
Only 23% of entrepreneurs are women.
The proportion of women involved in decision-making processes scarcely reaches 30% in most countries, and the institutions of the European Union, with women represented in between 13% and 30% of positions, are not exactly the best of examples.
We have already heard how the composition of the Convention plays its part in this.
If we are to make demands of the Member States, we should be going on ahead and setting the best possible example.
Not only are the EU's existing directives on the equality of men and women in need of improvement, they also need to be better transposed in the Member States.
This also means better monitoring by the Commission, so that equality will work; otherwise, it strikes me as nothing but a farce if directives exist and we are constantly having to check to see that progress is being made with their implementation.
