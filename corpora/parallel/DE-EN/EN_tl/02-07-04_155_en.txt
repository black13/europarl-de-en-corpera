Mr President, the situation in Angola is indeed most tragic.
From day to day, images of starving people and dying children are winging their way around the world.
According to the information at my disposal, 500 000 people - half a million - are in immediate danger of death.
What this makes clear is that humanitarian aid, especially food supplies, is second only to the ending of the war as a matter of priority.
If the country is to be put on a stable footing, though, this will of course presuppose that the destruction of its infrastructure be ended.
The consequences of the depopulation that was enforced in order to cut UNITA off from its supply lines must be dealt with.
Emergency aid is a prime necessity before any process of political consolidation can be set in motion, and the establishment of peace and the conditions for successful elections both presuppose and require that this be done.
