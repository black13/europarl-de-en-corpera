Mr President, we have a partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, and are working on a comprehensive energy partnership with it, yet there are to this day still no democratic standards in Russia.
There is still no room for either democracy or a free press to thrive.
One touchstone for the rule of law in Russia is the case of Grigory Pasko, in which, as in so many other cases, the judgment is founded on secret military legislation, dating back to the Soviet Union and not even recorded in the country's own Ministry of Justice.
What did Grigory Pasko do?
He did nothing more than was his duty as a journalist and a citizen.
He demonstrated his public-spiritedness by photographing the illegal dumping of atomic waste.
For that, Russia has condemned him, sentencing him to many years' forced labour.
I consider it a scandal that Europe stands by watching such a thing happen.
A petition will be drawn up requesting that the court's judgment be reconsidered, but I do not get the impression that efforts within Russia will be enough to get this flagrantly unjust sentence revised.
I therefore see it as a matter of urgent necessity that President Putin, who has expressed his willingness to let independent media into his country, should be taken at his word.
I would like Mrs Diamantopoulou to tell the cabinet that I see it as one of the Commission's important responsibilities, in any planning involving Russia, to put human rights and fundamental democratic rights at the top of the agenda and, as a matter of prime importance, to demand an answer on this from the Russian government before moving on to intergovernmental discussions about energy.
