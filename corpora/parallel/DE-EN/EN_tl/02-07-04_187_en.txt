Mr President, the great deterioration in the situation in Belarus is manifested, among other things, by its presence among the topical and urgent subjects of major importance two part-sessions of this House in a row.
That really is exceptional, as this item on the agenda is otherwise much more diverse.
It is quite incredible how the autocratic Mr Lukashenko keeps on believing that he can get away with things in Belarus that would be permitted nowhere else in Europe and allowed nowhere else in the area covered by the OSCE.
It is quite clear to my mind that he has lost his grip on reality.
The tragedy of the situation in this country, and of the developments occurring in it, is exemplified, in the area of freedom of opinion, by the fact that opinion surveys now have to be cleared by the government, with checks having to be carried out on who is commissioning them, how they are funded and how they are run, and a government commission demanding corrections to their results.
To take another example, our delegation in this Parliament received a letter from the Ambassador of Belarus dictating to us what we are to do with our agenda.
Perhaps he can do that with his own parliament, but we are freely elected deputies and still decide on our agenda ourselves.
That only goes to show in what sort of situation Belarus' parliamentarians find themselves.
We are submitting this resolution at a time when the question is being raised within the OSCE as to whether or not Belarus' Parliamentary Assembly is to be recognised.
I do not believe that it can be recognised, as it is not freely elected.
