Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations to Mr Schmid on a very good report on the Commission communication 'Strengthening the local dimension of the European Employment Strategy?.
Having been the rapporteur on Parliament's guidelines on employment policy in 2000, I take pleasure in referring to what we in the plenary decided almost unanimously at the end of 1999.
We decided that "the special role and responsibility of local and regional authorities, other partners at the regional and local levels, as well as the social partners, needs to be more fully recognised and supported.
In addition, the role of the Public Employment Services in identifying local employment opportunities and improving the functioning of local labour markets, should be fully exploited."
The call for Territorial Employment Pacts, sometimes couched in rather nebulous terms in the Commission document, is supplemented in the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs by the demand for the creation of employment pacts between the social partners in enterprises.
I was recently convinced by an example in my constituency of how successfully an attempt of this sort can work.
The BÃ¼rkert works in Ingelfingen were saved by this.
There is a need for a binding guarantee of employment to be agreed in return for workers waiving their rights to certain benefits.
This will be significantly improved by the incorporation of the local dimension into the European employment strategy.
What this is about is European coordination of national employment policies while incorporating also their local counterparts, the objective being a joint strategy to tap society's potential for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.
This is about subsidiary solutions that harmonise flexibility and social security.
The right formula for the European employment strategy is 'think globally, act locally? and it is with that in mind that we want to support Mr Schmid's report.
