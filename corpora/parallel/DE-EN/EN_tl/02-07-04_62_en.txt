Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to withdraw our support for Amendments Nos 68 and 69.
This was a joint motion by the rapporteur and myself on behalf of our respective groups, which we tabled out of a desire to be accommodating to the Council, which wanted an immediate resolution, albeit one contrary to the line taken by the Committee.
The Council, however, did nothing to meet us halfway, and my understanding of the codecision procedure is not that it involves conceding negotiating points at first reading stage without getting anything in return.
We will be voting against both amendments.
