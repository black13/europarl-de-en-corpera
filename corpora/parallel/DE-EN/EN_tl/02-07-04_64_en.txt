Mr President, I wish to point out that something very strange has happened to Amendments Nos 13 and 35.
In the original report, the term "consolidated version" was used, but in the folders - both of which are in German - both the amendments refer to a "codified version".
I would like to say that there have been difficulties with the legal department, but that the original version adopted by the Committee is described as "consolidated" and not "codified".
I am sure that more work will have to be done on this when final adjustments are made, but I just wanted that to be on the record.
