Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not disagree on the matter in hand, but we do urge that we go about it in another way.
On Wednesday, we will be having a truly wide-ranging and very serious debate on Iraq and other important issues, and our group has made very careful preparation for this not only as regards speaking time but also as regards what is to be said.
We therefore propose that it is not this week that we should have the debate on the International Criminal Court, but during the second September part-session.
That would in any case still precede 30 September and the Council meeting, so we can have a prior debate concluded by a resolution.
There is, then, no disagreement about this, but, when it comes to procedure, we favour the second September part-session here in Strasbourg rather than this week.
