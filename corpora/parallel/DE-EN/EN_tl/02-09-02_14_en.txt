Mr President, this decision leads me, as a member of the delegation to Romania, to make a request of you.
In mid-September, the Romanian parliament will be discussing the agreement which their foreign minister has negotiated with the USA in this matter, without - as you will perhaps be aware - keeping them informed about it.
The debate in Bucharest will therefore be a very lively one.
If we are to discuss this only at the second September part-session, you should perhaps write to your opposite number to the effect that the Romanian parliament should hold fast to the EU common position and perhaps decline to support this agreement.
That is what would be called for in that situation.
Thank you very much.
