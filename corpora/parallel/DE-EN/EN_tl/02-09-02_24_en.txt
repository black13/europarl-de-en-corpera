Mr President, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy held a debate with the Danish Presidency last Monday on the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme.
This debate included discussions between a number of Members, including the Chairman of the Committee and the Danish minister, in the course of which it was stated that the Council, having adopted the Framework Programme's specific programmes, which were laid down without Parliament's codecision, had come to an agreement with specific reference to the sensitive ethical issues.
This led a number of Members to assert that this agreement goes against the agreement which Parliament reached with the Council of Ministers in May.
There was no mention, in the documents we had to vote on before second reading, of any agreement on the issues that the Council has now come to an arrangement about, nor have I had any information about it.
It therefore follows that it is right and proper for Parliament to put questions to the Council.
As an ordinary MEP, though, I would also like to ask if the President or anyone else has been provided with documents that were not available to all Members of this House when the vote was taken.
