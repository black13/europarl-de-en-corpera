Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, in the minute I have, I want to focus on the question of what is to become of set-aside.
There is an overall shortage of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, particularly of protein crops, and deficits in the area of protein production.
Our concern is, then, with the recovering of areas for the production of protein, and this we can achieve through protein cultivation in rotation - the ecological distribution of crops.
If, in the new proposal, you provide for the permanent set-aside of 10% in order to protect nature, then there can certainly be no objection to incorporating 5%-10% into this category in order also to take account of factors that determine the character of the landscape.
In the other set-aside areas, though, we must focus on the environmental impact of protein cultivation and on the fact that this cultivation of protein yields 40 to 80 kilos.
We need to look again here at how we achieve a monitoring system and how, too, we can incorporate environmental factors into the negotiations with the Americans in such a way that we come to a new agreement and are not permanently obliged to refer back to one that dates back ten years -- by which I mean Blair House.
