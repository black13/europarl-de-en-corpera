Mr President, on the evening of 12 August, my daughter bought a camera in my home town of DÃ¶belin, population 28 000.
Three hours later, the shop no longer existed.
The same applies to 1 425 homes in the district and 711 businesses.
And of course, schools, scientific establishments and, above all, public infrastructures were seriously affected and, to put it bluntly, agriculture is staring ruin in the face.
As we have already heard, 220 000 hectares were flooded and the provisional estimates of flood damage to farming are enormous.
Mrs Fiebiger has quoted the figures.
Worst of all is the loss of animal fodder, mainly as the result of the grain lost.
Governments and the European Union have already given a considerable sum of money in initial emergency aid.
And quite apart from that, the Commissioner responsible, Franz Fischler, with whom I am in constant personal contact, and again may I express thanks to him for that, has ordered EUR 560 million to be paid in the form of direct payments to farmers, although the final figure will be higher because, according to my information, regions in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have now been included.
As you have already heard, set-aside areas have been provided, together with cheap grain for animal fodder.
My request, or rather my question is this: have these EUR 560 million really been available since 1 September?
To hear that from you in person, my dear Mr Fischler, would be music to the ears of the victims.
Because make no mistake.
This is a national emergency and, although the regions affected must make every effort to deal with it, they will be stretched beyond their financial limits.
Dealing with this disaster in the short-, medium- and long-term is therefore the job of these regions, the national governments and the European Union.
And action must be taken quickly because the people affected are in urgent need of financial support.
