Mr President, honourable Members, fellow members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank you all for your speeches and for the tone of this debate.
I think this really was one of the European Parliament's finest hours.
I have no wish to speak at length; I merely wish to answer the questions addressed directly to me.
The main question here is, how will the measures decided for farming now be implemented?
The first measure decided was to use set-aside areas.
This measure is up and running.
These areas can already be used in the regions in question.
The second measure decided was to provide grain for fodder from intervention stocks in Austria.
This measure is also up and running.
Applications are already being received from the Austrian authorities.
The third and most comprehensive measure is to give priority to advance payments of 50% of the area premiums in the current budgetary year.
Mr Goepel asked what the state of play is here.
The decision has been taken and will be processed, the money will be allocated using the normal allocation procedures used for premiums.
This is the quickest method.
In other words, the sums in question are released by the executive in each Member State.
May I add that this has since been somewhat extended and that these advance payments already total over EUR 900 million.
