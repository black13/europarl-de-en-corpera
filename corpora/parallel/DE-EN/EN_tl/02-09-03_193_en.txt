Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, your main argument for relaxing the feed ban is the cost of disposing of animal by-products.
Now that is more of an economic argument or an environmental protection argument.
To hear this argument from you, the Commissioner for consumer protection, comes to me as something of a shock.
Should we not be setting the cost of disposing of animal by-products against what it will cost European farmers if there is a renewed outbreak of BSE in their herds or - worse still - if people start falling ill?
If you could answer me that, I would be most grateful.
I still take the view that we need a total feed ban on meat and bonemeal at least until we can determine how infectious the prions responsible for the outbreak of BSE are and until we can define different types of bonemeal for each type of animal.
Only then will we be sure that the bonemeal in poultry feed, for example, does not come from poultry.
