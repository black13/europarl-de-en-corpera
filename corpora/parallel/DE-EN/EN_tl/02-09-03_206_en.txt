Mr President, Commissioner, this pilot project affects three countries, Germany, Austria and Italy and operates in a sensitive zone through the ancient Hauptkamm, where the Brenner motorway operators on the south side of the Brenner pass and now the equivalent organisation on the north side of the Brenner pass want to use the road to subsidise the railways, so as to prevent ecological damage and set up a pilot project.
But the project needs to run until 2035.
2005 is not long enough, i.e. the Italian concession needs to be extended by thirty years.
The Italian Government sent a message of support through Minister Buttiglione, until recently a Member of this House, and it is to be hoped that this pilot project, which could set an example and which your colleague, the Commissioner for transport, thinks is a positive move, will be seen as such and an exception will be granted.
Though I have heard you make positive points I have not heard you say you are in complete agreement.
Could you perhaps comment on that?
