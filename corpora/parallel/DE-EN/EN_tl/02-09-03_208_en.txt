Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I agree with the Commissioner; obviously, the routes across the Alps are in competition with one another.
But, as we all know, these routes are in a highly sensitive zone.
If one motorway company has saved money over a number of years in order to be able to offer a better solution, then my question is, why can we not leave it to the motorway companies to decide if they wish to offer technical alternatives in order to improve traffic across the Alps?
I would be interested to know what you think about this and whether we should leave it to the companies involved to decide the technical alternatives.
