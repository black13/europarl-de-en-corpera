Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I think making the principle of mutual recognition our focal point in Europe sets a good example.
I thank the Commissioner for his clear analysis and for clarifying the intention of the Commission, in its capacity as Executive, to really assert itself here and help this principle gain acceptance.
During the course of harmonisation, we do of course come up against limits which people are not always willing to accept.
We have also spent a great deal of time discussing test marks issued by independent certified institutes which test products.
Is there pan-European recognition for products tested in one country?
Are these test marks recognised as such in other countries?
If they were, that would increase the safety of products considerably in the future.
Does the Commission have plans for any initiatives here?
