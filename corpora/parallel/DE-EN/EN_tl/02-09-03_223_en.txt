Mr President, since direct talks began on 16 January 2002, the leaders of both communities have tabled proposals on the four core issues.
However, the parties have been unable to broker a comprehensive solution in keeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions.
As the direct talks are confidential, the Commission is unable to evaluate the results and has to rely on regular evaluations carried out by the United Nations Security Council.
The talks have reached a watershed now that the parties' self-imposed deadline of the end of June 2002 has passed.
Accession negotiations with Cyprus are proceeding as planned.
The Commission will be tabling its regular reports on 16 October of this year.
They will contain a detailed analysis of what progress the candidate countries have made in meeting the accession criteria and will be the basis for the Commission's recommendations on the countries which meet all the accession criteria.
These recommendations and any outstanding issues arising out of the negotiations will be examined at the European Council in Brussels at the end of October this year and accession negotiations should be concluded on the basis of these recommendations before the European Council in Copenhagen in December 2002.
Accession agreements should be signed in the spring of 2003 and ratified by the national parliaments in the following months.
Before accession agreements are signed, the Council will decide on the accession of the candidate countries after consulting the Commission and after receiving the assent of the European Parliament, as required under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union.
