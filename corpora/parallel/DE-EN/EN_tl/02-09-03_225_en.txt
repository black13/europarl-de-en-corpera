I agree with the honourable Member that time is now of the essence and that it is most regrettable that no decisive progress has yet been reached on the Cyprus question.
The honourable Member is also right in stating that the European Union is doing everything in its power to help bring about a solution and it shall continue to do so in the future.
We shall endeavour to reach a solution right up to the last day.
It is very difficult to answer your question about the attitude of the Turkish Government, especially now the political climate has changed in Turkey.
I shall be speaking to the Turkish Foreign Minister this week and perhaps then I shall have a better idea as to whether we can expect a decisive and constructive attitude from the Turkish side in the time ahead.
For the moment, all I can say is that I am no more able than you to predict how Turkey will act on this question, but I should like to take this opportunity once again to make an urgent appeal to Turkey to recognise that it is the Turkish Cypriots who stand to suffer if no solution can be found to the Cyprus question.
They stand to gain the most from a political solution and the accession of Cyprus.
But they stand to lose the most if no political solution can be found.
