I would say to the honourable Member that my reading of the situation is slightly different from yours.
I agree that I have said nothing new.
But that is because there is nothing new to report.
Which is something we both regret.
Responsibility for the political process, i.e. the process which should resolve the whole problem of the future, lies with the United Nations.
Neither the Council nor the Commission nor the European Parliament has any competence in this matter.
You should be very careful not to undermine the authority of the United Nations here.
Which is why it is the established policy of the European Union - and that applies to everyone, Council, Parliament and Commission - to support the efforts of the United Nations with every means at our disposal.
The most important instrument which we can give the United Nations and which we have given them is the accession process.
The fact that it has come to direct talks at all is only because Cyprus has accession prospects and because the Turkish side now understands that the European Union intends to keep to its enlargement timetable.
So I think that the best way of exerting pressure on Turkey - and believe me we shall do so - is to ensure that it knows that the enlargement timetable is non-negotiable.
