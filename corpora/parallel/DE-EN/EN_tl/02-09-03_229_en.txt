My dear Sir, Cyprus is at an advanced stage of accession negotiations.
Of the 31 chapters, 28 have been provisionally closed.
No more can be done at this stage of the proceedings.
As far as discussions with the aim of finding a political settlement under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General are concerned, I have just expressed full support for this process, as has the EU on numerous occasions.
As for the question as to how the dialogue between the two ethnic groups may affect accession negotiations, the Commission's approach is dictated by the conclusions of the European Councils in Helsinki in 1999 and in Seville in 2002.
The Union has stated that it wishes a united island to accede.
However, it has also pointed out that a political solution is not a sine qua non to the accession of Cyprus to the Union, if the Cyprus question has not been settled by the time negotiations come to an end.
The decision will be taken by the Council, taking account of all the relevant factors.
There is still a chance that we shall achieve our objective of political solution before accession, which is why the European Council has called on the leaders of both ethnic groups to step up the talks.
If a political solution is reached, the accession agreement will reflect the agreement reached.
As the European Council in Seville recently declared, the European Union is prepared to include the terms of a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus question in the accession agreement.
We have emphasised that we feel that Cyprus should be able to speak with one voice and that Cyprus needs to be able to apply Community law throughout the island.
If a settlement is reached and Cyprus accedes as a united country, the European Union is prepared to make a huge financial contribution towards the rapid development of the northern part of the island in the run up to accession.
