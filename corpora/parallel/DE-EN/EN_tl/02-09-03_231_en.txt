Mr President, Mr Hatzidakis, you are quite right.
The Commission will table a report on 16 October containing its appraisal of whether the candidate countries with which we are currently engaged in negotiations are ready to accede.
As you know, ten countries have been named, including Cyprus, with which we hope to complete negotiations by the end of this year.
The Commission will then state on 16 October whether or not this judgment still applies.
Naturally, this will include a clear statement on Cyprus by the Commission.
