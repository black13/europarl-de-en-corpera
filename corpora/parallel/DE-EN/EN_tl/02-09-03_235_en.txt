Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, no knowledge such as you have just described has come to the Commission's attention.
I would therefore be most grateful if you would let me have a copy of the information which you obviously have at your disposal.
However, I must reiterate that the Commission does not consider it unacceptable interference for religious communities to join in political debate as part of civil society.
I know of no cases in which human rights are being violated as a result of action by religious communities.
If you have specific examples of this, we shall of course be glad to look into them.
As far as the information campaign is concerned, I can confirm that we are conducting such campaigns, especially on the subject of equality for women.
It is part of the communication strategy which we are implementing together with Parliament in order to make citizens in future Member States aware of all aspects of future Community law, especially human rights and the rights of individuals and groups.
