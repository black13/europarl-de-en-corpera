Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission sees no point in speculating on what will happen in the hypothetical event that the Treaty of Nice is not ratified.
As you know, bringing about the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is the common aim of the European institutions, as the European Council made perfectly clear recently in Seville in June 2002.
The Treaty needs to be ratified because, otherwise, it will be very hard to conclude the enlargement process by the planned dates.
The Commission would remind the House that the European Council in Seville in June 2002 welcomed the Irish Government's determination to get the Treaty of Nice ratified in Ireland.
This issue was aired this weekend at the meeting of foreign ministers in Denmark, the main item on the agenda of which was enlargement.
The Member States and the Commission again agreed that we should not interfere in the opinion-forming exercise in Ireland by making statements about what we would do if the second referendum again had a 'no' majority.
