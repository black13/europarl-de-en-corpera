Mr Schmid, once again please read my lips.
There is no plan B and we are expressly prohibited from engaging in this sort of deliberation.
It is perfectly straightforward.
If I were to say here and now that the Commission is considering an alternative or that the Commission has an alternative, before we knew it Irish voters would be asking, what is the alternative?
We should very much like to know what it is because then we might not need to ratify the Treaty of Nice at all.
So if we say there is an alternative, then all we are doing is making sure the Treaty will never be ratified.
And we do have a reason for insisting on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice because, not only does it contain the technical requirements for concluding enlargement negotiations in the institutional section, it also contains political requirements for concluding the enlargement process which are indispensable to a whole series of Member States.
The reason why we did not opt for the simple procedure in this enlargement round and simply write the institutional rules into the accession agreements was that most Member States felt that both institutional and political changes were needed before this very radical change in the nature and state of the European Union.
These changes are enshrined in the Treaty of Nice and I advise you to take account of them.
For a whole series of Member States, the Treaty of Nice has to be taken in its entirety.
The seemingly convenient alternative, whereby if there is no Treaty, then we simply lift out the institutional sections and write them into the enlargement agreements, is unacceptable to a whole series of Member States and, as far as I am aware, to the majority in the European Parliament.
