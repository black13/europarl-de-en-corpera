Mr President, Commissioner, my question refers back to Question Time with the Spanish Presidency, when the Spanish Presidency told me that the Council could not address this issue because the Commission had not taken an initiative.
This may be a game of pass-the-parcel between the Council and the Commission - I have no idea - but that was what the Council told me.
Hence my question to you.
Of all the new states to come out of the former Yugoslavia, which never needed a visa, there are three countries with which the EU has association agreements, namely Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia, of which Macedonia is the only one which has to have a visa.
Even the neighbouring states of Bulgaria and Romania do not need visas, despite massive security problems, which is why this would be an important message for this country.
They feel humiliated, being at a disadvantage to the other associated countries.
It is the only associated country which has to have a visa!
