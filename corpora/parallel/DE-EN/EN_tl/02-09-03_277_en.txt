Mr President, Commissioners, you started, Commissioner Solbes, by mentioning that you are working on getting the Treaty changed.
I should like to ask you straight up: exactly what changes are you working on?
How will the European Parliament and codecision and joint competence fit in with these changes?
And for my second question.
We all talk about growth and employment.
We have the stability and growth pact.
We have the internal market.
We have the Lisbon process.
What potential for coordination in these three agreements has still not been exhausted and how does the Treaty prevent these orders from being fulfilled?
