Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I think that the Commission's draft regulation illustrates perfectly that the view held by many members that employment policy always plays second fiddle to economic policy is simply not true.
We need both, one presupposes the other.
There is no contradiction between competition policy, growth policy and the need to grant aid to certain sectors, as this regulation clearly illustrates.
We realise that aid has to act as an incentive and help bridge the way to self-help.
Aid is no substitute for economic policy and a well-ordered employment policy.
We still think the best way of creating jobs is to have a functioning internal market, to implement the stability and growth pact, to pursue the Lisbon objectives and to introduce the four freedoms, a deregulated and more flexible employment market and an education system which encourages lifelong learning, diversification of skills and continuing learning.
We welcome this regulation because it says yes to systemisation, simplification and bundling, yes to control and transparency, with the help of the aid register, yes to regulated employment aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, the pillars of European economic and employment policy, and because it says yes to greater coordination between the Commission's policy and the policies of the Member States and between ministries in the Member States.
We have already moved in this direction in Austria, for example, by successfully merging the ministries of labour and the economy into a single ministry.
I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for sending out a clear signal in your statements on aid and the floods that your aid policy takes account of regional differences in economic, competition and employment policy.
