Mr President, you have already answered one part of my question, but I wanted first to say that I do not know whether I signed myself in yesterday, although I was here all day and actually voted.
So I would like to ask that that be added, in view of the Minutes arriving so late anyway.
The second point I wanted to raise is whether it might be possible in future for the Minutes to be distributed in the morning?
This would mean that deferring the approval to the afternoon would have the advantage that we could peruse the Minutes at our leisure in the morning.
I really do not see why their distribution has to wait until the afternoon.
