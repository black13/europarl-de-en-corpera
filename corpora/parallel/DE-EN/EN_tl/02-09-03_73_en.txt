Mr President, we have taken over ten minutes to get from the ninth floor down to the Chamber.
The lifts are absolutely useless - either that or the architects who planned them are.
(Loud applause)
My fellow Member sitting next to me has made a very good comment.
He said, 'We have the safest lifts in the whole of Europe.
They are so safe because they no longer work.
That way, nothing can go wrong.'
But perhaps they should do the job they were designed to do.
