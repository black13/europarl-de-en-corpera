I voted in favour of the Berenguer Fuster report, as I, like the rapporteur, support the Commission's approach to reforming the system of employment aid.
I particularly welcome the way in which the planned limitation of the prior notification requirement now gives regional authorities more scope to develop local employment programmes, thus enabling them to respond quickly and flexibly, with targeted measures, to changed conditions in the labour market in the regions.
It is in particular small and medium-sized enterprises that will benefit from the more lenient conditions, being able, where the need arises, to expect the speedy and straightforward payment of aid, which I emphatically support.
The consolidation in a single text of current legislation on employment aid means that the Commission is also doing justice to its objective of greater transparency in the EU's lawmaking processes.
There is one point, though, in the rapporteur's argument where he and I part company.
The key to improving employment cannot be found in the greater labour-market flexibility for which he calls.
It is far more a matter of responding to the changed situation in the labour market by rethinking employment policy, for example by using new working arrangements to guarantee full employment while simultaneously safeguarding quality jobs.
