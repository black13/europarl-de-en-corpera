Madam President, there are large parts of Mr Maaten's report with which I can agree entirely.
There, are, though, a number of problems.
Firstly, any consideration of Europe and Asia has to include Russia as well.
All the issues touch on the interests of Russia as a great Eurasian power, as became clear only recently in the Korea issue.
Both the North Korean president's journey to Siberia and the plans to build a rail link crossing North and South Korea are worthy of a great deal of attention.
On the other hand, considering the problem more in the unclear light favoured by the USA, and failing to involve Russia and China to the extent they deserve, makes it difficult to achieve a peaceful and fair solution to the problems before us.
Secondly, to have an Asia policy without due consideration of the Shanghai Group and its place in Eurasian political events is to ignore the realities of the situation.
We must now decide on what the place of Central Asia, for example, is to be and what attitude we take towards the USA's Eurasian strategy, which envisages a new geostrategic situation in this area.
The end of the Cold War saw the budding of hope for a peaceful world, and that hope is, unfortunately, waning fast.
Thirdly, the States of the European Union have long disregarded or underestimated developments in Asia and are still persisting in deliberations that are one-sided and sometimes limited.
The Commissioner observed that reality has overtaken the report's reference to India and Taiwan in the same breath.
That I consider to be a political error that takes inadequate account of the realities.
Realpolitik always has something to do with interests, and the EU does well to strike a balance between its own well-understood interests and those of its partners.
