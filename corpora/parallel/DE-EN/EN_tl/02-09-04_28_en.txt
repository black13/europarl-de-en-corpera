Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to take the liberty of making a personal comment, because I have worked with you for a very long time and because I have always very much appreciated the open and honest way in which you have expressed your views.
It seems to me that in the course of the ten-metre journey from here to where you are sitting now you have been struck dumb.
You have not told us what happened in Elsinore, but instead you repeated what the Spanish Presidency achieved in this area in May.
I suppose that is better than nothing.
I would like to comment on Commissioner Patten's two questions.
I can assure you, Mr Patten, that we are all in favour of observing UN resolutions.
However, the United Nations is not an organisation where you can pick and choose - we have to comply with the United Nations Charter and we also have to comply with international law.
The United Nations Charter stipulates the cases in which military means are possible and permissible, and the procedure is also laid down.
The UN Charter does not make any provision for a pre-emptive war or for a war to remove an undesirable government, and we cannot ignore that.
Anyone who wages such a war in spite of this is himself an aggressor and is himself in breach of international law.
The second question was about the broad coalition.
On that point, I can assure you that that should in fact be the European Union's sole objective.
But we are not the ones who have split the broad coalition; no, it has been undermined by American unilateralism.
My question to you is: how can we re-establish this unity, this broad coalition?
