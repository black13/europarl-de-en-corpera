Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the debate about the situation in Iraq and possible military intervention is of course also a debate about the nature of solidarity.
When some Members of this House, Mr Van Orden and Mr Tannock, talk about solidarity, they chiefly mean solidarity with the United States.
For me it chiefly means solidarity within Europe.
That is why I am concerned that the United Kingdom, but also Spain and Italy, are going down a path that suggests that this solidarity could be undermined.
What particularly concerns me is the yawning gap between the United States' and Europe's conceptions of international world order.
The US seems to be increasingly drawn to a theory that international agreements and organisations have, as it were, a merely substitutional role.
For the major powers at least, it seems that national sovereignty and a national view of the world have top priority.
I have great difficulty with the US view that they can decide when to support an international organisation, be it 'just' the United Nations or the International Criminal Court, and when they themselves should act and when they can carry out pre-emptive strikes, and whereby they can define the danger and make decisions on deployment without consulting the international authorities.
Lastly, I also have a big problem with the idea that the President of the United States can read a book over the summer that says that you should not trust the military, because the military will hesitate and always see the risk of failure, and that the sign of a true politician is that he distrusts the military.
Given that the same author, Elliot Cohen, believes that we did not drop enough bombs on Yugoslavia, any country that listens to advisers like that really worries me.
