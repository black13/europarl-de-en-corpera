Below cost selling has been a much-discussed issue over the past months.
The Commission would prefer to use this regulation to lift the ban on this practice in various countries.
Such a commitment would have catastrophic consequences for smaller producers, such as those in the agricultural and viticultural sectors.
Unlike the major supermarket chains, they often sell only one product and cannot pass onto other products the losses involved in below cost selling.
They would therefore lose all their capacity to compete, and, in order to counteract that, many producers would feel themselves constrained to use ingredients that were cheaper and thus of poorer quality.
Lower prices would not alter the fact that it would still be the consumer who lost out in all this.
It was with some satisfaction that I noted that the committee with competence in these matters has adopted the text of my amendment on the subject and managed to reach a compromise that satisfies almost everybody.
In the Legal Affairs Committee, other amendments sought to prohibit any sales promotion whatever of alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer or spirits.
There is no doubt that excessive consumption of alcohol needs to be stopped by means of appropriate education at an early stage.
Moreover, all the Member States stipulate a minimum age for the public consumption of alcohol.
Prohibiting any sales promotion whatever is, however, disproportionate, harming as it does all consumers rather than only the small minority who are addicted to alcohol and therefore need treatment.
A majority on the Legal Affairs Committee realised the absurdity of this step and rejected the amendments to which I have referred.
