I am sorry that Mr Fatuzzo is not here today - I seem to be standing in for him.
However, I am genuinely concerned about this issue.
On the subject of Mrs Stenzel's report, I would like to congratulate her very warmly on it.
I am pleased that we have adopted it today, as elections are being held in Macedonia on 15 September.
What is at stake here is the democratic stability of this important country, to which we are now linked by an association agreement.
This country has experienced a huge refugee problem.
It has had two wars within its borders, many disasters, and now it is afflicted by terrorism.
That is why it is very important for us to signal to Macedonia today that this democracy has our support, this democracy, which over the last four years - during which there have been several major disasters - has amazingly succeeded in achieving a balance between different nationalities.
Even if quite a lot that glitters is still not gold, when you see the remarkable things the Macedonians have achieved, you have to say that they have earned our solidarity.
One sign that we could give would be to abolish the visa requirement for Macedonia at long last.
There was never such a requirement for Yugoslavia, there is not one for Croatia or Slovenia, and in fact Macedonia is the only associated country with a visa requirement.
We should finally accept this small country as a genuine European partner.
