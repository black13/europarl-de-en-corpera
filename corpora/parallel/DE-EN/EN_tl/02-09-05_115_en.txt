Mr President, Ibn-Khaldoun was one of those major historical figures who demonstrate how much we in Europe owe to the Arab and Islamic world.
We accordingly have a duty to give our support to a man, Professor Ibrahim, who has worked in the tradition of Ibn-Khaldoun, and we should make it clear - and this is also something that we owe, as it were, to the heritage of Ibn-Khaldoun - that there are not two concepts of human rights, one for Europe and one for Egypt, but that there is a single concept of human rights here, which is also appropriate in common cultural and historical terms and which should apply universally today.
That is precisely why we owe it to both Professor Ibrahim and the Egyptian people to get involved here.
First, to get Professor Ibrahim released and second, as his health is poor, to secure help for him.
However, the third issue is for us to very clearly advocate close cooperation between Egypt and the European Union.
Egypt is one of our most important partners in the Mediterranean area.
As is evident from the current political crisis, Egypt, alongside Morocco and Turkey, is our most important ally in the Islamic world in the Mediterranean area.
Precisely because Egypt is a partner and an ally and not a debtor country or a country we do not want anything to do with, and precisely because Egypt is an important ally, we should not mince our words in talking to them, as is usual between friends, and we should plead the case of persecuted minorities and persecuted people in general.
Above all we should support those people within the Egyptian State and within the Egyptian Government who want to strengthen human rights rather than demolish them.
Egypt has a great tradition of which I have personal experience from the times when Anwar al Sadat and President Mubarak addressed this House.
We are taking about important partners, and I believe that we should continue along that path and support Professor Ibrahim.
