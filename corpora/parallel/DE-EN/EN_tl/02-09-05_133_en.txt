Mr President, Commissioner, following the success of international action to save the life of Safiya Husseini in March this year, it is all the more shocking to again be faced with the threatened execution of a Nigerian woman and mother by being stoned to death.
Despite international pressure, the Nigerian Government is not willing to meet its obligations under international law and is allowing 10 Nigerian federal states to apply local and religiously motivated criminal law contrary to national constitutional law and international human rights.
At the same time, however, we need to be aware that Nigeria is by no means a unique case.
According to information from Amnesty International, in Iran, for example, in 2001 and 2002 at least six women were sentenced to death by stoning for crimes such as 'adultery and earthly depravity', in some cases after a long prison sentence, and these sentences were carried out.
In Iran alone a total of 35 people, both men and women, have already been executed this year in various ways.
It is therefore high time that the European Union took a stand against this barbaric practice not just in individual cases, but as a matter of principle.
It should also be possible to endeavour to impose sanctions on regimes where practices of this kind take place.
