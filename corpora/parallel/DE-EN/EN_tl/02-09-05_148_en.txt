Mr President, just a few words.
I wanted to mention that this is the first time we are holding an urgent debate since the Corbett reform of our Rules of Procedure.
That means that the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is cut from three to two hours, in order to free up two hours for legislative work.
That was the official reasoning.
Having seen today's agenda, I have to say that this legislative work must be taking place in secret.
I would like to emphasise that I am very willing to make concessions, but not when the other side throws them away.
By that I mean that I accept the idea of allowing two hours for legislative work, but in that case legislative work must actually been done here on Thursday afternoon.
If no such work is being done, then I would like to have those two hours back for the urgencies.
