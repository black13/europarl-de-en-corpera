Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, animal feeds are, after all, food, and we need the positive list.
You have been quoted in the German press as saying that there are thousands of substances that need to be tested.
I hope that was a misquote, because if there really are thousands of substances added to animal feeds, that would be a scandal in itself.
The number of additives needs to be limited and that should be implemented on a restrictive basis.
After all, if the industry then comes along and says that it has forgotten a substance and makes the test available straight away, that substance can be added on.
Of course, the positive list does not mean that we have nothing to worry about.
The fact that there are people willing to dispose of toxic materials by putting them in animal feeds because that is cheaper demonstrates a criminal intent which should be punished accordingly.
That also convinces me - and I think we in this House are all agreed on this - that a simple ban is not enough.
We need to consider what substances we are banning and what happens to them next.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already pointed out that legislation on waste should be closely linked with controls, just as it should be linked with what we are discussing here, so that there is not any overlap.
We have repeatedly seen cases of substances that really should be destroyed finding their way into animal feeds.
However, we should not throw the baby out with the bath water - please note, Mr President!
We have already seen what can happen in the case of food waste.
We also need to establish reasonable recycling arrangements where it is appropriate to do so.
Yesterday, I visited a cat and dog food factory.
When you see the meticulous controls applied there you realise that it is not a question of controls but rather of the sanctions that can be applied by consumers wielding their purchasing power against industry.
