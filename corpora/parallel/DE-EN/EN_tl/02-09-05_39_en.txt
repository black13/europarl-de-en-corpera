) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is an old German saying to the effect that you do not just learn for school, you learn for life.
That saying really does not hold true any more, as it implies that learning is limited to school.
We need to see school as a foundation for acquiring basic skills, and we have to educate people in school as a basis for lifelong learning if we are to meet the challenges of the modern age.
My second point is about the Lisbon objectives.
We will not be able to become the most competitive continent in the world if we do not invest in human resources, which are our greatest asset.
Competitiveness is not just about costs, it is about quality and about education and training, which are fundamental if we want a higher quality level of production, be quicker and reduce costs.
My third point is that we of course also need to attempt to define Europe's objectives.
What do we as a continent want to achieve in terms of educational targets?
There is another question linked to this issue about defining objectives: what are Europe's minimum standards that distinguish us from other continents and which we also want to achieve within the internal market in all the Member States despite varying levels of competence?
The Pisa Study provides an important basis here, because it is comparative and includes a best practice model.
However, we have four players: the Member States, employers and employees, the public and providers.
They all need to work together, and not just on programmes but also as regards financing.
That is why I welcome the proposal for a 'lifelong learning account'.
