Mr President, I would rather like to take a slightly different approach to the one I adopted during the debate on Afghanistan.
I am afraid to say that I am very pessimistic, as I have the very clear feeling that we are heading towards a fresh crisis.
In Afghanistan, which is a multi-ethnic state, there is an increasingly strong feeling amongst the largest national group, the Pashtuns, and whether it is justified or not I cannot say, that they are being neglected as compared with the peoples who lead the Northern Alliance, such as the Tadzhiks and the Uzbeks.
This feeling is giving rise to an increasing potential for conflict, which the surviving Taliban are exploiting.
People talk about the Taliban withdrawal area in eastern Afghanistan as if it were just a military or police problem.
Unfortunately this is a nationality problem, since as I have said the largest group in this multi-ethnic state feels that it is being treated as second class, and that is something that could be explosively dangerous in the long run.
That is why we need a clever strategy for Afghanistan, in order to integrate all the ethnic groups more or less uniformly, which up to now clearly has not been the case.
Despite all the humanitarian successes and all the progress made on paper there is still a time bomb ticking away in Afghanistan.
