Mr President, there is no doubt that there are a great many weaknesses in our food controls, and food safety is an unacceptably low priority.
The revision of the directive on food may help to significantly change this situation.
This is particularly necessary given the growing worldwide trend towards producing food by artificial means.
There are at present no universal controls on the value-added chain, and awareness of state food controls needs to be increased.
There will certainly be an improvement in this state of affairs if we can succeed in involving the agricultural industry, the animal feed industry and those engaged in the monitoring of food.
That will not be a simple task as those in positions of responsibility throughout the chain have a very negative attitude.
State controls are necessary, but we need to create better incentives for promoting voluntary self-regulation and self-regulation under civil law.
State controls can then focus on the high-risk companies and farms that will always exist.
It is not acceptable, when products have been placed on the market contrary to health regulations, for this to be declared the result of a production accident and the products withdrawn under covert or open buy-back schemes so that they will simply be forgotten.
As we know from past experience, it tends to be very difficult to clarify the facts of such cases rapidly and rigorously.
Compulsory reporting of what are labelled as serious health risks is clearly not enough.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 320 farms were temporarily closed because of suspected contamination with Nitrofen, but the discovery of this scandal and the attendant publicity were remarkable not so much because of the number of cases as because of the nature of the crisis.
