Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to express my gratitude to Mrs Paulsen for the good cooperation.
The outcome is a respectable one.
I believe that what have before us is a good regulation, one that meets Parliament's requirements arising from the committee of inquiry into BSE.
The main reason why this is important is that we are not just talking about feeding methods or about the authorisation of feed subject to certain conditions; it is also being made clear what happens to those things that cannot be used in feed.
Rules are therefore laid down on destruction.
That is what we must also achieve when it comes to the area of food waste.
A simple prohibition will not suffice, as it is not known what will then become of the stuff.
As I have always said, you can't just chuck the stuff in a ditch.
It is precisely then that it becomes hazardous, when, unsterilised and unmonitored, it can find its way to animals, possibly leading to the spreading of plague and foot and mouth disease.
But not if it is sterilised.
I am glad the Commission has acceded to this proposal and said that it will, by 2004, present a directive - and yes, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I too think it should be a regulation - on biowaste, in which it will lay down rules on all the possible uses of food waste, including its use as feed.
It is unfortunate that the compromise we reached has not been minuted.
As it will be the next Parliament that will have to negotiate about it - and things are forgotten very quickly - I will be distributing a note for the records which you can have a look at.
We may be able to sign it, and then give this a permanent place as what we want as regards the handling of this issue in the next Parliament.
