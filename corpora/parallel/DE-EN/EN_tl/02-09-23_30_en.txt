Mr President, as Mr Heaton-Harris has obviously got hold of the wrong figures, I would just like to briefly repeat what Mr van Hulten has just said, namely that nine dismissals were requested.
Let me point out to Mr Heaton-Harris that, for technical reasons, eight of these were described as 'removals' and one only as a dismissal, so I would ask you to look at these matters carefully.
I wish Mr Heaton-Harris and other Members would put a stop to their smear campaign against the Commission and stick to the relevant facts when carrying on their dispute with the Commission and with Commissioner Kinnock.
