Mr President, I can add to what Mr van Hulten and Mr Swoboda have said, having had the opportunity last week to read the Commission's report on disciplinary measures because a British journalist wanted to interview me about it.
Some Members may find it of interest that this lady had once been Mr Heaton-Harris's personal assistant.
I have just one point to add to what Mr Swoboda and Mr van Hulten had to say.
Mr Heaton-Harris has just asked what the Commission is considering doing about informing the law-enforcement services.
The lady journalist asked me the same question, to which I responded by asking whether it was not the case in all European countries, as it is at any rate in my own homeland, that disciplinary proceedings are set in motion only after the law-enforcement services and the relevant tribunals have decided on the prosecution of offences.
This leads me to wonder whether Mr Heaton-Harris has got the sequence of events right.
