Mr President, I would say only this to the lady from the Left of this House: the European Union is completely neutral as regards privatisation, but what is a matter of historical record is that employees' rights were never more trampled on than in the states in which everything was nationalised.
That is the lesson of the 20th Century!
(Applause from the right)
