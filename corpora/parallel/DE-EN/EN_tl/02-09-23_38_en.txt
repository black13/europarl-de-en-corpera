Mr President, in connection with the Sixth Framework Programme, we have, in this House, had in-depth discussions on the protection of embryos.
At the time, enormous pressure was brought to bear on the defenders of ethical principles, who were told that, important as the issue was, it must be not be allowed to lead to the blocking of this important research programme, of which the protection of embryos formed only a very small part.
We are now in a situation in which the very same people who said that then are trying to block the whole Framework Programme because of an attempt by a qualified majority in the Council - that is, by quite legal means - to implement ethical principles that we should actually have laid down at an early stage.
I would like to know what, if anything, makes it legitimate for Mr Westendorp to go around claiming to speak for Parliament and declaring that we want a Budget reserve for all or part of the programme.
I do not recall us ever coming to such a decision in plenary.
So I ask that tomorrow's trilogue with the Council should not address issues on which this House has never voted!
