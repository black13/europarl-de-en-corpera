Mr President, previous speakers have already addressed many important items in the 2003 budget, but we have to take care not to focus on too few of its specific areas and end up trying to give everyone a slice of the cake.
Those who suffered flood damage must now get aid very quickly and without red tape, and it goes without saying that provision must now also be made for the future.
We must, though, take steps to deal with the constant increase in unemployment.
SMEs continue to gasp under the excessive burden of taxes and levies placed upon them, whilst, at the same time, investment activity in Europe is declining, and the unemployment rate is, as already mentioned, constantly rising.
The excessively high rate of unemployment among young people is a particular problem, and there is urgent need for special programmes to reduce it.
I hope that Members of this House will support the motions we have tabled on this subject, which seek to promote apprenticeships in SMEs.
Such action would strengthen SMEs and help those young people who, in Europe, have little or no chance of vocational training.
