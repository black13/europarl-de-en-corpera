Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my Committee has very carefully considered its amendments, and its vote to introduce them was unanimous.
As already set out in the guidelines, we put the emphasis on such things as the management of borders, an area in which the ARGO programme is of fundamental importance, contributing as much to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice as it does to preparations for enlargement.
Enlargement makes the topics of external border control, visas, asylum and immigration even more urgent.
Efficient cooperation by the Member States and the candidate countries in these areas, and especially in combating illegal immigration, is indispensable, and requires that the necessary resources be made available for it.
My Committee also supports efforts to integrate third-country nationals who are long-term residents here by establishing a pilot project.
This would serve to transmit the values underpinning our coexistence in Europe.
I am very glad that the Commission accepts this.
Security, freedom and justice are not, of course, to be had for free, but my Committee's present proposals do not represent any increase in the financial framework over against last year's budget.
What we are asking for is only 99.4% of last year's figures.
This is something I particularly want to underline, as we have greater responsibilities towards the EU's citizens in view of 11 September.
I would like to conclude by reminding you of the 21 September 2001 action plan to combat terrorism, which envisages joint action by all specialist units to prevent and combat terrorism, and requires that Europol and Eurojust be equipped for this purpose with special resources.
It is with this in mind that I hope that my Committee will be backed up by Parliament's, the Commission's and the Council's own proposals.
