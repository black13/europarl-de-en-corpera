Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises - SMEs for short - has hitherto always been one of the European Union's major concerns.
I am, then, all the more astonished to note that, in the preliminary draft budget, the Commission is reducing the amounts for this over against last year and the years preceding it.
What it boils down to is that this programme has an implementation rate of between 97% and 100%.
The development of small and medium-sized enterprises is the cornerstone of the internal market, it being beyond dispute that this area accounts for over 90% of the workforce.
It is an area that we must promote and develop, especially as regards new technologies.
I would like to ask the Commission to support our motion that these amounts be augmented.
I would like to use my remaining speaking time to call on the Council to at last come up with a ruling on the seats of the new agencies, so that this House does not end up getting through the legislative procedures in no time, with the Council then needing years to come to any decision on the seat issue.
