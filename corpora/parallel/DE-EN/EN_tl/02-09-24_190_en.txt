Since my colleague Chris Patten is attending two summits simultaneously today, I would like to respond to some of the points on his behalf.
Firstly, in the foreign policy field, we face, after all, the most substantial new requirements for many years, without any scope to expand the budget.
The Council and Parliament have already used the flexibility instrument several times here in order to meet the new requirements.
On the issue of Afghanistan, I would like to extend my thanks to the Council and especially, in advance, to this House for agreeing to the very rapid release at this time of EUR 70 million which are still in reserve for this year in order to provide assistance here, and especially also for granting the necessary direct subsidies to the transitional government.
On the issue raised by Mr Howitt, which also relates to the Global Health Fund, I would point out that we have earmarked EUR 35 million for the Fund in the budget.
After all, we have already contributed EUR 120 million to the Global Health Fund from the EU and EDF budgets.
The decision was only taken recently, so we assume that these funds are adequate.
My colleague Mr Nielson, in particular, has various budget lines available.
He will make a statement on this issue shortly.
As regards Mr RÃ¼big's question on energy, the Commission has proposed a new multi-annual programme for action in the field of intelligent energies, which also provides funding for these energies in third states.
I think the Johannesburg Summit made it very clear once again that we should be giving special priority to this area.
