Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on Sunday's election results in Germany.
I know this is a national event, but all of us are members or one party or another at home.
Sometimes this provides fresh impetus and then it should benefit everyone.
Of course, the framework to be set in the budget for the Committee on Petitions is relatively small.
Nonetheless, this framework is still quite important.
After all, we had more than 2100 cases last year, which the Ombudsman had to deal with.
We regard this still relatively new institution as a major step forward in guaranteeing the quality and control of the administration and citizens' access to it.
We therefore fail to understand why our few requests relating to the coming year's budget, which primarily concern staffing, have obviously fallen foul of the restrictions and tight constraints governing administrative expenditure.
Indeed, I have the impression that in the past, the Commission pegged future costs for the administration at an extremely low level, far too low, and that we are now having to live with the consequences of this mistake.
Ultimately, it is down to us, as Parliament, to allocate the scarce resources as fairly as possible.
I think this situation is open to severe criticism.
Our colleagues have presented their cases for their areas - the small institutions - and I hope that in future budget procedures, despite the error that arose at the advent of this financial perspective, we will be able to find a solution in our area as well.
