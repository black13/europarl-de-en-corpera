Mr President, Commissioner, the different effects of our budget decisions on women and men have scarcely featured in our debate today.
For years, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has put forward proposals during the budget procedure to take account of the different impacts of our decisions on women and men.
We have been successful in the field of employment policy and the Structural Funds, where gender mainstreaming is now enshrined as a principle.
In foreign policy, too, gender sensitivity is increasing.
In the context of aid to Afghanistan, targeted measures have thus been introduced to reintegrate women into public life and restore their human rights.
We have achieved successes in combating trafficking in human beings, which is a modern form of slavery.
Violence against women has also become an issue in the budget.
Nonetheless, the STOP and DAPHNE programmes must not be used simply to carry out representative events.
Ultimately, just 13% of the projects can be funded, which is why the NGOs must be given direct assistance.
Gender budgeting must become even more of a theme than is currently the case.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities is working on an own-initiative report on this issue.
A word of criticism on the practice governing the allocation of funds as well: all too often - for example, in town twinning or the NGOs - it generates a great deal of resentment.
There is much frustration among active Europeans.
If on the one hand, we ensure that we do not spend any more on tobacco cultivation and we dismantle bureaucratic hurdles in this area, we cannot then put up similar hurdles in the way of the NGOs.
I ask for your support.
