Mr President, thank you for amending the list of speakers so that I could rise as well.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is very concerned about the fact that at the European Court of Justice, there continues to be a massive backlog of translation work.
What does this mean in practice?
Let's assume that in a specific case, proceedings have ended and a judgment has been handed down.
As the Court of Justice - unlike other Community institutions - does not publish its decisions until they are available in all the Community languages, the backlog of translations means that the finished judgments stay in a drawer at the ECJ for between one and two years until they can be published.
This is an untenable situation, in my view.
It is also increasingly viewed as a problem by the national courts in the Member States, since in the case of preliminary rulings, the proceedings in the European Court of Justice are merely interim proceedings in the successive stages of appeal through the national courts.
This means that these two years do not complete the proceedings; these two years are in addition to the duration of proceedings in the Member State.
We therefore call for adequate resources to be made available in order to bring this untenable situation to an end.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is also responsible for issues relating to the internal market and enlargement.
We have always focussed particularly on the specific challenges facing the internal market as a result of enlargement, especially for border regions.
We therefore fully endorse the amendments which aim to ensure that in line with last year's pledge, the funding for the pilot programme for SMEs is pegged at EUR 15 million.
