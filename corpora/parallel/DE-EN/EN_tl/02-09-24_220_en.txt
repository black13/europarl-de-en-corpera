Mr President, A-3021 - what is that all about?
In Volume IV, Section III - I have great understanding for Commissioners who have to deal in billions - we find budget heading A-3021: grants for European study groups and organisations advancing the idea of Europe.
What a daft idea!
Why?
Because, I believe, it is symptomatic of the processes which result in many European citizens assuming that you have to have a friend who has a friend in order to get money out of Brussels.
One of the previous speakers said that people think that the streets of Brussels are paved with cash.
People who genuinely try it know that this is not the case, but that, if you do know the friend of a friend, you are getting close.
Budget heading A-3021 bears ample witness to this.
It lists some organisations but not others.
An amendment by us, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which was intended to guarantee transparency by ensuring that the Commission applies the guidelines on assistance and subsidies and safeguards equal treatment of applicants and organisations, has been rejected.
That is a tragedy.
I wish this situation could be changed, for there can be no democracy without transparency.
