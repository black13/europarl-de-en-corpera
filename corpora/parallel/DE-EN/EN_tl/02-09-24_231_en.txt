Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, let me make it clear from the outset that on the whole we support the proposals on the mid-term review; even though they will not affect the 2003 budget, they appear to be the right steps in the right direction.
Of course there are still a number of points that would merit further discussion.
This is after all unquestionably a proposal for debate.
What will be decisive for us, however, will also be the extent to which we will be able to transfer funds that have not been used in the first pillar to the second pillar in forthcoming budgets, and that also includes the 2003 budget, because the development of rural areas is something that we are of course all concerned about and it will certainly be an absolutely decisive factor in the future.
The question is whether there is already any prospect now of going beyond the Interinstitutional Agreement and implementing this.
A further question is of course: how much progress has been made with implementing the SAPARD programme, Commissioner?
What is the position with this LEADER-EAST programme, formerly known as INPART?
I should also like to mention this once more.
It is also interesting for farmers to know - and you have only given vague hints about this in the mid-term review - what the future holds for the tobacco, sugar and milk sectors.
What is going to happen about quotas in the milk sector?
This too is a very important question.
As far as cofinancing is concerned, I should like to ask you to comment on this once more: this is an area where we certainly need greater flexibility.
