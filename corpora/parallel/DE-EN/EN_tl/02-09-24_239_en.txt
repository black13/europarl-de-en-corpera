Mr President, Commissioners, have no fear, I am neither a fisherwoman nor a farmer.
Neither do I wish to comment on the reform of agricultural policy.
My contribution will be confined to reiterating yet again my request for cofinancing.
I have been asking for this for three years now.
That should be enough!
I am here as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and as a shadow rapporteur.
The person I am shadowing, Robert Goodwill - who is the rapporteur for the budget - has already left.
All of the areas of agricultural policy on which I have questions or which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tackled have already been addressed by him or other colleagues.
The first is tobacco subsidies.
This issue has been raised time and again since 1994.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is calling for tobacco subsidies to be abolished.
Obviously the Committee on Budgets cannot accommodate this request because we have a market organisation and we have to work within the legislative framework.
Hence my very specific question to you, Mr Fischler: when is the Commission finally going to table a proposal explaining how it will contrive gradually to convert the areas under tobacco?
I know that there is any amount of discussion about this.
And I do not mean these half-baked ideas which are envisaged for the tobacco fund.
Neither is it acceptable for you to answer that it is all far too expensive because converting jobs - in whatever sector - costs anything from EUR 31 000 to EUR 391 000.
My next question concerns the Food Safety Authority.
When are you finally going to put pressure on the Council to let us have the Food Safety Authority?
(The President cut the speaker off)
