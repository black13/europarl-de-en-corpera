Mr President, I know that our concerns are close to the Commissioner's heart.
You, Commissioner, are a young and beautiful woman, and, whilst you have no need of cosmetics, I need them urgently.
I will be seventy next year, and, whilst I am very keen to get some anti-wrinkle cream, I do not want some animal to suffer as a result.
Do you really believe any woman would use any cosmetic product if she had to see an animal suffer for it?
We want to look good without others having to suffer to make it possible.
I really want to make an appeal to the cosmetics industry.
Look how the introduction of the catalytic converter led to prophecies of ruination and claims that the end of the motor industry was nigh -- and yet, it experienced a boom.
Why does the cosmetics industry not announce that it will invest money - a great deal of money - in research, in order to have the means to make women beautiful, but not at the cost of the suffering of others?
I believe the cosmetics industry would enjoy a massive upturn, and European women like us would be even more beautiful than all the other women on earth.
