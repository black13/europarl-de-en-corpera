Mr President, I do not want to discuss what has been said.
I am just very glad that I came into the Chamber early in order to do some work in peace and quiet, and then witnessed an interesting debate.
I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on permitting it and making it possible, and on giving your colleagues in the Bureau a good example to follow in the future.
What a pity so few Members were here, but perhaps more will turn up in the Chamber when word gets around.
