Mr President, I am sorry that Members are getting a bit nervous, but I consider it important, in view of our strange new Rules of Procedure, that I should say what this is all about.
It is certainly not technical!
Economic and monetary union has been a reality in the eurozone since 1999, and what the Commission is now putting before us is an attempt at getting better statistics, to prevent the European Central Bank from making the wrong decisions on the basis of inadequate and bad ones.
The draft regulation before us aims to improve the quality of these statistics, firstly by cutting the time period for the transmission of the main aggregates of the quarterly national accounts from four months to seventy days; secondly, by suspending various derogations granted to the Member States; and thirdly by having the employment data transmitted in one unit, namely the hours worked.
These changes are necessary if we are to have the most exact statistics on GDP at our disposal without delay.
The banks' economists have been warning for years that inadequate economic statistics could result in mistakes being made in monetary policy.
Mr Eugenio Domingo Solans, a member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, told a German newspaper that there had to be statistics relevant to the Euro area.
It is in the interests of decision-makers in European business, of the financial markets, and, finally, of the citizens of the Economic and Monetary Union.
There is still much to do, though.
Nowadays, for example, the Commission is compelled to use incomplete data when drawing up the initial estimates of GDP for the eurozone and the EU, which could well undermine the reliability of these indicators and have a detrimental effect on the financial markets and, especially, on the central banks, and Mr ?
