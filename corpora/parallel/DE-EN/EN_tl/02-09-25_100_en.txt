Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for having responded to comments that the rapporteur has not even made yet.
As you are in charge of the sitting, I would like to remind you of the following, which is to be found in Rule 120(5) of our Rules of Procedure: 'In a debate on a report, the Commission and the Council shall, as a rule, be given the floor immediately after the rapporteur's explanation.'
It must surely be clear to you that, whilst the Council is allowed an explanation, it is the report that is on the agenda.
I do not believe that this is a right or careful way to handle the work of committees in the plenary.
Thank you very much!
