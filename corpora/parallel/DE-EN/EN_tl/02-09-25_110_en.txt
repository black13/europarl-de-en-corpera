Mr President, looking at the dramatic way the current geopolitical situation has become more acute since 11 September last, there is much to be said for Europe having a Common Foreign and Security Policy.
It will not, however, be an easy matter.
When the USA - at a time when Bill Clinton was still President - and England bombed Baghdad shortly before Christmas 1999 without a UN mandate, I wrote a comment piece in an Austrian newspaper, Der Standard, the key point in which was that this bombardment, denounced by France, Italy, and Russia, and which drew a sharp protest note from the Vatican, had resulted in a fine crack running across Europe.
Today, I leave it to you to judge whether this chasm has widened or become narrower in the meantime.
I would also ask you to consider whether substantial European interests would be affected by an attack on Iraq or even on Iran, which is sought by certain hawks in the US administration who aim to topple the regimes in Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt as well.
It is in any case to be welcomed that the EU's Foreign Ministers, at the informal Council meeting in Elsinore expressed their opposition to military intervention in Iraq.
This awakens hope that the current geopolitical tendency, led by the USA, of resorting to force rather than having recourse to international law, will not be endorsed in Europe.
