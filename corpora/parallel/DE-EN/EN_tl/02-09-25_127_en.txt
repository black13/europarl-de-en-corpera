Mr President, I would like to devote my intervention to Mr Titley's very fine report.
Stopping the supply of weapons and the granting of licences is well known to be among the most effective methods of preventing conflict, and this is, incidentally, true also of the Middle East.
Many things are actually less surprising when one looks at the figures that show how much was supplied to the Middle East last year.
Although the bringing of conflict prevention to the fore is part of the European Union's purpose - for it is cheaper than ending military conflicts later on - people are still cheerfully exporting to conflict regions.
The Belgians are supplying firearms to Nepal, where civil war is raging, Great Britain's supply of radar screens for fighter aircraft contravenes Criterion 3 of the Code, while Sweden, France, and Great Britain are contravening its Operative Provision 4 by supplying heavy munitions to India without facing the consequences.
It is precisely in this area that the Code is weak, as it is not binding and makes no provision for sanctions against those who supply weapons to conflict regions all the same.
It must not surprise us if taxpayers complain that this European Union of ours gives out, on the one hand, development aid to these countries, which, on the other, are then destroyed by their own munitions.
It is for this reason that the Code of Conduct has to be applied in such a way as to really stop the supply of weapons to crisis regions.
That must be our objective!
