Mr President, your statement was not as clear as Commissioner Patten's.
I am actually seriously concerned that, in spite of their professed commitment to the International Criminal Court, the EU's Foreign Ministers will after all get cold feet on 30 September and issue provisos that undermine the credibility of the Rome Statute.
If the universality of the International Criminal Court is compromised the Rome Statute is weakened.
We cannot have two classes of law within international law.
Article 98 is no basis for bilateral agreements because it was only envisaged for agreements between States Parties to the Treaty.
It was an article that the United States itself proposed.
It does not apply between States that do not even want to recognise the International Criminal Court.
I very much hope, however, that on 30 November the EU will say 'no' and that it will not allow itself to be beaten into submission.
