Madam President, if I am not mistaken, Parliament and the Commission agree on the essential points: trade barriers need to be dismantled, integration needs to be fostered, Europe needs to speak with one voice in the IMF, and so on.
I do not wish to repeat it all.
I should just like to make two short comments and refer to Mr Patten's final remarks.
Firstly, I have been working on Latin America for many years and - to my horror, I have to say - I have observed that Latin America's importance on the world stage is diminishing further every year, while Asia's is growing.
There must be reasons for this, reasons that are far more complex than just a measure or two.
We should discuss this openly.
The second comment that I wanted to make concerns a survey that was carried out recently in Latin America.
Part of the population - around 20 000 people - were asked whether they believed that authoritarian governments were better able to solve the problems than democracies.
In 1996 in a similar survey only a minority put an authoritarian regime first; the majority was in favour of democracy.
Today over 50% of the population are saying: yes, we need authoritarian governments to solve our problems.
This means that the crisis that we are facing today in Latin America, and in particular in Mercosur, also presents a risk to democracy.
This reminds me of the eighties and early nineties when our debates on Latin America mainly concerned democracy.
At that time we understood that we needed to pursue a social and economic policy that restored people's faith in democracy.
That is why I do not think that it is pointless for us to concern ourselves with Latin America; if we do not then we will only end up drafting more motions on dictatorships.
