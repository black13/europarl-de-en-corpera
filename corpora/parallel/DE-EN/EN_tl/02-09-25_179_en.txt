Madam President, I am in favour of the solidarity fund.
To my knowledge there is no ban on criticising the International Monetary Fund or similar institutions and I do not regard them as sacrosanct.
I was also pleased to hear Commissioner Patten say that certain import quotas in the agricultural sector have been or are being increased.
I think, however, that even if we doubled or tripled all of these measures, we would not get to the root of the problem.
Mercosur has everything it needs.
It has oil, gas, all the important raw materials, and enough agricultural products to feed not only the whole of Latin America but Europe as well.
It has a competent workforce and it has a diverse industry.
I should like to take up something that Mr Linkohr said: the causes of this crisis run deeper, and not only economic reforms but also political reforms are necessary.
It is precisely the most important Mercosur States that have far-reaching political problems.
They have inefficient and, in some cases, corrupt political systems.
Anyone who has been to a rich, thriving country like Argentina and seen the desperate demonstrations by people from the entire political spectrum outside the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, calling for the resignation of all politicians in all parties, because they will not accept anyone anymore, can see quite clearly that this crisis is not a passing phase; it is democracy and the political system that is undergoing a fundamental crisis.
That is why we obviously want to take individual steps, but without a thorough reform of the political system in Argentina, but also to some extent in Brazil, this continent will not shake off the crisis.
So far, it must be seen in a positive light that, as a market, Mercosur has had the effect of preventing the worst - they have limped along by supporting each other - but in the long term the political system really needs to make a full recovery.
