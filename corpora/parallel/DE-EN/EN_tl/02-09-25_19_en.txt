Mr President, the world at large is slowly getting tired of hearing reports on environmental summits with feeble outcomes.
Rio still managed to be the bearer of great hopes, at least as regards theoretical approaches and fine words.
The deeds that ensued were so disappointing that the environmental movement around the world has been virtually struck dumb.
Kyoto was at least able to formulate an objective.
The length of the periods of time leading up to implementation is such as to induce paralysis.
Johannesburg was another disappointment in terms of what had been expected of it.
Every failed summit does more harm than good, as it brings on a mood of resignation.
Despite all this, I would like to mention the positive things about Johannesburg.
For the first time, the European Union set out a practicable way ahead and a definite strategy in the form of the development of renewable energy sources.
It is of course a matter for regret that the global one per cent increase was not adopted, but the EU now has the chance to live out and demonstrate, within its own borders, the way in which conversion to renewable energy sources makes everyone a winner, in that, by doing so, we will not only be mitigating climatic disaster, but will also be creating five times as many jobs as we would with traditional use of energy, preserving resources around the world, using renewable energy sources to develop technologies that we can export.
Let us bear in mind that two billion people in the world have no electricity.
It is now for us to work hard at demonstrating by our actions that we are actually achieving the objectives set by the White Paper for renewable energy sources.
I would like to point out that we are rather behind in our aim to double their use by 2010.
