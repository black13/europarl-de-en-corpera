Mr President, I have just had this confirmed to me by various Fisheries Ministers meeting at Reykjavik in Iceland.
These Fisheries Ministers came from the USA, Chile, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, the Faeroes, Norway, and so on.
They say unanimously that Johannesburg is on the right track with this decision.
Rarely enough are there real political decisions.
Everyone prefers to rush to coat their personal or national egoisms with a veneer of sanctity, particularly when the eyes of world public opinion are upon them.
This time, though, there was a real decision on sustainability and on the fisheries sector, which has undergone such a severe battering.
This agreement on a point of principle was achieved very quickly.
It sends the message that there is nothing more to be discussed, and that now is the time to act.
That is Johannesburg's appeal to the world.
It is also addressed to us who have Europe for our home and sit in this Parliament.
The reform of European fisheries policy simply will not wait.
It is of great intrinsic value and must not be used to gain advantages in other policy fields by being a pawn in negotiating tactics and games that it is all too easy to see through.
That is what is also called meeting each other halfway at the expense of fisheries.
Johannesburg was unerring in recognising that.
Fish stocks are to recover by 2015.
Now we have to get a move on.
I hope this will be one of our successes - one of the successes of the European Union within the framework of a reform that is imminent and can be delayed no longer.
