I voted in favour of the report on the representation of women among the social partners of the European Union.
According to statistics produced by the European Trade Union Congress, the proportion of women in positions of leadership is under 25%, which is far too low.
I believe that it is particularly important to achieve balanced representation of women at leadership level in trade unions, which, in wage negotiations, play an important part in promoting equality of opportunity.
It has emerged from various studies that women are seriously under-represented in wage negotiations, the consequence of which is that women's issues are taken too little into account in the labour market.
Women know what the real working conditions of female employees are and where equality is lacking.
If more women were to be in charge of negotiations, I am quite sure that greater consideration would be given to women's interests in the labour market.
I therefore call on the social partners to devise support programmes for women in order that their presence in decision-making circles may be enhanced.
The interests of female employees must not be ignored.
