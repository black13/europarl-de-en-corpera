Mr President, we are absolutely astounded that the Commission has tabled a proposal to water down the stability criteria without first agreeing the matter with the European Parliament in the relevant committees.
I would ask that we debate this Commission proposal as quickly and efficiently as possible here in Parliament, because the current position does not, I think, have the support of this House.
