Mr President, I must stand up for my honourable friend.
He could not have raised it this morning, because the Minutes are not approved until the afternoon.
But I wanted to say something quite different.
As you can see from yesterday's Minutes, there was no Question Time and yet the sitting ended at 10.20 p.m., i.e. considerably earlier than planned.
So there would have been time enough for Question Time.
I know you will probably say that the decision would have been taken by the Conference of Presidents, but the Bureau - and I should like to ask you to convey as much to the Bureau - is responsible for keeping to the Rules of Procedure.
And it states quite clearly in the Rules of Procedure that there must be one Question Time during each of the twelve plenary sessions in Strasbourg - at least that is how I understand it.
That is a parliamentary right and it is non-negotiable.
Hence, cancelling Question Time to the Council and Commission this week was, in my eyes, both an infringement of our fundamental parliamentary rights and an infringement of the Rules of Procedure, despite the fact that there was time enough.
This afternoon we have just one more debate.
So we could easily have held a topical and urgent debate this afternoon, but that too has been cancelled.
There has been a coup in the CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
We are due to debate it on 9 October, when it will already be history.
I urge you to organise Parliament's work differently from the way in which it has been organised this afternoon and this week.
