Mr President, I know this does nothing to change the outcome but a great many Members entered the Chamber after the vote.
May I suggest that we also return to fixed, reliable voting times on Thursday afternoons, especially as there are several places where the bell cannot be heard.
I therefore urgently request that the timetable be rescheduled so that the honourable Members know when there is a vote and where there is not.
