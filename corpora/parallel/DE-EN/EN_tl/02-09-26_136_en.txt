Mr President, I should like to go one step further than Mr Posselt.
I should like to protest against the fact that the vote is being held now.
According to the agenda, we should be voting at 4.30 p.m. and I can assure you that you cannot hear the bell upstairs in the offices.
I do not know where your office is and whether or not you can hear the bell from there.
We have arranged to vote at 4.30 p.m. and it is wrong to hold the vote now because not everyone in the building has arrived in the Chamber yet.
