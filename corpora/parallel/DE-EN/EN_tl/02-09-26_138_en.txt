Mr President, you have in principle anticipated my point.
Nonetheless, Mr Posselt is right.
We need to discuss Thursday afternoon's agenda.
I have no wish to gainsay my honourable friend Mr Whitehead, who said at the start of the debate that he had to give his speech and then leave to catch a flight, but to me it is absolutely unbelievable that a Parliament should arrange its schedule to accommodate Members' flight connections.
We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists shall therefore be discussing this with our Rules of Procedure experts.
Other groups should do likewise, so that we can return to the old schedule for Thursday afternoons.
Otherwise we might as well spare ourselves the effort.
(Applause)
