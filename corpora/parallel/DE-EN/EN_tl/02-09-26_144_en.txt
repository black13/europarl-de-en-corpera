Mr President, this is a very na√Øve discussion by those who are always opposed to Strasbourg.
And just what has been decided?
More mini plenary sittings have been convened for the next session in Brussels.
In other words, there are a few people who never miss a chance to turn everything against Strasbourg.
There is something, however, which I consider to be far more serious: we were told we could not hold a topical and urgent debate this Thursday because we held one during the first session in September.
Do you seriously believe that questions of world history, urgent questions should depend on whether or not we have the honour of expressing ourselves on current affairs?
I would have thought it more important to use the time available this afternoon to deal with other urgent topics, which normally go by the board because we never have time for them.
We would have had time today for anyone with any inclination to notice what we should have.
Members of Parliament should be able to speak on important matters when the occasion arises.
Today would have been a perfect opportunity.
I therefore urge that urgent matters be allocated the time needed to ensure that human rights issues are not sacrificed just because a few people are in a hurry to get back to their constituencies.
They can spend hours in their constituencies.
But those who wish to speak because they think it is the right thing to do must have the chance to do so, especially on Thursdays.
Thursdays do not end with a few 4 o'clock flights; they should end at 6.30.
