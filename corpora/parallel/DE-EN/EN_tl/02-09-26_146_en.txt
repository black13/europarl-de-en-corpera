Mr President, I should like to pick up on what Mr Harbour said.
First, my dear Mr Harbour, you are one of those who sets great store by the Treaty and if you read the Treaty, you will see that we have 12 regular plenary sessions a year and that, if necessary, we can hold additional plenary sessions in Brussels.
If we were to take out these six days in the autumn, we would have time for committees, time for week-long surgeries and all the rest, instead of which we could use the time here really profitably.
Secondly, this afternoon's agenda should have included a topical and urgent debate, for example on the coup in CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
Today we were told this would be discussed on 9 October.
In other words, the Conference of Presidents decided that this urgent matter should be debated on 9 October, i.e. in a fortnight's time, instead of this afternoon, when it could have been slotted in without further ado.
Thirdly, there was no Question Time this week, either to the Council or to the Commission.
That, as I said earlier, is a fundamental parliamentary right and the fact that there was no Question Time was a violation of the Rules of Procedure.
My dear Mr Harbour, I am very proud of Question Time; it is an achievement which mirrors a long parliamentary tradition in Great Britain.
