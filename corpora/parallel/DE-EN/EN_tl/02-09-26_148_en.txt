Mr President, to return to our same topic of conversation, listening to Mr Harbour, Mr Mann, Mr Posselt and Mrs GrossetÃªte, I now know why group chairman Poettering always looks so pale.
Discussions within the European People's Party are so lively that it is a pleasure to listen to them.
Perhaps you will invite us into your group one day so that we can share in your joy.
(Applause)
But there is one thing we should learn from the debate, and I address this comment quite pointedly to the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The Corbett reform has been a help, we can see that every lunchtime when it comes to the vote.
We have saved time.
But to save time and then not use it for parliamentary business is wrong.
(Applause)
I therefore think - and we shall be doing as much in the Group of the Party of European Socialists - that both you, Mr Vice-President, in the Bureau, and the groups at the Conference of Presidents should retable the question of the agenda, because if today is anything to go by, we cannot go on like this.
(Applause)
