Madam President, great praise has been showered on Mr SÃ¶derman and also on the two rapporteurs, Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis.
It is as a matter of principle that I wish to reiterate this, having read this great tome that comes out every year and found that he has achieved an enormous amount.
It is lamentable that the Committee on Petitions is prevented from playing the part to which it might do justice by the excessive inadequacy of the resources with which it is equipped.
The Committee on Petitions must be a real point of contact for citizens, but the Council should also take even more account of it.
The Nice Treaty states that the European Union must be brought closer to its citizens.
This might present an opportunity to do this at this level, and it is enormously important that the Ombudsman has offered to develop joint activities with local and regional ombudsmen and with committees on petitions.
The European Union will always find it difficult to be recognised in the Member States as the servant of the people that it is meant to be.
In particular, more attention needs to be paid to Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This is where it is enormously important that the Charter should become legally binding and be incorporated into the Treaties.
If we do not manage to force this through, we will find the European Union's credibility hard to defend.
