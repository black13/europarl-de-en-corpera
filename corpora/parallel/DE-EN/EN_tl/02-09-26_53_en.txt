Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment to paragraph 5, the last sentence of which reads: "considers in consequence that signing such an agreement is incompatible with membership of the European Union".
I would very much like the word "signing" to be replaced by the word "ratification".
That makes it much clearer and also means that the States that have signed still have a chance to refrain from ratification.
That is why I would prefer the word "ratification" instead of "signing".
