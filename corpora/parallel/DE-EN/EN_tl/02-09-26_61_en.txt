Mr President, as we, in this Parliament, tend less towards the intergovernmental side, I would replace the word "Council" here by "Commission".
I would, by the way, like to congratulate Mr van Orden, by dint of whose initiative Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union is to be incorporated into the constitution in its entirety, without any derogation!
