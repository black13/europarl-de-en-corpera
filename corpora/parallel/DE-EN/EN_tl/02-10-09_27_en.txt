Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement will change Europe on a lasting basis.
That is why the quality of the preparations is so crucial.
The Commission has today given the green light for the accession of ten countries, but it acknowledges at the same time that not all the criteria have been fulfilled as yet.
In light of this aspect, the Paris newspaper Le Figaro reports its 'creeping and unpleasant sensation of jumping into a void without a parachute'.
I would not go quite that far, but numerous sensitive issues remain unresolved: financing, Cyprus, and the Bene? decrees are just some of the key words here.
I am extremely disappointed by the Czech Government's stance of declining even to talk about the issues.
Europe means talking to each other!
I am disappointed by the Commission's stance.
What kind of community of values will the EU become in future if it meekly accepts a law which assures impunity for murder?
I have spoken of rifts.
They are offset not only by the advantages but also the opportunity to enlarge the zone of security and stability and overcome the division of Europe.
Enlargement is the political expression of reconciliation in Europe.
That is our great opportunity.
