Mr President, twelve years have passed since Rio, where it was recognised that greenhouse gases have to be reduced around the world, which shows how interminably slowly global processes of change in relation to the environment take place.
It is costs that are the main point under discussion.
It must, though, become widely accepted that every measure taken today is the cause of only a fraction of the cost of future consequential damage, which has to be paid for later.
That is what we have experienced in recent days in Central Europe, with the greatest flood disaster known to history.
The water has now gone, but the causes remain, and so we have to take action against them, primarily locally but also globally.
It is generally recognised that the most important step is the radical reduction in all greenhouse gases.
Mr Moreira Da Silva's Report points in the right direction, and does so excellently.
We need a long-term perspective that also involves our belief that real improvement can be achieved.
We have been relieved to learn in recent weeks that, for example, the ban on hydrofluorocarbons has resulted, after only a few years, in the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic being reduced in size for the first time.
Emissions trading in itself does not yet reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but simply divides them up in a different way.
An effective campaign must start at our own front door.
To do this, we must first of all develop renewable sources of energy and press on towards the energy efficiency goals that we have set ourselves.
The long-term view can only be that the polluter-pays principle should be applied and that the revenues thus accrued should be earmarked for specific purposes and used to improve the situation.
