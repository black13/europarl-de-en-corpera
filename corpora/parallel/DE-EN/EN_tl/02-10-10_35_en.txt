Mr President, if I had more than two minutes at my disposal, I would, in the most amicable way possible, demolish Mr Langen's arguments.
I do believe that the Commission has produced a thoroughly good draft, which I am sure we have improved, because Parliament always does everything better.
I want to make the following points.
Firstly, we already have a trade in emissions; across the world, some 70 million tonnes of CO2 have been traded since 1996, at - let us assume - a price of USD 3 per tonne, amounting to USD 210 million worth of business, and the trade is increasing at an exponential rate.
There has to be some order in this trade, and, in Europe, this directive helps us to do that.
That is why it makes sense.
I am very much in favour of past experience in the Member States being taken into account, which means that we need a transitional period, but one that must come to an end.
As far as I am concerned, 2008 is that end, when the same rule must apply across Europe.
I also want to point out that European competition law still applies to trading in emissions, and - Kyoto notwithstanding - the Commission can always intervene in the market if it believes that competition is being distorted.
This trade in emissions is in fact ushering in a new era in our economy, as waste gases - CO2 in this instance - are having a price put on them.
Where that price is estimated - the Commission is assuming EUR 20 per tonne - one can very readily imagine what significance this will have for the economy, for the energy sector, and for ecology.
We really are coming up to a paradigm shift, and, that being so, I am sure that this will not be the last debate on this subject.
I hope that Parliament's resolution will after all be the basis of a rapprochement between us, enabling us to come up with a solution that makes sense.
