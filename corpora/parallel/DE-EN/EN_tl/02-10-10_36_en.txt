Mr President, I would like to start with very warm thanks to Mr Moreira Da Silva, who was a superb rapporteur, and he has produced a fine report.
ET, Emission tradit is a strange unknown being from a strange unknown star.
We do not yet know whether to fear it or love it.
I have, though, attempted to give this being a rather more human face and have brought in a series of amendments, some of which have also been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Amendment No 2: if the authorities already have to update this by making various changes to the installations, then please let this happen with the operators' agreement.
The Commission states in its draft that it will stipulate a harmonised method of allocation for the period beginning on 1 January 2008.
I would rather that they did not.
I believe that Parliament has the right to be involved in this by way of the codecision procedure.
My concern in Amendment No 30 is that the allocation of allowances to new installations should, in principle, be harmonised across the EU.
My Amendment No 37 is particularly important.
This has to do with need for the Member States to ensure that the operators of installations can, within the relevant periods, bring forward allowances or put them aside for a subsequent year.
This strikes me as very, very important, and makes things a bit more workable.
It is my belief that none of us needs to fear this draft.
After all, we are dealing only with the period from 2005 to the end of 2010, which the Commission has already designated as a sort of test run.
Fear not, my good brave Mr Langen; we can keep on changing all this.
I am sure that it will be only after today's vote that we will really get started on a major discussion process.
