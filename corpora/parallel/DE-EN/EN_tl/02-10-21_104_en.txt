Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one thing I believe to be true is that, with a report or a draft of this sort there are points that have to be discussed, one of which, for example, is the differentiation between the rules for refugees and the rules on subsidiary protection.
We all, probably, have different opinions on it.
In my own country, Germany, there could also be difficulties as regards the way we handle the reunification of families, if the whole thing is framed in such generous terms that we, in Germany, perhaps have to tackle it in a different way.
On the other hand, though, it is of course a good thing that we at last have a directive, or are at least making the attempt to lay down minimum standards, which, once in place, will enable us to achieve our objective of preventing secondary movement.
I can understand my fellow-Members from other groups not being in agreement with all points, but I would also remind you that we are delegates.
I am not a minister of a nation state, and am therefore not obliged to take a stringent line and consider how to persuade and convince my Danish or Dutch counterparts.
I am a member of a Parliament in which I enjoy the freedom to act according to my conscience, a Parliament in which I can contemplate visions and draft proposals about them.
I can frame my ideas in such broad terms that, in the final analysis, they do not absolutely have to be passed by a Council in the form of a directive, but can be a parliamentary position paper and an eventual contribution to discussion.
It is in this sense that I hope that we will pass this draft tomorrow.
