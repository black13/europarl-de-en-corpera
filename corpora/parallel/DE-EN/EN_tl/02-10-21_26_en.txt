Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating you, Mr President, on what has happened in Ireland.
You have had an incredible fight, with the support of many Members of this House, to all of whom I would like to express my gratitude.

That is a success also for you, Mr President, and I would like to offer you my warm congratulations.
It is a success for us all!
Life brings situations about which it is no pleasure to have to speak.
Today is one of them.
Whilst wishing to place on record my personal regard and fondness for Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, as a person, I have to add that we are dealing here, not with relationships between people, but with the acceptance of responsibility.
That is why an overwhelming majority in my group is of the definite opinion that something has happened that must not be allowed to repeat itself in the same way.
(Applause)
