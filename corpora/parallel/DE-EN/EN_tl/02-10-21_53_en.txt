Mr President, the Stability and Growth Pact was introduced to safeguard the euro as a strong currency, but, in view of Europe's generally poor economic position and high rate of unemployment, it should be permissible to rethink or refine the stability criteria for the precise reason that this will keep the euro strong.
A currency is as strong as its economy.
If the economy is limping along, the currency will be weakened in the long term.
The high level of tax in Europe weakens the economy and is not leaving private citizens enough room to manoeuvre or enough disposable income to boost consumer spending.
Also, too much money is being poured into the grossly distended bureaucracy of the civil service.
This must be changed.
The euro needs not only a pact for stability, but also, primarily, for growth.
Discussion of this issue is therefore both necessary and sensible, in order that the euro may in the long term become a strong rather than a weak currency.
