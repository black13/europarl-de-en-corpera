Mr President, the Charter is a milestone on the road that leads to real EU citizenship, and it also sets down in writing that it is people, rather than the market or power, who should be at the heart of European politics, and so I join with all those who have said that these rights must not exist only on paper.
They must also become binding.
Congratulations to the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their intention that the Charter should form part of the constitutional treaty.
I agree that it should not be mentioned only in the Preamble, but that the Charter should form the first chapter of the constitution.
We are always saying that this constitution should be able to be read in schools.
This Charter is wonderfully readable; it would make a fine preface for a European constitution, and its reflection of Europe's values leads me to believe that it should actually be printed in its entirety.
My second train of thought leads me to the view that the Charter should be incorporated without any changes being made to it.
It was the subject of really lengthy discussion in the first Convention, and I cannot see any reason to amend it again.
At most, there might be a need for editorial adjustments to the transversal articles, but not substantial alterations.
They contain everything on the Charter's scope, and do not need to be duplicated and made more complicated.
Our rapporteur is to be thanked for his excellent report, which will without doubt become an important document for the Convention.
