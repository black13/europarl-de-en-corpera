Mr President, much has already been said by previous speakers.
We distribute some of our funds indiscriminately, we set too few priorities, and we also finance ineffective actions, if you consider that we still allow ourselves the luxury of two parliamentary places of work and are therefore also paying for very questionable tourism for Members as well as a Convention that is costing millions.
Europe needs new impetus.
We need an offensive on the economy, including measures to make cheap capital - I mean venture capital - available above all to small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is precisely here that effective initiatives are lacking in the 2003 Budget.
There is an urgent need for action when it comes to introducing the Basle II provisions, above all when we consider that 45% of European small and medium-sized enterprises have little or no own resources.
As well as changing the way in which aid is allocated in agriculture, in the future we will also have to change the distribution criteria in the Structural Funds.
The standard of living in a region should not be used to assess the situation or be a factor in the amount of aid allocated.
Companies or sectors that need support should all receive these funds, regardless of whether the company is located in the north, south or east.
We must use the funds entrusted to us more efficiently and more carefully, if we also wish to co-finance enlargement.
