Madam President, the vast majority of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I am rapporteur, have been taken into account in the 2003 budgetary procedure.
Regrettably, three of the committee's amendments that I consider to be important were rejected or altered.
They are being put to the vote again in the plenary.
They concern firstly cooperation with third countries on migration.
Here we want the commitments to be increased by a further EUR 5 million.
I am convinced that the only way to improve the situation is to step up cooperation and that means more funds from the European Union.
Secondly, they concern the European Refugee Fund.
I do not think that I need to dwell on this as the issues are actually already well known.
The third point is the Celex budget.
Although the situation has changed immeasurably since the attacks on the USA, we have done a great deal without demanding a dramatic increase in expenditure.
I therefore think that all of our demands - these three points - are justified and would ask you to bear this in mind when you vote.
