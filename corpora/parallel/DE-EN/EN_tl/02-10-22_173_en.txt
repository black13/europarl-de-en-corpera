Mr President, when the Commission placed an order with the software company SAP at no time did it think in terms of an order of magnitude of 4 000 users.
In the public call for tender of 1994, a figure of 1 053 potential users was given as an indication.
On the second point: following the public call for tender, which was published in the Official Journal, the Commission - and specifically the SINCOM Council - decided to conclude a framework contract with SAP to buy SAP R/3 software licences worth EUR 1.5 million; that was the value of the order including the associated service agreements.
This amount covers the use of the financial accounting module by 600 civil servants, the vast majority working in the budget and Financial Control Directorates-General, as well as a few users in the internal and external audit services, for example the Court of Auditors, and in the operational Directorates-General.
On your third question: the actual number of users of the SAP financial accounting software currently stands at 300.
