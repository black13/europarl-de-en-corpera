Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for answering the question.
I would be interested to know how the system has actually been prepared for the enlargement of the European Union.
This will of course present particular challenges in terms of bookkeeping.
We are also aware of the accusations that have appeared in the media.
What precautions will you take in the future to ensure that the existing system will guarantee, even after enlargement, that financial management is tailored to future requirements and that the European taxpayer is protected?
