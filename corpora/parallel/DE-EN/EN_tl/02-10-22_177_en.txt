Mr RÃ¼big, the accounting system that we have does not only consist of the SAP R/3 software that has just been mentioned; the SINCOM 2 system is also available for services that manage funds.
All of the Commission's services and all offices that manage funds are linked up to this.
As far as enlargement is concerned, the number of services linked up will not actually be increased immediately now.
Pre-accession aid is also managed using this system.
Preparations for enlargement obviously require the candidate countries and new Member States to take certain measures.
Accounts for the Commission will of course have to be opened in the central banks or national treasuries.
Very intensive preparatory discussions are underway between the Budget Directorate-General and the individual accession countries about the whole business of collecting own resources and using the national treasuries.
