Mr President, I should like firstly to thank you very much for the information and to present Mr WÃ¼rmeling's apologies, as he had to leave for Berlin at very short notice to attend an important meeting.
I should then like to add two short questions, which the Commissioner may be able to answer briefly together.
Might it not be the case that the Commission's negotiating position would possibly be improved if it reserved the right in the negotiations to amend the directive in respect of the export ban if necessary, because it could then exert pressure on the other countries to go along with such a recommendation?
Secondly, if the negotiations fail do you expect production to shift significantly from the European Union to third countries?
Does the Commission know, or does it have any estimates of, how many jobs might be lost in the European Union as a result?
