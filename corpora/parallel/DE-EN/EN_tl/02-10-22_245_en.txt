Mr President, these security rules were submitted and discussed in the Committee competent to deal with them.
This agreement can also be adopted or rejected regardless of them, but it cannot yet enter into force, as the security rules have not yet been adopted.
The Interinstitutional Agreement can therefore be adopted tomorrow in any case.
Please permit me to address a brief comment to the Members.
We are dealing here solely with foreign, security and defence policy, none of which form part of the legislation.
That, Mr Bonde, is why this committee does not deal with any papers that have to do with legislation, in which area Mr Turco is talking about justice and internal affairs.
I have said quite clearly that the Agreement recommends that a separate agreement be negotiated for this area, and I believe that this should go much further in taking Parliament's rights into account.
Mrs Hautala is right to say that, if this does not succeed, one of the options provided is that of an appeal.
I would, by the way, like to tell Mrs Hautala and others that it is only when we know the documents that we can say whether their classifications are justified.
If we see that access is not being given to papers that Parliament as a whole is actually meant to be able to see, we can say that they have been wrongly classified, and in this way bring about a change in practice at Council level.
If, though, we know nothing about the documents, we can have no criticism to make on this score.
Apart from that, we have to say that getting access to such documents represents a new start for the Council and the Commission as well.
Without such a settlement, we will have difficulty in carrying on any sort of European foreign and security policy.
In this instance, therefore, all the institutions have a shared interest in finding a point from which they can all start.
