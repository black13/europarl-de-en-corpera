Mr President, the rapporteur on the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation has presented many good proposals, but I would like to say right at the outset that we should avoid giving the impression that the last Commission's downfall was due to a bad financial regulation and the rules for its implementation.
It is my belief, Commissioner, that such would be a false assessment and would lead us into renewed disaster.
It was far more a matter of culture.
If, on the one hand, you are saying that the amendment of the Financial Regulation and the rules associated with it is one of the most ambitious tasks involved in the reform of the Commission, then I have to say that you cannot be aiming very high!
You tell us that the reason we cannot have external candidates for the post of accounting officer is that there is a Statute that says so.
I ask you!
If the Commission cannot even alter a Statute, how does it think it is going to govern the EU?
Surely one of the first things that the executive should be able to do is to change the rules governing its own staff!
That, Commissioner, is just not acceptable!
Perhaps you are putting the cart before the horse.
In my judgment, this is about changing the culture.
That was possible under the old rules, and will also be possible under the new ones.
When, for example, I study reports, as I have done in connection with the whole Eurostat business, in which you looked on and you continued to spend European taxpayers' money on employing firms that, to your own knowledge have demonstrably deceived and cheated you, I do not know, Commissioner, whether this renewed culture, under the banner of zero tolerance, the idea with which we started out in 1999, has actually gained a foothold yet!
