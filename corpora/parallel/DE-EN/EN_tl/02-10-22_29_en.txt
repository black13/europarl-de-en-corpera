Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know from our own experience that there is really no such thing as an internal market in pharmaceutical products in the European Union.
There are price differences of as much as 400% between Belgium and Germany, and you cannot simply explain that away by different VAT rates!
I am afraid that these reports concentrate too much on approval.
I hope, however, that the transparency that we have flagged up here and that we are calling for will in future make it easier for consumers to understand why there are such great price differences between individual Member States.
It is not acceptable for Europe's internal market so obviously not to include the pharmaceutical industry.
I hope that by achieving transparency the links between public research and industrial research will also become clearer, and that databases will also make it easier to see who has been involved in given clinical tests and to what extent public research receives external funding.
I too am pleased that we managed to leave advertising out of the equation, because that would have simply raised expectations on the part of patients that could not be met.
We are talking about better and more favourable prices, not about more advertising.
