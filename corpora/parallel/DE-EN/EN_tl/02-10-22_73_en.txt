At the Johannesburg Summit a 15% increase in the production of alternative energy sources by 2010 was proposed.
Increasing the productivity of renewables is the only long-term alternative to traditional energy sources.
Research and development need to be stepped up with a view to achieving this.
The positive effects flowing from this are self-evident.
Research creates jobs; increased use of biofuels provides an additional product alternative for the agricultural sector; and, last but not least, negative environmental impacts are reduced.
For all these reasons we have voted for the Fiori Report.
