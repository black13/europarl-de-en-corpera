Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as permanent rapporteur for agencies in the Committee on Budgets, I have been following these reports, which regulate the operation of the London-based medical products agency, that is the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.
I am very grateful to the rapporteur and to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for having taken our suggestions on board in their reports.
There is, however, one thing I would to make very clear to this House, and this also applies of course to the Commission and the Member States.
If we are to give an agency new remits, then we also need to consider where the money for carrying out those tasks is to come from.
We cannot just keep increasing the size of an agency.
We have a General Budget that only provides us with a certain amount, and Parliament cannot top it up - we can only restructure it.
So if we wish to allocate financial means to an agency in future, we have to take those means away from another agency.
I know that I am not making myself popular by making these statements, but I am not here to be popular.
We need to bear in mind in future that an agency can only carry out the tasks assigned to it with the money at its disposal, and that it cannot act as it likes beyond that.
That is not possible, because we do not have the money for that.
