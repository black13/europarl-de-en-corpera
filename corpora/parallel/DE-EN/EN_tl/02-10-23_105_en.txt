Mr President, I have had a dream in which Mr Fatuzzo's daughter phoned up my son, who is also studying law, and asked him whether he approved of the way I voted on Mr Duff's report.
I am unable to give out his response to this, as I awoke with something of a shock.
I therefore want to make it perfectly clear that we voted in favour of the report even though I see some of the problems as being the other way around.
My primary difference of opinion with the rapporteur is that I believe that the possible problem of the supreme courts coming to divergent judgments in matters of basic rights has not been resolved.
As a former supreme court judge, I know what I am talking about.
Despite this, the institutionalisation of basic rights prevails, and so the vote has been in favour of the report as a whole.
