Mr President, quite apart from whatever the Conference of Presidents may have determined, I would nonetheless like to insist that we should actually stick to the Rules of Procedure.
You said that the authors come first.
The authors are the two appointed by the committees.
Then it says there that these reports are to be replaced by amendments from this or that person.
That is the normal procedure with amendments.
Both the authors are sitting here.
Perhaps a mistake has been made!
Perhaps the bureau, and in particular its officials, are flexible enough to concede such a mistake, so that we can try something really completely new and not let our lack of flexibility show how incapable we are of policy-making.
