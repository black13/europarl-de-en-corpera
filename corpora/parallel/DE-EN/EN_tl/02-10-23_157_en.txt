Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Haarder - our former colleague and now the President-in-Office - today we are once again debating terrorism and how to combat it.
I think we all agree that terrorism has to be combated and we also all agree that this can only be done at international level, because terrorism has become an international issue.
If we wish to combat terrorism at international level, however, we of course also need to take a critical look at ourselves.
As the Budget rapporteur for the Internal Market Committee, on which we formerly sat together, Mr President-in-Office, it has come to my attention that we are faced with much petty squabbling.
We want to fight terrorism and to do so we need a European police force, Europol, and a successful authority, such as Eurojust.
I now note, however, that although we in the European Parliament have already made as much as EUR 2.8 million available for Eurojust, for example, this money cannot be spent because our European authorities are not able to operate effectively for national, petty reasons.
If the national police forces are not prepared to cooperate with Europol and if the national ministries of justice are not prepared to support Eurojust, then we can carry on getting up on our soapboxes to say how important it is to fight terrorism, but we will never succeed in doing so because it is preventive action that is needed.
To be able to take preventive action we also need functioning authorities, and we will only achieve this if the national countries, the 15 Member States of the European Union, finally make it possible for our authorities, such as Europol and Eurojust, to act.
I should therefore like to ask you, Mr Haarder, and also Commissioner Vitorino, to convey this point repeatedly and clearly to the Member States in the Council; otherwise success will elude us.
