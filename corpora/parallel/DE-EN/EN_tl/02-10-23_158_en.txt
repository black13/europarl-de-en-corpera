Madam President, no doubt in our next debate on Echelon we will once again hear a chorus of criticism of the interception system, which allegedly works too well, and thus of the USA.
At the same time, however, I note that Members were basically positively disposed towards the anti-terror legislation and voted in favour of it.
This does not, however, in any sense serve primarily to combat terrorist activities; above all it gives the EU greater powers to conduct investigations through, for example, the Schengen Information System II and the European arrest warrant.
The effect of this qualitative and quantitative extension of the EU's powers is to introduce sweeping changes in fundamental rights, meaning in particular greater intervention by the modern civil state and a weakened right of defence for the accused, whoever they may be.
The completely arbitrary definition of terrorism provides the clearest indication of all that the war on terror has little to do with combating terrorism and instead has as its primary objective the erosion of fundamental rights in the EU.
