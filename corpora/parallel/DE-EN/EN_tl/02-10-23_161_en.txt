Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the acts of terrorism one year ago, but also subsequent attacks, were the most effective wake-up call that the European Union has ever received.
The European Union has reacted more quickly than ever before and I believe that in a relatively short period of time it has adopted some extremely efficient measures.
There are, however, still many more measures that we need to take.
Our internal strategy has in any case been successful.
What we need now is a successful external strategy.
I should like to address a number of points here that seem to me to be necessary for extending and stepping up our cooperation with third countries.
The first is that we should extend the network that we have already formed to include Europol liaison officers and that we should use it for analysis purposes and for criminal prosecution, but also to provide support to third countries.
What we need are better ways of channelling information into our files, not only in the Member States, but also from third countries into the European Union.
Secondly, we should take another look at how we link the data files at our disposal so as to have more effective instruments available.
I am thinking of the Europol data, the Schengen data and the Eurodac data.
The third point is that in some cases we are still working with extremely antiquated systems such as the fingerprint system.
We must finally move over to using biometric systems so that we can determine identities with complete accuracy and take advantage of this in our screening processes.
Fourthly, we must not only think in terms of cooperation with the USA, but should accept the offer and take the hand that is being extended to us by the Asian states and work together with them in the fight against terror.
I myself attended the last ASEP conference in Manila and we received magnificent offers for getting cooperation with the Asian states against terrorism off to a successful start.
