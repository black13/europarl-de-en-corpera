Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you specifically for mentioning the fact that you are also working on nuclear safety in the Ukraine.
I would be interested to know whether it is actually intended to use the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency as a basis for guaranteeing safety there.
