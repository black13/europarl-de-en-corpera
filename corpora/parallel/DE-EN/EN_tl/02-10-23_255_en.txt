Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for that very good, detailed reply and for your formidable knowledge of the situation, which of course explains why we hold you in such high regard.
I should just like to ask a brief supplementary question.
It is a delicate issue, I admit.
You also once spoke of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
We are seeing that the term Yugoslavia in expressions such as 'the former Yugoslavia' and 'the remains of Yugoslavia' has actually disappeared and is to be replaced by the term Serbia-Montenegro.
The word 'Yugoslavia' would then only continue to exist in the official name of Macedonia.
I should like to ask you whether it might not be possible, in the long term, to find a diplomatic solution to the name issue, because it certainly places a strain on this country, which, while it may not threaten its existence, does have profound psychological consequences.
