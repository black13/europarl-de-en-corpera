Mr President, allow me if you will another brief supplementary question.
The Commissioner said that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has been informed.
That is correct.
She said that Parliament will be informed.
This too has been promised.
But we do not want to be informed, Commissioner, once you have made your decision; we want to be included in the decision-making process.
Our complaint is that this is to be regulated in the form of a technical annex.
We feel that this is a core amendment to the directive and we want to be included in the decision-making process.
I would be grateful if you could comment on this or if you could at least pass this on to the Commission as a whole.
