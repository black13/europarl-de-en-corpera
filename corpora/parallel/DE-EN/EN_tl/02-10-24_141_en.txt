Mr President, Commissioner, I really am appalled by your reply, because you said absolutely nothing about the central issue of how we want to achieve or can guarantee freedom of choice for the consumer.
You said absolutely nothing about how we are to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on a limit value of 0.5% for labelling.
That is precisely what the Council is currently negotiating.
With your planned limit value for seed, this value is not achievable.
You know that, which is why I should now like to ask you to tell us what conclusions you intend to draw from this vote by Parliament.
Is it in fact that you want to press ahead, that you want to bring about a fait accompli, that you want, as it were, to give the seed industry a Christmas present?
I think you should state here today how you intend to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on this regulation.
You said just now that contamination is unavoidable.
That is as incorrect as it is unacceptable!
In saying this, you are setting yourself up as the mouthpiece of the genetic engineering industry because that is what the lobby claims, but it is not true.
Tests in Europe have shown that there is no contamination of seed of any consequence and in Austria we even have purity requirements for seed and I think that is exactly what we need.
We need freedom of choice for consumers and, in order to guarantee it, we need purity requirements.
We should not just throw in the towel in the face of contamination when, with the right policy, there is no contamination, because products or seeds which cause such widespread contamination cannot be released.
So what we need is freedom of choice for consumers and, please, rather than giving Christmas presents to the seed industry, give us a timetable today.
We want to know what the Commission is planning to do and if it really is prepared to accept Parliament's democratic resolution and wait until we have adopted a resolution on the Scheele Report.
