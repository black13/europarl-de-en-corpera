Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to reiterate the following point: what the Brussels Summit achieved was clarification as regards financing.
In other words, if we talk about planning certainty, such a thing may now exist for those carrying out budget planning, but it certainly does not yet apply to farmers.
So it is now up to us to establish a policy up to 2013.
Only that way will farmers have the security they need to plan ahead.
That is what we have to do, and this is where the Commission will make its contribution.
By approximately the end of the year we will draw up appropriate proposals so that we can then move the debate on in a meaningful way.
I am sorry that I cannot stay for the end of the debate.
I am certainly not leaving for reasons of pleasure.
My plane takes off from the airport in half an hour, and there are 13 ministers waiting for me in Prague.
So I hope you will forgive me if I can no longer be present for the debate after 9 p.m.
