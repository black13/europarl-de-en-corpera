Mr President, I am sure there is not much we can do about tight schedules and fixed commitments, but if you had explained to the House from the Chair that Commissioner Fischler would have to be on board a plane by a certain time and for certain reasons, I am sure we could have avoided this conflict, because everyone would have seen sense.
However, if you simply inform us that is how things are, you are bound to provoke some resistance from Members of this House, and quite rightly so, because it is an offence to our dignity!
We are not content for our views to be put to one side - we want to be involved in this decision, and we want to know what is going on.
If you can take that on board, then I think we can have a reasonable dialogue with each other.
