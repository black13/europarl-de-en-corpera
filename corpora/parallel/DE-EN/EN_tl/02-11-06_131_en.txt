Mr President, the reform process set in motion by the 1992 agricultural reform and continued by Agenda 2000 is to be carried forward and adjusted to reflect changing circumstances.
The Commission's proposals are a basis for discussions after 2007, as a whole raft of issues and problems correctly identified in the paper remain to be resolved.
Nevertheless, the common agricultural policy was successful, and those elements that made it successful still need to be defended.
I am quite convinced that there will be major debates on the decisions reached by the Heads of State and Government in Brussels as regards how to deal with future expenditure under EU agricultural policy within the predetermined financial framework and including the ten candidate countries.
Looked at in that light, the motion for a resolution is just a snapshot and not a reform paper.
Freezing the agriculture budget at its 2006 level as from 2007 means an annual cut in agricultural support for farmers in the existing Member States, which will be hard or even impossible to achieve in 2003, the year before the elections.
It will not be possible to reach a consensus to the effect that farmers should meet the cost of enlargement, yet it looks suspiciously as if that is what is intended.
In her speech, the President-in-Office mentioned that there are proposals on the table for the milk sector.
I would like to ask you, Madam President-in-Office, when you think these proposals will be implemented.
Before 2008 or not?
