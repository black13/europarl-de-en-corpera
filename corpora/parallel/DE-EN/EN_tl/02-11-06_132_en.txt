Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our committee chairman, Mr Daul, on what he has presented to us.
However, this is not just Mr Daul's resolution, it has the support of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I hope that tomorrow it will have the support of the entire European Parliament.
Your personal achievement has been to bring together the various different tendencies in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and to document the European Parliament's desire to have a voice in the reform process.
I would ask you, President-in-Office, to convey this to the Council, please.
The European Parliament wants codecision here.
It wants codecision as regards debates about content and form, and it wants codecision as regards financial resources.
We do not want to end up with the sort of strange decisions made at intergovernmental conference level, with us being informed how much money is to be devoted to the agricultural policy, without anyone ever seeking to establish a link between the substantive reforms needed and their financial impact.
We want codecision for both agricultural policy and finance.
You were wise enough not to cap pillar two, because we would not have found that acceptable, but we need to achieve a situation in which the European Parliament also has sovereignty over finances in pillar one, and can also decide what the basic features of the agricultural policy are.
I am pleased that we have support within the Commission and that in Commissioner Fischler we have someone who will advance the reforms in the direction this House has in mind.
