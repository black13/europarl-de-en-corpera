Mr President, President-in-Office, I would first like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Joseph Daul.
Like many of the previous speakers, I fundamentally welcome the fact that the European agricultural model is to be extended to a multifunctional agricultural sector in the enlarged European Union.
This requires qualified external protection, and within the EU we still need markets to be regulated.
However, although I fundamentally view the Franco-German unity that has emerged in the run-up to enlargement as a good thing, it does raise some issues for me.
Although taxpayers and farmers already know how much money is to be spent up to 2013, they do not know on what.
Germany's position as a net contributor will worsen simply because Germany's Federal Chancellor has locked us into the agreed financial framework for the agricultural policy from 2006 to 2013, with 25 countries.
As we have heard again and again, and as the Commissioner has also told us, the reduction in compensation payments needed after 2006 will mean that less money will go to the agricultural sector than does now, and that applies particularly to Germany.
I simply want to make that criticism clear.
Incidentally, our Chancellor is not renowned for being the German farmers' friend!
The Commissioner for agriculture has put the net contribution to be made by the EU's farmers to financing enlargement at EUR 500 million in 2013.
This amounts to the difference between the additional costs resulting from direct payments for the new Member States and the increase in agricultural expenditure approved by the EU Summit.
This Commission calculation indicates to me that Europe's farmers will have to pay the lion's share of the burden of enlargement.
The Commissioner for agriculture has repeatedly presented it as something positive that the Brussels Summit did not cap resources for rural development - that is to say, for the second pillar - but he can also tell us ?
