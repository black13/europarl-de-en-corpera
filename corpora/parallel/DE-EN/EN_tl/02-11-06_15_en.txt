Mr President, on a point of order: I was somewhat astonished, at 1 p.m. this lunchtime, to learn of the existence of this application by the Greens.
We are a democratic group, in which decisions are never taken by the chairman acting alone.
I immediately sent an e-mail to the bureau and to the two co-ordinators, Philippe Morillon and Arie Oostlander, to the effect that we would support this application by the Greens subject to no objection being expressed to me.
My dear Mr Cohn-Bendit, I would, however, ask you to ensure that, in future, our groups have the time to discuss such an issue in a democratic manner.
In the absence of any objection from the bureau and the co-ordinators, our group is in favour of taking this topic and Mr Solana's statement together.
