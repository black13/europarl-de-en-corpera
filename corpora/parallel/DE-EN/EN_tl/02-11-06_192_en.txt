Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even if this is just an interim report to be produced every three years, it should be used not just to take stock, but also to give an overview of the next planning period.
It is quite right not to go into detail and not to give precise figures, but the key points need to be identified and central issues need to be resolved in good time.
One of these central issues is the 0.45% share of the Union's GDP set aside for cohesion policy, which may not be exceeded even during EU enlargement.
Another central issue is treating the regions as a reference unit for cohesion policy tasks and not nation-state criteria.
Anyone who would like to see anything else is missing the point.
A further central issue is the concentration of support on disadvantaged regions in an enlarged EU with clear, transparent and quantifiable criteria for the concept of 'poor regions'.
These and these alone can be dependent on the 75% criterion.
Any other factors taken as a basis for measurement cannot be clearly quantified and open the way to arbitrary decision-making.
This even applies to a criterion such as unemployment, for which there is no EU-wide definition and which is therefore bound to lead to inaccurate estimates.
When it comes to supporting disadvantaged regions, we first need to consider those regions with less than 75% of EU GDP.
But those regions that will be lifted over the 75% threshold after enlargement, becoming 'statistically wealthy', also need to have a more generous phasing-out arrangement.
We wish to see regions receiving more support the closer they are to the 75% threshold.
In this respect I agree with the rapporteur, who has tabled an amendment on this point.
