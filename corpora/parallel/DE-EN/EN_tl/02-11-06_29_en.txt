Mr President, Madam Vice-President, whether one tends to be favourably disposed towards atomic energy, as you do, or to take a critical view of it, as I do, the proposals that have been presented today are in any case very, very important and an important step on which I should also like to congratulate you.
I have two questions.
Firstly, Madam Vice-President, are you prepared to shape information policy on atomic energy in such a way that full information is given, with the utmost transparency, as regards dangerous incidents and safety measures, and to demand of the other countries that they should do likewise?
Will you also see to it that the controls carried out, as well as the controllers' reports, will be made available to the public, so that they may be sure that everything is being done properly?
My second question has to do with the timetable.
Which timetable have you decided on for the voting on the proposals you have put forward?
Are you prepared to play your part in speeding this voting up?
