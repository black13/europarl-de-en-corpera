Mr President, there will surely be great public interest in the topics of today's debate, which give us the chance to put an end to a certain schizophrenia by which, in the negotiations to date, we have been demanding more of the candidate countries than we do of our own Member States.
I would therefore like to congratulate the Commission on doing as the Vice-President has suggested, and adduce another weighty argument in favour of Community-wide standards.
The sooner we have Community-wide standards, the sooner we will have the chance to let them have an external effect, in, for example, Russia and the Ukraine, which is most important and in our interest.
That would, in addition, be the best way to support the IEAE.
Madam Vice-President, I would like to ask you a question related to that.
Could you briefly describe where the Commission's proposals on the line taken so far in negotiations with the candidate countries are leading?
