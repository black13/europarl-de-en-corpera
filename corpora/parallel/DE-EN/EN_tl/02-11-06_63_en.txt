Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask, Mr President, that the speech Mr Schulz has just delivered should be delivered this very day to the German Federal Chancellor and to the chairman of his party!
(Laughter, interruptions)
I think that is the right way to ensure that people do not say one thing in Parliament and then, for whatever reasons, suddenly take up another position in the Council of Ministers, for there is one thing that must be clear: the attempt must not now be made to make good the damage done to the election campaign by German foreign policy stance towards the USA over Iraq, by doing more damage through the ill-timed announcement of a starting date for negotiations with Turkey.
I think that, on this issue, we have to be perfectly clear in our own minds that the credibility of the whole accession process is dependent on the criteria being applied in precisely the same way to every single country, and on the timetable for it being adhered to.
Mr President of the Council, I would very much like to congratulate you on the work done by you and your government to date, including what has been done to prepare for the enlargement of the European Union.
Together with the President of the Commission, you have to handle Monday's summit with Russia, which, among other things, has to do with the Kaliningrad question.
It is my belief that there are two things that have to be dealt with together.
On the one hand, the enlargement of the European Union and of NATO means that bridges have to be built to Russia, that important country, but Europe's history means that the European Union must also show itself to be the protector of small countries and that, in any arrangements reached in connection with the Kaliningrad question, the status and sovereignty of small countries must be taken into account if we want to become a credible Union.
I wish both Presidents a very great deal of success in this incredibly difficult undertaking.
(Applause)
