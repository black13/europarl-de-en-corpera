Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, we have all been horrified by the pictures of the hostage-taking in Moscow, and we have to unequivocally hold fast to the fact that nothing justifies the taking of hostages.
Nor is there any dispute as to the right of any state to refuse to be blackmailed by such terrorist acts and to take appropriate counter-measures.
These, though, must be aimed only at the terrorists and must not make an entire people culpable.
There is room for criticism of the Russian leadership's lack of candour in handling public relations after the hostages were released, with particular reference to the delay in getting medical aid for the freed hostages and the way their families were prevented from visiting them in hospital.
There is also the question of why, unlike the hostages, the special forces that were sent in suffered no adverse health effects through the gas, even though they were operating without gas masks.
If eyewitness reports are accurate in stating that the hostages' captors were shot while still unconscious, then that represents a flagrant breach of every system of law and must therefore be condemned.
Violence can never be the solution to a problem; only peaceful means will do.
That is why the Russian Government must be told that, if they, in effect, label an entire people, and its elected representatives, as terrorists, then by so doing they are depriving themselves of the last partner with whom they can even attempt to resolve this problem in a peaceful way.
I believe it to be the European Union's task to support Russia and help it to get a process of negotiation going without delay.
