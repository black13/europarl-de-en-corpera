Mr President, I would like to bring in an oral amendment to item 21.
I shall state the justification for it at the outset.
The text, as it now stands, could give the impression that farmers wanted to enter the margin, that is, the EUR 20 billion, as such under the second pillar.
That is, however, not the intention; rather, it is intended that we should use the agricultural budget to put the reform on a sound financial footing by redistributing from the first pillar to the second.
In order to dispel this misunderstanding, I submit the following oral amendment:
'takes the view that the Commission proposals are not to be implemented under the current Interinstitutional Agreement and that a revision of the Financial Perspective is necessary with a view to reallocating part of the funds from the first pillar to the second', followed by the additional phrase: 'this bearing in mind the fact that the Community budget as a whole remains far below the upper limit for revenue'.
I hope this will prove to be acceptable.
