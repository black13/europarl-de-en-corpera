This report points out once again the grave deficiencies in the Structural and Cohesion Policy.
I have for years been reading these reports with very great attention to detail, and always the same deficiencies are enumerated: unemployment continues to rise, and the cohesion policy interventions must be considered as having missed their targets.
The present report highlights the fact that 24.2% of EU aid does not even reach the recipient regions, being diverted instead to richer ones.
Faced with these facts, we cannot evade the question as to whether the policy we are applying is the right one.
I also regard the candidate countries with concern.
The Commission's progress reports show that action is urgently needed to develop their administrative capacities and coordination mechanisms.
Mrs Schroedter's report must be a warning to us.
The prospect of imminent enlargement means that a change of direction can be delayed no longer.
It is precisely because I stand by the fundamental European ideal of solidarity that I demand a far-reaching reform of regional policy, one that will at last make this ideal into a lived reality.
Mrs Schroedter's report contains good ways of going about this, and the Freedom Party delegation has therefore adopted it.
