Mr President, just a quick word on the tanker accident off the Galician coast, which is another terrible and tragic accident of which we have certainly not heard the last.
A few days ago, a representative of the Commission, speaking in Lisbon on the subject of EMSA, the European Maritime Safety Agency, addressed the concept of a European environmental coastguard.
That is something we have been demanding for ten years, but without getting very far with it as yet.
I also want to prevent the occurrence of anything like what recently happened in Germany.
It was a year ago, in a similar situation, that we set up a maritime casualty taskforce that has still not yet become operational.
It was stated in a weekend newspaper that three potential bases are being sought for it, the best of which will be chosen.
I would have you know that the public take a critical view of this, to say the least, and I would simply ask that we should not allow ourselves such blunders, at least within the European framework.
