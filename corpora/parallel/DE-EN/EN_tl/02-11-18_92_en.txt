Mr President, I wish to join with all those who have expressed gratitude to our rapporteur, who did indeed have to go against his own instincts in order to be able to put this compromise before us, and I am also grateful to him for having incorporated in these compromises amendments that Mrs Roth-Behrendt and I had submitted.
I can therefore support the essence of the lines the committee has taken.
Perhaps we should take another look at one or the other of these amendments, if they really do, as it were, again jeopardise the legal basis as given.
In essence, the considerations on which our amendments were based were that the internal market has a legal basis that allows us to make regulations on advertising only if that advertising has an impact across borders, and, moreover, to a substantial degree.
I agree with Mr Lechner that this is not automatically the case with newspapers and magazines.
I also think we are insisting that sponsorship agreements both in culture and in sport have to make allowances by means of proper transitional periods.
I also think that the right to freedom of information is meant to matter to us.
On it, indeed, depends the economic basis of both the traditional media - and major daily newspapers are telling us what is going on here - and also the new media.
I join with Mr Medina Ortega and with all those who regret the fact that we have no better legal basis for health policy in the European Union than that which currently governs the internal market.
I would also like to observe that the Convention working party on the powers of the European Union proposes that it should in future no longer be possible to have recourse to legislative measures relating to health policy in the EU, but that only so-called support measures should remain feasible.
I hope, Commissioner, that this will give you a reason to drum up support from the Commission for a reshaping of the Convention's proposals on this subject.
