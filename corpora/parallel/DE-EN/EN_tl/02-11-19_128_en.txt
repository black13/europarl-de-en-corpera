Mr President, the extraordinary debate has made it even more apparent how diverse are both the viewpoints on the process of enlarging the European Union and also the problems of its future form.
Some things are seen as the report depicts them, but many get more critical treatment than they do in the report.
Certain things were said which cannot go without criticism; when Europe's borders are at issue, anyone who simply casts doubt on everything done at Yalta and Potsdam, should know what he is doing.
It is perhaps no disaster for an announcement to be made about the deferral of the deadline for accession, but elections to the European Parliament are to be held a few weeks after that, and it will be the Fifteen alone who will decide on the results of the Convention.
Above all, there are reasons of form and content for deferring the deadline.
The problems still to be resolved are trickier than had been assumed.
So it is that Poland and other states expect support for agriculture to be reconsidered and that they will not achieve parity before 2013.
Fears that a first- and second-class EU could come into being have not been dispelled.
Such fears are the natural reaction to great concessions being demanded of the candidates whilst there has been little or no negotiation of the transitional periods that are required.
Commissioner Verheugen has understandable complexes if he expects MEPs to digest 6 000 pages of text in order to confirm accession.
We should, however, be asking ourselves what we expect of the citizens of the future EU if they have to deal with the same amount.
It is incumbent on parliaments - the national parliaments and our own - to put our finger on what is wrong and demand an approach that will secure stability and equality and prevent us ending up going round in endless circles.
