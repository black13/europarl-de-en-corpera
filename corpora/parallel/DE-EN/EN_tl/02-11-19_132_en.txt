Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council - I should also have been pleased to greet the Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to concentrate on a topic that has already been mentioned, but I should like to address it in a markedly different way.
I think that we, as the European Parliament, must seriously ask ourselves how we intend to deal with such an important country as Turkey in the long term.
I think we have to give very serious answers to a few questions here.
The first question is, do we really want to hold up a mirror to Turkey's progress reports year after year and say to it: sorry, you're not ready yet?
Do we want to permanently tolerate a situation where the European Union's common foreign and security policy is handicapped by being unable to make use of NATO resources because the Turks could potentially use that to blackmail us?
Before Turkey becomes a member or whether or not full membership of the European Union becomes a possibility, should we not rather be looking for answers to the question of how we can even today help the European Union to build special relations with Turkey, thus enabling us to seriously address all the questions that we need to answer jointly, quite specifically in the field of foreign and security policy?
I therefore call on my fellow Members to give very serious thought to this issue and then perhaps after all to accept the PPE-DE motion on this very subject and vote in favour of it.
I am referring to Amendment No 7, which says that we must start building a special relationship with Turkey now so that we can solve all our common problems together.
We should not wait until Turkey's situation in regard to human rights, democracy, and so on, is such that it can seriously be regarded as a candidate country.
I should be pleased if this House would support this urgent matter so that we can achieve good cooperation with this important part of Europe.
