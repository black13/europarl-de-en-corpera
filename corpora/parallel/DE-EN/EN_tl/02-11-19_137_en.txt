Mr President, paragraph 46 of the report calls on the Council's Working Party on Nuclear Safety to report to Parliament on the implementation of safety measures for Temelin before accession negotiations are concluded.
This requirement is proper and important because the operators are currently not even satisfying key minimum safety requirements such as renovation of the much discussed 28.8 m level.
The much criticised quality of unsafe valves has not been improved either.
The pipes still do not have a second protective coating as European standards require.
The first protective coating is inadequate in any case.
The Temelin nuclear power station does not therefore at all satisfy the conditions laid down by the Council working party as agreed in the Melk Process.
If this is disregarded, the Commission's attempt, early this month, to create new safety standards for nuclear power stations can be considered a failure from the outset.
