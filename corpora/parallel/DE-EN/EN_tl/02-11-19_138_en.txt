Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Members of this Parliament and colleagues from the candidate countries, may I extend a particularly warm welcome to our Latvian colleagues who were elected to their country's new parliament early in October this year.
I welcome them so warmly because I have felt very involved in their efforts and in their work for many years.
On days like today I ask myself - and I am sure I am not the only one to do so - what has particularly impressed me about the enlargement process in the last few years.
Of the very many remarkable achievements, one is very seldom acknowledged.
Many reports by the Commission or Parliament contain a short sentence that is pregnant with meaning - a sentence that rarely receives comment and where the attention paid to it bears no relation to its significance.
That sentence reads quite simply - and it applies to all ten candidate countries: 'The political conditions for accession are satisfied.'
That means the first and for me the most important accession criterion formulated in Copenhagen is not an obstacle.
I do not take this fundamental assessment for granted.
We ought to express our appreciation to all our colleagues in the parliaments and governments of the candidate countries for having stuck fast to democratic principles even in difficult situations.
The cultivation of democratic relations cannot be taken for granted in times of upheaval and reorientation, in times of enormous economic problems and radical changes in circumstances.
After decades of dictatorship, the people have shown what the political priority must be: democracy and freedom take precedence; they must be cherished and safeguarded.
