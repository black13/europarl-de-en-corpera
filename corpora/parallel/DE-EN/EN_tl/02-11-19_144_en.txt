Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to deal only with the subject of internal security, because this security is very valuable to us, to the citizens of the European Union just as much as to the European Union as an economic location.
One of our objectives with enlargement must be to gain more security by having a common strategy, a common policy in fighting against corruption, international crime, illegal immigration, and the like.
All the candidate countries have made tremendous efforts in the preparation process to bring internal security up to a high standard.
The European Union has been actively helping them in this with various programmes.
The Commission makes an annual review of the progress made.
Some have made a great deal of progress, while others sadly still have ground to make up.
Without naming any countries, I should like to draw attention to some of these shortcomings.
At one point in this report we read that increased efforts are needed to fight corruption and economic crime, which continue to give cause for serious concern.
Or that there are still deficits in the approximation of laws in the area of money laundering or the protection of financial interests.
Further on it says that particular attention needs to be paid to combating drugs and smuggling, fraud, corruption and organised crime, or that efforts to combat organised crime must be stepped up.
These are quite specific points that show where individual candidate countries still have to make enormous efforts.
As the candidate countries are represented here today, I call on you all to do everything to remedy the shortcomings that still exist and to ensure that the enlarged Union remains a union of security.
I am sure that, with all the support you are receiving, you really will be able to work off these deficits and reach the objectives.
That would be in the interests of us all.
