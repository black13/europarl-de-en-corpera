Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, together with Mr Oostlander I have for many years now had the privilege of following the accession process from the point of view of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
The written report says what still now remains to be done.
Unlike Mr Pirker, I should like to emphasise the tremendous progress that all the candidate countries have made in this area that is as broad as it is difficult - and in which they have also been supported by the Commission and our Member States: the abolition of the death penalty, which still existed at least in the laws of a few candidate countries, discrimination against various minorities, Russian minorities for example, the improved integration of Roma minorities, the construction of a democratic police and democratic criminal prosecution authorities and other important authorities in the justice and administration sector and much more besides has been achieved by really unparalleled efforts.
This has been the case in all the candidate countries, to a greater or lesser extent to be sure, but it is particularly true of the Czech Republic, which is particularly close to my heart.
I therefore find it all the more regrettable that the present Austrian Government is showing no recognition of the positive things that have been achieved and that at least one of our ruling parties is trying to win votes for itself with anti-Czech slogans in the current election campaign.
They are of course focusing on the past again.
I hope that after Sunday's elections we will have a government in Austria that makes the common future of the Czech Republic and Austria central and stands in the way neither of the enlargement nor of the deepening of the European Union.
