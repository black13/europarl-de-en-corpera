Mr President, as a Pan-European it has been my privilege to work towards this great day since the 1970s.
Otto von Habsburg was here today, he has been mentioned several times and I was able to accompany him all along the way.
I celebrate this day, which is a great day for me.
As the son of a Bohemian family, I am also glad that a member has spoken Czech here for the first time today, my friend Daniel Kroupa.
He is in the tradition of that great social democrat Jiri Pelikan, who was here as a Czech in exile following the first direct elections of Members of the European Parliament.
There have also, however, always been members of Bohemia's second ethnic group here, the Sudeten Germans.
I am thinking of Volkmar Gabert and Egon Klepsch.
I, too, am part of that tradition; we have always seen ourselves as Bohemia's ambassadors here.
The Pan-European idea originated in Bohemia 80 years ago; Bohemia is the heart of Europe.
That is why I regret the fact that, at the start of this year, there was suddenly talk in Prague of defending the post-war order.
We do not need a post-war order in Europe.
We do not need a wartime or pre-war order either; what we want to build at the start of the twenty-first century is a new, equitable order of nations, built on reconciliation, on healing of the wounds we have inflicted on one another, on justice, on mutual respect and mutual recognition.
I therefore call on the Czech authorities to cast unjust decrees like the Bene? decrees on the scrap heap of history where they belong.
Let us join together in building a new Europe where the peoples live together as equals, where ethnic groups and minorities are protected, where the European cultural diversity that was expressed so impressively in the speeches here this morning is respected.
