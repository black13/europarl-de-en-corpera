Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we draw near to the close of the debate it is not easy to introduce another new aspect.
Since there is broad agreement here that we welcome this process and we are taking for granted that ten new states will soon be sending their representatives here officially, I should, however, like to raise one aspect again, that is the necessity of canvassing in all future 25 countries for this also to find acceptance with public opinion, with the citizens.
I think that is a great task that lies ahead of us and cannot only begin when the accession process is almost completed and the treaties signed.
I come from a region that in 1990 entered this European Union overnight, as it were.
I know that many citizens experienced the necessary restructuring process as a personal defeat, a downgrading that marked them out as losers.
I think we need to make clear to people in the candidate countries, too, that membership of the European Union also results in resources and means being made available to cushion the citizens and help them through the difficult process.
That will be a big task for us because after all we need majorities in the population.
If we in this Parliament are agreed, that is to be welcomed, but we must take the citizens with us in this process, which will certainly not be as easy as it sounds.
Let us work together to make it possible.
As a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to see the advisory committees more fairly and intensively involved in the next concrete discussions of the outcome of negotiations.
I know that is a great political achievement, a great political report, but the individual specialist committees must surely have something important to say about the process.
