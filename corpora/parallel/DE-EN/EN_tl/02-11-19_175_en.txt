Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Council Presidency has answered all your questions so precisely, I can allow myself to be very brief.
I think this debate has been very helpful.
It has contributed to the dynamism we need in order, with the wind behind us, to reach our objective in Copenhagen.
It has also given clear pointers as to what still requires attention in the negotiations that lie ahead, and we shall endeavour to bring the pointers that have emerged from this debate into the talks.
