Mr President, let me cut a long story short.
We were able to agree with the representatives of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats on a variety of compromises, including paragraph 1 on the Bene? decrees.
Amendment No 6 now makes further changes.
In order to achieve as broad a basis as possible, we will be voting for Amendment No 6.
We will above all also be voting for this amendment in recognition of Mr Schr√∂der's very successful efforts to steer a reasonable course as regards the Bene? decrees.
