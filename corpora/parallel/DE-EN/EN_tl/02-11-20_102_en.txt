Mr President, I am the rapporteur for this part.
I would like to point out that this was originally drafted in English, and that the German translation by no means does justice to the English text.
That is no doubt the reason why there is now an attempt to have a separate vote.
I would just like to say once again that the English version is the only correct one.
