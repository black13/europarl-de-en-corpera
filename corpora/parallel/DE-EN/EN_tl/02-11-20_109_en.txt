Mr President, I would just like to stress that the European Parliament supports the Commission proposal to make the most of this experiment in reducing rates of VAT for labour-intensive services.
Nevertheless, we are very disappointed that the nine Member States that have taken advantage of this did not see their way to submitting their reports on this experiment as agreed, so that the Commission does not have a basis for preparing its own legislative proposal.
I wish specifically to appeal to these Member States to submit their reports next year so that we can have a European legislative proposal on reducing rates of VAT for labour-intensive services by the end of this parliamentary term.
