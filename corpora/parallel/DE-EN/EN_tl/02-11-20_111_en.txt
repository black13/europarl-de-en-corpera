Mr President, I know that statistics are dry and boring, and some people even say that they are the most subtle form of lie.
Be that as it may, statistics are, it is to be hoped, an important way of decision-makers obtaining information and thus reaching the right decisions.
The recommendation for second reading before us is about the Community statistical programme for the next five years, 2003 to 2007.
At first reading, the European Parliament called in particular for a significant increase in funding, which seems really essential given the work to be done because of enlargement.
The Commission and the Council accepted all our amendments except that one.
I can only lament this short-sightedness.
In a world that is becoming ever more complicated, and in view of the increasingly close-knit nature of the internal market, European statistics are gaining in importance, and the Commission and the Council in particular need to be aware of this.
Unless a decision is reached today, Eurostat will not have any money to start this programme on 1 January 2003, and I therefore call on this House to adopt the common position.
I say this in the hope that the Council will this time show more insight and be more open to our wise counsel!
(Loud applause and heckling)
