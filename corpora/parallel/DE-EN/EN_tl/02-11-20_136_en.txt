Mr President, although the content of Amendment No 6 represents an improvement on the original Bene? compromise, it does not take account of the requirement in respect of the amnesty law before the accession of the Czech Republic.
This law has no place in a European Community of values that calls for the protection of basic rights.
We have therefore rejected this amendment.
A newly reunited Europe cannot legitimise collective expulsion.
Recital O in the report gives an important signal here and therefore has our unqualified support.
Even if paragraphs 46 and 47 are basically welcome, what is missing from the report are specific demands in relation to the serious safety problems with the Temelin nuclear power station and the possible decommissioning of the station.
We were able to support all the amendments and points concerning the closure of nuclear power stations that cannot be retrofitted and we support the highest possible level of nuclear safety.
Whilst the report is deficient in more binding proposals as regards the Bene? decrees and the Temelin nuclear power station, it comes out clearly in many places against fraud, corruption and discrimination.
We are very much in favour of specific demands for these problems to be overcome in advance of accession.
With regard to Turkey, my group is in favour of the recommendation in Amendment No 7 for the creation of a special partnership between the EU and Turkey.
We believe that it cannot be in the interest of Europe as a whole to allow Turkey to join the EU.
On the other hand, delaying tactics holding out the prospect of the start of membership negotiations should be fiercely opposed.
In conclusion I would like to say that we stand by the common European peace project and the historical need for future enlargement.
However, as the quality of the enlargement process is and will continue to be very important, my group abstained during the final vote.
