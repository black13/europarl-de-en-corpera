Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should support the fundamental health protection efforts being made in the European Union.
I am against the tobacco advertising directive for several reasons of principle.
Firstly, because it does not have a legal basis, and, secondly, because tobacco is after all still a legal stimulant.
If we were to accept the Commission's logic, we would also have to rethink our position on advertising sweets, fast cars and alcohol.
Thirdly, a policy that simultaneously subsidises tobacco and bans its advertising is neither logical nor consistent, and cannot therefore really be taken seriously.
As I see it, this is an issue of principle, and needs to be addressed accordingly.
