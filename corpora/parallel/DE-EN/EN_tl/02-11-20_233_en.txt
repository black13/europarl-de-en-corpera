Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the fate of the entire European Union is far more closely intertwined with Russia than we imagine at present.
After 70 years of the Soviet system, the future development of Russia is of course problematic, based as it is on a combination of deep-rooted structures and a new system.
As I see it, the position of the European Union can only be to provide active support during this massive restructuring process.
Over the next few decades, Russia will be Europe's most important energy supply partner.
Even during the Soviet era, Russia has always been a key player in stabilising world peace.
That should not blind us to the problems in Chechnya, and those problems cannot be denied, but we have to see the overall picture.
Furthermore, Europe does not have the right to treat Russia differently from other countries that are also in breach of human rights.
I would like to stress once again, for the avoidance of any possible doubt, that this by no means justifies the situation in Chechnya, but we do need a careful analysis of that area.
Europe needs to proceed on the basis that only a fair and open partnership between equals can succeed in the long term.
The most important steps to be taken are systematic actions to build trust, to establish fair trade relations, and to reinforce Russia's economic development and provide any form of assistance that will promote the development of democracy, a process that has still not been completed after 12 or 13 years.
It must be evident that without a stable, democratic and strong Russia world peace will be at even greater risk than it already is at present.
