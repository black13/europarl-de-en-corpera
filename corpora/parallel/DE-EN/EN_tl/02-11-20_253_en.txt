Madam President, I would like to start by saying that I agree with the statements made here by the Commission and the Council, but I would like to stress a few key points.
Pakistan is now a nuclear power that is even engaging in trade in nuclear technology, if you include North Korea.
The war in Afghanistan was pretty much an acid test for Pakistan, and I believe that it was only the current regime, the Musharraf regime, that made the anti-terror coalition possible in Pakistan at all.
The Kashmir problem has not gone away, and it is one of the major focuses of conflict in Asia.
Unfortunately, the anti-terror strategy has meant encroaching upon human rights and slowing down the process of democratisation in Pakistan, as has regrettably been the case in many other countries as well.
For its part - and in saying this I am simply describing the situation and not wishing to be judgmental - the Musharraf regime is essentially a consequence of the fact that there was previously a string of corrupt governments.
I share the view that we have heard expressed here: Pakistan has for generations been run by corrupt governments whose leadership of the state has given no evidence of responsibility.
That meant that military governments repeatedly came to power.
All those governments made a show of democratisation for the benefit of the West and at the same time had to keep the extremists at home happy.
That was bound to lead to tensions.
One comment about the election: we know that only about 30% of Pakistan's population voted, for a variety of reasons.
In Baluchistan and in the north-west of the country, religious fundamentalists were the victors in the election.
That is a problem, because it means the country is becoming more and more unstable.
The MMA, the party that brings together the various fundamentalist strands, will create problems for Musharraf and for the government that is to be formed.
