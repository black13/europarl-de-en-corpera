Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for presenting this proposal on additives for use in animal nutrition to us, and I would also like to express my warmest thanks, and those of my colleagues, to our rapporteur for her outstanding report.
In general terms, let me say that the debate about guidelines for a re-evaluation of additives should be viewed positively.
In particular, additives which are authorised for an unlimited period and which the report describes as harmless would no longer be available for use in animal production if a complex and cost-intensive authorisation procedure were introduced.
We have already seen this happen with a wide range of drugs after re-authorisation was required.
Re-evaluation, rather than re-authorisation, may therefore prevent a thinning-out of the product range.
The key issue in all aspects of food safety legislation, however, is the principle of traceability and transparency, as well as risk assessment.
There must also be genuine openness for us as consumers, and also for producers.
If an additive proves to constitute a risk, its use must continue to be ruled out.
Let me stress that I am in favour of a central agency.
In my view, the European Food Safety Authority would be the most suitable body to carry out this evaluation of additives.
I also welcome a simplified authorisation procedure for additives which are already permitted in foods.
Let me touch on one further point, namely imports from third countries.
The same stringent rules must apply to imports of meat and animal products from third countries as those which apply in the European Community.
For us farmers, this is vitally important.
I urge the Commission to submit a report to us on the use of antibiotic growth promoters by the end of 2007.
