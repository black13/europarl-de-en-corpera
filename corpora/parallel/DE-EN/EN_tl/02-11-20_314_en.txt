Commissioner, I have a further question.
I believe that your response to the problem of third-country imports was simply that you are introducing more stringent controls on imports of feedingstuffs.
However, Mrs Doyle and, indeed, Mr Parish were referring to the end product.
After all, throughout Europe, we have ready-made foods from these countries in our freezers.
This is why we are asking to what extent we have to impose controls, reject the products, or even tolerate distortions of competition with the European Community.
