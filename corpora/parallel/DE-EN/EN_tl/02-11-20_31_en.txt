Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for creating the right framework for the future of Basle II.
However, at the same time I would like to ask Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin what they are doing under their portfolios to ensure that Basle II is implemented without damaging the economy.
Basle II is about the creditworthiness of companies, of small and medium-sized enterprises, and about the guarantees and transparency this requires.
I believe that if we do not take precautions in good time here, we will end up with a huge problem involving ever more bankruptcies and enormous unemployment.
I would like to address my second question to Commissioner Lamy.
Mr Prodi mentioned that we want to drive forward the political democratisation of the WTO.
To what extent has provision been made in the Commission's work programme for making progress with the parliamentary assembly?
