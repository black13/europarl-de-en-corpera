Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after months of intensive work, we can now vote for the first time in plenary on the draft directive on working conditions for temporary workers.
Everyone involved has made great efforts to achieve the best possible solution for temporary workers, temporary work agencies and dynamic economic development in our EU Member States.
Reaching this outcome was a difficult task.
I would like to thank everyone who helped to ensure that we could present a fairly good compromise today.
With around 10 million jobless and a shaky economy in the European Union, we must be sure that our well-meaning intention - to guarantee a basic level of social provision for temporary workers - does not paralyse an entire sector.
It would be quite inappropriate to term 'temporary work' an atypical or even an unworthy form of working.
Temporary work can help new recruits find a direction for the future, and it can help prevent employees who are particularly difficult to place from leaving the workforce, or assist them to return to work.
My group attaches particular importance to flexibility in this sector.
We must not create new bureaucratic hurdles, and temporary work must continue to be affordable for small companies too.
Otherwise, the days of temporary agency work are numbered, leaving even more millions jobless in the European Union.
If, when we vote tomorrow, we are guided by the principle of subsidiarity and the concept of pro-active economic development as a basis for more jobs, we will create more scope for the EU Member States to pursue their own courses towards flexible labour market development which does not conflict with appropriate protection for workers.
The measures adopted in Germany with regard to temporary work lead to a dead-end.
I hope we can create a more effective framework here.
