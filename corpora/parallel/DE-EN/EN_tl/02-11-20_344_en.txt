Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most Member States already have laws on temporary work or collective agreements, but they vary substantially in quality.
The German legislation formerly in force was certainly not as simple as has been claimed here, and the public, whether they were employers or employed, did not accept it.
Let me list just some of the peculiarities in the German restrictions: the ban on 'synchronisation', limitation to twelve months, a ban on fixed-term employment, and a ban in the construction industry.
This is why I think that the German Government and parliament have taken a very courageous and significant step by already incorporating the European directive currently being debated into the qualitative improvements for Germany.
It was unacceptable for workers in Germany to be earning up to 40% less than the permanent staff.
No wonder the industry as a whole has such an appalling image.
This is precisely what we are trying to change.
What is interesting, however, is that temporary work is most readily accepted by society, and is also increasing to the greatest extent in those Member States where the principle of equality applies, namely in France and the Netherlands.
Of course, the employers want social acceptance as well.
The main reason for using temporary agency workers - as our Foundation in Dublin found out - is not the cost savings incurred, but the option of flexible deployment during seasonal bottlenecks, as a response to personnel fluctuations, and in some cases in the extension of probationary periods.
This is exactly what the European directive facilitates, with Mrs van den Burg's amendments.
The necessary flexibility is further safeguarded through wage negotiations.
Let us adopt this directive tomorrow and send out a clear signal that there really is such a thing as a social Europe!
