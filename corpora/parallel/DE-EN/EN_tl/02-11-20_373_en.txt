Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the Commission's objective of again giving the EU a leading role in the field of life sciences and biotechnology.
However, the proposed strategy lags far behind expectations.
I would therefore like to thank Mrs Dami√£o very much for her comprehensive report which clarifies the Commission's strategy document in many respects.
Europe must take on a pro-active role once again if it is not to lose ground in this sophisticated area of technology.
This applies especially to 'green' genetic engineering - in other words, to agriculture.
A prerequisite is the establishment of an effective, predictable and stable legal framework, both for agriculture and for the biotech industry in Europe.
This framework must comply, in particular, with WTO rules and safeguard the coexistence of all forms of agricultural production.
The removal of the de facto moratorium for product approvals is the precondition for more planning security for companies and the agricultural sector.
The moratorium is especially harmful to innovative SMEs in Europe and conflicts with the Lisbon objectives.
Within the Commission, and within the European institutions, a targeted European policy to promote a 'B-Europe' policy must be promoted.
Based on the successful concept of eEurope, these same priorities could be pursued on an overarching basis by several of the Commission's Directorates-General.
Further key points include: support for the development of bioclusters and other models for technological transfer, easier access to risk capital, especially for start-ups and SMEs in biotech research, the introduction of a European patent, and a transparent and scientifically based information policy on the part of the authorities, companies and the scientific establishment.
