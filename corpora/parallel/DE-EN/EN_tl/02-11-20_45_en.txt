Mr President, I have two questions.
The first is about securing our external borders.
I very much welcome the programme and proposals with regard to enlargement, and particularly the fact that you want to have uniform responsibilities.
The question is this: when do you think the new Schengen manual will be available?
We will have common training programmes.
When do you think this common training system will be operational?
What I would also like to request is that we should consider the compatibility of the technology being used and that we should also get Europol to carry out the proposed risk assessment as soon as possible.
When do you think the system will be operating?
My second question is about migration.
Our objective - and on this we agree - must be to create viable legal immigration mechanisms and prevent illegal immigration.
However, the problem that arises here relates in particular to the area of asylum, where, although the Commission has made proposals, final decisions remain to be made in all areas.
But we need decisions to be made quickly so that genuine refugees - who make up about 10% of applicants - can be helped swiftly and so that repatriation can be arranged for the remaining 90% that have to be rejected.
Commissioner Vitorino, how do you intend to ensure that a system of this kind can finally be made operational and that we can secure Council approval?
