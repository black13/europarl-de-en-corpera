Mr President, yesterday morning we had the part-session with our colleagues from the candidate countries.
Although it was not an official meeting, it was one of the most interesting meetings ever held in this House.
I therefore think that it is a matter for regret that although there is a verbatim report of proceedings for yesterday afternoon, there is no verbatim report of the historic proceedings yesterday morning, and I simply wanted to ask if that would be rectified.
