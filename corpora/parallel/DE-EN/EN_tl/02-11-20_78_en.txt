Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday the Council agreed to set the date of accession at 1 May at the latest.
As I see it, we should not be arguing about one month or another, and I suggest that we should make the necessary adjustments here and accept the date of 1 May.
However, to make sure that this does not put Parliament at a disadvantage when it comes to nominating the new Commission later on, we should stipulate an arrangement which will benefit Parliament now and add the following words after the date: '? and calls on the Council not to jointly nominate and confirm the new Commission with Parliament until after the European elections and to find a provisional interim solution for the accession countries'.
I believe that we should avoid Parliament having its rights encroached upon by having nominations made before the elections.
