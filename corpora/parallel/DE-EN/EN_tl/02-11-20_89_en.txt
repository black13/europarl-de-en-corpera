Mr President, as long as the mover agrees, I would like to make a suggestion to you, namely that the word 'welcomes' should be replaced by the word 'notes'.
There is a simple reason for this: the Lithuanian authorities and the Lithuanian Parliament have not yet given this their approval.
However, I believe that it is important for the European Parliament that the Lithuanians should give their approval to this agreement, which is why we should use the word 'notes'.
I hope that the mover can accept this.
I would also like to suggest that we should take the first sentence from Amendment No 52 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which was originally withdrawn, and add it to paragraph 18.
That way we will have overcome the technical problems and incorporated the essential message.
I would be pleased if the members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists could agree to this.
