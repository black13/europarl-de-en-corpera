The appeal to national authorities to cooperate more closely in the fight against so-called white-collar crime is certainly to be welcomed.
If, however, you want to give examples of this white-collar crime, and mention money laundering, market abuse and financing of terrorist groups, you should be careful not to add tax evasion to the list.
We all agree that tax evasion should be stopped.
Everyone should fulfil their duty to pay taxes.
But this is no reason to confuse tax evasion with tax fraud.
There is a clear distinction between the two.
That is why I tabled an amendment in this regard in committee, but unfortunately it was not adopted.
The same amendment was tabled in the plenary on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
This amendment also deletes the reference to the practice of blacklisting countries if they do not yet adhere to the various international standards in the field of fighting white-collar crime.
The 'naming and shaming' method appears at first sight to be very attractive if the sole objective is to fight against this form of crime, but it actually reinforces the law of the most powerful in international relations.
You would think twice before putting the USA on a list of this kind.
