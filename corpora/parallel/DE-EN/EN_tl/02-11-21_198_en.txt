Mr President, we have to bear in mind that the situation in Sudan varies greatly depending on the region.
In the north we are dealing with a problematic regime, which is however displaying clear reformist tendencies, and which is supported by Egypt.
In the south we have a brutal and bloody civil war, which it would be too simplistic to describe solely as a conflict between Islam and Christianity.
There are also conflicts amongst Muslims themselves and amongst Christian tribes, although the main conflict is indeed between Christians and Muslims.
This shows that this is not actually a war of religion but a series of tribal conflicts, ethnic conflicts, and that interested parties, including interested parties in the oil industry - for once this must be said - are systematically fanning the flames of these conflicts.
That is why I am very grateful that the motion addresses this issue very clearly: the problematic role of certain parties who have interests in the natural resources - we have seen this in the Caucasus and in Congo too - and who are abusing ethnic conflicts to brutally increase their own profits.
That is why as Europeans we are not only under a particular obligation to influence the people in Sudan, to work with them on a peace solution and to exert pressure on all of the parties in the conflict, but we also have a duty to hold serious talks with our European oil companies operating out there and to make it clear to them how great their responsibility is for this strategically important region and for the people who live there.
