Mr President, thanks are due to the Commissioner for the competition report, but congratulations also go to both rapporteurs for presenting us with their analysis of the issue.
The competition report is based solely on the accountability of the Commission.
This means that our comments carry about as much weight in the Commission as Economic and Social Committee opinions, and no more; we must be clear about this.
This is not to say, however, that the Commission, which has been given considerable competence here, wishes to restrict its rights in the field of competition.
Allow me to make a number of critical comments about the further development of competition policy per se.
Progressive globalisation, the fact that the European economy is characterised by mergers, and an ever tougher competition policy have consequences for the situation on the ground in that they bring changes for the labour market.
This does not mean that I wish to bring this process to a halt; I want to put to you the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which is that the employment guidelines are no longer sufficient on their own to compensate for the labour market problems arising from increased competitive pressure combined with today's weak growth.
I know that we should not, indeed we must not, pin excessive blame for current problems on competition policy; I am clear about that.
But what I wish to say is that the possible extension of competition rules to services of general interest would appear to me to be problematic.
It is not for the Commission to define these on its own; it must be done by politicians in general.
Competition policy is undoubtedly of value in itself, but must be reconciled with socially important areas of general interest, and this is even more important as the European Union prepares for enlargement.
I hope that you will have sympathy for this view, Commissioner.
