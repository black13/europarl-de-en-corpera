Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the final speaker in this debate I should like to stress once more that competition policy lies at the very heart of the internal market and I believe that for the European Union it is a very important policy instrument for strengthening Europe's position in the world and pursuing the Lisbon objectives.
Competition policy is supposed to protect European consumers, lead to fair market prices, create increased supply and increase all market participants' dynamism and capacity for innovation.
Competition policy prohibits both State and private monopolies.
It fights measures that distort competition and it is a precondition for all companies to have fair opportunities in and on the market.
We are on the right track, but unfortunately we have not yet reached our goal.
We are on the right track because we are seeing a fall in the number of cases investigated and because there has been an increase in the fines imposed.
We have not yet reached our goal because obstacles to fair competition abound and there are many different bodies with responsibilities in this field, which allows distortions of competition to creep in, and because we are too slow in implementing some directives.
We have not yet reached our goal because we have not completed our work in the interests of public welfare, because services of general interest do not yet have the clear exemptions and rules within competition law to make it possible to allow services of general interest and competition law to function harmoniously together.
I also welcome the Commission's proposal to apply the 'de minimis' rules to all arrangements between SMEs and call on the candidate countries to implement the competition rules quickly so that there are no distortions of competition between different industrial locations.
