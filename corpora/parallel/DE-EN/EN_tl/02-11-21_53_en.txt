Mr President, yesterday we held a debate on Mrs van den Burg's report on temporary work.
This debate lasted from 10 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. and 28 speakers took part in it.
When I asked this morning whether there was a video recording of it I was told that there was not because proceedings were only filmed up to 8 p.m.
Mr President, we say that we want to treat all debates alike and yet those whose reports are debated after 8 p.m. are always at a disadvantage.
Transparency is not guaranteed.
We are there; the interpreters are there; only the audiovisual service cannot be there because its resources have been drastically cut.
I consider this to be an unacceptable situation.
(Loud applause)
