Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
First of all, my thanks to you, Mr Lage, for your report.
I am delighted that you support this proposal granting Community vessels access to Angolan waters until 2 August 2004.
The new protocol is in the mutual interest of the Community and Angola and contains a few new clauses, which I should like to comment on.
Stocks in Angolan waters will be checked annually by local scientists in the interest of sustainable fisheries.
As a basis for this scientific knowledge, or should I say as a result of this scientific knowledge, fishing opportunities will be revised in line with it.
36% of the financial contribution will be used to set up a partnership between the EU and Angola, in order to develop research, artisanal fisheries, training and aquaculture.
This is a net improvement over the 28% earmarked for targeted action in the last protocol.
Not just tuna vessels but all fishing vessels will have to carry six Angolan fishermen, compared with five previously.
This will create an additional 160 to 180 jobs locally.
I should like to comment briefly on the proposed amendments.
Basically, the same applies as I said earlier about the protocol with Senegal.
On the question of including the Member States' obligation under Regulation 500/2001, with ships declaring their catches in third countries, this is not possible.
But I am more than willing to include this obligation in any new agreement, because this is something that needs to be negotiated.
