Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was slightly surprised by the last two speeches because I assumed that we had reached a reasonable compromise between the first reading and now in the conciliation procedure and that we had improved the Commission proposal on a number of counts.
I think the conciliation procedure was swift and determined to reach a result, the Council was constructive, and I rather had the impression that the PPE-DE and the Liberals had moved some way towards us.
I thought that sense had triumphed!
Nonetheless, and here I agree with the previous speakers, one aspect must give us cause for concern and that is implementation in the Member States, but not - as Mr Bushill-Matthews said - for technical reasons.
I think there is another reason why implementation should give us cause for concern.
I heard today about a professional musician working with a famous German orchestra who turned down an interview with us out of fear of reprisals.
He was to have described his problems as a professional musician but was too frightened to do so, and I am sure he is not the only case.
Employee protection, as Mrs Stauner said, is a basic necessity in modern working life, not a superfluous luxury.
The directive has added some important aspects in order to give employees in all sectors, from music to industry, the security of knowing they have a right to instruction and information on the risks to which they are exposed and that employers must point these risks out to them.
There are several options open to the Member States here, not just passive hearing protection.
They can also introduce new working methods and develop new jobs in which noise levels are kept to a minimum.
