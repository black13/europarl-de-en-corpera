Madam President, Commissioner, it is late, and I shall be brief.
I am delighted with this report.
My thanks to the Commissioner for what she has just said.
I am delighted that my proposed amendments were accepted by everyone in the Committee on the Environment.
My thanks also to my friend Mr Nisticò, even if there is one question we disagree on.
I think it is morally reprehensible to take primates from the wild.
If we feel we cannot do without them, then we must breed them.
I come from a country where we would no longer dare keep such animals in a zoo, not even the Schönbrunner Zoo, the oldest and most beautiful zoo in the world.
The last time a pharmaceutical company dared to bring two chimpanzees to Austria from Africa, they were rescued.
They now live, much beloved by the public, as Liesl and Hiasl in an animal rescue centre in Vienna.
As one famous English legal practitioner once said, you do not ask yourself, can animals think, can animals talk?
No, you ask yourself, can they suffer?
And that they certainly can.
