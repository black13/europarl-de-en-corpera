Mr President, someone said earlier that shrimps are netting a much higher income than cod.
Does that mean that cod will be off the menu in future, as is apparently already the case in Newfoundland?
That reminds me of a joke.
Why do we need cod when we have fish fingers?
But seriously, we have been preparing for this reform on 1 January 2003 for years now and just what has the European Parliament delivered in the end?
A lot of people are saying this is a lot of hot air about nothing, because the strong wind of change expected in European fisheries is now no more than a mild breeze.
And I think that the House has given birth not to a reform but at best a mini-reform.
Oh well, be that as it may ?
Instead of safeguarding long-term fish stocks, short-term, short-sighted maintenance of the status quo is the order of the day.
Harsh words, but I stand by them.
Hardly the real reform everyone supposedly wanted.
Hardly a ray of hope for exhausted resources, more a fatal 'eyes down and charge!'
We have too many vessels chasing fewer and fewer fish, with some stocks in a state of total collapse.
You cannot ignore the facts, even if you think it might lose you your seat.
Do you really believe that people do not see through politicians?
I cannot continue to support public aid for new vessels with a clear conscience knowing that we simply have too many vessels.
If building new vessels were a profitable business with good profit forecasts, surely the banks would be queuing up to hand out money?
They are not queuing up, there are no good profit forecasts and yet we expect European taxpayers to step in, whether they want to or not.
That is just plain stupid.
Sad, but true!
And there will not be any profit forecasts unless we rethink and make radical cutbacks.
