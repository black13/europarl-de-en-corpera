Mr President, this evening we are debating three proposals for regulations which form what I think is the most important part of the package of common fisheries policy reforms and we therefore need to remind ourselves why reform is so urgently needed.
One of the most important reasons is that stocks of several species are at a critical level.
There are too few fish for too many fishing vessels and the proposed regulations need to be judged in this context.
Parliament needs to pluck up courage and stand firm if it is serious about protecting fish stocks.
Unfortunately, no thread of real reform runs through Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's reports.
I do not think that minor cosmetic corrections are of any use at all in the long term, be it to the fishermen or to the endangered stocks, which are on the verge of collapse.
Nor do I totally agree that we should call the voluntary scrapping measures proposed by the Commission into question.
The emphasis here is on voluntary; to me, everything else is just talk.
As far as I am concerned, neither report is acceptable as it stands and I cannot vote for them.
The fact that all the proposed measures need a soft social and economic landing is one of our main demands and I think we all now agree on that.
But today's debate is about the proposed reforms, not the loss of the Prestige and we must not confuse the two.
We stand by the Galician fishermen but we must keep our eye on the ball.
