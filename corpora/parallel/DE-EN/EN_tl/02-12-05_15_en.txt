Mr President, I too would like to explain once again why we feel totally unable to vote in favour of this report; it is because the premises it is based upon are totally flawed.
Migrants put themselves in the hands of traffickers and smugglers of human beings because legal immigration into 'fortress Europe' is virtually impossible nowadays.
That and that alone is the starting point for all this.
That is why trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings happen in the first place, and it is because people who come here in this way are forced into acting illegally that they find themselves in a precarious situation.
It is for that reason alone that it is possible to exploit them in the way that they are being exploited.
To that extent, I can say that I find the Commission's proposal honest at least, because the title itself makes it clear that this is about ensuring that any form of illegal immigration is made more difficult, rather than about helping the 'clients' of traffickers and smugglers of human beings.
That is evident from the fact that this report also covers smugglers who do nothing apart from transporting people across borders in return for payment.
That is why I have only this to say: if this really were a matter of helping people, which some Members have suggested to be the case, then we should be working to dismantle border arrangements in a consistent way and to guarantee that people have the freedom to choose where in the world they live.
