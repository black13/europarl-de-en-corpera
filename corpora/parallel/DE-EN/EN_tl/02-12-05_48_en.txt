Mr President, I welcome the Commission's intention to make the EU the first supranational democracy in the world.
That is a fantastic project, and people understand it and support it.
In any democracy, the government is elected by parliament, and that is why I also welcome the proposal that here in the EU the Commission and its President should at last be elected by this House and not by the European Council.
The present approach is really topsy-turvy, and I think that we need to reinstate Montesquieu's principles.
So I congratulate you on having managed to get there.
This is a really important point, and one where Parliament and the Commission can now pull in the same direction.
I would also like to congratulate you on clearly advocating that there should be just one executive and not two.
There cannot be an elected President of the European Council alongside the elected President of the Commission.
We do not want the institutions to be renationalised, what we need is to apply the Community method, and in this paper the Commission and Parliament are on the same track.
We must get that through in the Convention!
