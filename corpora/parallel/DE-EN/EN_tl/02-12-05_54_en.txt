Mr President, I would like to propose some amendments to the Minutes.
On page 26, paragraph 11, concerning the statute for Members of the European Parliament, the PPE-DE's motion for a resolution of 14 November is not shown, although I have the electronic record of transmission here, and the two compromise amendments tabled by both the small groups and the two larger groups are not mentioned either.
Could that please be corrected?
