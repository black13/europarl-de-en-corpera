Mr President, I would specifically like to support this proposal on behalf of my group.
There is every justification for proceeding in this way.
We amended the Minutes this morning, so that this House's Minutes now say that the PPE-DE Group's motion was tabled first.
I would, however, urge you, Mr President, to let this House decide.
