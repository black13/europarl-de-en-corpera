Mr President, you thought you were right to follow the procedure you adopted.
On behalf of my group, I would like to say that we did not agree with your decision, but I do not want to dwell on that.
I asked to speak because Mr Watson did.
However, I certainly cannot accept that anyone - be it a member of my own group or one of the other groups - should take the moral high ground and accuse others of having unworthy intentions!
(Loud, prolonged applause, heckling)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reaction in this Chamber, the enormous support for what I have just said, is enough.
I do not need to add anything else!
