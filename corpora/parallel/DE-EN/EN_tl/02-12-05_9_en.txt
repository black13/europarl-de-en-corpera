Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international estimates indicate that traffickers in human beings transport up to 700 000 people every year, mainly women and children.
Every year, 120 000 women and children are lured into the European Union from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe alone.
These figures do not take account of either illegal immigration or the smuggling of human beings.
This highlights the urgent need for coordinated measures against this form of organised crime.
The proposal for a directive, which provides for short-term residence permits to be issued to victims who cooperate with the competent authorities, is an important step.
Up to now, there have not been any pan-European arrangements for dealing with the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings.
However, we need common European standards if we are to combat this form of crime.
The short-term residence permits proposed here will not undermine the current practice of deporting illegal immigrants.
Instead, the authorities will be put in a position to obtain information and incriminating evidence from victims who cooperate, with a view to apprehending traffickers and smugglers of human beings and commencing criminal proceedings against them.
Immediate deportation of victims may improve the statistics, but it does not bring us any closer at all to achieving our objective of effectively combating organised crime, whereas short-term residence permits for victims who cooperate make it possible to identify structures, break up criminal rings and bring criminals to justice.
That must be our goal.
At this point I would once again like to thank Mrs SÃ¶rensen very sincerely for all the commitment she has put into this report.
I would also like to thank the Commission and the other groups for their helpful cooperation, which I believe has led to a good end result in this report.
