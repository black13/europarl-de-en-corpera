Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, above all on the highly critical comments she has made.
In order to nip in the bud any tall tales about post-2000 implementation, I would also like just to remind the Commissioner - and I know this is not exactly his area of competence - that, as at 6 December this year, we had EUR 500 million left over in the B31 budget line covering education and youth programmes.
EUR 500 million, Commissioner - and I would like to tell you what it means when money is paid out in this area so slowly as to become indefensible.
It means that class war is being waged.
Under those circumstances, the first to be prevented from taking part in programmes of great value to Europe are students from poorer backgrounds.
As a representative of the Socialist Group, my comment on that is that these are not bureaucratic difficulties that just happen to have cropped up; people are actually being prevented from receiving anything, and that is something we quite emphatically will not stand for.
When it comes to the giving of discharge for the coming year, Commissioner, we will be casting an eye over what happens when payments are made in future, and what will be done about delays to this programme, and I also hope that our rapporteur will be examining it with great care.
Otherwise, the devil will take the hindmost - in this instance, those whose parents' income is rather more modest, to whom we feel we have especial obligations.
