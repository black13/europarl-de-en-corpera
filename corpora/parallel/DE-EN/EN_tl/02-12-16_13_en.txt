Mr President, that is something I wish to oppose.
As recently as last month, we drafted a resolution on this very important topic, and a form of words relating to this terrible accident was to have been incorporated in the declaration adopted in Copenhagen.
We do not consider any further, supplementary resolution on this topic to be appropriate; rather, the whole issue would be given even more weight, in our view, if something were to be framed to form part of the Copenhagen declaration.
We therefore oppose the Socialist Group's motion.
