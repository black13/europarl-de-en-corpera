Mr President, I wanted to put another question relating to Wednesday.
Why, yet again, has the time allotted to questions to the Council been reduced by half an hour?
I want, at the same time, to register a protest against this.
As you know, I regard the putting of questions as a fundamental parliamentary right.
I regret the fact that this is happening more and more often.
