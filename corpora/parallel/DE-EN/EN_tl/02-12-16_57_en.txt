Mr President, I wish to state my view that Mr Bourlanges's astute reflections are only likely to put an end to the procedural chaos if we really are prepared to be guided by this transparency and clarity in the hierarchy of acts, and that is not always very easy, particularly for those of us who deal with lawmaking in this Parliament's specialised committees, as there is the temptation in modern-day laws to draw a distinction between technical issues and questions of policy.
And, as lawmaking has become not only a more involved process but also ever more complex, Members of this House are assumed to be incapable of mastering difficult technical problems.
So the executive, wanting to be helpful, puts its rules in appendices or other forms of act, despite the fact that in some cases there are some really intricate political issues of decisive importance lurking in their depths.
I think this makes it right and proper to propose that a hierarchy of acts be used to create reliable forms of cooperation.
Alongside primary legislation, we need secondary legislation; it is only when it comes to secondary legislation that we need, even more than the national parliaments - which already have it these days - the so-called callback procedure, as this House has no right of initiative with which to reverse the Commission's initiatives.
I think it is to the committee's enormous credit that it has now also concurred with the view that both institutions, which are held in an institutional balance, must each have their own chance to withdraw a proposal.
I think that really is of the utmost interest for democratic and transparent lawmaking.
