Commissioner, you call your communication 'Modernisation of Accounting'.
To put it politely, I call that a misrepresentation of the facts, as what has been revealed to us in the last few weeks has been total chaos.
Your administration is about to blow up in spectacular fashion and if you had the courage of your convictions you would admit it.
I only wonder why it is only now that you are admitting to this scandalous situation - I only mention the fact that nothing was obviously done to prevent multiple entries - even though the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to it repeatedly since 1994, why you apparently need a few more years, until 2005, to put a stop to them, why you dismissed a chief accountant who was the first to draw attention to these errors early this year and why you subjected her to disciplinary proceedings.
I seriously wonder how you think you can sell us your new Financial Regulation as a great success when it is not based on an operational bookkeeping system.
