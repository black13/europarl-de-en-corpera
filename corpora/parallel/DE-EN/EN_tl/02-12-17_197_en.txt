Mr President, Commissioner, please excuse me if I have to leave before you reply, but I have a group of visitors and it is my custom to be punctual.
That is not usual everywhere in Europe, but I do it.
I have a very precise question.
You said you wanted to carry out a feasibility study about the IT system.
Now we agree that we are under pressure of time so far as the modernisation of the accounting system is concerned.
When I think about it, on the grounds of plausibility it seems to me that a feasibility study can only refer to option 2, namely modernising the existing system in such a way that it also satisfies future requirements.
My question is, given that we are all under pressure of time and that the system must be modernised, would it not be more sensible to save time by not asking this question and going straight for a complete integrated replacement of this system?
