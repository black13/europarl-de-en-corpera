Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, I congratulate you on this ambitious project and have the following questions.
The new system must be operational from 2005.
What do you propose doing in the meantime, since the Court of Auditors has been voicing strong criticism of the existing bookkeeping and accounting system since 1994?
You know that Parliament will very likely be dealing with these problems once they have been put before the Committee on Budgetary Control.
How much longer will it take after 2005 before everything is really operational if the new chief accountant - probably supported by the committee you referred to - will then actually have to guarantee that it will work?
