Mr President, I will gladly answer the question.
As I have explained, in the year 2000, the Commission commissioned a study that examined the accounting system.
We then decided - it was in a Prodi Commission proposal for the Financial Regulation - to propose new bookkeeping rules.
Then in June 2001 the services of the Commission prepared a first package of measures, a first action plan, of what must be done.
That was the basis on which the chief accountant was appointed in January 2002 and that was the basis of the work that should have been done.
I believe that Parliament itself would say that anyone working in the Commission is responsible for implementation.
It is not sufficient to repeat certain criticisms, but it is then that person's duty to work on implementing the reform.
