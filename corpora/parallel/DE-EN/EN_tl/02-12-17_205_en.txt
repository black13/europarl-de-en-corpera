Mr President, Mr Heaton-Harris, once again, the chief accountant who was responsible for the budget and capital accounts in 2001 was also responsible for the 2001 financial statement.
It was sent to the Court of Auditors on time.
The Commission presents the budget and capital account to the European Court of Auditors, which also checks the books on an ongoing basis.
The European Court of Auditors again came to the conclusion for the 2001 books that the financial statement provides a correct and true picture of the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation at the end of the year.
