Mr President, just two specific queries.
Firstly, can you give some kind of guarantee - one can of course never give an absolute one - that the humanitarian aid is actually reaching the Chechen refugees, or are you relying completely on the Russian authorities for that?
My second question is this: as camps have now been set up in Ingushetia and masses of people deported, do you know where those people have gone?
