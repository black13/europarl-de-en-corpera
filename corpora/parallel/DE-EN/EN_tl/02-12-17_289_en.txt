Madam President, Commissioner, in the past we might have talked about pigs' ears, today it looks more like fishy goings-on.
We read today in communication COM (2002) 422, which was presented yesterday, that a firm has imported shrimps with very high nitrofuran levels - 20 mg - from Vietnam via Ostend into Germany and then on to Austria and Luxembourg as well as selling them in Germany.
How is that possible?
This communication is dated 25 November, but only today, nearly four weeks later, is there an early alert.
Why were four weeks allowed to elapse?
I would like you to give me, and Luxembourg's consumers, a clear answer.
My second question is this.

That is a Commission decision.
I will read you what it says:
