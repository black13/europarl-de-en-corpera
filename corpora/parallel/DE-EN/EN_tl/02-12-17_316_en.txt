Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Florenz for this report.
I would particularly like to thank him because he initially took quite a different position on the end-of-life vehicles directive.
I think it is a sign of greatness to change your position and make clear that producer liability is possible.
If we had not found so satisfactory a solution to the problems with the end-of-life vehicles directive, we would not have been able to adopt this directive, either, because it would not have been evident why some were excluded from producer liability and others not.
I therefore believe it is a very great success not only for the environment but also for consumer protection.
I think it is very important that consumers will in future be able to have greater certainty that prices are telling the ecological truth and that consumers need not buy new hardware with every new software program.
In this way, we are also giving industry incentives to pursue not only environmentally friendly policies but also consumer-friendly ones.
I think it is very important that we have succeeded in arranging this individual financing and also that we were able to prevent the Council having its way and that small and medium-sized undertakings will not be released from liability.
I would, however, also ask the Commission to strictly control and enforce this individual financing later.
Only then will this directive really be a milestone in environmental and consumer protection.
