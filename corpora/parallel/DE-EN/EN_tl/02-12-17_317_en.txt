Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to begin by offering Karl-Heinz Florenz my warmest congratulations.
He has put his heart into his report, he has fought for it and I believe he has achieved a good result.
I believe putting the focus on firms' own liability goes to the heart of the problem.
In future, these firms will be able to participate in public tenders, serve local and regional public institutions and invite tenders.
That means things can get much cheaper for consumers.
One problem that of course arises for small and medium-sized firms is how they are to provide a guarantee for various services.
The question of how they are to provide such guarantees in the future is raised at this very time with the Basel II rules, which are all about creditworthiness, securities and transparency.
It is important that national, regional or local political decision makers give some thought to how they can help small and medium-sized undertakings over guarantees in the future.
Another point is the bans on substances.
I think the Commission should be very careful to ensure that proof of sustainability is furnished in the next three years, so that we can see that these bans really do make for a better, more sustainable, more ecological performance.
Consumption and costs must not be allowed to increase in certain areas because of the bans, putting a counterproductive burden on the system.
All in all, I believe the discussion has been most worthwhile.
I would also like to sincerely thank the Commissioner because it is also an important forward-looking step in the area of refuse and waste and because small and medium-sized firms are being given completely new opportunities here.
