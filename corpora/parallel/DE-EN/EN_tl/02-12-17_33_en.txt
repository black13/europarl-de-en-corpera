Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, I recall how we discussed foot and mouth disease at the Brussels conference all of a year ago, when I was still Chairman and followed what you had to say on the monitor.
I must say that our positions have now grown closer together, whereas at that time they were still rather more divergent.
I explained the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was that a policy of culling and keeping countries free of the disease would not enable us to solve this problem.
At that time, the Commission still took another view.
I concede that the international organisations took yet another line on the question of when inoculation should take place.
Now we have moved on a bit, and I call that progress.
I believe that targeted vaccination will enable us to limit the damage, in material but also in cultural terms.
The scandals associated with foot and mouth disease and the burning pyres gave the world an image of Europe that we must not allow to be repeated.
Let me just say something on the subject of prophylaxis.
I am not in favour of constant prophylactic vaccination, but we must also make it clear that control vaccination always amounts to prophylactic vaccination.
The right time for this has to be identified, and this is where the Commission has to watch out.
We also have to give the Member States leeway to enable us to have ring-vaccination and control vaccination at an early stage.
That does not, however, necessarily include ongoing prophylactic vaccination, to which I wish to express my opposition.
