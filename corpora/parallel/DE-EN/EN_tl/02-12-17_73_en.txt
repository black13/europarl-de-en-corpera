Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before we move to the final vote, I would just like to say a few words.
Never before, in eight years, have I taken the floor after a report, but I think it appropriate that I do so today.
There is no doubt that some of the amendments on which we voted today are perfectly in order.
Whilst I do not want to revisit the subject of Great Britain, which we talked about for long enough this morning, some of those that did not get through had to do with the removal of duplications, for example in connection with the OIE's three-month probation period, which causes us concern.
We were also concerned to give the report a coherent form.
We did not succeed in that, but it does not matter.
What I would like to say is that I am very glad that the Greens' Amendment No 25 was rejected.
I also want to tell you why.
The fact is that it would make the internal market fundamentally null and void, and, when your farmers vaccinate, you would have to explain to them that they were enabling British farmers to eat their own sheep and Dutch farmers to drink their own milk, since these products would no longer find their way onto the EU market or the markets of third countries outside the European Union.
You simply have to bear that in mind.
It may be all very fine as far as protecting animals is concerned, but there is no political mileage in it at all.
That is why I am very glad that the amendment was rejected.
Quite apart from that, I am very happy that we worked together extremely well in the committee, without regard to group allegiances, and that this report is supported by a large majority today.
