Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, is it not absurd that there should be a Council, which appoints a Commission and entrusts it with the drafting of a common asylum and immigration policy, and that the same Council should do everything in its power to frustrate this Commission's proposals?
At present, that is what we have to deal with in this area in the European Union, and on a daily basis.
I believe that my fellow German Members who are taking no part whatsoever in this debate have good reasons for their absence.
I assume that they are celebrating the fact that, from today, Germany will no longer have a modern immigration law, because they have been successful in preventing the creation of a modern law of this sort.
That, I believe, is what the Christian Democrats should finally ask themselves - they should ask themselves what they think they are doing.
If they were to act responsibly, they would inevitably end up sharing with us a concern that there should be a common asylum and immigration policy.
But that is not what they are about.
The Christian Democratic majority in the European Union has but one objective: integration and the frustration of any reasonable immigration policy.
I very much regret this.
