Mr President, it was not only in this House that we experienced a very active, not to say pro-active, Council Presidency, but that is how it was perceived by the world at large.
Now, inevitably, we are all the more surprised when, at the end of its term, the presidency answers questions relating to the future in such generalised and diplomatic terms that it almost calls to our minds another presidency, also from northern Europe, which was generally evaluated by this House as being far too diplomatic and general in its approach.
Let me, as a Member of this House, call on the Council to make an unambiguous statement as to how the Danish Presidency assesses the Congress of the Peoples of Europe and whether or not the latter is, when it comes down to it, an expression of a new intergovernmentalism.
In any case, Mr Haarder was himself once a Member of this House and can surely understand the extent to which that would reduce Parliament's role.
