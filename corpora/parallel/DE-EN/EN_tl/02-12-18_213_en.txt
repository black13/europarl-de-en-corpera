Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in a resolution, the European Parliament called for a framework directive on the safety of nuclear material and on the security of nuclear power stations.
Nuclear safety is a topic of deep concern to us all.
The Commission has now drawn up a proposal in the form of a Green Paper.
Now it is the Council's turn to do something.
There are many different suggestions as to how this directive is to be dealt with in the future.
Do you believe that it is still possible to implement this directive before the new Member States join?
