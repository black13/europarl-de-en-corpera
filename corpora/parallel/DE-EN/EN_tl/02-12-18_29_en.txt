Madam President, since 1996, not only have I been commuting between Brussels, Vienna and Strasbourg, but have also, in the company of this Union of ours, been climbing, with greater or lesser success, various summits every six months.
Such assaults on summits may appeal to extreme mountaineers such as our colleague Mr Messner, but I believe that the average member of the public still finds the proceedings laborious and difficult to understand.
Admittedly, it has to be said of Copenhagen that it was well organised, that excellent work was done, and that there was a marked improvement in transparency.
Not all of the problems were resolved, however, although they were properly worked through.
One can rejoice in enlargement as an historic event, but one can also be amazed at the way in which Austria was treated as if it were a candidate for accession and at the derisory consideration given to its vital interests.
It has again been demonstrated that the European Union cannot go on in the same way that it has to date, above all when there are 25 or more sitting down at the negotiating table and even more so when the main concern of every Council Presidency is to extricate itself from the whole business with as little inconvenience to itself as possible.
It is for this reason alone that I believe a debate on greater continuity is needed as a matter of urgency.
What will remain after the success of Copenhagen will actually, despite all the presidency's efforts, be a residual insecurity and, in the end, the hope that the heavily pregnant Convention will in the foreseeable future give birth to something that can serve as a basis for further improvements.
