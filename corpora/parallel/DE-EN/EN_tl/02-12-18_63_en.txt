Mr Alavanos, the United Nations peace plan includes a road map, which concludes with the proposal that the process should end with a referendum to be held in Cyprus' Greek and Turkish communities on the same day, and which would combine both questions, that is to say, approval of the resolution of the conflict and approval of membership of the European Union.
Consequently, the situation cannot arise in which membership of the European Union is approved, but not the political solution to the conflict in Cyprus, and so your question is hypothetical.
On the contrary, it is a fact that if, by a democratic process, the people reject accession to the European Union, we regret that very deeply, but, being a democratic institution, we have to respect it.
