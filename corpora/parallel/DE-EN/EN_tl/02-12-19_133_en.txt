Madam President, the decision by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to publish a consultation paper presenting its proposals for an anti-subversion law in accordance with Article 22 of the Basic Law has led to great uproar and concern not only in Hong Kong itself, but also here in the European Parliament.
We have very clearly heard what not only people in the religious world but also the business world, the newspapers and journalists in Hong Kong have told us, and we need to take those fears very seriously.
There are fears that the opposition is to be silenced, that freedom of speech and freedom of the press, the right to publish and freedom of association are to be curbed, and that the right and the freedom to establish trade unions will no longer be guaranteed.
These are genuine fears and we must take them seriously, because we are talking about civil rights that we regard as fundamental values, and we also intend to defend those fundamental values in China.
That is why we are calling on the People's Republic of China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' policy which the previous speakers have already mentioned.
That policy must be respected.
I call on China to respect it and to ensure that Hong Kong can exercise its own rights and is not subject to any pressure to limit existing rights and freedoms.
