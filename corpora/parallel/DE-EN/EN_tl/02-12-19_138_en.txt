Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been closely following the public debate surrounding the proposal adopted by the Hong Kong regional government on the implementation of Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law.
The Commission is conscious of the enormous significance and political sensitivity of this initiative, especially as regards the development of Hong Kong and China as a whole.
As this proposal by the regional government has been framed in very general terms, it will not be possible to judge this draft law properly until it is presented to Hong Kong's Legislative Council.
That will probably happen in February 2003.
The Commission's approach is based on the assumption that a wide-ranging consultation process will now take place, and that this will subsequently be extended to the detailed legislative provisions as soon as they are presented to the Legislative Council.
The Commission believes that it is very important for the views expressed by various groups during this consultation process to be taken fully into account when drafting the future legislative provisions.
Furthermore, the proposed legislative provisions and their application should not undermine the preservation of a constitutional system or respect for human rights and basic freedoms in Hong Kong, in accordance with its 'one country, two systems' principle.
Lastly, in accordance with Hong Kong's Basic Law, the legislation proposed must be compatible with UN agreements on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights.
The European Union is carefully monitoring developments in this area through its ambassadors.
On the basis of their recommendations it intends to transmit a declaration to the Hong Kong regional government at the highest possible level and as soon as possible, and in any case before the end of the consultation process on 24 December; this declaration will emphasise the European Union's commitment to the principles I have just mentioned.
