Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is deeply concerned about the planned destruction of Palestinian families' homes in the old town of Hebron.
Not only are these buildings of cultural and historical significance, but the planned action will also add further to the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians.
The European Union has condemned the attack by Palestinian militants on 15 November in which 12 Israeli soldiers were killed.
The Commission cannot, however, see how the measures planned would increase security in Hebron; if anything, these measures will serve to exacerbate the situation, which is already extremely tense.
The Commission considers that the destruction of historic Palestinian dwellings is in breach of the Hebron Protocol agreed by Israel and the Palestinian Autonomy Authority in 1997.
That protocol commits both parties to preserving and protecting the historic character of the town, so that no part of its heritage is damaged or changed.
The Commission also wishes to draw Parliament's attention to the recent conclusions of the European Council held in Copenhagen, when the Council expressed its alarm at the expansion of settlements and related construction work.
It called upon Israel as a matter of urgency to reverse its settlement policy, to freeze settlement construction and halt the confiscation of any further land.
