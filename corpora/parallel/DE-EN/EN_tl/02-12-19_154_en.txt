Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China I have recently been able to hold many fascinating discussions with my Chinese counterparts.
I had gained the impression that a real opening up, a genuine dialogue on human rights was actually going to take place.
So I too very much welcomed the release of both Ngawang Sangdrol and Jigme Sangpo.
We regarded that as a sign that pledges were being honoured and promises were being kept.
We very much welcomed the fact that Li Peng honoured his commitment finally to enter into contact with the Dalai Lama and that initial discussions were actually being held with representatives of the Dalai Lama.
We regarded these as two very positive signs.
So we are all the more dismayed now that at exactly the same time two people, Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup - a lama and one of his followers - were arrested and kept in solitary confinement for six or even eight months, although to this day it has not been established beyond doubt that they really committed the act of which they were accused.
This is totally contrary to the constitutionality that we naturally expect and demand from a people or from a government.
We understand very well that the fight against terrorism is important, but that means combating genuine terrorism, not dissidents.
The fight against terrorism must of course also respect constitutional criteria, otherwise it cannot be justified.
I only hope that this was a blunder that will be very quickly rectified by the Chinese Government, and that these two people will be released or will at least receive a fair trial.
I also hope that China will make sure that the door to human rights, which has been very slightly opened, will not be slammed shut again but will be opened further, so that genuine constitutionality may also prevail in China.
