Madam President, as our President already wished us a Happy Christmas at lunchtime today, which may explain why many Members have already inadvertently left, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you as our President for Thursday evening for your excellent chairmanship and to congratulate you.
We wish you, and of course all the staff who have remained with us until this evening, a very Happy Christmas.
