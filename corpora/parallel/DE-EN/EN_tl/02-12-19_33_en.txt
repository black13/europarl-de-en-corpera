Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication bears the words 'status of work on the examination of a proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest', a phrase which I feel is something of a provocation.
We do not need an examination of the need for a framework directive; rather, what we need is for the Commission to present a framework directive, in accordance with Parliament's long-standing request that it should do so.
If examination is what you want, you should read the Langen Report, the thirty-five pages of which will give you a detailed explanation of why we need a framework directive of this sort.
We therefore demand that the procedure be speeded up and that Parliament's resolutions be acted upon.
Commissioner, there is such a thing as the Lisbon process, which speaks unambiguously in terms of the European Union having social cohesion as its objective.
In my view, services of general interest serve that social cohesion.
A large proportion of services of general interest are provided on a voluntary basis and not only as a main job.
They contribute to a higher degree of humanitarianism, and, as a rule, they are at home in the area between the state and the private sector.
The support they receive from the state is not to be regarded as state aid, and they are private, although not wholly subject to competition law.
It is for this precise reason that we need a legal framework that provides legal certainty.
Christmas being only a few days away, I would like to extend the warmest thanks to those who work, whether professionally or voluntarily, for the common good.
Without them, our society would be a colder place, and the European social model would be unworkable.
