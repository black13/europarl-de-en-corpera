Mr President, our group has just been discussing this issue, and it is our opinion that the topicality and urgency of developments in North Korea make it imperative that this issue be dealt with this week.
In the event of further discussion of this issue becoming necessary, we will sort that out at a future date.
We are therefore against the topic of North Korea being removed from the list of topical and urgent matters for debate.
