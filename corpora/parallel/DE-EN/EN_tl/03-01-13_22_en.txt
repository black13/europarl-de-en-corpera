Mr President, I wanted simply to point out to Mrs Frassoni that we could still have added the subject of capital punishment in the Congo to the list of matters for topical and urgent debate without further ado if her group had not, at that time, needlessly voted to restrict the list of matters for topical and urgent debate to three topics on each occasion, which is of no use to anybody, and does not help matters.
