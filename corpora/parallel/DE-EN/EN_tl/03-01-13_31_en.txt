Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we were on our Christmas holidays, Touria Tiouli, a Frenchwoman and a citizen of the European Union, was in prison in Dubai.
Having accused three men of rape, she was taken into custody as long ago as October, accused of relations sexuelles adulterines - extra-marital sexual intercourse - a bizarre interpretation of the law that degrades the victim still further and gets her jailed into the bargain.
We have enshrined European human rights in the Treaties, and human dignity in the Charter, and regard these things as binding throughout the world.
This scandal in Dubai, Mr President, makes it necessary that this be pointed out.
I ask you to write on behalf of the European Parliament a letter that will get Touria Tiouli set at liberty and make it clear that we want nothing to do with states that treat human dignity with such contempt.
