Mr President, please allow me to add something to what Mrs Gebhardt has said.
The things she has described have made a deep impression on me, but, Mrs Gebhardt, there was just one thing missing.
The reason why these violations of human rights outrage us is that a European woman is involved.
We should, though, be aware that Muslim women - and not only in Dubai - are exposed to the same violations of human rights on a daily basis.
