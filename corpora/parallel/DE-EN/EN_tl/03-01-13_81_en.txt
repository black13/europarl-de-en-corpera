Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, with this report, Parliament is getting the new year off to a good start - such a good start, that I have almost forgotten that I have forgotten to wear a tie.
Ladies and gentlemen, this report's political message is that Europe's Parliament is drawing much closer to its regions, thus abandoning its former attitude, which was somewhat aloof.
As far as the regions' right of appeal is concerned, I am glad that we have already come to an understanding about so much.
We have agreed that the situation demands that the regions should have the option of laying claims before the European Court of Justice.
We are also as one in believing that, on the other hand, the Member States must have some sort of monitoring role in this.
In practice, this means that all that remains to be decided is what the role of the Member States is to be.
Mr Corbett, your compromise proposes that it is only to the Member States that the regions should be able to make some sort of application, but that, unfortunately, gets us no further and is no sort of compromise.
The fact is that the regions can of course do that already.
Furthermore, it labours under the great disadvantage that we would be doing precisely what you advise us not to do, in that we would be interfering in the relationship between the regions and the Member States, and prescribing what that relationship should be.
That is why I wish, again, to commend to you the compromise motion No 24, which would enable the regions to appeal under the Member States' supervision, as it were.
This would leave room for flexible solutions in all the Member States, solutions that might be different in Germany from what they are in Great Britain.
For this reason, I really do beg you to reconsider this.
This is a sensitive issue for the regions, who are awaiting a signal from us, and I would be glad if we could join in sending that signal tomorrow.
