Mr President, when I read yesterday's newspapers from Luxembourg, I was amazed at the fuss created by the Greens, who have made themselves out to be the prime movers behind the revision of the Regulation harmonising certain social security provisions in the area of road transport.
If our rapporteur had read these articles, he would surely also be astonished, as, out of the 269 amendments with which the committee had to get to grips, a mere 16 originated from the Greens, and - thank God - 14 of those were voted out.
It takes a certain kind of sheer nerve to muster the whole of Luxembourg's press in order to give them to believe that this report would bear the stamp of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, whereas it in fact saw the light of day in consequence of an agreement between the rapporteur and the three largest groups in this House.
Today, I have voted against the amendment on driving times that the Greens have put before us, my reason being that it does not guarantee the necessary flexibility and would do the drivers a disservice.
A solution as inflexible as this one would in fact not permit those who have to drive at a great distance from their base to apportion their rest periods in such a way as to allow them to spend more time with their families and friends.
I welcome the opportunity given to us at first reading to make a sensible contribution to a regulation on social provision that is clearer, safer, and more controllable.
I hope that, from 2004, the digital tachograph will prevent black sheep from finding new boltholes!
