Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr President of the Council, concluded your remarks with a brief discussion of European defence policy.
You observed that the agreement between NATO and the European Union has now come into being, thus leaving the way open for the next European defence policy measures, which we can expect to be taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
This is an eventuality to which particular attention must be drawn, as the European Union will then, for the first time, be taking on responsibilities in defence in a visible way.
This leads me to put two questions, the first of which has to do with how this defence policy is to develop in future.
Do you share the view that the constitutional treaty currently under negotiation should include an article stipulating a mutual defence commitment, comparable to the corresponding article in the treaty on the Western European Union?
That would be an expression of confidence when we take joint action.
Secondly, you also, very briefly, addressed the area of armaments policy, alluding to the way in which the countries of the European Union spend EUR 150 billion on defence, whereas we are always being told that the excessive duplication resulting from this means that efficiency is minimal.
Do you share the view that a common market in defence needs to be created?
What definite steps will the Greeks take during their presidency of the Council?
