Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to add something to what has just been said.
Only a matter of a few decades ago, Angola was one of Africa's principal agricultural exporters, and this of course means that it is appalling that we now have to supply it with food aid - a situation brought about by both war and socialist mismanagement of the economy.
There are three questions I would like to put to you.
Firstly, what actual agricultural programmes is the Commission implementing?
That, in my view, is the most important thing, that the country can again be self-supporting and export agricultural produce.
Secondly, what is the state of the infrastructure that is needed to distribute the food?
And thirdly, what is happening about educational and training programmes?
These are, I believe, the three most important issues that are at stake here.
