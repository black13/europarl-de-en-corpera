Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to express my gratitude to the Commissioner, believing as I do that third-party certification will be a particularly important consideration for us in the future.
The CE conformity marking does indeed confirm that the product complies with all rules within the European Union and is legal here.
The only thing is that the public do not, in fact, want just this legal status quo; they want certification by a third - and of course neutral - party to give better products a higher market profile, so that what we end up with, for all practical purposes, is a quality pyramid.
The CE marking would be its lowest level, with a standard mark being required to indicate significant improvements in quality, practical usefulness, or safety features in comparison with the normal CE marking.
I believe that such upward gradation of quality would be of great importance to consumers and the public.
