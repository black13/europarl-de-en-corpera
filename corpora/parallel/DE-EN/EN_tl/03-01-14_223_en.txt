Commissioner, I too am aware that Kosovo's present status is laid down in the UN Resolution, but the simple fact is that we also have to consider the future, and that is where I can envisage a problem, in that no major investor will put money into Kosovo if he does not know what sort of long-term future the place has to look forward to.
If people cannot see what prospects there are for the country, they will carry on trying to emigrate, rather than investing their energies in Kosovo itself.
Hence this question: is there any sort of dialogue between the European Union and the representatives of Kosovo, in which these issues are at least considered?
After all, the present position cannot remain as it is for decades at a stretch, and we cannot go sliding, without any sort of forward planning, into a future that will be with us very soon.
