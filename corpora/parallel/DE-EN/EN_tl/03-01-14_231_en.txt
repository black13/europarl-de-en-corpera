Mr President, I would be interested to know if the Commission has considered the accusations from the Israeli point of view.
Following the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure, these accusations were made precisely when that same infrastructure had some connection with terrorist activities directed against Israel and against Israeli civilians, without regard to whether they were Jewish or of Arab descent.
I would be interested to know what conclusions this has led the Commission to draw.
