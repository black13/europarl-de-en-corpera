Mr President, I had actually intended to say something completely different, but in the light of the last two speakers' comments I will digress somewhat and take up another point.
We have heard things said that actually belong in the past - in a past that is, thankfully, long gone - a time when all that mattered was intervention and the class struggle, when people tried to create confrontation.
I believe that this was completely the wrong attitude.
History has condemned this approach and life punishes latecomers, as an extremely famous man once said, a man who had his roots in this system and then in the end also brought about its downfall because he knew it so well, I mean President Gorbachev.
We want better environmental protection, more goods to be transferred from road to rail, a better modal balance and thus better protection for consumers.
Better protection for consumers: let me give you an example of something that happened two days ago in my home region, in the cross-border Brenner Pass, where consignments of dangerous goods, which now have to be carried by road because there are no rail services that can handle them, caught fire, with very serious consequences for the environment and for the public.
We escaped an environmental disaster by the skin of our teeth.
This is our intention: we want to make transport safer, and here I am particularly grateful to my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, who has been fighting for these initiatives to be taken for years.
We hope that these reports - and his in particular - will mean that we can take a substantial step in the right direction.
I am also grateful to the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, who has a particularly good understanding of this issue and is endeavouring to achieve a modal balance.
We hope that we can continue further along this positive route.
