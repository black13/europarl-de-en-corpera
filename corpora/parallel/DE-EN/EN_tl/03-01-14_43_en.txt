Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we adopt the Markov report today then this new legislation will not only interest those directly involved in the transport sector but millions of people in Europe, because this is also about road safety.
Safety in road freight transport concerns everyone who lives in the EU, because - and the statistics are clear about this - overtiredness at the wheel kills!
A study by the European Safety Council shows that more than 50% of drivers admit that they have fallen asleep at the wheel at least once in their driving careers so far.
What then is to be done?
We Greens think that the working times in this sector, the driving times, need to be reduced.
We have tabled an amendment stating that they should be reduced to 80 hours every two weeks with a maximum of 45 to 48 hours in any one week.
What we have at the moment is 56 hours per week.
That is only the driving time.
On top of that there is loading and unloading.
There is no other job in industry that presents such a high risk for which we permit such long working hours.
In addition, systematic inspections need to be introduced.
As Mr Piecyk mentioned, when the regulation on the digital tachograph is implemented, we must exert pressure on all of the national governments to introduce checks on undertakings, the company card.
If you talk to police officers they will tell you that this company card is the only way of effecting systematic checks on undertakings.
Obviously we will have to ensure that this European legislation is respected in the competent overarching bodies, for example in the requirements for CEMT licences.
I have raised this with Mrs Isabelle Durant, who is currently chairing CEMT, so that this issue is put on the agenda of the CEMT ministerial meeting of 21 and 22 April.
