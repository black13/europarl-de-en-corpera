Mr President, I think we can make things easier for ourselves.
My group opposes the oral amendments.
I am sorry, but having discussed these reports in detail in the committee and voted on them as a package, it is simply out of the question to untie that package by making changes at this stage.
That is why my group opposes all oral amendments to the Ainardi report.
