Mr President, I indicated beforehand that I wished to raise a point of order before the vote on Amendment No 24.
I refer to Rule 139(6) of the Rules of Procedure, which states that amendments have to be distributed and translated.
I have various language versions in front of me, none of which contains this particular amendment, Amendment No 24.
In addition, a number of Members, from both the conservative and Social Democratic groups, were under the impression that this vote would not be taking place until tomorrow.
I would therefore firstly move that the vote should not take place.
Insofar as it is possible for me to assess the situation as one of the proposers of the original right to bring cases before the court, I do not think that a proper decision can be made if these amendments are put to the vote first and not Mr Duff's amendment.
In any case, Members are free to exercise their independent judgment.
I refer here to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure.
Give us an opportunity actually to vote on the right to bring cases before the court, that is, on the original wording of Paragraph 8.
