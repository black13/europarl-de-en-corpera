The proposals for a second railway package set in motion important initiatives towards strengthening Europe's railway system.
Opening rail freight services within Member States, and accelerating the process of opening up the international ones, represent a significant step towards deregulating the railway sector.
The objectives set by the White Paper for European transport policy up to 2010, as well as the constantly increasing volume of traffic on Europe's roads, mean that absolute priority must be accorded to transferring goods traffic from road to rail.
Diverting the flow of European freight traffic can succeed in the long term only if railways are high-performing and competitive.
The planned harmonisation of the European railway network is therefore to be welcomed, provided that a maximum of safety in rail travel can be guaranteed.
