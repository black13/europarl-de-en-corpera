Mr President, I have been happy to vote for Mr Pirker's report, seeing that it carries on work that I did in 1998, when we adopted the report - in my name at the time - on eastward enlargement and internal security, which for the first time elaborated the idea of a European Corps of Border Guards.
Since then, substantial progress has been made on the part of the Member States by way of the Italian feasibility study, and on the part of the Commission by way of this communication, for which I thank Commissioner Vitorino.
This, though, is only the first step in the right direction, and I would like to make it abundantly clear that I am putting the case for our pressing for a truly European border protection force, for a European Corps of Border Guards with a basis in Community law and financed on a Community basis, for anything else would be nothing more than a hotchpotch.
As far as the proposed educational institution is concerned, I suggest that resources should be combined and duplication of work avoided by using the Police Academy, also proposed in the 1998 report and already up and running.
I believe this would get us on the right track.
Crime is organised internationally, and we have to, at long last, organise the combating of crime on a Community and cross-border basis.
