Mr President, the temporary confusion that may have reigned in Lebanon from time to time has obviously led to confusion in Parliament.
I wish to inform you that Amendments Nos 10 to 15 have not - contrary to what is stated - been tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but by Mr Belder, and that they should therefore be dealt with accordingly.
