Mr President, I would like to start by asking when a final decision will be taken on the seat of the Police Academy.
You may well be aware that Parliament, at my suggestion, proposed this Police Academy in 1998 and brought it into being.
We actually thought it should be sited in the border zone between the present-day EU and the candidate countries.
So the first question is: when is a decision going to be taken about the Academy's eventual location?
My second question is on border control, and it is this: what is your view of a specifically European legal basis for the control of Europe's borders?
And for my third point: is the managing body for integrated European border control, which you have just mentioned, to have a permanent base, and if so, where is it to be?
