Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen - even though there are, I believe, only two or three Members present at the moment - I wish to compliment you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for, in the now four years that I have been putting in-depth questions on a regular basis, nobody has managed to say so little in response to the question as you have just done.
My question was not about the whole range of things you talked about; on the contrary, it was very specific.
I am sorry to have to say this, but perhaps it is the custom in Greece to be ill-prepared to answer questions, although that is a custom unknown here in this House.
I will take the opportunity of putting the question to you once more: is the Council aware, in view of the accession deadline of January 2004, that the appointment of new Commissioners and the short-term appointment of new Members of the European Parliament will involve an unduly high cost to the taxpayer?
Be it in drachmas or euro, it is still money, and the taxpayers' money at that.
Did the Council take this into account at all when setting the date?
