Mr President, the OSCE has, as we know, been expelled.
Even though he had a visa, the German ex-minister Norbert Bl√ºm was sent back by the Russian authorities while he was on his way to Chechnya, and the delegation from this Parliament was barred from the Duma.
The Russians do not want anyone in the region.
What I want to ask you is this: Could the Council not put pressure on Russia, so that a delegation could travel to Chechnya as soon as possible, with the Commission represented by Commissioner Nielson or some other Commissioner, accompanied by members of Parliament and the Council, in order to gather information on the ground?
The Russians can get first-hand information in the European Union anywhere and at any time.
We want our Russian partners to accord us the same right of being able to inform ourselves where and as things are happening.
