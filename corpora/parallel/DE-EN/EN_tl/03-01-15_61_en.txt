Madam President, Commissioner, today is an immensely important day for the European cosmetics industry, ushering in a completely new era for cosmetic products, one for which a very large number of women have waited for a very long time.
I hope that products will come on to the market that will make beautiful young girls even more beautiful, but these are also very important to older women, who of course want to be attractive grandmothers to their grandchildren - and you try and find a grandmother who would dare tell her grandchildren that the cream she has just used, or that she uses on the children, has caused suffering to an immense number of animals.
Such a grandmother would be done for!
You see, celebrated and truly beautiful women have for a long time used products made without experimentation on animals.
Julia Roberts is one such; she loves natural cosmetics, preferring to use a rose cream from a German firm - and, ladies and gentlemen, as she is a celebrated American actress, perhaps that is sending an important message to the American cosmetics industry.
Do American actresses really have to resort to European products simply because they are not tested on animals here?
That attests to the inadequacy of the American cosmetics industry.
I love cosmetics.
I owe my hair colour to l'Or√©al, my perfume is by Dior, and my face cream comes from Great Britain - Englishwomen have such wonderful complexions.
In future, though, I will use far more cosmetics, and will be proposing Mrs Roth-Behrendt for honorary membership of all animal welfare organisations.
Today, though, I really would like to thank Europe's cosmetics industry most warmly for its cooperation, and I wish you a turnover of staggering dimensions.
May these new products earn you masses and masses of money.
