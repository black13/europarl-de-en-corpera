Madam President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, we are deeply perturbed by the developments in North Korea - a country without democracy, a country which allows its people to starve, and a country which nonetheless feels compelled to defend itself with a 'nuclear arsenal'.
It is very difficult for us to find a line here which expresses this deep concern about the situation in North Korea, yet does not escalate the conflict.
We do not want to create a similar situation to Iraq, but we do want to exert massive pressure on the North Korean government to focus on the needs of its people instead.
After all, this is not the first time we have turned our attention to this issue.
What is especially disappointing is that we have made numerous overtures to North Korea in a bid to work towards exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy, so that the country's few resources can genuinely flow into development.
This is why we want to make it clear yet again that we want to work for dialogue, and that we urge North Korea also to engage in dialogue with us.
We are pleased that the Americans too are prepared, in this instance at least, to engage in dialogue towards a peaceful solution and that talks are currently taking place.
We call on the Commission to continue the provision of humanitarian aid, despite these unpleasant and unacceptable political conditions, and to help the country's starving population.
With this in mind, Madam President, I think we are able to support the relevant resolution and express the hope that the United States and Europe will opt in this instance for a common approach in order to persuade North Korea to help its own people instead of posing a threat to the global community.
