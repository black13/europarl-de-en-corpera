Madam President, unfortunately, the situation in Chechnya really has not improved, despite the efforts to persuade Russia to adopt a rational course.
We have repeatedly stressed that the fight against terrorism is an entirely justified, indeed necessary, fight.
However, in the case of Chechnya - and this applies to similar situations in the context of Iraq and other regions as well - we have always stressed that bombs, military aggression and military measures are unsuitable as a means of resolving the issue of terrorism.
For this reason, we also need to make it very clear to Russia that we are profoundly disappointed that Russia - which is and should be a partner of the European Union - has failed to pursue a rational policy aimed at combating the causes of terrorism as well as terrorism itself.
We are deeply disappointed that people are being forced to return to this unsafe country and that even the expellees are being forcibly repatriated.
We believe that every option must be exhausted to achieve a peaceful solution here.
One such option could be the referendum if it takes place under objective conditions.
The people themselves should have a chance to express their views, and I believe that it would do Putin's and indeed Russia's reputation good if Russia could revert to, or basically establish for the first time, a rational and peaceful policy on Chechnya.
