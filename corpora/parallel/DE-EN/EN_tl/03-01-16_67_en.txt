Mr President, a few days ago, I visited our future member state, Cyprus, which is half-way between Athens and the Iraq-Kuwait border.
Lebanon is just a stone's throw away.
This shows how important Lebanon is for us in the European Union.
If we recall that Beirut was once the cultural and economic centre of the Eastern Mediterranean, this shows that we, as Europeans, have a real interest in a stable Lebanon.
I therefore greatly welcome the adoption of this agreement and believe that it will contribute substantially to stabilising a country which is very significant for Europe.
Its cultural diversity and its economic power, which is slowly developing once more, are important for us.
I think it is in the Europeans' interests to support Prime Minister Hariri's development drive, and as regards the Mediterranean-Europe Parliamentary Assembly, I believe it should be constituted in Beirut, in order to send out a signal that we recognise and support these efforts to overcome the challenges of terrorism and occupation which undoubtedly exist.
