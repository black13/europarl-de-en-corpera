Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad, but true, that if Iraq had nothing but dates, war against Baghdad would not even be on the agenda, even if the country were ruled over by a dictator.
If the Congo did not possess such an incredible wealth of natural resources, Africa would have far less in the way of problems.

Illegal actions must be punished, and commercial undertakings must be made to comply with a code of conduct.
