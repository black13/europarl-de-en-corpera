Madam President, Commissioner, may I quote something?
When the great surpluses in the 2000 Budget year came to light, the Budget Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, was quoted as saying, on 30 May 2001: 'Such a large surplus is an exception.
It means that, in the 2001 Budget year, the Member States will be required to remit markedly fewer own resources to the European Union, 81 billion etcetera instead of 90.9 billion.
I regard this as thoroughly good news for the Member States.'
End of quote.
We know, Commissioner, that this was not an exceptional occurrence.
The problem with this Budget surplus - for that is what we call it - is that the surpluses get bigger the longer the period lasts, or so we have been able to establish so far.
So there is something intrinsically wrong with the system.
It is not good news for anybody if we are not in a position to establish the reality of Europe's Budget.
I am not going to stand up in front of the taxpayers and say, 'I stand for a Budget totalling EUR 90 billion, provided that only EUR 80 billion is actually spent!'
That is not good budgeting!
It is not you alone that I blame, Commissioner.
I know that you are doing all that you can.
We too, as the budgetary authority, have to do something, as do the Member States, but I tell you this: no Parliament with any self-respect, and committed to Budget reality can sit by and watch these things happening.
In future, we will have to adjust the amounts and figures actually spent against what was originally planned, or the other way around.
In the long term, that is just not on.
In the long term, our citizens will not stand for it.
That is the crucial point about this discharge procedure for the year 2000.
As I have said, things got worse rather than better in 2001.
This is something on which we have to work together.
