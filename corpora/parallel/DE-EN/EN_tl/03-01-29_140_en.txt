Madam President, Commissioner, there are two issues arising from Mr Mulder's superb report that I would like to briefly address.
The first is that of recovery.
Here we see the sum of some EUR 3 billion mounting up, and the amount of money outstanding keeps increasing.
The recovery rate for 2000-2001 has been halved, down to some EUR 40 million.
Something is wrong here.
It is not working.
This is not right.
I believe I am right in saying that our recovery rate has not even reached 16 %.
My second point, Commissioner, has to do with the implementation of IACS in Greece and, in future, in the candidate countries.
This is a highly political question and not just one of whether or not maladministration has been brought to light there.
How are we to get the new Member States, soon to be joining us, to believe that they have to introduce an IACS system, if there are old Member States that have simply failed for years on end to implement one?
Politically speaking, that is just not on.
At some point they will say to you, 'Come back in ten years, Mr Fischler.
We will have introduced it by the time the Greeks do.'
And that, of course, as far as budgetary exactitude is concerned, is where we end up on very treacherous ice.
That is why it is important that we bring pressure to bear on the last Member State of the present Union, telling them that they must introduce this system, or else things will go wrong in connection with enlargement.
We know, for example, that in Poland, a major case of fraud has come to light in the run-up to the introduction of IACS, but I mention that only in passing.
Let me repeat: this is a highly political question, and one that cannot be reduced simply to maladministration.
Commissioner, it is one that we have to get to grips with together.
