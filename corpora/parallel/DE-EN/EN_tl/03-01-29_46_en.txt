Mr President, an overwhelming majority of the European public is opposed to a war in Iraq, and there is at present no occasion for such a war, other than the desire to seize Iraq's oil reserves.
A preventive war is nothing other than a deliberate and unilateral attack, something for which there is no justification in the absence of a UN mandate.
There are many who would be the losers in such a war.
The USA and Great Britain may perhaps be able to win the battles, but there is much more at stake.
One loser would be the civilised world, which is seeing a demonstration of how easy it is to displace and suspend international law, which was fought for over centuries, for the sake of a preventive war of aggression.
