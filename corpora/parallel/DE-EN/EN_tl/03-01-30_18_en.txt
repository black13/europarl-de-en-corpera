Mr President, Commissioner, protectionism is always cited as a reason for hunger in the world.
There is no doubt some truth in that, but trade does not fill stomachs.
Trade does not make people rich, either, ladies and gentlemen, at any rate not always both sides.
We must therefore ask how we trade.
If we are speaking of the debts of developing world countries, then the reason for those debts is unequal trade.
If we talk about people being hungry, we have to see that 80% of the hungry live in rural areas.
How are the hungry to export food to Europe when they have nothing to eat themselves?
We must ask who trades with Europe, in what goods and on what terms?
If we are trading and importing unprocessed foodstuffs that are then processed here and shipped back with export subsidies - which again distorts the terms of trade - that cannot help to solve the problem of hunger.
Europe is the biggest importer of food.
If we are asking how we can change the balance of trade in favour of the countries of the developing world, the only way is to pay for those products according to European terms.
Then we shall see economies developing.
If, however, we say we will exploit these countries with low prices, then we will destroy rural agriculture both here and there.
We must also see to it that land is made available to the people in these countries.
Land - in the sense of a class struggle - is not the whole of the problem, however; we must also ask the following questions: Who can work that land?
Who will take responsibility for it?
Who will teach the people how to work the land?
Who will allow people who are still in a subsistence economy to continue working in that subsistence economy and support them so they can pass their knowledge on to subsequent generations?
We ought to be addressing these questions and stop thinking we can help these people fill their stomachs simply by opening the borders.
