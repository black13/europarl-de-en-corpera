Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to confine my remarks to the subject of HIV/AIDS.
The World Population Report for 2002, which has just appeared, contains some shocking figures.
On average, 14 000 men, women and children die of this scourge every day.
It is now the commonest cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa.
To date, more than 60 million people worldwide have become infected and around 22 million of them have died.
Of the 40 million persons infected, 95% live in developing countries and nearly three quarters of them in Africa.
Out of 580 000 children below the age of 15 who have died from AIDS, 500 000 - almost 90% - lived in Africa.
I could continue with these statistics of misery indefinitely.
This catalogue of disasters is not only the sum of millions of human tragedies, however, but it is something that affects whole societies.
Life expectancy is falling, education is severely affected, agricultural output is declining, and the social and economic fabric is being eroded.
Plans for fighting HIV/AIDS must not be confined to the health aspects.
What is needed is an integral strategy with wide-ranging education and prevention campaigns.
Those who are already infected are entitled to the best possible treatment.
We carry some responsibility for that.
It is also up to us to provide the necessary knowledge, awareness and, of course, the necessary resources for prevention and treatment.
Because once a person is infected, that cannot be reversed.
In Sierra Leone I saw large posters on streets and squares with the blunt message: Aids kills! malaria and tuberculosis can be cured, AIDS cannot.
AIDS can be avoided, however, and that is worth every effort.
