Mr President, would you please ensure that the German version of Amendment No 9 is corrected?
It should not read 'Demokratiekomittee'.
That is an incorrect translation.
It is not intended to have a formalised character, but to remain an informal matter.
Therefore please amend the German text; the English is the correct text.
