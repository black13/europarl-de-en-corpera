Mr President, given that, despite worldwide protests, including protests from the European Parliament in December, a Tibetan was executed by order of a Chinese court four days ago and the same fate awaits a highly respected lama, I ask the House to agree to a motion going further than proposal No 8 from the Greens and Non-attached Members.
I propose adding the following to item 16:
'condemns in the strongest terms the execution of the Tibetan Lobsang Dhondup on 26 January for alleged political crimes and calls for the immediate setting aside of the death sentence on the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek'.
