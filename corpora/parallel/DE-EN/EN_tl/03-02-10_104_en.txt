Mr President, Commissioner, many developing world countries, along with many NGOs that are active around the globe, have demanded that responsibility for negotiations on agriculture should not be handed over to the WTO, a demand made also at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre.
There are good reasons for this.
We have to see that, in the past, although agricultural trade affected the world's agricultural production only to a minimal degree, its mechanisms, and the resultant price destruction had a profound effect not only on European countries, but also on those in the developing world.
Not only there, but also in Europe, its practice of dumping - in the form of export subsidies - destroyed or marginalised rural farming, bringing even greater hunger, forcing countries into a state of dependency, and causing debts to accumulate.
It is abundantly clear that trade does not fill stomachs, and if anyone does get rich from it, it is seldom if ever both the parties concerned.
It is therefore understandable that it is from these sources that highly sceptical questions are being asked about precisely what is to be negotiated at the WTO.
If the WTO negotiations are to be successful, then these mechanisms have to be done away with.
Care must be taken to give absolute priority to the right to produce basic foodstuffs, the right of countries to alleviate their own people's hunger, the right to cultivate the land and to treat the environment properly, along with the right to pass farms on to the next generation, thus maintaining rural farming, as well as the dismantling of destructive trade mechanisms, and of what we call world trade, which amounted to nothing more than export dumping.
This will enable us to develop in solidarity with people in the developing world, as well as with rural farming in Europe.
