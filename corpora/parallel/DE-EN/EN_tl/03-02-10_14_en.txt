Mr President, I do not want to oppose a debate on Iraq, but your proposal involves cancelling Question Time in order to have one, and I very much want to put my opposition to that on the record, taking as I do the view that every individual MEP's right to put questions - enshrined, indeed, in the treaties - is one of the most important parliamentary rights, second only to the right to vote on legislative texts.
We are becoming accustomed to important matters - it is always important matters - ever more frequently reducing or doing away with the time available for questions.
I ask you to put a stop to this practice.
Questions to the Council used to be held at 9 p.m., or from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., and for ten to fifteen years that worked perfectly, until the Council decided it was tired in the evenings and had to leave, so that Question Time was moved to the afternoon, and since then, Question Time has been cut back or moved, always to make room for other items of business.
I ask you to take a long-term approach to this problem, and to sort it out.
