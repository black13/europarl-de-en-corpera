Mr President, something extraordinary happened at the end of the last part-session here in Strasbourg, when, for the first time in many years, a written declaration was supported by an absolute majority of this House.
The statement, signed by 320 Members, demanded that, in future, the President of the Commission be elected by this House and no longer by the Council.
The breakthrough was achieved by the 313th and 314th signatures, those of Mr Bar√≥n Crespo and Mr Poettering, whom I congratulate on their last-minute courage.
It is my belief that it will strengthen our delegation to the Convention and help get it to accept this demand.
I wish to request that you forward this position - now an official one taken by Parliament - to Mr Giscard d'Estaing.
There is now some hope after all that it will dawn even on the President of the Convention that the head of Europe's executive has to be elected, not behind the Council's locked doors, but in this House, the people's open forum.
