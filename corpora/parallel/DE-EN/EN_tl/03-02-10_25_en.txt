Mr President, I know Mr Leinen to be an upright and honourable colleague.
It could well be, though, that, for a change, he had an ulterior motive for the form of words he had drafted and wanted to make my life difficult.
So I will take this opportunity to reiterate what I told Mr Leinen when he was guiding my hand to where I should sign.
I told him, 'If I sign, I do so not as Chairman of my group, but in my own name, modest person that I am.'
