Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have to start by clarifying whether patent laws are actually in place.
The copyright must be valid in the country in which it is sold; that is to say, it must have been registered and granted there.
Of course, things can always be manufactured in a country where there is no copyright on them, and there must be doubt as to whether, although they clearly bring benefits, the medicinal products have actually been patented in every country around the world; I really cannot imagine that they have been, but should that indeed be the case, it follows that compulsory licensing is the ideal approach when it comes to giving help quickly and in a consistent way.
We must ask ourselves, though, what happens if a compulsory licence is actually granted.
Will it solve all our problems?
What about prevention and complete recovery?
I think it self-evident that medicinal products need to be developed further, and that we have to focus primarily on creating incentives for research, rather than simply allowing ourselves to reduce the issue to patent rights and licences.
When, moreover, the copyright has expired and compulsory licences have been granted, we politicians, too, will bear responsibility for universities and industry having incentives to carry out research.
Another important step in the right direction would be to put out public invitations to tender several times in a given year, to safeguard the fundamental principle that sufferers from disease really should get the most modern and the most effective medication available.
For if, in future, research in this area of medicinal products, and the marketing of them, ceases to be a viable business proposition, we will be faced with the problem of being able to offer medicinal products that may well be cheap, but are not as effective as they might be.
What do we do then?
