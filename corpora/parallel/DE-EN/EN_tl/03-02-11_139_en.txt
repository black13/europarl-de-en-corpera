Mr President, I just wanted to tell Mr Lang that opening itself up to world markets has paid off for Chile.
Living standards have gone up, Chile's growth rate is far higher than that of other Latin American countries, and I just hope that this policy catches on in them as well.
What I would like to say to Commissioner Patten is that we are already engaged in active cooperation with members of Chile's parliament.
We had a meeting with them here in Strasbourg as long ago as the autumn - even before the Agreement was ratified - and had, surprisingly enough, an extraordinarily lively debate with the Chilean Congress and House of Deputies.
The problem we now have is not with the treaty.
The treaty is excellent, and I also wish to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his superlative report.
There is a treaty, but it must not be allowed to remain an empty form of words.
It has to be filled out - with something real.
Let me, by the way, remind you of the fact that we also have a scientific agreement with Chile.
If that is not to remain a mere formality, it too has to be filled out, and that is what I want to urge us to do.
Money is needed if that is to be done, but money is not the most important thing.
If that is to be done, the main thing we will need is will, the will of the European institutions, but also the will of enterprises and organisations.
What I hope at the end of the day is that this Agreement, whose objective is also very strongly political, will contribute to Latin America growing together, will contribute to stronger relationships between Europe and Latin America, and, above all, that cooperation with Chile will help to overcome the conflicts in certain Latin American countries, some of which conflicts - in Colombia, for example - are raging openly.
