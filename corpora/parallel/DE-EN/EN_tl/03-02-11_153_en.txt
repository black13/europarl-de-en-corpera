Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Austria is seriously testing Mr Jarzembowski's endurance today, but I crave his indulgence.
Ladies and gentlemen, crucial Austrian interests are at stake when we vote on the extension of the ecopoint system.
The objective, as formulated in the Transit Agreement, of a long-term and sustainable reduction in pollutants has not, as yet, been achieved.
In parts of the country from which I come, transit traffic has come to constitute an intolerable nuisance.
The proposals in Mr Caveri's report reduce the ecopoint system to an empty shell.
I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 18, which has been tabled by a number of Austrian Members from all parties and builds on the Danish Presidency's compromise proposal.
Even though I do not think this proposal goes far enough, it represents a middle way acceptable to all parties involved.
Austria does not simply want to keep its ecopoint system well into the distant future.
We, too, want a fair and, above all, sustainable solution to Europe's transport problems, but so long as one is not in sight, and pending the adoption of the new infrastructure cost directive, the transit issue requires a transitional arrangement that takes account of Austrian concerns.
