Mr President, the answer to Mr Wynn's first question, which related to the comparison between the figures incorporated in the Copenhagen resolutions and those tabulated in the Commission proposal, is that it has to be emphasised that all the negotiations in Copenhagen were conducted using 1999 prices, as we were guided by the Berlin resolutions, which were based on these.
Today, the Commission has also, at the same time, decided on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective in 2004 prices, so this results in a difference.
Let me point out that we have also included Cyprus in one of the tables.
As far as your second question is concerned, I would like to say by way of reply that the 1999 Inter-Institutional Agreement was an agreement between all three institutions and so the Council, too, has to adhere to it.
