Mr President, the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement also laid down the maximum by which the financial framework could be increased in the event of enlargement, and, to that extent, amounted to a limitation.
It was also the limitation within which the Commission proposal was drafted and the negotiations with the candidate countries were held.
I would, though, like to re-emphasise the fact that the judicial issue is of crucial importance as regards the significance of the approval of the accession treaties with their figures, as against the negotiations on the Inter-Institutional Agreement.
This is something to which we will have to give very careful attention in our discussion in next week's trilogue.
What has to be said about Turkey is that the Council has this year also adopted the proposal that Turkey should be included in category 7, thus becoming entitled to pre-accession aid.
We have a sort of pre-accession strategy where Turkey is concerned, and the legal basis on which category 4 aid - another very 'internal' debate - is paid includes precisely this expression, so that no new legal basis would be required to transfer Turkey - financially speaking - from category 4 to category 7.
Further to your question on the Balkans, I have this to say.
As has, this year, emerged from many reports in the press, Croatia has decided to apply for membership of the EU.
It is now for the Council to consider what happens next; it will probably ask the Commission to examine the matter, with which request the Commission will of course comply.
It is not for us, at present, to consider whether another state is to be included in category 7.
I would, though, again like to point out that the Commission is proposing that category 7 be left unchanged and that adjustments be made to the financial programme for categories 1 and 2, covering agriculture, the Structural Funds, internal policies and administration to take account of enlargement.
