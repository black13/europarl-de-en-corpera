Mr President, I will take Mr Garriga Polledo's question on heading 4 first.
As you know, heading 4 was not on the agenda in Copenhagen, and as regards heading 3, there was the Commission proposal on the framework, as laid down in the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement, and there were the negotiations on the specific programmes that are now being brought in.
As I said, they include the Schengen facility as well as the programme - which I consider to be of the utmost importance - to provide further help to build effective administrations, and the programme for decommissioning nuclear power stations.
Turning now to Mr Mulder's question about the monetary reserve, a decision was made in 1999 - and this is also laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement - to abolish the monetary reserve, which is why it no longer exists.
As far as the Guarantee Fund is concerned, the situation is that the Guarantee Fund has also had to be used to guarantee loans to the accession countries and for example for various EIB programmes.
Once the accession countries are Member States it will no longer be necessary to make the relevant guarantees available in the budget.
In other words, after enlargement the Guarantee Fund will have more scope to support loans to third countries.
