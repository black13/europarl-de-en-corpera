Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the decision in principle to ban advertising for a product that is legally traded raises the question of what will happen in the future in competition law.
If further decisions are taken here to ban advertising for sweets, cars and other categories of products, we will be faced with a problem with the market economy itself.
You see, although these products are legal, it is not permitted to advertise them.
What impact do you think this will have on other sectors - alcohol, for example - which also make a substantial contribution to financing motor racing, for example?
