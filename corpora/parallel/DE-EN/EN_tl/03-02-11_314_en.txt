Mr President, it is my pleasure to address the 13 Members who seem unable to drag themselves away from this place and particularly the one lady who still remains to listen to us.
Five minutes before the witching hour we have a topic that is obviously pulling the crowds in, or I might put it this way: we know that we want Europe and need it, so please allow me to use the 90 seconds that I have left to talk about how we can achieve it.
Have a go, ladies and gentlemen, at using what we are debating here.
Go on, click on a website - the Council's, say - go straight to where it says 'Access to documents' and click.
What happens?
Nothing.
Click again.
What happens?
Nothing.
We say to our dear friends in the Council and our dear friends in the Commission - whose web site looks like something out of 'The White Horse', which was a cult operetta in Fifties' Austria - use the money that we could save by for example not holding meetings like this in this form and spend EUR 50 000, 60 000 or 100 000 on producing an up-to-date website that is more use than what is there at the moment.
You would actually be doing voters a service.
They could also get the search functions to work.
If these very banal things are done then we can - I think - consider what we might use this new eEurope for, incorporating, for example, tools to survey public opinion.
In the meantime it is also possible to envisage holding Europe-wide referendums with minimal effort and at negligible expense.
All of this must always be seen on the basis of my ceterum censeo - there can be no democracy without transparency and a well-used Internet is a very, very good way of achieving this.
