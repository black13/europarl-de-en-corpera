Mr President, for the purpose of correction, I refer to Amendment No 17, which amended Mr Vitorino's original draft to indicate that application may be made by anyone who 'is legally present or already present there and has entered legally in order to reside there.'
The justification states that 'individuals who are illegally present in the country should, however, also be offered the opportunity' to obtain a contract of employment.
That means that the application is to be made on the basis of illegality; even your own justification says so.
