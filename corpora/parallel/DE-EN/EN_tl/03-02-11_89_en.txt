Mr President, there are, very confusingly, a large number of translations of item 14.
It is apparent from its context that it is about the United Nations rather than the United States, and that must be made clear.
Neither the English nor the German translations get it right; you have to go back to the Spanish version, which makes it perfectly clear that it is the United Nations that is meant, the subject being international organisations.
That has to be borne in mind, and it is perhaps important as we come to the vote.
