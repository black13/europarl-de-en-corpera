Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report.
In my own country, the issue of the White Paper on Transport is a matter for vigorous debate.
The White Paper on European transport policy points in the right direction, towards the opening-up of the railway market, the revision of the guidelines and of the TENs, and towards taking enlargement - which is almost upon us - into account in the area of transport.
One of the White Paper's proposals is of enormous importance in view of something currently under discussion - the extension of the Austrian ecopoint system.
A proposal for a framework directive to lay down the principles on which charges for the use of the infrastructure were to be imposed on all cross-border carriers was to have been presented as recently as 2002, yet, even today, we wait in vain for this directive on transport infrastructure costs, which is intended to at last facilitate a cross-subsidy, along Swiss lines, for the benefit of environmentally friendly means of transport and to pave the way for the transfer of traffic from road to rail.
Such a transport infrastructure costs directive will be a criterion against which our credibility and the much-invoked European transport policy can be judged.
We need it urgently!
