Mr President, after both the First and Second World Wars, people demanded 'No More War!', and the international legislation drawn up in order to give this demand tangible form expressly incorporated a clearly defined ban on the use of force, making the use of it subordinate to the United Nations.
They expressly rejected any preventive war of aggression without United Nations approval.
Any preventive strike against Iraq on the part of America and Great Britain would, without a doubt, be in breach of international law, and its consequences for the Middle East, for the Arab world, but also for the world community as a whole, would be incalculable.
If one or more states arrogate to themselves the pre-eminent right to use force and take the law into their own hands, that amounts to unmitigated private warfare, the so-called law of the strong, one of the characteristics of which is that it breeds more private warfare.
Looking at things from this angle, the European Union must do everything possible to avert a unilateral war of aggression.
Europe's peoples have long known this, and now it is time for European politics to grasp it.
