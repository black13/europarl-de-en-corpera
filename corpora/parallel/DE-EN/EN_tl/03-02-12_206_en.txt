Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the area of freedom, security and justice is something that many Members of this House still imagine to be a highly advanced position adopted by a European Union that offers its citizens the greatest possible degree of freedom and protection from the State.
It is not only in the last year that events have proved the opposite to be the case: repressive measures are enjoying a boom, with the European Union and its Member States forcing through controls on the EU's external borders no less than in its interior.
On top of that, there is increased monitoring of personal data and of free communication.
Biometric means are being used to evacuate privacy of any meaning.
Finally, the EU's racist character is enhanced still further by the many laws aimed at so-called 'foreigners', with the introduction of the Eurodac system and the development of the Schengen Information System representing only the tip of the iceberg.
This security means, then, the greatest possible security for the State, whereas freedom would require a quite different policy - some would call it a more mature one - backing effective data protection, the demolition of Fortress Europe and the repeal of all racist special laws, including those on the right to citizenship.
Such, though, is not the case.
What we are building here is a Union of state security, control and monitoring.
Baroness Ludford's Liberalism, does not, unfortunately, extend to addressing any of these points in her question.
