Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez for this report.
Our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can support this report in its entirety and without reservation.
Whilst I think it very much something to be welcomed that we at last have a commitment to woodland at European level, I share Mrs Figueiredo's view that we have to try to concentrate more on biodiversity, changes in climate and the database for monitoring purposes, and that perhaps less prominence should be given to forest fires.
We must be clear in our own minds about one thing: this, too, is a matter of environmental concern, and so we should try to give this important step our support.
We hope that this report can be adopted as soon as possible and will enjoy broad support in Parliament as early as first reading stage, so that we can start to implement this programme as soon as possible and so that the Member States have the resources to at last implement this programme in a practical way.
Today marks the first occasion on which I have not needed to make use of all my speaking time, as I believe that we all agree that what matters is that we assign greater importance to European woodland, seeing it as an essential habitat and making it clear that changes in climate have to be monitored, and that the Commission's approach has to be widened a great deal to take account of biodiversity.
We therefore give the report our full support and hope that the Member States will be able to get down to work as soon as possible.
My thanks again to all those who have given their assistance.
