Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, what makes the forthcoming Spring Summit so crucial in terms of political psychology is the fact that the times in which we live are not at all rosy.
The message from this summit must be one of confidence, because Europe's economy and hence growth and employment, will not be got moving if such confidence in the EU Member States' political leadership is not created or, where it exists, improved.
I do think, however, that it is not just confidence in governments that matters, but that it is also significant that European business is at last affirming its responsibility for contributing towards growth, investment, and employment.
The state alone cannot create the jobs that Europe needs in order to really develop its productivity and also in order to become the region of the world best able to face the future.
So it is to the Greek Presidency of the Council that I am appealing for a continued campaign against unfair fiscal competition and for us to be enabled at last to blockade all the tax havens and not let matters rest with the first breakthrough we achieve on the fiscal package, so that everyone can help put the Member States in a better position as regards the receipts on which their ability to make investments depends.
It is at this point that I would like, again, to appeal to the private business sector to step up private investment.
Not only is there too little public investment, but the private sector also invests too little, and it is only partnership between the two that will enable Europe to evade the self-fulfilling prophecy that our weak growth - or, in certain states, stagflation - will be followed by recession, which is something Europe can do without.
It is because our periods of growth are far too weak that this appeal is addressed to the Greek Presidency of the Council, along with the appeal to the Commission and the Council for improved cooperation between the institutions.
The European Parliament, as co-legislator, is prompt in doing its work, and it would be a good thing if the Council could keep up with us.
