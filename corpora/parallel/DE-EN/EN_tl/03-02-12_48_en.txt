Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have all stressed how especially important the Spring Summit is in view of flagging growth, the internal market not yet being complete and the Lisbon objectives becoming ever more nebulous and people having less and less confidence in them.
I see the Lisbon strategy as being Europe's response to globalisation.
The Lisbon strategy is our regulatory framework, because it links the market to social responsibility and the sustainability of the environment, which is how this regulatory model distinguishes us from the United States and from other continents.
What is known as the eco-social market economy is the European regulatory model.
We must stop apportioning blame.
We must make it clear where responsibilities lie - who is responsible for meeting what target and by when.
We need definite targets rather than woolly statements.
In which areas do we want to be Number One and by what date?
Who has to achieve what subsidiary goal and by when so that the jointly determined European objectives might be fulfilled?
What the Spring Summit should do is specify how the Lisbon objectives are to be broken down country by country, and have these objectives incorporated in every statement made by governments and every labour convention entered into by them.
There is no contradiction between the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon strategy; on the contrary, without the Pact, the Lisbon strategy could not be fulfilled.
This means that we have to keep on ensuring that the internal market becomes a true internal market and that sufficient account is taken of small and medium-sized businesses' potential as the foundation of Europe's economic structure and a source of new employment.
