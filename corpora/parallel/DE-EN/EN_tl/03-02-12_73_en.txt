I am glad that the European Community has succeeded in concluding an association agreement with Chile.
It is particularly important in the wine sector to establish clear rules on such important areas as the recognition of designations of origin and production methods.
Among other things, the agreement includes a comprehensive list of all European designations of origin to be protected in Chile as soon as the agreement enters into force.
This is a significant achievement in view of the fact that, for example, no sparkling wine will be allowed to be sold in Chile under the name of 'champagne', even if the true origin is stated or if 'm√©thode champenoise' appears on the label instead of 'Champagne'.
The agreement also prevents trademarks from circumventing the law on designations of origin, so that, for example, the trademark 'Moselle' will lapse at the end of a five-year transitional period for export purposes, as the wine contained in the bottle is not from the Moselle region and the consumer could thereby be deceived.
I do, however, regret the fact that various traditional European terms such as 'Chateau', 'Clos' or Grand Cru' will continue to be permitted in Chile and will, indeed, be legalised internationally.
Such designations could give consumers the wrong idea about the wine's true origin, all the more so as the words are French rather than Spanish.
