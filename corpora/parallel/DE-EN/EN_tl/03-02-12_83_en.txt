Mr President, on behalf of our group, I wish to make a declaration of vote on the Caveri report.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regrets the fact that, eight years after Austria's accession to the European Union, no solution satisfactory to all parties - on economic as much as on ecological grounds - has yet been found to the problem of goods transport through the Austrian Alps.
In the hope of a speedy solution and of greater planning security, acknowledging the positive efforts of the Danish and Greek Council presidencies, we call upon the Council to act upon the mandate of the Laeken and Copenhagen European Councils by promptly presenting a Common Position that will speed up the decision-making process involved in the joint enactment by the Council and Parliament of a solution accepted by all the parties involved.
I wish to thank the interpreters for their excellent translation of what was far from being a straightforward text.
