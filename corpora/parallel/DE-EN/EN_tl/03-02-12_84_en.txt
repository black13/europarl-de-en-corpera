Mr President, whilst I otherwise hold Mr Caveri in high esteem, I wish to make it known that I have voted against his report.
I believe that it would, in this case, have been better for Parliament to have taken the Danish compromise into account and not gone beyond it.
It is not, in my view, very helpful to tie oneself down to a new line.
I trust that the Council will again do as Mr Poettering, the leader of our group, has just suggested, and get to work on finding a common solution.
The fact of the matter is that even the rule on category 4 HGVs is not entirely without its problematic aspects, as it means that the environment in the affected areas will be subjected to new nuisances.
We have to provide help here as a matter of urgency, and there needs to be greater understanding of this area, which is such a sensitive one.
