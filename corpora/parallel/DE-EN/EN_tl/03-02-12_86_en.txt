Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to inform the House that my group and I have rejected the report, and explain why we have done so.
As I said yesterday, Austria does not want to keep its ecopoint system for ever; what we want is a fair and sustainable solution to Europe's transport problems.
For as long as such a thing is not in sight - and, above all else, for as long as the new transport infrastructure directive is not adopted - the transit issue needs to be dealt with by acceptable transitional rules.
It is for this reason that we have not approved today's Caveri report.
We have supported Amendments Nos 19, 20 and 21, as they call for the retention of the ecopoint system and an upper limit for the number of journeys by HGVs until such time as a sustainable solution to the problems of the whole of the Alpine region enters into force.
I see the failure to even vote on Amendment No 18, which is based on the Danish compromise, as sending a very poor message to the people of Austria.
