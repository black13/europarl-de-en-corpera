Mr President, the fact is that it was only at the weekend that a note reached me; it dates back to last year and I am utterly astonished by it.
The reason for my astonishment is that this note had not previously come to light following the many questions we had put to the Commission, particularly concerning the book-keeping and accounts, and because it is obviously not through the Commission that it has found its way to me.
I do not know whether other Members have had a copy, and have not, as yet, had the chance to seek further information about this.
For now, though, that is of secondary importance.
What is important, though, is the fact - which I note with amazement - that the Director-General of internal audit is due to join us for the meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. today.
I know nothing about this, though, and he has not even been invited.
I have tried to reach him by phone in order to get some information about this note, but have not, for the moment, been able to do so, as he was in a meeting.
Discharge will not, of course, be under discussion at this mini-conference - that will be dealt with in plenary in April - but this is, of course, vitally important right now.
In eight days' time, the committee will have to vote on what we are going to do about giving discharge, and on what proposals we are going to put to plenary.
This really does make it a matter of urgency that we should have information about this.
I really do not know any more when I am meant to do this if we are to be able to deal with this properly in committee.
Although we will, self-evidently, be discussing it this evening, it is already my view that we should know what is going on when such a thing lands on the table, and that we should discuss it among ourselves.
