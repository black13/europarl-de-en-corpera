Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mrs Ayuso Gonz√°lez for her hard work as rapporteur for this directive.
A directive on increasing the use of biofuels is something that I can only welcome, but I do regret the fact that the current situation falls well short of my expectations.
It is precisely by increasing the use of biomass that we can contribute both to securing farmers' income and creating new jobs in the current and enlarged Europe as well as to enhancing the multifunctional role of the countryside.
In addition, such an initiative meets the requirement of sustainability, which is so important from the point of view of protecting the environment.
In the light of all this, the compromise proposals on the table are rather disappointing and reflect a definite dilution of the original demands, because all that is left of the original obligation to blend - as we might have expected - are reference values.
It would actually have been very pleasing if the Austrian model, which makes it mandatory for more biomass to be used, could have served as a model for Europe as a whole.
Finally, I have to note that unfortunately the final paper contains too few incentives for a more efficient use of biofuels.
Once again the discrepancies between the interests of the fossil fuel industry and farming are clear for all to see.
Given the finite nature of oil deposits and bearing in mind the Kyoto targets, we can only hope for the future that this is not a closed book, that further efforts will be made to push up the use of biofuels and that this really is just the first step in the right direction, if all of us really do feel a credible and serious responsibility for providing future generations with a secure foundation on which to live.
