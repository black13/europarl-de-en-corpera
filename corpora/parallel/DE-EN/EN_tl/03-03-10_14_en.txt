Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I always admire the commitment that the esteemed Mr Cohn-Bendit brings to what he has to say here, I have to ask that we stick to logic and bear in mind the way this issue has historically developed in this House.
After all, Wednesday's debate, which will be a thorough one, will not be the first we have had on the terrible way the Iraq crisis is developing, and our group has always taken a stand in favour of action within the bounds set by the international community.
I say this so that this may not be in doubt.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, though, knows as well as any other Member of this House that we voted on this in December.
There is now no occasion for us to have a new vote every time we meet here in order to introduce new emphases; on the contrary, Parliament's position is unambiguous, as is that of our Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, and I believe that the other groups - most of them, at any rate - want this House's position, once decided upon, to be binding, and for us not to have to make much ado about exchanging views every time.
On Wednesday, everyone will have the opportunity to give an opinion, and I recommend that we do so with the gravity and seriousness of purpose that this crisis merits.
That is why we oppose a new resolution.
