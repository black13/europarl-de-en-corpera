Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I first say as an aside that, with all due respect, you cannot blame the weather for everything.
In the end, we too have had our part to play in the fact that cod stocks are now at this catastrophic minimum level of one third, that is 50 000 tonnes.
Let us not forget it!
My main comment, however, is as follows: I have taken over - foolishly, I am almost tempted to add - as the Committee on Fisheries' rapporteur for the 2004 Budget.
The basis for this work is of course the current budget for 2003, a prominent feature of which is the reform of the CFP and its requirements.
No provision is made in the individual budget lines for disasters, however, which means that we are not prepared for them, either in the Member States or in the European Parliament.
Generous interpretation of the rules on flexibility and the reserve, as was still possible in the case of Morocco, is no longer an option.
It is primarily the Member States that are having to pick up the bill for the consequences of the Prestige disaster off the coast of Galicia and the 45% reduction in the catch quota for cod.
Their policy - the policy of the Member States - is also in need of reform.
However we here in Parliament need to help the fishermen today.
It is still a fact that it is not pity or greed that motivates our actions here in Parliament, but the knowledge of the hardship being suffered by our coastal communities, which in addition have to earn their daily bread under the most difficult of conditions.
We all know that in the peripheral areas of our prosperous EU there is usually no alternative work available.
We, the EU, are a community based on solidarity and we have to help.
But how?
At times like this a great deal of good will and assertiveness is needed in this House, particularly in the Committee on Budgets, but also in the Commission and crucially - as I have said - in the Member States.
Please take note!
