Mr President, I would like to ask a question.
Mr Fischler, in the light of all of these disasters - and I am sure that this will not be the last - should we not consider introducing something along the lines of a disaster fund - I cannot think what else to call it - of around a cent for every fish fin, so that we can actually offer help in those cases when it is really necessary?
You see, we also have to be able to give help spontaneously.
Recently the idea was floated of distributing the funds over several years, if we do not get the money now, but of course that would not help the fishermen either.
Is this something that the Commission might also consider?
