Mr President, Mrs Langenhagen, I am quite happy to reflect on these matters in more detail with the Committee on Fisheries.
Even at this stage I should just like to point out though that we are going to have to give this very careful thought because, as you yourself know, the funds available under the fisheries structural fund are very limited.
If we are now to create a reserve for emergencies from the outset then obviously that money is not going to be available for the normal programme, which could ultimately mean that we leave money unutilised, because we can hopefully assume that in the future we will no longer have to deal with a series of disasters, but on the contrary that with the help of these recovery plans we will have things under control.
We will be addressing this issue in great detail during the course of this year: proposals will also be made to Parliament for additional recovery plans.
But as I have said, this is certainly something that it will be worth discussing in more detail and I am happy to do so.
Perhaps we might also have an informal debate on this in the Committee on Fisheries, say on the basis of a non-paper of some kind.
