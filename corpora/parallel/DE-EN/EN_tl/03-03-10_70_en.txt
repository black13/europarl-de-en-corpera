Mr President, I can identify with the criticisms and fears that have been referred to, among them the lack of Parliamentary control, the need for improvements in information policy, and transparency.
With all due respect, Commissioner, there are still, between confidentiality and absolute transparency, many practicable ways ahead.
This is a reproach directed at the Member States and also at the Commission.
Rather than providing elucidation about the various demands or the degree of willingness to deregulate, the documents available tend to be more of a playground for those who interpret these things.
Commissioner Lamy, you began with a report full of atmosphere, propagandising for the European model, and referring to the interest of developing countries.
I would have liked it if Parliament, in its resolution, were to have more to say about the developing countries.
What you said at the outset about privatisation, though, is not something that this House should accept without demur.
A chain of consequences follows if you give people what they want.
I do not want Brussels to be the venue for a debate on a liberalisation introduced to Europe through a back door called GATS.
Both my esteemed colleague Mrs Fraisse and Mrs Hieronymi have already voiced the most important things about art and culture, matters which are of political concern to me as well.
It is perhaps enough for me to say that it is to you that we owe the distinction between working defensively and working offensively.
Thank you very much for the report you have put before us today.
It is now for us to move into the second stage, taking the offensive in the same way and joining as one in this debate, using every possible means of action available to us in order to create an international and binding instrument to protect and promote cultural diversity.
