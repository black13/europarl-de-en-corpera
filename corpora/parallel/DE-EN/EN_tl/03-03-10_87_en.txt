Madam President, Commissioner, I get the impression that the EU's way of conducting negotiations is listing to one side.
It is one-sided in being guided by economic interests, which is actually out of the question.
The Treaties require us to make sustainable development the model for all our policies, which means that we cannot carry out liberalisation without at the same time negotiating social standards and environmental norms.
This leads me to form the impression in my mind that you are actually in violation of Article 6 of the Treaty.
It is especially when one is presenting demands for liberalisation of water to seventy-two of this planet's states that one is negating the very social and ecological conditions that prevail locally.
It is here that the principle of sustainable development must hold undoubted sway, rather than the economic considerations inherent in the ability to provide water if at all possible in the interests of shareholders.
Decisions as to how to organise the water supply have to be taken on a local basis; they must remain with local politicians and must not be taken in response to external pressure.
The EU must not stoke up the fight for the blue gold.
