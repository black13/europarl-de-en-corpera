Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mann observed during the discussions in committee that his report had not enjoyed the support to which he had previously been accustomed.
This of course is partly due to a number of demands which have a very specific national character and which do not really belong in the European debate at all.
I support the intention expressed in his report, which is that the guidelines should concentrate on what is essential and that annual reports should also continue to be produced in future.
Also in terms of the objectives, I believe that we have achieved broad consensus, especially as regards flexibility on the labour markets, without subjecting the workforce - the employees - to any unnecessary dismantling of their social protection.
The path towards this goal is undoubtedly a matter of debate.
Fresh ideas would be all well and good, Mr Pronk, but in some areas, we can detect very clear retrograde steps, starting with the involvement of the national parliaments.
Mr Mann has called for the national parliaments to be allowed to exercise greater control, yet we agreed some time ago that they will not only exercise control but will participate through the framework of legislation - which goes much further.
Indeed, Sweden and Denmark have already applied this in principle.
Moreover, Mr Mann calls for implementation of the national further training plans to be pushed through.
Here too, we agreed that there should be legislation imposing a binding obligation and setting out workers' rights to further training.
Furthermore - and this, of course, is where we cannot agree with him - he calls for indiscriminate tax cuts and wage subsidies.
These are not fresh ideas.
They are completely obsolete.
Nor do they promote the entrepreneurial creativity that we urgently need.
