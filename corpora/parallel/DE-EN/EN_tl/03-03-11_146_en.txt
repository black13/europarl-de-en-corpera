Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we will all - institutions and politicians alike - have to review and reshape our communication strategies, priorities and working methods, but also our decision-making and opinion-forming processes in the light of the European Union's enlargement to what will probably be more than 30 states - if we include the Balkan countries - but also in the light of the political challenges which are being set for us and which we are setting ourselves.
Against this background, we welcome the fact that the ECB has put forward a proposal unanimously.
We also welcome the fact that a clear political message has been sent that the ECB should in future regulate its decision-making mechanisms itself, and that we do not want to make any special provisions here.
There is absolutely no reason why this decision should be adopted hastily, as the rapporteur has already pointed out.
We can continue in familiar fashion and prepare a fundamental reform with the next Intergovernmental Conference.
The fundamental reform which is necessary, and which we intend, differs in one key respect.
We say: everyone should remain on board; there should be no rotation principle; in a common Europe, everyone should have a say in the ECB.
The solution is not rotation but weighting.
This weighting could be based on the weighting in the Council, but must build primarily on economic and financial market policy parameters.
Rather than more complexity, we want greater transparency.
We do not want new forms of discrimination, but more integration and therefore greater clarity for the public.
Take us up on our offer, which is to prepare a comprehensive reform instead of an over-hasty short-term solution!
