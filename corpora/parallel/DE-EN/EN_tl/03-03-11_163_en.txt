Mr President, the Commissioner obviously wanted to say something just now, and perhaps I can ask him a question at the same time.
I fully endorse the proposals that Mr Prodi has outlined here.
What would interest me is this: what will be the institutional framework for all this?
You mentioned the financial instruments and the treaties with neighbouring countries.
However, my question to the President or the Commissioner is this: are any specific institutional arrangements required?
Theoretically, after all, there is still the European Conference.
There are various possibilities.
In connection with the Mediterranean region, we have discussed the option of establishing closer parliamentary cooperation as well.
We must not leave this in abeyance, and we must also ensure that the responsibility is clarified within the Commission, for what we are dealing with here, really, is an interim phase between normal traditional foreign policy and integration in the European Union.
In my view, this interim phase must be defined very precisely, and the Commission should submit specific proposals to deal with it, setting out detailed arrangements and describing which institutions are involved.
Will the European Conference be revived?
Will there be specific responsibility within the Commission for this area of cooperation?
Will it remain with Commissioner Patten?
These are the questions that interest me.
Perhaps you could explain the situation in more detail.
