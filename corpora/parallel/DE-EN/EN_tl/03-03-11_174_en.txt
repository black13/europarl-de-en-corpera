Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has now put forward a proposal for us to discuss, on whether there are alternative options to full membership of the European Union.
This will undoubtedly be a key issue for the future after enlargement and the accession of ten new countries.
I would like to ask two questions.
Firstly, I am not altogether clear whether what is being proposed is a flexible system of bilateral relations between the EU and the various countries, or a multilateral approach - a kind of a 'European Economic Area plus'.
I think this is an important point.
My second question relates to the Balkans.
I know that a highly differentiated approach is essential when considering the Balkan countries and that some of them will be able to join the European Union earlier than others.
However, the other countries will still need a long period of internal development.
It would therefore be wrong not to include them in a strategy of this kind, for during the interim period - which could last a long time - they could be included in this network as well.
Perhaps the Commission could review this position once again.
