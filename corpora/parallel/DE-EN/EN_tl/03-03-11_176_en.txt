Mr President, our discussions have focussed exclusively on the broad outlines, and, whilst these are, of course, very important, the problems lie in the detail.
One of the central issues in the neighbouring countries is what will happen at the borders.
Will there be new, decentralised instruments to facilitate practical cross-border cooperation?
Will the border arrangements be eased, or will the borders lead to a real and tangible division by separating ethnic groups and severing existing relations?
What interests me is what the Commission's strategy says about this issue.
What form will the financial instrument take?
Will it be a centralised instrument, as is currently the case, with the problems that we have, or will it be a decentralised instrument?
