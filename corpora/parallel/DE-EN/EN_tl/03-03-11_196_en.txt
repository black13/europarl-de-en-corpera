Mr Alyssandrakis, I do not agree with you that Cyprus' accession, in the form currently proposed, will mean a de jure division of the island.
The protocol that I have already mentioned several times makes it absolutely clear that Community law will not be applied in those parts of Cyprus over which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus cannot exert effective control.
But this is not tantamount to recognising two Cypriot states.
Like the rest of the international community, we still regard the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the representative of the whole of Cyprus, as its only legitimate representative under international law.
From a purely legal point of view, the whole of Cyprus will become a Member of the European Union.
In practice, Community law will not be able to be applied in part of the territory of Cyprus for as long as there is no political solution.
Once there is a political solution - whenever this may be - all that will be required will be a unanimous decision by the Council and the whole of Cyprus will be a Member, both de jure and de facto.
We would not need to hold further negotiations.
Neither would another Treaty be required, or renewed ratification.
All of these matters are settled in the protocol, which is part of the Act of Accession.
What can the Commission do to improve the situation?
I think the most important thing that we can do is to continue to cooperate intensively with Turkey, to continue to use all of the means at our disposal to encourage Turkey to drive forward political, economic and social reforms and to meet the political accession criteria.
That is the only thing that we can do.
At the end of the day it is also the only thing that will help.
