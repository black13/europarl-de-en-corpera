Mr President, I would ask you to call my question again, and for the following reason: I was here at 5.30 p.m. and the debate was still in full swing.
I then went to another meeting.
As soon as I saw that Question Time was starting and Mr Prodi had finished speaking I rushed here from that meeting, but the first part - which according to our documents was supposed to last 30 minutes - was already over.
I really would therefore crave your indulgence.
In such cases it is extremely difficult, even for someone like myself who endeavours to attend Question Time on every occasion, to be here on the dot ready for this procedure.
I would therefore ask you to call my question again.
