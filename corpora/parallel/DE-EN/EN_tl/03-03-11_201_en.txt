Mr President, I just wanted to clarify three points: firstly, Commissioner Verheugen is still here.
Secondly - and this is also an important point - you made an exception at the last part-session.
I will check in the Minutes to see which Member was concerned.
I have a very clear recollection of this precedent being set.
Thirdly, I should like to say that I would request that Question Time begin, as in previous years, at 5.30 p.m. precisely, regardless of what is happening in plenary.
That was the practice in this House for almost 20 years and it was something that we could rely on.
But being sloppy about the start time, only then to be strict when applying this rule, and extreme when interpreting it, is not something that I can accept.
Either you are liberal in both cases or strict in both cases!
