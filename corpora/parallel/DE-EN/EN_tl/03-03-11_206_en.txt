Mr President, Mr Crowley, the point you raise in your oral question corresponds exactly to the subject of a formal complaint that has been submitted to us.
The formal complaint came from the Media Observatory Czech Republic, and has been endorsed by the company Media Print & Kappa Pressegrosso.
It stated that alleged violations of EC competition law had been observed in the Czech Republic.
Both I myself, and the EU delegation in Prague, have also had this matter drawn to our attention in conversations with the chairman of the Media Observatory Czech Republic.
And I can tell you that immediately afterwards I had the opportunity to raise this issue with the Czech Government at the very highest level.
For the time being, the Commission is of the opinion that it is first and foremost the Czech competition authorities and courts that are responsible for the matter, because it mainly concerns distortions of competition on the Czech market in print media.
Nevertheless, the Commission services have contacted the Czech competition supervision authorities.
The Czech supervision authorities are currently examining the case and recently issued a temporary order against the company Prvni Novinova Spolecnost and its parent company for possible violations of the Czech competition rules.
I hope I pronounced that correctly.
I am not quite sure.
Czech is a difficult language!
Implementation of legislative provisions by the Czech competition authorities is being closely monitored in the run-up to accession, and with this in mind the Commission will continue to observe progress on this case.
