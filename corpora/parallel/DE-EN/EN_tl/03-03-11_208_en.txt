Mr Crowley, the different roles that we play here explain our different accounts of the situation.
As a Member of Parliament, you are of course free to express a political judgment.
As a Member of the Commission, I obviously cannot make a political assessment of a case when the legal proceedings are not yet concluded.
You will understand this and you would certainly object - and rightly so - if the Commission were to express an opinion in other cases that are sub judice and where the proceedings have not yet been concluded.
I must therefore say that I simply do not know today whether we do in fact have a breach of competition law on our hands.
The question of whether competition law has been violated is being investigated at this very moment by the Czech authorities, and the Commission services are in contact with the Czech authorities because it is our job to ensure that in the pre-accession phase the relevant instruments are correctly applied and the relevant procedures adhered to.
That is the connection.
Incidentally, if this had happened after accession it would not have made any difference.
There is no doubt that this is a case for the national competition authorities and not for the European competition authorities because it is only the domestic Czech market that is affected by this dispute.
The Commission is therefore already doing what you asked me to do at the end of your statement.
We are acting on this matter.
I can even go a step further and say that given that this is about media pluralism and given that media pluralism plays a significant role in promoting democracy in a country, the Commission is also taking this case particularly seriously.
