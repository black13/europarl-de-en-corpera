Mr President, Mrs Van Lancker, you have clearly misunderstood me.
At any rate your supplementary question does not reflect what I said.
I did not say that the Slovak Government had dismissed the accusations as untrue.
I simply said that the Slovak Government stressed that there was no state-sponsored practice of this kind, that the state did not tolerate these practices and that the accusations that you and others are making were the subject of a meticulous investigation by the competent authorities.
If the Slovak Government were to say that there was no truth in these accusations then it would not need to order an investigation.
I would ask you not to be too quick to condemn another country.
So far, in my opinion, there is no proof that this is a systematic state practice.
Instead the suspicion that is uppermost in my mind is that what we have here are individual cases of abuse, admittedly of the gravest kind.
I must draw your attention to the fact that the Commission does not have any executive power in the countries that will be joining us.
It is therefore completely out of the question for us to undertake a criminal or criminological investigation in a future Member State, just as we would be unable to do so in a current Member State.
We have done what we can to use our political influence to make the Government of the Slovak Republic aware of the urgency of this matter and to ask it to carry out a thorough investigation.
I really must insist on stating here that the Slovak Government responded immediately and has complied with all of our requests without hesitation.
