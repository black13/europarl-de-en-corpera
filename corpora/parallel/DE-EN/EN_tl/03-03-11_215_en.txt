Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for his answers.
He really is very convincing on this issue.
I should also, however, like to thank the questioner for even raising this matter.
I have a small and perhaps naive supplementary question: would it not be possible then for either the Commission or perhaps even Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to invite one or other of these women to visit us and describe to us what is actually happening there?
I would be interested to talk to this woman in person.
Perhaps it would not be without interest for the Commission either to hear a personal account of the situation on a one-to-one basis.
