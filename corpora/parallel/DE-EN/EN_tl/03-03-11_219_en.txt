Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question posed by Mr Staes concerns the distribution of food to those in need in Belgium.
This is clearly a matter for the Member States, so, in this case, it is a matter for the Belgian authorities.
The funds that were provided for the 2002 programme in Belgium were no lower than in 2001.
On the contrary, funding was increased from around EUR 2.3 million to EUR 3.5 million, precisely so that beef, which was available again in 2002, could be distributed without this entailing a reduction in the quantities of the other food that had been made available.
The decline in the quantities made available to the Belgian Federation of Food Banks is due to the fact that the Belgian authorities divided up the food available differently from in previous years.
