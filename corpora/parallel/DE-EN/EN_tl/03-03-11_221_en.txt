Mr Staes, in my statement I was talking about amounts of money and not about tonnes.
I also said, however, that you need to bear three different things in mind here.
First of all, as I said, it is the Belgian authorities that are responsible for dividing the food between various charitable organisations, which then pass this on to disadvantaged groups.
How much each organisation gets is therefore decided by the Belgian authorities, and it may well be the case that the organisation that you mentioned received less, but this would mean that another organisation would have received more.
The only way of finding this out is, however, by contacting the Belgian authorities.
The second point is that there is also a link between the Community and Belgium because, as you know, we have provided a financial grant, but we do not give this grant to the individual organisation, we give it to the Member State.
We then leave it up to the Belgian State to divide these resources amongst the individual charitable organisations in accordance with its particular priorities.
