Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem raised by Mr Sterckx in his question is one of which the Commission is very well aware.
I agree: it is true that the definition of fishing days in the temporary recovery plan for cod is very inflexible.
We accept this and are working on amending Annex XVII because in this way we can resolve the problem.
I can also tell you that we invited all those with responsibilities in this sector to Brussels on Monday morning.
We discussed this issue with representatives of the Member States on Monday and also today.
We are sure that we will find a solution to this problem that takes account of the practical situation.
