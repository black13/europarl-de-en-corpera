Mr President, the question that Mr Purvis has raised is actually completely unrelated to the issue that we have been discussing here.
The debate is a general one about the means by which we can on the one hand rescue our endangered cod stocks and on the other hand do so in such a way as to avoid the fishermen concerned suffering severe hardship.
Turning now specifically to industrial fishing, I can only say that we have been working on this issue for years.
We have also obtained relevant reports from scientists to ascertain whether fishing for sand eels does actually as it were take the food from the mouths of young fish and young cod in particular.
We were told that this is only true to a very limited extent.
In addition, you will also see from the stock surveys that the sand eel stocks continue to be very large and are not in decline.
These stocks are in fact stable; we do not have a problem there.
There is one problem with industrial fishing and that is the risk of cod being caught as a by-catch.
It is certainly important to monitor what happens here.
The experts are telling us, however, that these by-catches have fallen significantly thanks to new fishing technologies and that in the future it will be possible to virtually eliminate them.
