Mr President, as Mrs Izquierdo Rojo has rightly said, the Commission proposal on establishing Community rules for direct payments under the common agricultural policy provides that the single payment arrangement is open to all farmers that can show that they have a valid claim.
All eligible farmers, including of course young farmers, who have already received direct payments under the old system, have an equal claim.
Furthermore, under Article 49 of our proposal, these claims can be passed on, either through specific bequests or by anticipating the line of succession.
This provision takes account of customary practice in Europe when a holding is taken over by young farmers.
In addition the proposal also specifically accommodates new farmers.
Article 45 provides for a national reserve in the Member States.
Reference amounts can be allocated from this reserve for the single payment to farmers who started their farming activity only after 31 December 2000.
Finally, it goes without saying that reference amounts need to be allocated to new farmers in accordance with objective criteria and according to the principle of equal treatment, so as to avoid distortions of the market or competition.
Finally, if a farmer - and that obviously includes a young farmer - can prove that his production has been reduced in the reference period because of force majeure or other unusual circumstances, then he can claim that his case is one of hardship.
The possible cases when hardship pertains are described in more detail in Paragraph 4 of the relevant article.
As you can see, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, there are a whole series of ways in which we want to use our proposal to give a special helping hand to our young farmers.
