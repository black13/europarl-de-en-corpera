Mr President, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I can tell you that what you said about parodies certainly rings true with me.
It is actually sometimes the case - regrettably, I have to say - that when you listen to the comments of some national politicians you can barely recognise the Commission's proposals.
We do actually need to do much more here.
We have prepared a public relations strategy specifically so as to ensure that the proposals are discussed in the public domain.
We do however expect - and quite rightly in my opinion - the national governments to at least provide correct information.
Whether a government representative likes these proposals or not is of secondary importance.
We have an entirely legitimate expectation, however, that no false information is put into circulation.
Unfortunately, this requirement is not always respected.
I would therefore say that this is a task for all of us.
I can only ask you, in your capacity as a Member of the European Parliament, to make the facts known for example in Spain and to keep farmers informed.
In any case I will continue to do everything in my power to send this information out directly from Brussels, particularly through the media.
