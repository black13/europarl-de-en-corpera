Mr President, Mr Bautista Ojeda, firstly, under the Everything but Arms initiative the world's poorest countries have the right to export their own production, that is their entire production, to the EU if they so wish.
And if they wish they can also import rice for their own use.
That is part of the decision that was made in this House.
Incidentally, I might add that I expressed my own misgivings about this from the outset.
But the decision was made and I stand by it.
Now there is only one thing that we can do, and that is to be vigilant and ensure that no foreign rice that has not even been produced in these countries is exported to the European Union.
How can we ensure that this is the case?
We can do so by using those instruments that we also use in all other areas to check the origin of a product.
This requires proof of origin, certificates and checks by the appropriate teams of inspectors, and in some cases on-the-spot checks or analyses are also necessary.
In some cases it is certainly possible to tell by analysing the imported rice whether it really is from the country of origin indicated or not, and this does happen in practice.
