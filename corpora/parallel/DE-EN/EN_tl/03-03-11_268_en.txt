Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon strategy can only succeed if we promote competition between the European systems.
In other words, we are concerned here with competition between economic solutions and, above all, with the best solutions to emerge from competition between the EU governments.
That also ties in with the basic idea of subsidiarity in Europe.
To put it in plain language, there should simply be no further increase in cooperation concerning economic policy, meaning that macro-economic policy ought quite simply not to fall within the competence of the EU.
Socio-political objectives too, such as bringing about full employment, promoting social cohesion or establishing a balanced relationship between competition and public service are contrary to the principles of subsidiarity and competition.
Moreover, we should - in my view, anyway - also take care that such objectives do not find their way into the EU constitution.
What is more, we also need competition in the tax field, that is to say between European tax systems.
Nor, above all, should we go on using the open coordination method in the form currently under discussion.
In other words, we need, in the future too, an economic policy for which the Member States themselves continue to be responsible.
In my view, only competition between economic policy objectives will, in the end, also lead to local conditions within the European Union that, against the background of general worldwide competition, may be further strengthened.
