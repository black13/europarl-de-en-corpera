Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the public - especially in the candidate countries - often makes the erroneous assumption that the European Union's Budget deals, in effect, only with agricultural policy.
Such an assumption is not only fatal, but also false.
It is even more important, in times of economic upheaval and renewal, for us to affirm and create social cohesion in order, among other things, to stabilise democracy and gain public acceptance in these new Member States.
Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like, then, to highlight four points from the debate that were of particular importance to us.
In this context, the first is support for the social dialogue.
In practically all the candidate countries there is still the need to establish and reinforce structures that will make the social dialogue a reality.
The second point is the need to improve conditions in the workplace.
Our work in the Member States treats health and safety at work as a priority, and the same must be true in the candidate countries.
The third point is that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has stressed our desire to have greater support, in every case, for the social platform as part of the action programme against social exclusion and discrimination.
I would refer you to the Lisbon resolution in which we highlighted competitiveness and employment opportunities and stressed the need for them.
In the candidate countries, restructuring affects not only agriculture, but still also major, and outdated, sectors of industry.
They need our help with that, help that we can - and should - provide by means of European Union funds.
In all these areas, we rely, of course, on the knowledge of the agencies.
We therefore expect them to receive the financial appropriations that they need.
