Mr President, the committee agreed overwhelmingly on the need to restrict self-handling to ships' crew.
Now, though, we have the problem that these expressions are used very differently in the various translations, not only the German, but also the English and French versions.
As I see it, knowing that the basis must be the German text, the most correct and tidy translation is the English one, which refers to 'regular seafaring crew', enabling Parliament to make it abundantly clear that we are not talking about what is done on land, but only about what can be done by the ship's crew, using their own equipment, and nothing more.
That is why I would like this made clear by the language used in the translations.
'Seafaring crew' and 'Schiffsbesatzung' would have the additional advantage over the expression used in the German version, in that 'seem√§nnische' in German still has a very masculine ring to it, whilst 'Schiffsbesatzung' and 'seafaring crew' could be said to be gender-neutral, which would have an advantage in terms of gender mainstreaming.
(Loud applause)
