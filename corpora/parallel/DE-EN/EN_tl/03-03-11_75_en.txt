Mr President, this amendment is redundant, as sentence 2 of Amendment No 24 makes provision for the eventuality of an appeal at law.
The reference therein to Article 17 (3) of the directive is final, and so we cannot now vote on any alternative options.
There is no doubt in my mind that this amendment must lapse.
