Mr President, page 17 of the Minutes details what was said and done in yesterday's Question Time, which was announced on the screens only after it had begun three-quarters of an hour late.
It should have been my turn half an hour after the beginning of Question Time, and, although I ran down here straight away, my question had already been dropped, as none of those down to put questions in the first half-hour had been there.
I then asked that my question should be allowed anyway, as it was the question immediately following it that was being dealt with, but the President stuck to the rules with extreme rigour.
I would just like to say that you should either stick strictly to the rules - which means that you start Question Time punctually - or else, if you are going to be sloppy anyway, you have to exercise some liberality in these matters.
That is the first thing I wanted to say, and I ask you to see to it that I do not get the standard reminder telling me that I should have been present at Question Time, for, if I do, I will have to reply to it in somewhat personal terms.
Now for the second point that I wanted to mention in this context: Mr Puerta, who was presiding yesterday, promised me and Mr Salafranca, who had the same problem, that we would get written answers - which represents a deviation from customary practice - and I would ask you to ensure that this promise, at any rate, is kept to.
