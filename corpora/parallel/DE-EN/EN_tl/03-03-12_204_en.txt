Mr President, I would first like to apologise.
The interpretation referred to Questions Nos 1 to 3, which is why I asked to speak.
So the reason was an error in the interpreting.
Please accept my apology.
But I would now like to put my question to the President-in-Office, whom I wish to thank for his very concrete and helpful reply.
I have two short supplementary questions.
The first is to ask what you think of the idea of simply setting up a working group to consider the options for the future of Kosovo.
That would give us a preventive role and stop us from once again reacting only when it was too late.
The second question is this: as far as I am aware, the preamble of the new constitution of Serbia and Montenegro includes a claim by Serbia that Kosovo should in future be a part of the Yugoslavian sub-state of Serbia.
I would like to ask whether the European Union or the United Nations have protested against this.
I ask because this would prejudice the chances of keeping open the future status of Kosovo.
