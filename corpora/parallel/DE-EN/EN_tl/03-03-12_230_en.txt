Mr President-in-Office, you really have my admiration today when I consider the range of subjects you have had to address, ranging from the Iraq crisis to stray dogs in Athens.
I admit that is asking a lot of you.
I believe that this is relevant to the Council - I did in fact also put this question to the Commission but it did not reach it yesterday - because the umbrella organisation for all Greece's animal protection organisations has told us that the Council wanted Athens 'cleansed' so that the EU would not have to put up with seeing stray dogs there.
Please accept that I love Athens, which I regard as the cradle of our culture and the birthplace of everything that we think and feel.
But I always sleep very badly in Athens because it simply upsets me so much to hear these stray dogs barking.
The point I wish to make is this, and neither the dogs nor I will mind if you address this as a member of the public or as a member of a government.
There are animal protection organisations in Greece, and I know that they catch dogs and that they put down the old and sick dogs that are beyond help, and that they seek good homes for the healthy ones, and that the remainder are neutered and then released again.
I believe that these organisations need money and the support of members of the public.
If a particular member of the public also happened to be a minister, that would do no harm at all.
