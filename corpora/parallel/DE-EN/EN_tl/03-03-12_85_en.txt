Mr President, when I voted in favour of the Ayuso Gonz√°lez report, I did so as a matter of firm conviction, and in doing so I am in agreement with the overwhelming majority in this House, for the fact that only five Members did not vote in favour of it should be a signal to those elements in the Council who have hitherto sought to prevent or delay favourable treatment for biofuels.
All the arguments speak in favour of biofuels: abandoning excessive dependence, greater benefits for the environment, and an increase in the sources of income available to rural firms.
This makes it incomprehensible that there should be so little awareness on the part of certain elements in the Council, comparable to their ignorance of the promotion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources.
I hope that this solidly united vote by Parliament will, as it is intended to do, stir up the Council to demonstrate some awareness and enable us to benefit the environment, to strengthen agriculture and, above all, to be less dependent on others for energy.
