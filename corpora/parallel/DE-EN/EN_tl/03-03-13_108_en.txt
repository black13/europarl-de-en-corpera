Mr President, the Turkish Constitutional Court has today proscribed HADEP, the pro-Kurd People's Democracy Party, and has, among other things, forbidden forty-six of its members to take part in any kind of political activity for the next five years.
Turkey is a candidate for accession to the European Union, in which it is not acceptable for political parties to be banned in this day and age.
Mr President, I ask you to intervene in this matter.
