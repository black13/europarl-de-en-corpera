Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication and Mr Whitehead's report on the Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006 are quite crucial documents.
In the EU's Member States, people are relying on Parliament constantly upholding the protection of consumers, which they regard as a very important, indeed crucial, element in the EU's internal market.
In our homelands, the standard of consumer protection is an important yardstick for measuring the effectiveness of our work.
Various committees have delivered their opinions.
The Committee on Budgets had the task of examining and evaluating the financial statement for this Consumer Policy Strategy.
Whilst it adopted the Commission communication, it proposed to the lead committee a number of regulatory adjustments.
The Committee also regrets the fact that no attempt had already been made to evaluate or qualify the effects that the measures proposed by the strategy as submitted would have on our finances or on the Budget.
The Committee furthermore points out that, if the measures envisaged in the strategy are, on being incorporated into the proposal for a new legal framework, to extend beyond 2006, the finances will have to be confirmed, either by an agreement on a new Financial Perspective, or by annual Budget resolutions.
I therefore hope that time can still be found to make the necessary adjustments or to allow the proposed amendments to influence practical implementation.
