Madam President, this morning, I asked for the posters hanging from the windows of certain Members' offices to be removed because of the damage they do to Parliament's dignity.
Now, just before the vote, there are still numerous posters hanging on the walls.
If we permit this, it will catch on, and Parliament will end up at some point looking like an advertising pillar or a load of hoardings covered with posters.
That is not in the interests of this honourable House.
I ask that action be taken with the utmost rigour.
