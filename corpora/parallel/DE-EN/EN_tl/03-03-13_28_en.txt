Mr President, it stands to reason that we are meant to protect consumers from unfair business practices, as that is how we create a climate of confidence, but, in doing this, we must not overshoot the mark by protecting consumers from themselves and declaring them to be incapable of managing their own affairs.
The Consumer Credit Directive is one example of this.
With that in mind, we should be supporting all measures that have the effect of promoting sales and the fulfilment of the internal market.
Under no circumstances must businesses be tangled up in more red tape, as it is above all small and medium-sized enterprises that are handicapped by it.
We must make it our objective to create more confidence while, at the same time, avoiding increased bureaucracy.
