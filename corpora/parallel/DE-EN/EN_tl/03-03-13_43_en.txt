Mr President, I would like to refer to the Green Paper, specifically that on consumer protection.
It would be possible to make a long job of this, or to say something very brief, and the speaking time available to me leads me to choose the second option.
I believe that there are already adequate rules on the essential parts of what the Green Paper covers.
I therefore have in mind only the directives on misleading and comparative advertising or the fact that all the Member States have laws on duress and the use of force.
From the point of view of practical implementation, if one takes into account the scope of the amended directives on distance selling and of the proposed regulation on sales promotions in the internal market, the only consumers to which this would be applicable in cross-border business transactions would be tourists.
That, again, does not add up to much.
I therefore see no need for a framework directive in this area.
What would be more important, in order to shine some light into the jungle in the interests of consumer protection, would be clarification of how the directives applicable in this area interact.
Unlike some of those who have spoken before me, I do not expect an additional framework directive to achieve that.
