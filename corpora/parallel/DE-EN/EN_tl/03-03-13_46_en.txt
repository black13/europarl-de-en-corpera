Mr President, Commissioner, I am very glad that I have managed to get a few of my amendments accepted.
I hope that the Commissioner is also satisfied.
The one amendment to the Patrie Report has to do with taking into account the protection of competitors from unfair business practices, without prejudice to consumer protection, and in the interests of a uniform legal framework.
Commissioner, I believe that to be of the utmost important particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.
I am particularly happy to have been able to get two amendments that I regard as being quite crucial made to the Whitehead Report.
One aims to guarantee optimum health and safety provisions in the current evaluation of chemical substances whilst ensuring the use of in-vitro testing procedures whenever possible.
This is just a fundamental principle, but its embodiment in law will be a major step forward.
In the other, we call upon you, Commissioner, to promote the use of labelling in the WTO as a means of ensuring that consumers may be informed about origins and production methods.
If I may adduce a simple example, it matters to consumers whether eggs are from hens that have been tormented in battery cages or happy hens that have been free to run around, even if they have to pay a bit more for them.
They get better eggs, which taste better.
Knowing as I do that you, Commissioner, are a particularly kind-hearted man, I am sure that you too will be very gratified by these amendments.
