Mr President, there is something I would like to have done in this House.
I noticed today that there are banners hanging in the Parliament's courtyard.
I do not want to discuss what is on these banners, but it has no place in this honourable House.
If this precedent is followed, Parliament will soon end up looking like an advertising pillar or a hoarding full of posters, and that would be detrimental to the honour of the House.
I therefore ask that these banners be removed.
