Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time for illusions is past, and now we must face reality.
Saddam Hussein's criminal regime must be disarmed.
That is what most of us in the House want, and to that the United Nations has committed itself in almost innumerable resolutions of its Security Council.
Most of the indications are that it would not have been possible to disarm Saddam Hussein without the use of military means, whether another four, eight or twelve months had been spent attempting it.
What matters now, therefore, is this war be brought to a speedy conclusion, sparing, if at all possible, those not actively involved in it.
My sympathies today are with the soldiers who must come through this war, as well as with their families and with those who will be the victims and will have suffering to endure.
I believe that one of the illusions that we must cast off is the role of the European Union.
The part it has played in this crisis has been a lamentable one, for it has been divided and lacking any capacity for action and or any influence on the objectives it purportedly seeks to achieve.
That is not the least reason why the European Union must, in the post-war period, undertake to make a substantial contribution towards enabling the people of Iraq to establish a state and a social order that are of their own choice and that is prepared to live at peace with the world.
It is obvious, though, that the Europeans have failed.
When will Europeans at last learn that the world will listen to them only when they speak with one voice?
