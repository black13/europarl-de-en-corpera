Mr President, in order to avoid potential misunderstandings, I too want to emphasise that I am in favour of enlargement, by which I mean enlargement as soon as possible.
The states that want to join us have undertaken a great endeavour, but the resolutions passed by the European Heads of State and of Government in Copenhagen have needlessly created a grave and extremely difficult situation.
Their decision puts them in breach of all the Treaties currently in force and of budgetary law, Parliament's most important prerogative.
The Council's actions could be read as a denunciation of the Interinstitutional Agreement in accordance with Article 26.
With the serious issues within the European Union relating to enlargement having to be resolved and resolution of those relating to the Treaty of Nice still a long way off, that this should happen is the Council's crowning failure!
It baffles me that such a thing is possible when the Council and the Commission have so much expertise at their disposal, unless the intention is to openly provoke Parliament.
As we all want enlargement, we are faced with the problem of retrospective damage limitation.
When I see, though, how the Council treats treaties and the European Parliament, I have the gravest concerns about what is coming next.
Transparency, democratisation, integration and cooperation are empty words if you do the very opposite.
At the moment, I do not trust them.
As the resolution of this difficult problem will be the subject of ongoing negotiations between Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission even after this decision is adopted, Parliament would be well advised to keep an open mind on all the options for dealing with the accession treaties in April.
As I know from personal conversations with them, many Members of this House very much doubt - just as I do - whether, under such conditions, they should give them their approval.
