Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me clarify matters very briefly.
Firstly, there have to date been no complaints or problems relating to the flow of funds in Portugal, where full use has been made of the money available; nor has the Portuguese Government had any complaint to make to us about anything not working.
Secondly, it is true that we have been paying in instalments so far, but the reason why the final instalment has not been paid is that we have not so far received a request for payment from either Spain or Portugal.
We can act only when the appropriate applications have been made, and so the Commission is perhaps the wrong body to which to address these complaints.
