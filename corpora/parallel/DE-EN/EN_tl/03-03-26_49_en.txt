Mr President, I welcome the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission.
The war against Iraq is completely without justification and must therefore be condemned.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is something on which the Council remains silent.
In the war against Iraq, cluster bombs and landmines are to be used, in contravention of international law.
The Council remains silent about that, Mr President.
The war is being waged against the civilian population, millions of innocent people becoming immediate or secondary victims, the latter as a result of the collapse of food and water supplies.
Anyone who has been in Iraq will know what the situation there is like.
The war is unleashing a humanitarian catastrophe, but the Council has nothing to say about that either, and so, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I call upon you to be silent no longer.
I urge you to support the initiative by Russia and the Arab League for an emergency session of the Security Council, to gather together those Member States of the European Union that have opposed the war, and to set in motion action that will rescue the United Nations from its role of spectator and again give it a part to play in this conflict.
Be silent no longer, Mr President-in-Office of the Council!
Just as we do, you represent the majority of Europe's citizens, and you can be sure of their support.
I urge you to take responsibility and stop this war.
