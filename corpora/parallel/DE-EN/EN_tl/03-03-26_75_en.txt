Mr President, I am of course not speaking on behalf of my colleague Mr Sakellariou, but, as he is unable to speak at the moment, it is my turn!
Let me get to the point and say that I am thinking of Afghanistan.
There, we all joined together in doing our bit in a just cause; we were all glad of the degree of success we achieved in combating terrorism in that country, and there was agreement among ourselves that the people of this earth, be they Muslim or Christian, should not have to be at war with each other.
It was precisely for this reason that we succeeded in Afghanistan, for we were able to make it clear to Muslims that it was side by side with Muslims that terrorists had to be fought.
The situation in Iraq, though, is quite different.
There, we have not yet succeeded in persuading Muslims that a war there is as necessary as it was in Afghanistan, and their scepticism is something I share.
While there really are not yet sufficient reasons for it, this war is - unfortunately - a reality.
My fear is that, this being so, we will, once this war is over, have to deal with the problem of huge differences of outlook between Muslims and Christians.
It is probable that, after the war, much of the work we have been doing for decades will have to be done again.
Where some things are concerned, we will have to begin again from the ground up in order to convince Muslims that Christians do not actually have anything against them.
Unfortunately, though, it will not be possible to get that point across to the Muslims in Iraq.
