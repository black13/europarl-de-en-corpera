Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Item E of the Council Conclusions states that the European Union is committed to keeping its leading role in sustainable development, both at home and abroad.
It is therefore perfectly clear to me that what is currently going on in Iraq is in contravention of Item E of the Council Conclusions.
For the war in Iraq is not sustainable; it is bringing suffering and devastation upon the people and is weakening across the board the industrialised countries' position in the global context of sustainable development.
Money is being wasted on it rather than being put into sustainable investment.
In the United States, it has been estimated that the war will cost USD 90 billion in the best-case scenario, and USD 1 000 billion at worst.
We have already gone beyond the best-case scenario, as the war has already gone on longer than the USD 90 billion estimate assumed.
That far exceeds the mere USD 50 billion that all the industrial nations together spend in a year on development cooperation.
In view of this, we can indeed say that money is being wasted rather than being spent in a sustainable way.
Secondly, I get the feeling that sustainable development is being relegated to the bottom of the list even within the European Union.
On the credit side, I acknowledge that reference is made to the promotion of environmental technology and of clean transport, but I do believe that we have to generally press forward with more vigorous ecological renewal of our industrialised society if employment is to be generated and sustainable development advanced, as, without it, both these objectives will remain beyond our reach.
So clear benchmarks are needed for what we want and for the methods that will enable us to monitor it; sustainable development needs clear goals and clear indicators in the same way as employment policy does, for sustainability is not a fig leaf, but a modern garment that would suit the EU well.
