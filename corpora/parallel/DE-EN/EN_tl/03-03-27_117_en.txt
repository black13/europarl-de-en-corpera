Mr President, I regret that this House has been unable to adopt a clear position on Iraq.
I would therefore like to state my position for the record.
I consider this war to be illegal, immoral and politically counterproductive.
I also believe that we must use the current crisis in foreign and security policy to unite Europe in foreign and security policy, not against the USA but as a self-assured partner; sadly we are still not that today, and it is our own fault.
