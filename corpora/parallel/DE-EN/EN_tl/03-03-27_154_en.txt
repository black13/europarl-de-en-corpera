Fraud in the EU results in losses in the region of EUR 1 000 million a year.
Despite improvements in combating fraud, it is almost impossible to bring the abuse or improper application of EU money under control.
I repeat at this point my old criticism that structural abuse is inherent in the system.
Intelligent crooks are always one step ahead of the authorities.
That is why I also believe that far-reaching reforms are necessary.
Moreover, citizens cannot understand how on the one hand national austerity budgets can be tightened up while on the other EU money disappears.
And enlargement gives the problem a further dimension.
I expressly support the measures Mrs Theato proposes in her report, but I still maintain that only a fundamental reform of EU subsidies can get to the roots of the problem.
