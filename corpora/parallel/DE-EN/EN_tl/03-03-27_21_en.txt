Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are a death sentence for those affected, most especially in the poor and the poorest countries of this world, but there is no longer any reason why anyone should have to die from malaria or tuberculosis.
These and other infectious diseases can be cured by the use of effective medicines.
Through the research programme, the European Union is contributing financially to the fight against these diseases and we can hope that this will give people suffering from AIDS in the developing countries a chance of getting effective and affordable medicines for their terrible affliction.
The Committee on Budgets has given this report a unanimous welcome.
We should, however, be clear that the provision of funding for the research programme will not in itself solve the problems.
The misery of poverty, underdevelopment, the lack of education and political lack of interest encourage the spread of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
This is where everyone in positions of responsibility must increase their commitment.
