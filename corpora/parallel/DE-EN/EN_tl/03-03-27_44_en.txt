Mr President, the protection of financial interests must naturally continue to be one of our primary objectives.
In this connection, we also support the creation of a European Public Prosecutor, but after detailed discussions we also believe that this cannot be a cure-all for the future.
The existing options must also continue to be developed.
By this I mean strengthening OLAF and encouraging improved cooperation within the official machinery.
It is noticeable, for example, that the Netherlands reports four times as many fraud cases as, for example, Spain or Greece.
If Member States fail to get to grips with their fraud cases, they must also face the threat of having their subsidies cut off or they must be made to pay for the losses to the EU resulting from their authorities' lax controls.
