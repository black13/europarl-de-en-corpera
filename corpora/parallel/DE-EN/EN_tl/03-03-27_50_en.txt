Mr President, I was pleased to hear that two days ago the Belgian authorities brought fraud charges against former Commissioner, Mrs Cresson, four years after her misdemeanours brought down the Santer Commission.
This, too, shows the urgent need to create a European Public Prosecutor to bring to court solely and exclusively cases of fraud involving European money, and to do so soon after the offence was committed, because a preventive effect can only be expected if prosecution and conviction follow quickly.
Although in principle I would be the last person to advocate a further transfer of powers to the EU, in this exceptional case it is justified because all - and I stress all - the bodies that have been responsible for the protection of European money up until now have failed lamentably, most of all the present Commission, which is being reduced by this task to throwing around verbal abuse.
The need for action is greater than ever, however, because the amount of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism is growing.
I need only mention the most recent goings on in the European Statistical Office, EUROSTAT.
For the most part, national public prosecutors cannot cope.
But hanging the small fry and letting the big fish get away is having a devastating effect on European citizens' confidence in the European institutions.
I therefore appeal to the Council and the Convention: we do not need any more green papers.
What we need is a clear legal basis that clearly defines the task to be performed.
Then there will be no more room for objections from individual Member States.
This first step must be taken now with the revision of the treaties and eastwards enlargement.
If we succeed, this institution will be linked inseparably to Mrs Theato's efforts, and I expressly thank her here once again for her persistent efforts.
