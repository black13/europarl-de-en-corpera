Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regarding this morning's negotiations I can inform you that there has been no agreement so far and the trialogue will continue next Tuesday.
I see prospects for agreement, but I also believe acceptance of this recommendation is also a decisive instrument guaranteeing our objectives in this matter, namely equality for Parliament and the candidate countries in the Budget procedure.
Please therefore take this as a speech in support of the resolution.
