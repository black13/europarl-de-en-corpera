Mr President, Commissioner, I would like again to refer to the Lisbon Summit, which seems, after all, to have achieved a certain amount in the educational sphere, with new programmes being created in order to enable the Union to make good its claim to be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world.
Among many equally important means to this end is greater and better use of information and communications technology.
The eLearning Programme, as we have just heard, is now to promote still further access to European educational and training programmes in order to improve their quality and accessibility.
The enormity of the gulf between one country and another is demonstrated by the statistical data that Mr Mauro has just enumerated.
There is good provision in schools, but the equipment is underused and the teachers lack the necessary skills, so there are grave deficiencies here, not to mention the gap between North and South.
The fact that there is almost 90% use in Denmark, and only some 11% in Greece demonstrates to me that there is a great divide between these two countries and thus within Europe.
The proper response to this digital divide is integration into the other European instruments.
This is where primary and secondary schools make up a very important target group, one in which I therefore believe greater investment to be needed.
We can therefore wholeheartedly agree to this proposal for 40%, which should be the percentage in elementary and secondary schools.
In conclusion, let me stress that the success of educational policy is not dependent on the number of programmes, but rather on their being implemented and funded in a realistic way.
This makes it necessary to increase funding from EUR 36 million to EUR 54 million, without adjustments taking funding away from other programmes.
That is the only way, Commissioner, that we will achieve the Europe for small citizens to which you have just referred.
