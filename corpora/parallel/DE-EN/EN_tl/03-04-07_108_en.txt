Mr President, which of the mothers or fathers present does not know that feeling of embarrassment that comes from sitting next to your own child or a schoolchild at a computer?
Even since my twins - who are now nine - were at pre-school, they have been showing me again and again how to use a computer, so I think I would need the eLearning Programme more than my children do.
Leaving such personal matters to one side, I congratulate this programme, and also the rapporteur, especially on his calls for European software, for more European content and for European services.
This is a responsibility for the Fifteen and for the European Union.
It is one from which the Council, too, cannot be discharged.
I also welcome all the amendments that are intended to foster a critical engagement with the instrument of the Internet, not only on the part of school pupils, but also on the part of their teachers.
Whilst much of this is good, there is one point on which, unfortunately, I am unable to agree with you.
The digital divide between the Member States is something that the Fifteen - who will soon be joined by another Ten! - must sort out among themselves, but the digital divide in our societies is a matter of concern for all of us.
I do think that, in order to be consistent with your Amendment No 10, we should stick to the Commission proposal as to how the funds are to be divided up.
We consider that to be a more equal and more balanced allocation of funding.
I am sorry, but with so little time available to me, I cannot go into greater detail.
