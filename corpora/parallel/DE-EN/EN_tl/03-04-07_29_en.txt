Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has decided - as Mr Gasòliba i Böhm mentioned earlier - to ask for questions on Cuba to be put orally, so that we can discuss with the Council and the Commission the problems in that country, and to enable us, in an appropriate setting, to address the arguments in depth and come to our conclusions.
Mr President, a majority in my group have therefore already expressed their objection to a topical and urgent debate, as we believe the situation in Cuba to be so grave and so important that three-minute debates are not an appropriate place for taking decisions on the subject.
Mr President, I am familiar with your statement on the recent arrests in Cuba, and also with the Council's condemnation of Cuba's actions.
This is one reason why we believed that this issue should be dealt with in this context rather than in a topical and urgent debate.
Your response to the present situation was indeed the right one.
I want to ask whether we will actually have this oral question session.
