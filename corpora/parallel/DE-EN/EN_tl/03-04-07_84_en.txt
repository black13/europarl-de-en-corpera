Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs De Sarnez, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that this programme is entitled 'Erasmus Mundus'.
I am glad because it refers back to a shared root, from which sprang the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union.
On the subject of diversity, I would like to emphasise how close to our heart it is that this long-standing objective of the European Union should be reflected in the requirement for written and oral competence in two EU languages in addition to the mother tongue.
This is an objective that we should consistently pursue.
My fellow-Members have already mentioned so much: equality of opportunity and the fight against poverty are goals towards which the European Union is expected to strive.
What else is still expected of this Union of ours?
For what can we still be a motor?
What do we expect of ourselves, and what do we have to offer?
Here too, I am repeating myself and merely saying what has already been said, but we must again lay stress on one fact.
It is that we can offer an area of tolerance, a space full of respect - something that cannot work without education - as well as a space for intercultural dialogue and intercultural competence.
That cannot work without education.
That too leads me to appeal to the Council, for it can work only if we are ready, right now, to invest, if we replenish Heading 3 rather than simply capping it and saying that we will squeeze it out of something else.
Whilst we are not meant to be debating what that 'something else' is to be, it is something that we still have to talk about.
As Mrs Wenzel-Perillo said, this question has to be put here more than just once.
We have to show our colours!
The investment in education that we are making today will bring forth a harvest that will bring gladness not only to us within the EU, but also beyond its borders.
That is what is expected of Europe!
