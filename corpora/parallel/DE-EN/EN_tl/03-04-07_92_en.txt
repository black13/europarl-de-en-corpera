Mr President, Commissioner, the number of students on the move is greater now than ever before, but the present situation is that the majority of international exchange students do not necessarily choose Europe as a place in which to study.
I believe that one reason for this is that we have not yet entirely succeeded in combining the individual strengths, the diversity of the education we have to offer, and also our wide experience in networking.
It is my opinion that this 'Erasmus Mundus' programme can help here.
Promoting cooperation with third countries will also improve still further the quality of university education in Europe.
What is also lacking, in my view, is a recognisable and clear-cut European identity for higher education.
That is perhaps why many graduates and scientists prefer to do their research and studying in America.
I think this attractive programme for high-quality education will do something to counteract this tendency.
I would like, at this point, to extend sincere thanks to the Commission, and also to the rapporteur, Mrs De Sarnez, for this initiative.
Mrs De Sarnez also deserves special thanks for having managed to negotiate an acceptable compromise with the Committee on Budgets, so that 'Erasmus World' is not funded to the detriment of already existing programmes.
We have heard it said so often that young people's education, being an investment in the future, is no place for austerity measures.
