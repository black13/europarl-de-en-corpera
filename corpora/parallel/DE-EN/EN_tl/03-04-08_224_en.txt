Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a matter of importance to all of us that speedy and effective help should be provided in disaster situations.
Might you not contemplate the compilation of a Green Paper, listing for the benefit of all our offices and of all the voluntary organisations, what the options are, or create a virtual platform where the relevant bodies could coordinate their efforts in an emergency?
