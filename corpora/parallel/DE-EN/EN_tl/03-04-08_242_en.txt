Thank you, Commissioner, for that very important information.
Now, I would just like to ask you further whether you can give me answers on two specific points.
Firstly, what is the situation as regards the training of the border guards, particularly as regards the project for a European police academy?
Secondly, I would like to ask you when you think the Council will or might come to a formal decision on the project for a European border police force - or is that, at present, purely a figment of the imagination?
