Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we know that there are various weak points on the shared external border, for example with Slovakia, where there is still a border line running for some forty kilometres, which is difficult to police properly.
Could you envisage a force of this kind being deployed on a short-term basis in especially vulnerable border areas where help and protection might be needed?
