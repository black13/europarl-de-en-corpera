Mr President, I am going to do something unusual, but I believe it to be necessary.
I think it is a pity that I cannot put my laboriously-crafted four-minute speech on the record, but it is apparent to me that my speech would have been a mere repetition of everything that has been said so far, and which has also been true.
For that reason, I do not, at twenty to ten in the evening, want to repeat what has already been said.
I have nothing to add to what has been said by Mr von Boetticher, Mr Coelho or Commissioner Vitorino.
We are all in agreement.
My group endorses the proposal made by Mr Turco and Mr von Boetticher, and we approve the position they have taken.
I do not think that there is more to be said on the subject.
My colleagues can use my speaking time if they really want to.
