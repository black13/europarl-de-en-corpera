Mr President, the results of Europe-wide surveys clearly show that the European public are distancing themselves more and more from the Community ideal, and one substantial reason for that may well be the way in which many EU citizens have been given false information over recent years.
For example, 43% of Europeans continue to believe that a work permit is required if they want to work in any other Member State.
It is regrettable that the advantages offered by the EU are not always recognised as they should be.
It is clearly evident from this, and also from many other examples, that the EU's existing information and communication policy is not working.
Negative public opinion is of course reinforced by the EU's inability to get a grip on corruption, and by its failure to effectively dismantle the bureaucratic apparatus - I am thinking, for example, of the way our Parliament meets in two places.
We should be a better state that what the public has at home.
We have to take urgent action, by which I mean that the EU has to take a position on the things that have gone wrong, do away with them and put together an additional package of measures.
For example, the EU could be introduced in schools as a specific subject, and pupils could be offered more opportunities to inform themselves locally about what is going on in the EU.
Such measures would be a step in the right direction, so that negative preconceptions about the EU could be eroded and public support for the Community ideal would be restored.
