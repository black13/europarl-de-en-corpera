Mr President, it is a very tight and highly ambitious timetable, but the Financial Regulation - which, as you are well aware, has been entirely revised with Parliament's assistance and is now in force - imposes a statutory obligation to implement these reforms by the year 2005.
We made this explicit pledge to Parliament and the Committee on Budgets.
We shall therefore make every effort to meet that target, and we shall keep you constantly informed of our progress.
If we pull out all the stops, I believe that this reform process can be successfully completed.
It is the ambition of the Prodi Commission to ensure that the entire process of reforming the Commission is properly concluded by the end of 2004.
