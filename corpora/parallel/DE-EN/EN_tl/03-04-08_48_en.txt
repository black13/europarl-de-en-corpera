Mr President, in view of the increasing importance of restorative justice, I am grateful to the Kingdom of Belgium for its initiative in this matter.
The aim is the establishment of a European network of national contact points, designed to permit a permanent exchange of information on restorative justice and on one of its most commonly applied methods of resolving disputes, namely mediation.
Ladies and gentlemen, every citizen of the Union can move freely within its borders, but, by the same token, he or she can also become a victim of crime in any Member State.
Some of the honourable Members of this House and their staff have had painful personal experiences of this in the immediate vicinity of the Parliament building in Brussels.
On the other hand, I believe there is little point in creating more and more new European authorities.
For this reason, I have proposed that the secretariat of the contact network be established within the existing secretariat of the European crime-prevention network.
This will serve to minimise operating costs as well as maximising the synergy effects between the two networks.
I have also given sharper contours to the defined aims of the initiative as well as proposing a different legal basis.
Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the establishment of a network of contact points cannot be an end in itself.
The creation of such a forum can only be the first step.
It will therefore be our task to seek further advances in the protection of victims in cooperation with the Council and the Commission.
Europe has the opportunity to adopt legal provisions that will effect a truly rational harmonisation of the varying treatment of victims of crime in the Member States.
