Today, Mr President, I too voted in favour of the accession of the Czech Republic.
It is self-evident that the Czechs are part of Europe, in the heart of which they live.
I would no longer have been able to look my friends and relatives in Prague in the face if I had voted against them joining us.
My 'yes' vote, though, is intended primarily to strengthen those in Czech public life, in political parties, parliament and government, who have come to recognise that, rather than having to drag the ballast of history into the future, a people that finds the strength to face up to the whole of its own history reaps honour rather than humiliation.
Reconciliation is the fruit of truth and of any person's willingness, for a moment, to put himself in another's position.
I know as a German that even we, who overran almost all our neighbours in wartime, regained the esteem and respect of all by not repressing these aspects of our history or treating them as merely relative.
Let the Czechs try it too; it is a liberating thing to do.
