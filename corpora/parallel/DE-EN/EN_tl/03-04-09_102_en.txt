Mr President, I would like to preface my remarks by saying that I am a great supporter of enlargement and, having been, among other things, chairman of the delegation to Slovenia, have been a convinced defender of this policy.
Turning to the subject of the Czech Republic, I would like to state that I had always hoped that the Czechs would, in good time, cast aside the dead weight of history and make it possible for us to vote for the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union with joy and a clear conscience.
It is unfortunate that the failure of many Czech politicians' courage has prevented that; hence also my vote against, in solidarity with Mr Ferber.
I hope that the Czechs will in future get round a table and find there a way of working through the past together.
