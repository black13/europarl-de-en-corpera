Thank you, Mr President, for handling matters in this way.
Let me say this in all seriousness to all the staff and officials of this House: where your legitimate interests are at stake, we are on your side, but do not use this historic day, when the admission of ten countries to the European Union is at stake, as the occasion for enforcing interests that may or may not be legitimate.
We have to do proper work today, we have to vote, and I ask you to discharge your great responsibility so that we may be able to do our duty.
