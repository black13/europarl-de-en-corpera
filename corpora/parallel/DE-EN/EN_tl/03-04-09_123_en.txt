Today's vote on the accession of ten Central and Eastern European states sees us laying the foundation on which the historical division of Europe into East and West will be overcome.
The historical division into masculine and feminine worlds persists, however, both in Eastern and in Western Europe.
My 'yes' to the accession of Cyprus, Malta, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is coupled with the expectation that the acquis communautaire will be adopted without reservation, and given life, as it applies to the area of equal opportunities for women and men.
I will not deny that I found it very difficult to say 'yes' to the accession of the Republic of Poland, which, along with the United Kingdom, is a participant in war against Iraq, a war of aggression and contrary to international law.
I therefore see it as my responsibility as a German social democrat to set today's European date of 9 April 2003 against the nationalist date of 1 September 1939, at the same time hoping for peace and prosperity for all and for a European social model based on partnership.
