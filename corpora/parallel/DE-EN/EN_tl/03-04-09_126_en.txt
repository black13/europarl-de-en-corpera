It is with joy and satisfaction that I note that, in the vote referred to above, the Czech Republic received the worst result and thus a 'Parliamentary shot across the bows'.
Present-day Czech politicians must wonder why they did so badly, with 489 votes in favour, 39 votes against, and 37 abstentions.
As a member of the EU/Czech Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee, I experienced, over the past four years, the Czech's intolerable arrogance at first hand.
Over and over again, I appealed to Prague to meet us halfway in the matter of the wretched Bene? decrees, and in this way draw a line under the unpleasantnesses of the past.
On each occasion, the politicians in Prague refused categorically to do so.
My yes in the vote today is therefore a signal to today's young Czechs, who will, it may be hoped, soon be calling the political tune in Germany's neighbouring republic.
I wish the present holders of political office in the Czech Republic much joy from the arguments in their own country as to why the vote in the European Parliament in Strasbourg was such a poor result for them.
Perhaps it is only now that the open dialogue that Parliament has been striving for will begin.
