.
Never before have I seen so many Members of the European Parliament put massive pressure by their national party leaderships.
It is for that reason that the result of the vote does not correspond to the honest convictions that many of us have.
What I say now I say also with those in mind who dared not follow their conscience.
The EU must become democratic before it can be enlarged.
That is what we promised our electorates in 1999.
Yet the EU has not done its homework, and the Treaty of Nice is a mockery.
That is why the EU can work only if the Convention and the governments decide on a real constitution, one that is democratic and transparent.
Although I am very much in favour of the EU's enlargement, the accession of ten new members at once means that it is at present taking on too much.
The reason why I voted against the Brok Report is that it presents us with a world of illusions.
I could not even vote in favour of the accession of Poland, where too much is getting out of hand, and the Polish Government is playing an active part in the abhorrent war of aggression in Iraq.
I abstained in the votes on all the other states, my primary concern being the question of whether the West is ready for the East, the answer to which question is in the negative.
