Today, the European Parliament has voted to accept the accession of ten states to the European Union.
This is an historic day, not only for Europe, but also for me personally.
The calamitous division of Europe is being overcome, and Europe is being united in peace and freedom.
The peoples of Europe now have the opportunity to join together in shaping their future in freedom and under democracy.
I have nonetheless voted today against the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, and I would like to explain why I have done so.
I have voted today against the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, and I would like to explain that this was not a 'no' to the Czech people, but rather a deliberate sign to the political office-holders who, despite many demands that they should do so - from their own people, among others - were unwilling to abandon passages in the Bene? decrees that are contrary to human rights.
My electoral district is in the Oberpfalz, a border region which shares some 140 kilometres of border with the Czech Republic, and one where many have built up a new life after being driven from their homes in Bohemia and Moravia.
I know how strong are the ties that bind these expellees to their former homes, and to family members and friends who still live in the Czech Republic and to whom the Czech 'Immunity Act' remains applicable.
