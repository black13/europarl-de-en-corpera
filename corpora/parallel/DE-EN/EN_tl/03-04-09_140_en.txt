I very much welcome today's vote in the plenary of the European Parliament in favour of accepting the ten countries that wish to accede to the European Union.
The enlargement of the European Union represents a gain both for the European Union and for the candidates for accession and is an indispensable prerequisite for peace, stability and prosperity in a reunited Europe.
It is with reference to this, though, that I would like to reiterate the urgent necessity of establishing, as soon as possible, an EU-wide harmonised system of common safety standards for all present and future EU Member States in the field of nuclear energy use.
The following steps need to be taken without delay:
Revision of the Euratom Treaty by the Convention on the Future of Europe, which is currently in session; the drawing up and enactment of the directives already proposed by the European Commission on the improvement of nuclear safety; and the establishment of an independent authority at EU level to inspect controls in the area of nuclear safety in the Member States, in close collaboration with the IAEO.
Having voted as I have done today, I will redouble my efforts towards a just political solution, as soon as possible, to the problem of the Bene? decrees and, in particular, of the Immunity Act, No. 115 of 8 May 1946.
