Mr President, for me, as a German MEP, the reunification of Europe, for which we have voted today, is of comparable significance to the restoration of the unity of my own country.
It is for that reason that I approved today's applications for accession with all my heart, including that of the Czech Republic.
I do, however, profoundly regret the Czech Republic's failure to annul the expulsion decrees and, in particular, the Immunity Act, which is contrary to every principle of law.
I have therefore declared my approval of the accession of the Czech Republic as well in the conviction that, if the Czech Republic becomes a Member State of the European Union, we will be able to represent better and more effectively the interests of the German expellees and of the German minority in the Czech Republic, to whom I feel a sense of obligation.
