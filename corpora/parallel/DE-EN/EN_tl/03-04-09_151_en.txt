Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad that the accession of the Czech Republic has today been approved.
It is unfortunate that my parents could not live to see this event.
My mother died in January.
They were expelled from their home, and lost a very great deal.
My uncle was murdered in a Czech camp in 1946.
Having, however, been brought up in a spirit of tolerance and forgiveness, there is one thing I can tell you, and that is that those who - to some extent justifiably - have voted today against the Czech Republic's accession because of the Bene? decrees, have forgotten the decisive truth that it is peoples who are accepted.
We have to look forward rather than revert to the old politics of revenge; I see it as very, very important to stress that.
In view of how certain members of the CSU have just voted against it, that is, alas, again no doubt attributable to elections in Bavaria, where they want to have air sovereignty over certain beer gardens where expellees gather.
I cannot go along with that.
I find it very regrettable that there are those here who were not big enough to take a forward-looking view of history, but remain imprisoned in their old feelings of desire for revenge.
