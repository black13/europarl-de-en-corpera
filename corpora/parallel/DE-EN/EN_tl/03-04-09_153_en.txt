Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my voting against the ten accession reports is intended to express my deep concern that the European Union has as yet failed to do as it had promised and enlarge and deepen the EU both at the same time.
My confidence in the EU Member States is shattered to its foundations, for not only has their lack of unity in matters of foreign and security policy been demonstrated to Europe's detriment, but, for the same reasons, the Treaty of Nice failed to achieve the conditions required before enlargement can take place.
The Convention has not yet produced an outcome, let alone a commitment to the new treaty text being ratified as soon as possible.
I regard it as hypocritical to decide on enlargement while the European Union's unresolved problems are swept under the carpet.
When this House has such an important decision to take, I would have liked to see more determination to defend its rights in relation to the Council.
Lest I be misunderstood, let me say that I am in favour of enlargement, and as soon as possible, even by 1 May 2004, but for that we need a new treaty basis, one that guarantees common action on crucial issues even when there are over 25 Member States.
More than ever before, I find a lack of the common European will that is capable of mastering tasks in the strong Europe of tomorrow.
