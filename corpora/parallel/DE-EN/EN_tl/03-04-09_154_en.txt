Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am well aware of the historic significance of today's vote, which is also, though, the most difficult decision I have had to take in my political career to date.
I did not make this decision easy for myself.
I brought myself, after mature consideration, to vote in favour of the Czech Republic's accession, something I did despite my rigorous position on the Bene? issue.
The Immunity Act remains part of Czech law.
It is an unjust law and a stain of dishonour.
There is no place for it - none whatsoever - in a new Europe that takes seriously its affirmation of common values.
It is with great regret that I note that the Czech Government has not, to date, been magnanimous enough to make a gesture.
Despite that, I have voted in favour of the Czech Republic's accession, thus demonstrating a trust that may, for all I know, be misplaced.
I would, though, like to help break the vicious circle of misunderstanding and help break down entrenched positions, and I trust that this positive signal will also meet with a positive response from the Czechs.
Those who reject an outstretched hand have not understood the spirit of the enlarged Europe.
