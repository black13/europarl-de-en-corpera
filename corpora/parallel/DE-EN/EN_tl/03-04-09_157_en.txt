The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance, but whether the Czech Republic is founded upon the European order is a matter of doubt.
Czech Prime Ministers have described the post-World War expulsions as 'just' and 'necessary', and have even held them up as examples in present-day conflicts.
This must be set against the statement in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to the effect that 'collective expulsions are prohibited.'
It was for that reason that Parliament's resolution adopted on 20 November 2002 stated, under heading O, that 'ethnically-fixated policies leading to collective expulsions and the destruction of cultural goods are a flagrant breach of fundamental human rights and the common European legal culture'.
This is an unambiguous verdict.
It is not aimed at exacting restitution of any kind, but makes it clear that Czech positions such as those referred to are an offence against the most fundamental principles of law, which the EU exists to maintain.
Although we note with satisfaction President Klaus' statement that the 'events full of violence and human tragedies', which had also befallen the Bohemian Germans, were 'unacceptable acts from today's point of view', nothing comparable has been said by the Czech Government, or by its parliament, or by groups or parties in it.
They have therefore failed to dispel the doubts as to whether the Czech Republic has its roots in the ground of European legal culture.
This means that not all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU have been complied with, so that we are unable to vote in favour of it doing so.
