I approve the accession of the Czech Republic because I take the view that the reunification of Europe and thus also the return of the Czechs to the European family must not be halted by the irresponsibility of those Czech politicians who have still not yet grasped how a modern state functions under the rule of law.
It is to be hoped that the lasting injustice of certain of the Bene? decrees continuing in existence will be able to be done away with more speedily within the EU than if we refuse to admit the Czech Republic to it.
