I abstained when the vote was taken on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU.
What was decisive in my doing so was the fact that the government in Prague does not think it necessary to distance itself from the decrees of the one-time President Bene?, which declared to be lawful the gravest offences - including murder - committed against Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in the course of their being expelled.
It is not acceptable that the Czech parliament, in April 2002, should affirm that this sort of expulsion was 'unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable'.
An essential part of my work in the European Parliament has to do with ensuring that human rights are secured, the rule of law defended and minorities protected.
These principles are among the Copenhagen criteria, which have to be met by all states desirous of joining the EU.
It is compliance with these conditions - not only with those of the acquis communautaire - on which their ability to accede depends.
As the Czechs have not met these conditions, a no vote on my part, directed at the actions of those who hold political responsibility in their country, would be absolutely justified.
As, though, we are not voting on governments, but on states and their peoples, I abstained today.
I hope that the citizens of the Czech Republic will, after their country's accession, gain a deeper understanding of the community of values and laws that is the EU.
