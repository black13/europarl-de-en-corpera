I have abstained from voting on the accession of the Czech Republic.
I am of the opinion that the country has not yet fulfilled all the conditions required for it to be able to accede to the EU.
The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance.
It is founded upon a common system of law and upon reconciliation between Europe's peoples.
It is a matter of great regret to me that the Czech Government has not, as yet, changed its stance on the expulsions and continued to affirm them, in the parliamentary resolution of 24 April 2002, as being 'unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable'.
This makes it all the more welcome that the Czech President, Vaclav Klaus, should, on 20 March 2003, state that the expulsion of Czechoslovakia's German population, and acts of violence against Germans even after the end of the war, were not acceptable from a present-day point of view.
It should be added that society in both countries has seen many efforts made towards a final reconciliation.
In the meantime, no change to the existing legal position has been either made or announced as a result of the President's statement.
The attitude of the Czech Government and parliament is contrary to the spirit of reconciliation and of respect for human rights and the rule of law, which characterises European integration.
I would like to give voice to my personal hope that the imminent enlargement of the European Union will enable the Czech Government and parliament to reconsider their position, and that the necessary gestures and actions will follow.
