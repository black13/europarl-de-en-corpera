Today, I have voted against the Czech Republic's application for accession to the European Union.
It is my conviction that the most important foundation for the unification of the European peoples is the unconditional obligation on the part of all to the principles of a state ruled by law.
It is on this basis alone that a united Europe has a future.
It is this obligation that the Czech Republic is failing to discharge by retaining the decrees of the former Czechoslovak President Bene?, in particular the Immunity Act (Act No 115 of 8 May 1946), which to this day has not been repealed.
The effect of this law is to accord general legitimacy to the gravest crimes and offences committed in the post-War era.
There is no room in the common system of European law for any state that has such laws on its statute book.
A decision in favour of accepting the Czech Republic as a Member State would also create a precedent that could be prayed in aid by potential future applicants.
The creation of a precedent would do lasting and profound damage to the credibility of the European Union.
