The reunification of Europe is an historic opportunity, and Czechs and Germans in particular have the prospect of a rich cultural heritage.
I do not regard all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU as having been met, my specific concern being the Bene? decrees, which have survived to the present day.
Despite these misgivings, which for me are considerable, I have voted to approve the Czech Republic's accession.
The young people of Europe share in but one common future - Europe!
This is an opportunity that I do not want to deny to the young generation in the Czech Republic.
