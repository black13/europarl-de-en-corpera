I have today voted against the application by the Republic of Malta for accession to the European Union.
The reason for my decision is Malta's persistence in shooting migratory birds.
In the course of accession negotiations, Malta had flatly refused to fully implement the European Union's protection provisions in the form of the EU's bird protection directive, and managed to negotiate a transitional period permitting the Maltese to hunt birds up to the end of 2008.
This arrangement is a license for poachers and for those engaged in the illegal trade in animals.
European jurisprudence strictly prohibits hunting on the high sea, the hunting of songbirds with nets, and the mass shooting of rare songbirds.
These are legal fundamentals that a candidate for accession must acknowledge.
