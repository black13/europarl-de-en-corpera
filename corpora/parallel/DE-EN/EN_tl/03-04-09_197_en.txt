Mr President, voting against the accession of a country for which I have particularly great respect involved a difficult decision, but it was one that I took for myself alone, without attempting to influence my group, nor allowing myself to be influenced by them.
I cannot give my vote to a candidate country that, by providing combatant troops, is participating actively in an illegal, immoral and sordid war in Iraq, thereby not hesitating to break international law, and sharing in the responsibility for the murder of thousands of innocent civilians.
Poland is on the wrong track; its government certainly is, and in that they are not alone.
The Polish people, too, preferred to follow the American Secretary for War rather than the Polish Pope.
The Poles are more proud of their special unit, GROM, than they are of their Catholic bishops, who are campaigning for peace.
In doing so, they are excluding themselves from the community of values that is the EU.
I hope that they will soon come back.
Today, after mature consideration and in complete accord with my conscience, I have voted 'no'.
