I voted to approve the Accession Treaties only under protest and out of solidarity with my future colleagues.
Despite the Commission's warnings and reproaches during the course of the negotiations, the Council has insisted on committing what is without doubt a breach of the law.
The Council's controversial retention of Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and consequent wholly unilateral alteration of the 2004-2006 financial framework amounts to a breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament and the Council.
By doing this, it has trodden Parliament's budgetary rights underfoot.
At the same time, it has forced upon Parliament the choice between fighting for its rights and approving the enlargement treaties.
Such behaviour by the Council puts an end to our loyal cooperation with it.
