Mr President, I would like to thank the Minister for his reply.
I would like to put an additional question: do you think it is conceivable that Croatia could be included in the next enlargement round?
Not this one, of course, but the next round planned for 2007.
Do you think it is conceivable that Croatia could be part of this round, and will you propose this in the Council?
Personally, I believe that Croatia fulfils the criteria at least as well as some of the countries which we have admitted today.
