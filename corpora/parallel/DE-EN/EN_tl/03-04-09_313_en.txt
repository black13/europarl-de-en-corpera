Mr President, thank you for the reply, but let me ask you this, briefly and succinctly: are you prepared to ensure, are you prepared to intervene, so that the thirteen persons - the delegation of human rights activists whose passports were confiscated in Casablanca - are given back their passports and are able to resume their journey to the 59th session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva?
One member of the delegation is a laureate, Mohammed Dadash, who spent nineteen years in prison and who was awarded a human rights prize by the Ravdo Foundation in Norway.
