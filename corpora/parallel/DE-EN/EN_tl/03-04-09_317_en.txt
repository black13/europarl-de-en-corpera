Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, recently, there are more and more reports of Europeans disappearing between Algeria and Tunisia.
The current figures are four Swiss, eight Austrians, one Dutch, one Swede and fifteen Germans.
Are you aware of these incidents, and is the Council considering taking joint action to free or locate these fellow citizens?
