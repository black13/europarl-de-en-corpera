Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on Monday this week, we debated category 3 very intensively under the heading of internal policies, and one area which is of particular concern to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is of course intelligent energies.
In category 3, more than EUR 500 million is now newly available.
Do you think that in this area, we could make the development of these intelligent energy technologies a particular priority - also in the ten new accession countries, which have today been confirmed by Parliament?
In other words, do you think we could step up these initiatives in this area too?
