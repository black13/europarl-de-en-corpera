Mr President, I congratulate the Commissioner, and I congratulate Mr Peter Liese.
After the committee adopted Amendment No 30, I felt a real need to add here that the Member States should, at the least, uphold the ban on research involving the destruction of human embryos.
You see, I would now like to exercise one of the great achievements of our European continent.
I would like to exercise the achievements of freedom of thought and freedom of conscience.
Please do not try to make matters easy for yourselves by claiming that we are not here to preach morality!
What else is at stake, then, when embryos are destroyed?
We do not need to harmonise at all, for we all share a common set of ethics which states, at least: you shall not kill!
I respect your opinion, but please respect the opinion of others who say: I will not kill!
Someone once told me that at the very moment when the egg and sperm cells join, a unique person is created - not just anyone, but a person with a specific hair colour and individual qualities - in other words, a human being.
I know there are the famous fourteen days, Mr Purvis.
I am afraid that we do not entirely agree on this issue.
Has individuation occurred or not?
Am I not already killing?
Please recognise that people are afraid of having to kill.
Yet perhaps we are discussing all this quite unnecessarily.
Let me tell you that a few days ago, Professor Huber of Vienna University presented his most recent research achievements and findings.
In many years of work on blood obtained from umbilical cord, he has achieved massive successes which give him the justified hope that in a few years, he will be able to generate organs from it.
