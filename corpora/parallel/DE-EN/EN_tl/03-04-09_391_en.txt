Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Evans has just said everything I wanted to say, and given the late hour, we should perhaps depart from the noble principle that everything has already been said, but not by everyone, so I will refrain from repeating everything all over again.
Let me just make two brief comments in addition to what the rapporteur has said.
Firstly, many thanks to the Commission and the Commissioner.
The conciliation procedure was a real pleasure.
We were very pleased to note, in our group, how much effort was made to make concessions to Parliament here, and since we have often said unflattering things about the Council and the Commission yesterday and today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my warm thanks for this truly outstanding conciliation procedure.
Secondly, I would like to say something in the interests of the dogs themselves.
I have a dog myself, and he has told me that he does not want a microchip or a tattoo.
It is no fun at all for dogs to be dragged about the place.
You see these poor dogs on aeroplanes, barking, whining and whimpering, stuck in those awful cages and having to endure a long flight, and I really do think that anyone who gets a dog or cat should realise that they have acquired a living creature, and if they are not prepared to take proper account of its needs, they should not get an animal in the first place.
