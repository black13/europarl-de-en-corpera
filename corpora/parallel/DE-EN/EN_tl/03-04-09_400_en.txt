Mr President, quality assurance in food production poses major challenges to all those involved in the production chain.
One of the tasks is to utilise those resources which safeguard transparency and traceability for all market participants, and, of course, for consumers.
Seed production is a broad-based business; marketing is regulated in the various countries by official supervisory authorities, and the factors such as varietal purity and certification of origin are confirmed.
This report is intended to close the gaps.
To this end, financial support in the sum of EUR 1 million is available, but as I have already said, this is a broad-based business.
The provision of EUR 1 million illustrates, to my mind, how long it will take to be able to carry out comparative tests in this area.
Labelling has always been required for the genetically modified varieties, and it is a matter for the countries themselves to deal with the thresholds.
The problem of multiplication of sowing seed on individual farms, which is addressed here, will and should be regulated flexibly through special replicate licences, a solution which I can only endorse.
Here, there have been - and continue to be - substantial gaps.
The EU should deal comprehensively with the entire complex issue of GMOs within the framework of the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Action Plan, also as regards seed.
I wish to call, at this point, for competition law and competitive freedom of choice to be maintained, not restricted, in agricultural production.
This report does not do so, but I would like to highlight this issue once again.
