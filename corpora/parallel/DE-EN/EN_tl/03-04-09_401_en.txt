Mr President, it is correct that the Commission did not wish, by way of this amendment of the Directive, to address the issue of genetically modified organisms.
However, when a new proposal for a directive is presented, we have every right to bring in our own ideas - for, after all, we in the European Parliament have no right of initiative.
The burning issue at present is not comparative tests, but coexistence between seed containing genetically modified organisms and seed for organic farming, which cannot contain GMOs by law.
It is this coexistence that is the problem.
It was not so difficult as long as there was no contamination, no transfer of genetically modified organisms.
Indeed, the scientists had told us that this was not possible - until one of their genes escaped.
The problem facing us now is that we cannot protect organic seed.
This is the problem that we are seeking to address.
In advance of this process, the Commission is putting forward proposals which we do not find satisfactory.
However, we want to put this problem at the heart of the debate, and we have used the report for this purpose.
