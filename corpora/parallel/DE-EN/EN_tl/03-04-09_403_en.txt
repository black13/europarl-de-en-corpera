Mr President, not only am I Right-wing in orientation, but I also sit on the right.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, my fellow Member Mrs Auroi, for this report.
I welcome the Commission's proposal to simplify matters by drawing together and streamlining ten directives on the Community comparative tests.
For twenty-five years, comparative tests on arable crops have been carried out in the Community on the basis of relevant legal provisions.
The scope of these tests has further increased substantially in recent years.
This system of follow-up controls is seen as a very important instrument to harmonise the marketing conditions in the Member States and is therefore also endorsed in the internal market.
These comparative tests must not, however, be restricted to those seed and plant varieties that have so far been certified and listed in the Union's common catalogue.
There must also, in my view, be a quite specific way of dealing with seed designated for use in organic farming.
With this Directive, however, we should not only be looking at organic agriculture.
I believe we should also be taking a look at conventional farming, and so I personally wish to support Mr Sturdy's amendments.
A clear threshold for GMO traces in seed must be laid down in accordance with the latest scientific knowledge and research, not ideological criteria.
If the traces lie below this threshold, it should still be permissible to place the seed on the market.
The presence of genetically modified organisms in seed, at least in the lower batches, is generally adventitious and often technically unavoidable.
What is required here is genuinely feasible detectability in order to draw conclusions as to whether the seed should be placed on the market.
With this Directive, we must therefore create a clear legal framework for agriculture as a whole - both for organic and conventional farming - and for food producers.
