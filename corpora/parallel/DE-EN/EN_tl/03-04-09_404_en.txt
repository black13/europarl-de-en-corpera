Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the open market, the free internal market, is one of our European Union's greatest achievements.
However, it is also one of the most difficult chapters, as open market access must not distort competition.
We need harmonisation of the marketing conditions in the Member States.
This sounds quite simple at first, but it is actually extremely complicated, not only because there is a large number of products to regulate, but also because we must focus on upholding the same conditions as regards cultivation, care, and not least, quality definition.
For twenty-five years, comparative tests have been carried out in the Community on the basis of relevant legal provisions.
I myself was a rapporteur on the amendment of Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine.
The report was adopted by Parliament on 24 October 2000, and today, two and a half years later, the Commission is still only at the stage of discussing the contents of Annexes I to IV.
With the tighter provisions envisaged here, I see a risk that the report's intention, namely to simplify, will be pursued ad absurdum.
The virus tests which are called for, for example, would result in very high costs, which could lead to a reduction of clones and thus a depletion of genetic resources.
This clearly conflicts with the Directive, whose content aims, in the long term, to abolish standard material while maintaining genetic diversity.
I therefore ask the Commission this: firstly, why is the work here progressing so slowly?
Secondly, can the Standing Committee on Seeds really amend a Commission proposal - one that Parliament supports - so radically?
The resultant question for all of us is how effective our cooperation is.
Today, however, we are discussing the financial contributions made by the Community for the comparative tests.
I support the Commission's proposal to create a clear financial basis for this support.
