Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to Mrs Jackson's comments.
I think Amendment No 4 is entirely justified, for what we want is a re-evaluation of aspartame, especially as regards its effects on risk groups, particularly pregnant women.
We know far too little, for example, about the effects of heavy consumption of sweeteners during pregnancy or on the health of infants and children.
The same applies to sucralose and cyclamic acid, about which Mr Lannoye has already spoken.
Let me say a few brief words about cyclamic acid.
Although Mrs Jackson, with reference to aspartame, has just mentioned the FDA in the USA, she does not want to heed the FDA's warnings about cyclamic acid.
As Mr Lannoye has quite rightly pointed out, a far lower maximum usable dose of that is permitted.
I think we must all take note of this.
We really should adopt the proposal put forward by my colleague, namely to cut it as low as 100 mg/l.
We must try to reduce the high levels of sugar use.
We are finding that our children, for example, can no longer taste the sweetness in fruit, that sugar is no longer perceived as a seasoning, and that foods are oversweetened to such an extent that at some point, we get used to these sweeteners, with the result that more and more sweeteners are being used in order to reduce the massive consumption of sugar.
We are in a vicious circle.
For this reason, I fully support the proposal put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I think we must follow this debate very closely, for there is one thing that we must not permit, and that is the use of carcinogenic substances such as sweeteners.
The precautionary principle applies here, and as long as potential threats cannot be ruled out, we cannot run any risks.
