Mr President, the enlargement reports are on the table.
There is much to be said about them, but unfortunately I can only deal with a few points.
As far as the Czech Republic is concerned, we should understand and respect the fact that history can be seen from two perspectives and that the Potsdam Agreement was international law too.
On 4 December 1989, I apologised on behalf of the Government of the German Democratic Republic to the peoples of Czechoslovakia for the events of August 1968, but at the same time I did not forget the 9 May 1945.
We need vision and the courage to let wisdom prevail and to resist any inclination to do what we know to be wrong by swimming against the tide of history and creating new divisions.
As for the general historical context, consideration should be given to the post-war history of the whole of Europe, not only in its political dimensions, and all of us must act in full awareness of our historical legacy.
There are calls for the enlarged Union to speak with one voice.
These calls are certainly warranted, but that one voice must plead for peace; it must uphold the rights of the United Nations, speak out against a new arms race and rally support for the fight against hunger and poverty in the world.
The historical dimensions of the present moment are beyond dispute.
What is questionable, however, is the way in which the European Union is proceeding, whether it is proving equal to the historic mission with which it has now been entrusted in fulfilment of Europe's historical destiny and whether it is taking a sufficiently balanced approach to that mission.
If it fails to do these things, the future development of the Union will be more uncertain than many people are prepared to acknowledge today.
