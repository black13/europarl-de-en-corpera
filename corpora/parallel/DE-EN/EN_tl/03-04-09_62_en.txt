Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spread of democracy and the establishment of pluralism and the rule of law in the eastern part of Central Europe are common objectives not only of the region itself but of the entire continent.
This was said in May 1990 by the then Hungarian Foreign Minister, Mr Gyula Horn, when he received the International Charlemagne Prize in Aachen.
At that time, the three Baltic States were still part of the Soviet Union, and Germany had yet to be reunited.
Today this objective of our entire continent has been achieved, which makes this a momentous day.
In 1956, Hungary bravely rose up against dictatorship.
Decades later, at a time when the Warsaw Pact still existed, East German citizens took part in a pan-European lakeside picnic by the Fertö Tó, or Neusiedler See, an event which our fellow MEPs Otto von Habsburg and Bernd Posselt had helped to organise, before striking out again on the road to freedom, and it was Hungarian border guards who stood aside and let them pass.
Shortly afterwards, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, together with his Austrian counterpart, Alois Mock, cut through the Iron Curtain.
That was the first step in a process which culminated in the fall of the Berlin Wall.
This is why we in this Parliament today shall say 'yes' ten times over.
In the case of some countries, our 'yes' will be more muted, more hesitant.
In other cases, it will be loud, instant and clear.
In Hungary, the European legal order has taken root.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Common Security and Defence Policy, the Hungarian Prime Minister voiced his criticism of expulsion orders more plainly than the competent EC Commissioner and more plainly than several other heads of government.
And so I shall say 'yes' ten times over today, but my clearest and most spontaneous 'yes' will be reserved for Hungary.
