Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a unique opportunity today to bind the bulk of Europe into a single political entity for the first time.
We must not deny this opportunity to the peoples of Europe, for all the people of this continent are entitled to attain freedom, peace and prosperity within a political community - and I stress the words 'political community' - almost 15 years after the collapse of Communism.
My home country of Austria has the longest common border with the acceding nations.
I know what the Iron Curtain meant, and I am also well aware of what an external border of the European Union means today for those on both sides of the border.
I myself am descended from Czech and Hungarian grandparents.
I was born in Austria, only a few miles from Bratislava, the capital of modern Slovakia.
I could just as easily have been born on the other side of the Iron Curtain, in which case I should have enjoyed far fewer opportunities than have been granted me in my life.
Even though the governments of some EU Member States have made it difficult for me through their illegal actions in relation to Parliament, and even though many of the applicant countries' governments have made it difficult for me by supporting an illegal war, I shall cast an unequivocal 'yes' vote, just like all the other Social Democrats from Austria, for I am convinced that the door to the European Union must be opened to the peoples of Eastern Europe and of Cyprus, though it is still divided, and Malta.
And with the same conviction we shall pursue the dialogues that still need to be conducted, whether they relate to the Bene? decrees, to nuclear power stations like Temelin or to other power stations, secure in the knowledge that the pursuit of this dialogue benefits both sides, for enlargement is not a zero-sum game.
We shall emerge as winners, and so will the new Member States.
If European solidarity ever meant anything, it means something in this vote today.
