Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it only remains for me to offer my sincere thanks to everyone who has participated in this debate for the clear and convincing welcoming signal they have given to our new members.
I believe we have done enough talking now.
The time has come for action.
Allow me one last attempt to appeal to those honourable Members who still harbour doubts by putting this one point to them: in thirty years' time, no one will remember what Parliament and the Council have been arguing about during the last two weeks.
I also believe, Mr Posselt, that no one will be talking about the Bene? decrees thirty years from now.
But in thirty years' time the decision taken here today will still be remembered.
(Loud sustained applause)
