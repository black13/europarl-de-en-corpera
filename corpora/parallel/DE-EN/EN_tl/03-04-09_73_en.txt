At this historic moment, it falls to the European Parliament to be the first of the European institutions to approve the accession of ten new Member States.
The euphoria of this momentous decision, however, must not cause us to lose sight of the current state of EU policies and of the challenges that lie ahead.
Many of the reforms on which the survival of the Union is believed to depend, such as the reform of the institutions, the Structural Funds and the common foreign and agricultural policies, have still not been enacted, financial commitments have not been made to the acceding countries, and the quest for deeper European unity is faltering.
For years the Greens have been campaigning for enlargement and consolidation of the EU.
We want to see the powers of the Union increased in the realms of environmental policy, social policy, foreign policy, etc.
The Iraq conflict, however, has cruelly exposed the discord that exists within the EU.
The position adopted by representatives of the governments of some applicant countries has also been surprising.
Be that as it may, the people of those countries must not be made to suffer for the lack of political courage shown by the EU leaders or for the statements made by their own Heads of Government.
For this reason I shall be voting today in favour of the accession of ten new Member States.
The real challenge for politicians in the EU - and for civil society too - consists in rallying the necessary majorities within the Convention behind a sustainable European Union.
As far as the Iraq conflict is concerned, what applies to Spain also applies to Poland: other political solutions must be found at the next elections.
