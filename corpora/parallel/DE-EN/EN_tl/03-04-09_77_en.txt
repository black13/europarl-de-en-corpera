Mr President, I want to propose that we should adopt item 6 in the following form: '? recognises that peace and security have been crucial factors in the decision of the candidate countries to join the European Union and that special responsibilities consequently lie with the Union to strengthen transatlantic ties on the basis of European strength and equal rights.'
I can imagine that we would then be able to lay to rest the misgivings others have, and come to a common position on this.
