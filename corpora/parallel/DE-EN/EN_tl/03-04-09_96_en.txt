I did not vote in favour of the report by Mr BÃ¶ge and Mr Colom i Naval, which reflects the result of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament.
My concerns are not allayed by the result of the trialogue, which was intended at least to limit the damage that the Council has done to democracy in the EU.
Annex XV remains in the Accession Treaties and will thus become primary legislation.
Everything else, I regard as empty words.
Only after years have elapsed will we be able to begin to prove that the opposite is the case.
The Council, though, has already demonstrated that it is acting against Parliament.
