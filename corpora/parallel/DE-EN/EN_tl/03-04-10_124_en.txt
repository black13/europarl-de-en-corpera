Mr President, Guatemala, home to an ancient culture, is a country that has, again and again, suffered grave setbacks.
Recent history shows us that, ever since the murder, in the seventies, of the German ambassador Graf Spreti, who was a diplomat and politician of note, this region of Central America has repeatedly found itself under the spotlight of European and German public opinion and was battered by one crisis after another, to which any response came too late.
We were always too late in responding to the bloody acts of violence, to the revolutions, and to the terrorism.
So I thank Mr Liese and all the others who have taken the initiative in putting forward this masterpiece of pre-emptive diplomacy, a brief resolution which, for the first time, is not a reaction to a crisis of the sort with which we are familiar in our debates on topical and urgent matters - although there is of course an acute crisis going on.
Primarily, though, this is about prevention, and, moreover, prevention through action rather than through words.
It gets right to the core issues, these being the whole area of agriculture and the reforms that it needs.
Secondly, it turns to economic reform and the area of fiscal legislation, which really is bizarre.
The crucial thing is that it also embeds the peace process, to which the European Union can make a substantial contribution by supporting and setting up dialogue, as well, of course, as in the field of economic cooperation and development aid.
I am very grateful for this initiative.
It is my belief that the real task of this House is not always to merely condemn, but to actively endeavour to devise strategies for minimising disasters, or averting them completely.
