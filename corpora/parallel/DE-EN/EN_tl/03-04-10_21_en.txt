Madam President, I, too, find the proposal disappointing.
It is actually high time that carcinogenic substances were done away with.
The removal of phosphates is in fact a necessity, and it is a tragedy that we have not succeeded in bringing it about.
Moreover, when it comes to phasing out, the Regulation lags far behind other provisions, such as, for example, the water framework directives.
Labelling is only an initial step.
Although the highest priority must of course be given to freedom of choice, my criticism is that too little attention has been paid in this debate to examining the causal links between allergies, sensitivity to chemicals, and exposure to chemical substances.
This Regulation does too much about the effects on water and far too little - hardly anything at all, in fact - about any exposure assessment covering consumers and those who work in the production process.
Let me conclude, Commissioner, by putting a request to you.
We were too late in submitting an amendment, but I ask you to consider it all the same.
We know that a number of companies are already adding bitter constituents to washing-up liquid in order to prevent children accidentally drinking them.
There are still far too many deaths as a result of children drinking washing-up liquids or cleaning fluids.
I ask you to give consideration to this, even without an amendment on the subject, and to look into the possibility of asking firms to add bitter constituents in order thereby to reduce the number of child deaths.
