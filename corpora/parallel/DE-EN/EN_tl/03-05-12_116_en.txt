Mr President, I believe that I speak on behalf of all present when I say that we are more than grateful to Commissioner de Palacio.
We need flair like this, and we need willingness from within.
The signal we are putting out is not merely to the outside world; it must also be backed up from within, and I would just like to assure you that we will continue to rely on the closest cooperation with you.
We want to do our part, but we will have to think up some way of influencing the Member States.
At any rate, we will make the attempt.
