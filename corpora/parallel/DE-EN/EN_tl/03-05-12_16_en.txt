Mr President, as you have just announced, the Conference of Presidents has not complied with the request that we made of it.
I would like to use this opportunity to again briefly explain to the plenary why it is, in our opinion, that we should not have a debate without Parliament's opinion being expressed.
Now that the hostilities are over, it is clear how things stand in Iraq, and this makes it possible for this House not only to have a debate on the situation there, but also to frame a resolution stating the position this House takes in the light of what is actually happening in Iraq.
The Conference of Presidents gave me the impression that there is some degree of fear, particularly among the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that Parliament could again end up in the position it was in last time and be unable to adopt a resolution.
I do not want to enlarge on the reasons for this, as I would then have to address a certain person to my right, but perhaps, given a little goodwill on the part of all the groups involved, we now have the chance to put together a resolution that would indeed express not only the consensus in this House, but also the stance of the European Union, or could define Parliament's demand that the European Union's position be expressed through a Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is again possible and necessary.
Our group therefore asks that the debate be accompanied by the text of a resolution.
