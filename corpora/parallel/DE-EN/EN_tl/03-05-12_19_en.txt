Mr President, this is about Wednesday.
I cannot find on Wednesday's agenda any vote on the calendar of part-sessions.
In the last part-session, we had a vote on an illegal calendar, and I wanted to ask you why this vote is not being repeated.
It is the case that a number of Members are considering appealing against this decision.
As we have a deadline to keep to, I wanted to ask when a lawful vote on our calendar of part-sessions is to take place.
