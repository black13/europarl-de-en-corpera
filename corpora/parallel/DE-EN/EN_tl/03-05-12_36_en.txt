Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was on 8 May 1945 that Germany was at last obliged to capitulate.
For six years, Germans had laid waste most of Europe, where millions of people were robbed, imprisoned, transported, starved and killed, and, in the extermination camps, murdered millions of Jews.
We owe the tremendous defeat of the Germans not to the troops of the Western Allies alone, but primarily to the people of the Soviet Union.
The Second World War claimed the lives of 20 million Soviet citizens, who served with the Red Army, starved in the siege of Leningrad, and were forced to labour as slaves.
It was the Red Army that liberated the extermination camps.
Today we are denying their grandchildren access to Europe, and Kaliningrad, intended as territorial compensation for the German internecine war, is separated from Russia.
That is disgusting and shameful.
I would ask you to remember with a minute's silence all those people who died in the war against Fascism, especially the soldiers of the Red Army and hence all those who made today's Europe possible in the first place.
