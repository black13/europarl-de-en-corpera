Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like at the very outset to join in expressing thanks to Mrs McNally, who, in the Committee on Industry, has handled this topic with a very great deal of prudence.
The discussions with the Committee on Budgets were of particular importance to us, as this is an area where the Committee on Industry considers it very important that programmes such as these should be adequately funded, and I also want to express my gratitude to Commissioner de Palacio for making it possible to include 2003 in these considerations and get these programmes up and running as soon as possible.
We are all aware that the international energy crisis, in particular, means that action is urgently needed.
Europe is dependent on energy imports to a very great degree, with, at present, some 50% of its energy being imported, and we will very soon have to face rates of increase that we find utterly unjustifiable.
That is why it is important that this programme should receive special emphasis.
This multi-annual programme will enable us - or so I hope - to start to turn European energy policy around, and, in particular, the use of energy - a subject on which we have adopted many framework directives already - must be one of our priorities for the future.
It is of course not only the benchmarks - which have recently been constantly improving - that help us to implement this at the national level, but primarily the models of best practice, and this is where the multi-annual programme is an extremely important gauge, enabling us to see in which countries, with which technologies and with which processes, we are achieving the greatest successes.
I therefore believe that this programme sees us taking a great step forward in European energy policy, and so I thank you in advance for your good cooperation.
