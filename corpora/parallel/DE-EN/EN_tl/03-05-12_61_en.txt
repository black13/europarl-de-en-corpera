Thank you very much, Mr President.
Mrs McNally has come up with an interesting idea.
She mentioned intelligent energy, in contrast to stupid energy, which, at times like these, reminds me of oil and of 'stupid white men', the title of a book by an author of whom some of us think very highly and who has won an Oscar.
On the one hand, then, there are the stupid white men following a very definite principle of energy use - old and conservative - and we have an intelligent white woman, Europe and something else.
Of course, there is a lot more to it than this.
I believe that programmes such as this one give us a chance to make progress in formulating what is meant by the European way.
I also think it smart to set up a European Intelligent Energy Agency, which has a chance of becoming what the USA's Environmental Protection Agency was in the early 1970s in the eyes of the rest of the world.
At that time, when there were as yet no Greens and our environmental awareness in Europe was underdeveloped, it was access to information and the EPA's pilot schemes that made the development of exemplary projects possible.
That is something this agency could do here.
Certainly, though, it is also smart to take on board the point that we should not be giving this agency yet another new bureaucratic superstructure, but finding a place for it where capacity already exists.
I believe that intelligent energy also includes intelligent transparency about the use of resources.
This new agency could set an example by really showing how it manages the funds allocated to it, and by the absence of what is a cause of justifiable criticism of the European institutions, by which I mean lack of transparency in the way funds are spent and used, in the knowledge that without transparency, there is no democracy.
