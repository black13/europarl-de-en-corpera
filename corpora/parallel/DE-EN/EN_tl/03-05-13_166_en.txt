Mr President, Commissioner, I think that is an extraordinarily bright idea, but we will first have to read your document and see what is proposed in detail.
I could envisage us concluding treaties with the states surrounding the European Union, and all the technical integral parts of the Treaty on European Union or of our future constitution then applying to these states as well, so that - in the area of energy, for example - these states would have a share in the liberalisation of the energy market, in the projects for trans-European networks, and so on.
If that is what it is to boil down to, then it is a very good idea.
I do, though, see this as raising a number of questions, to some of which you have referred.
For a start, why, if there is to be cooperation with the Mediterranean - for the thing is called Euromed - then why not with Russia and with other states?
Why, in point of fact, is this cooperation to be only in the field of energy?
Are there no other integral parts of the Treaty that could be used in exactly the same way?
It is unfortunate that we will then, in accordance with our own Euratom Treaty, always have to divide our activities into nuclear and non-nuclear, so it would appear that we need two different treaties.
Far from the least important question is whether this sort of cooperation in competition - and competition is what this is about - has to be backed up by joint undertakings in research, and whether there is also financial support for one project or another.
So I look forward with eager expectation to what you are going to put before us on this; perhaps you could respond to one or other of these questions right now?
As I have said, I think this is a brilliant idea, one that needs specific elements added to it.
I am sure that we will have discussions on that in Parliament as well.
