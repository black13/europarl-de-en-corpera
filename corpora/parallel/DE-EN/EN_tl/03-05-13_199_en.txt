Commissioner, I wanted to put a question supplementary to Mr Ebner's, one concerning development aid, which is your core responsibility.
To what extent does water policy, relating not only to drinking water but also to water for agriculture, play a pivotal role in two especially important war zones that we have to deal with at present, namely the area around the Euphrates and the Tigris - which also involves Turkey - and the Palestinian problem as a whole?
I wanted to ask you whether you are conducting separate negotiations in these areas, where water both has an important part to play in peacemaking and could also trigger armed conflicts.
