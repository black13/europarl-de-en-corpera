Just two more brief supplementary questions: firstly, does the Commission check to see that all the organisations that are promoted or supported do not, in fact, fund abortions?
Secondly, does development aid comply under all circumstances with the laws of developing countries on abortion, or is the attempt being made here to exert influence on legislation in those countries?
