Mr President, the Commission proposal for a legal basis for reproductive and sexual health and related rights in developing countries was put before the legislative authority - in this instance, the Council and Parliament in a codecision procedure - on 7 March 2002.
In accordance with item 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, it is the legislative authority that lays down the financial framework for the entire duration of the programme.
The amount mentioned by Mrs Scallon relates to the budget allocation for the four-year period from 2003 to 2006.
The estimate proposed by Parliament was in excess of the amount originally proposed by the Commission, and so the Commission was asked to check whether this greater amount could be funded under the revised programming for heading 4 of the Budget without exceeding the upper limit imposed on this heading in the Financial Perspective.
The Commission was able to give a binding assurance to the budgetary authority that, in accordance with the policy priorities for future expenditure, as redefined by a resolution of 5 March 2003 in the course of annual strategic planning, such funding was very definitely available.
