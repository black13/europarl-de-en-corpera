Mr President, Mrs Scallon, all funds from the European Budget are spent in accordance with the Treaty bases.
The programme in question has to do with the protection of health, both reproductive and sexual, and I believe that my fellow Commissioner Mr Nielson, in anticipation of further interventions by you, has also stated in writing in his letters to you that the relevant programmes are in accordance with the overall international programming in this area.
