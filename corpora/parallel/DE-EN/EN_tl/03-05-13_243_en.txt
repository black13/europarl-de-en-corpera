Mrs Ahern, this Budget line was discussed in depth in the debates leading up to the resolutions on the 2003 Budget.
It is the case that this programme is now in the hands of the legislative authority, that discussions are ongoing, and I believe it to be a matter of general consensus that the European Union should continue to give support in the health sector.
Indeed, this was one reason why we have, among other things, made provision for the European Budget to endow the Global Health Fund with substantial sums, and the programme we are discussing makes an important contribution to putting health care in the developing world on a firmer foundation.
