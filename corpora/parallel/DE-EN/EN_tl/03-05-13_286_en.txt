Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Callanan, I would like to start by thanking Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee and you above all, Mr Callanan, for the outstanding work that has speedily produced the compromise text that is before us today.
The Commission proposal to amend the Recreational Craft Directive is intended to take environmental concerns into account in a directive on the internal market, and so it is a good example of the synergies that the achievement of sustainable development requires between environmental and industrial policies.
The compromise reached in the trilogue between representatives of this House and of the Council represents a balance between these two pillars of sustainable development.
The Commission's expectation is that this dossier will be brought to successful completion, by which is meant the adoption of the accompanying text by this House and by the Council.
That is the final procedural step towards the long-awaited Community-wide regulatory system limiting emissions from recreational craft, and I thank this House, and again in particular the rapporteur, for their help in achieving this objective.
