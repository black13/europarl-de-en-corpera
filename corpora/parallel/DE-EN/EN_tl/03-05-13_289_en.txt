Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, recreational craft can look back on a very important development.
They were originally powered by two-stroke engines that really did pollute the environment and also produced a great deal of noise.
What is noticeable about modern boats is that research and development have already achieved a great deal, and development can go ahead.
I believe that we have found a joint solution here, one that also provides an incentive for the further development of this new technology, and I would like to thank Mr Callanan most warmly for seizing the initiative.
What matters to us at the end of the day is that mobility should be ensured in the future, not only for the purposes of carrying on a business or profession, where it can of course very often be vital, but also in the sphere of sporting activity, where, so I believe, quite a bit has been achieved recently.
What matters at the end of the day is that exhaust gases and noise should be kept to a minimum so that these are appropriate to the surroundings in question.
I therefore believe that we have now found a solution with which we can all be happy.
Let me again express my heartfelt gratitude and my hope that this may bring us an agreed outcome in Parliament too.
