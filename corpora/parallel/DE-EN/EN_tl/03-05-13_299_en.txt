Mr President, as such specific questions have been put, I would again like to take the opportunity of responding to Mr Dhaene.
I had stated that the Commission would, this year, be issuing a communication on the sustainability of tourism.
In view of the issue in the Convention, I can, at present, tell you only that the Commission does of course want to safeguard the present position, but I can certainly concede that you are right to say that we have two representatives in the Convention as against the sixteen from Parliament.
That being so, I am sure that things can be done there.
