Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has, in my view, produced a workable proposal.
Let us hope that the Council follows Parliament's example, takes a decision and does not delay the directive.
Parliament should accept this proposal as a basis for a decision and extend the directive to environmental damage caused by nuclear activities.
The directive is important in my view because it will make the polluter pays principle a European principle that can be asserted in practice and because it will strengthen the European model of an environmental and social market economy.
Mrs Flemming and I tabled 35 amendments on behalf of the Austrian contingent.
Of these, 11 were accepted verbatim and 7 have been incorporated in the compromise amendments.
In my opinion, the following five points are particularly positive and deserve to be mentioned: firstly, the directive will apply to all those activities that are listed in Annex I and which are now described more clearly thanks to our amendment.
Secondly, liability is precluded for normal operations that have been approved by the authorities and for emissions or activities that are not regarded as harmful based on current scientific knowledge.
This provides legal certainty.
Thirdly, the principle of shared liability has been accepted instead of liability based on solidarity, which means that the costs will be split in cases where there are several polluters.
Fourthly, the directive seeks to have environmental damage made good and for that reason the provisions on compensation for interim losses have been deleted.
Fifthly, the committee is in favour of voluntary financial security measures and of capping liability and is against compulsory insurance.
This also represents a balance between different interests.
