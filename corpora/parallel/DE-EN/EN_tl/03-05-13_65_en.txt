Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Corbett.
This is not exactly a straightforward subject.
Perhaps the easiest way to explain it - since we always have a few visitors with us at this time of day - is to say that we are talking about building a bridge.
The Corbett report is an attempt to build a bridge out of this European confusion of non-competencies or mysterious clan competencies, which mean, as Mr Radwan said, that all of a sudden rules directly affecting the lives of millions of people are adopted at a lower level, when there is no direct democratic legitimacy for this.
This is to a large extent due to the history of the European Union and its failure to have a clear separation of powers.
This state of affairs means that many issues fall in a grey area and are delegated.
In some cases laws are still made by civil servants; in certain areas this is a practice that is even on the increase.
The fact that the European Parliament is putting up a fight is, I think, a historic achievement and also legitimises its existence.
But what is crucial now is undoubtedly for the Convention, which is of course occupying a great deal of our attention at the present time, to make it much more clear what happens where, and it is of course vital that this include the power for the European Parliament - this representative body of the people - to be able to call back such implementing powers once they have been delegated.
The success of this project will depend on this, but also on whether we can find the words and expressions - once Mr Corbett has built this bridge - to explain this to the public and the electorate in a way that they can actually understand, so as to bring clarity and transparency to the issue, so that there is nowhere that anyone can hide any tricks.
With this in mind I would stick to my ceterum censeo, that there can be no democracy without transparency.
