Mr Oostlander, I am able to inform you that, while the agreement between Russia and Lithuania is in the process of being concluded, the duma has given a firm undertaking that the border agreement with Lithuania will be ratified by the end of this month.
As for the others, I am not in a position to give you news of such a positive outcome, but we are working on them.
In practice, though, this will not in the least be a problem, as there is no dispute about the borderlines.
The only real problem was in connection with Kaliningrad, and that has been resolved.
