Even if you say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council cannot be expected to change its stance overnight, I do nonetheless believe that one can expect it to be willing to change a stance that causes problems of this sort.
Our twenty-five different tax systems result in distortions of competition in the internal market; small and medium-sized businesses are put at a disadvantage, particularly when operating across borders; and, of course, unanimous voting in the Council on tax matters creates problems when it comes to strengthening the internal market and the European economy.
So let me again ask you what initiative the Council would take in order to remove the disadvantages to small and medium-sized businesses resulting from differing tax systems and to support the internal market as a whole?
What initiatives have been taken in the Convention by the Member States in order to do away with the requirement for unanimity on matters affecting the single market?
