Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has asked the Commission to produce a study of the effects of Basle II.
Even though this study has not yet seen the light of day, we know that the effects of Basle II touch Europe - I refer in particular to the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises and the securities they are required to provide.
What I want to ask is: what will the Council do in order to get its hands on this study, and how will it deal with the problem of tax reform in such a way that small and medium-sized enterprises can meet the requirements of Basle II?
