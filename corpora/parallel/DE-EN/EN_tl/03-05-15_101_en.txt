Mr President, I did not want to say anything about the Minutes, but before you come to the Minutes, I would like to come back briefly to the procedure adopted this morning in respect of the vote.
During the lunch break, I checked again to see which of the Rules of Procedure could be the basis for holding the vote on the Schmitt report - which was firmly on the agenda for this afternoon - at midday without a debate.
I failed to find in the Rules of Procedure any rule which, in my view, would cover this procedure.
I therefore wish to request the Bureau to notify me formally which article in the Rules of Procedure formed the basis for this morning's decision.
