I would like to take up the matter raised by Mr Posselt.
The President's phrasing - and I will take the liberty of checking the Minutes from this morning - did not imply that the President endorsed the proposer's concern.
The phrasing was this: 'Does the House have any objectives?'
That means that the precise case described in the Rules of Procedure did not apply.
As a Member of Parliament, I refuse to be passed around this House like a surplus tomato in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I have groups to attend, we have invitations, and we have meetings.
Votes and other matters are constantly being postponed, especially on a Thursday.
I do not think that we should simply rely on decisions by the Administration which are ultimately whispered in the President's ear.
We even have votes - every Member from every group has been affected by this - where there is an asterisk and a note saying 'This proposal is out of order under paragraph so and so', so no vote is taken.
Who is making the decisions here?
We - the people looking at you - are the European Union's elected representatives.
Apart from you, distinguished President at the front, the people looking at us are supposed to be reporting to us.
'Reporting to' does not mean making decisions for us.
I therefore fully support Mr Posselt on this issue.
