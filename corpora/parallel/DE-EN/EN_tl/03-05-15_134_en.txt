Mr President, I believe that especially in view of the spread of entirely new diseases and epidemics in East Asia - SARS is sadly only the tip of the iceberg - it is a matter of urgency that Taiwan, a highly industrialised state which is visited by many people and has great experience in politics and administration, should be integrated into the World Health Organisation, something that this House has demanded on various occasions.
I think it is very regrettable that this matter - which, in the age of globalisation and world travel, is important not only for Taiwan but for everyone - is not being pursued vigorously enough.
Of course, we know that Beijing is blocking this; that stands to reason, but I do think it is very regrettable that whereas the Commission has taken, and continues to take, a clear stance here - and I thank Commissioner Wallstr√∂m for the Commission's exemplary commitment on this issue - the Council can only be described as faint-hearted.
On a serious issue such as health and epidemiology, this faint-heartedness on the part of the Council can cost lives.
I therefore appeal to the Council of the European Union, to the governments of our Member States, to act resolutely so that Taiwan can join the World Health Organisation at last, and to ensure that these artificial obstacles are overcome.
This is not a question of prestige; people's lives are at stake.
