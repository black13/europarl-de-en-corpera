Madam President, the euro's strength at present is supposed to be an indication that the European economy is in quite a healthy state.
We all know that this is actually not the case.
In reality, things are not looking good for us.
In recent decades, we have lived beyond our means.
The fact is that our social, pensions and healthcare systems are no longer affordable.
The result is that those who are willing and able to contribute find themselves burdened with levies and taxes which they can no longer afford.
If we want to solve the problems, we must ease the burden on our contributors, which also means cutting taxes.
Europe must distribute the burdens more fairly.
As well as cutting taxes, we must also create employment conditions which once again enable businesses to create jobs so that working becomes a worthwhile option again.
Work must become a worthwhile option in Europe once more.
This is the only way to ensure that we can tackle our economic problems effectively in future.
