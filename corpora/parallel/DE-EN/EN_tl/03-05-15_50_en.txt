Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Posselt, in agreement with the shadow rapporteur, Mr Schmid from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we felt it was more appropriate to vote this afternoon when most of the Members are here.
There was a lengthy discussion on this matter in the committee and this report is largely uncontentious.
After all, there are no further proposed amendments, and that was why I felt it was sensible, and would ask the plenary to agree, that the vote be held this afternoon when all the Members are still here.
