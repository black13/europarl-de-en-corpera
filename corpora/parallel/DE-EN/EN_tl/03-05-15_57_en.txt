Mr President, I have just two comments to make.
Firstly, the German translation of recital A is incorrect, so please use the English version here.
A further point is this: in our calls to the Commission, a mistake has crept in to paragraph 2.
I would ask you to delete the following words, as they make no sense in legal terms.
After the words 'WIPO Treaty', the following four words - 'on Performances and Phonograms (WPPT)' must be deleted.
It is incorrect.
'WIPO Treaty' should stand, and the following four words plus the parentheses must be deleted.
