Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the energy market is, above all, to the advantage of consumers and for Europe's citizens.
Why is it to their advantage?
It is because they can buy on the market the service that is best for them.
Not only, as they did before, can they differentiate quantities, but now also in terms of quality and, in future, they will be able to do so as regards prices.
I believe that one tremendous thing we have been able to achieve together has been with regard to labelling, in that public utilities will, in future, be under an obligation to indicate the source of the electricity, which will in future be independently monitored by the Commission, with the establishment of a group of European regulatory authorities which will share their experience with one another and thereby promote competition, to the benefit of consumers and of Europe's citizens.
The fact is that competition means service, and that is what the public want; they want service and freedom of choice.
In future the mix of energy sources will have to appear on the bill every year.
What that means is, quite simply, that I, the consumer, will in future - or at least after 1 July 2007 - have the right to choose an electricity company, 100% of whose electricity is generated from hydropower.
I think that is a great leap forward for all of us, and that, in future, greater transparency will result from this as a matter of course.
Energy imports will have to be monitored by the Member States, and their sources will have to be certified.
Ultimately, we regard the full application of Community law as having most especial priority.
We believe that the decommissioning funds, together with the interest they yield, should be applied only to their original purpose, so that the costs must be borne by the form of electricity generation from which they result.
