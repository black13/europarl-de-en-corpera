Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, customers in my own country, Austria, have had a free choice of electricity suppliers since 2001 and of gas suppliers since 2002.
It is now time for regulated liberalisation to be succeeded by a period of further deregulation.
Rather than the pressures of regulation, we want more competition.
That is why we say 'yes' to the internal market.
Where this is concerned, I start by asking myself why it is that, in most cases, it is still by reference to the national market that competition is assessed.
Does this old thinking bear any relation to cross-border exchanges in electricity and gas, or to the realities of the networks?
I would say, no, it does not.
Does it not foster distortion of competition in favour of the larger states and energy-producing companies as against smaller ones?
I would say that it does.
Reconsideration of this is necessary and appropriate.
Turning to my second area of concern, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, and the Committee for taking on board the concerns of the Association of European Transmission System Operators and of Vorarlberger Illwerke AG.
These have to do with the way in which the definition of cross-border flow is being changed to refer to regulated zones instead of to the borders of the Member States.
The old definition is national rather than European and hence contrary to the promotion of cross-border exchanges in electricity through the integration of the internal market in electricity.
It is something that we have to change.
Thirdly, I would like to have something clarified.
We keep talking about the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned.
By this, we should always mean the competent authorities - for it is not always necessarily the regulatory authorities that are competent.
