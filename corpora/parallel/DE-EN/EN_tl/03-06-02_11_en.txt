Mr President, I would just like to ask you to check whether, for legal reasons, a fully valid part-session is possible at all after 1 May, as the new Treaty of Nice stipulates 732 as the fixed number of Members.
However, as far as I am aware, there are 788 of us.
I would be interested to know how the qualified majority is meant to be worked out if there is a part-session in May.
I would ask that it be checked whether this proposal is at all legal.
Thank you.
