Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the firm support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for Mrs Mann's report on regional free trade areas and trade strategy in the European Union.
Let me add a few observations.
By means of this report, we are setting out the principles by which we trade and cooperate commercially with the world's regions.
Of course, it also gives direction and a specific character to the many possibilities open to us there, which we also have at regional level.
Our group works on the fundamental assumption that we are thereby able to build up free and fair global trade, and that those countries that have not so far had sufficient opportunity to engage in trade, have the chance, through the establishment of their own free trade areas, to share in this development.
I see this - not only in view of what Commissioner Lamy said - as an important guide to the timeframe within which, in the aftermath of Doha, a renaissance of regional trade agreements around the world may perhaps come about.
I get the impression the cooperation with certain countries - such as Singapore - can also be the key to regional free trade agreements with regions that are themselves not yet in a position, or not sufficiently advanced, to take partnership further.
That is why we should be using the idea of cooperation with Singapore as the prelude to greater cooperation with ASEAN.
The specific characteristics of the region present us with a broad spectrum of diverse possibilities, which must of course remain subject to the World Trade Organisation.
The development of, for example, the West African market also requires, not only that we open our own market, but that West Africa should be put in a position to do better business with Central Africa and Southern Africa, as Mrs Mann pointed out in her report on South-South trade.
