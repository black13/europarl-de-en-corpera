Mr President, I wish to raise another matter, although I leave it to your wise judgement as to whether, if it gains majority support in this House, it should be dealt with on Wednesday or during the short sitting on Thursday.
I refer to the need for information from the Commission concerning the events surrounding Eurostat.
These cases of fraud - which I will describe as matters of suspicion - have not yet been considered by the Members of this House, although they are receiving blanket coverage in Europe's media.
Our group requests that we should have a communication from the Commission, on the basis of which we could discuss the Eurostat problem, either on Wednesday, or during the short sitting on Thursday.
