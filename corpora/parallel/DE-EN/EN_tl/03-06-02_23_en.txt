Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having considered this matter, our group supports this proposal.
We would very much have appreciated it if the resolution of the Conference of Presidents, which was - as I recall it - unanimous, could have been acted on this week, and if the Chairman of the Convention could have visited Parliament this week.
I do not know why this has not been done.
The reasons for this remain to be clarified, but I would very much welcome it if the Chairman of the Convention were to join us for our short sitting.
