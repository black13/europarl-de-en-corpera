Mr President, let me just reiterate the point that, as I recall it, the Conference of Presidents resolved unanimously - something it very rarely does - to ask the Chairman of the Convention to join us for this part-session.
I do not know whether an official summons or invitation was issued, or whether it was declined.
That may well be the case, but I would like clarification - which we are not going to get right now - as to whether, if the Conference of Presidents' resolution was unanimous, that resolution was implemented as regards our procedure, and I would be obliged if we could be given more precise information on the subject on Thursday morning.
