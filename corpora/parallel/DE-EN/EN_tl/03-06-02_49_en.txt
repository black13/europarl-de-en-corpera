Mr President, it is with great concern that I note - as do many of our fellow citizens - a decision taken by the US Congress, which makes the implementation of an aid package for Aids amounting to USD 15 billion in value conditional upon the willingness of the recipient countries in Africa to accept supplies of genetically-modified food.
Although this composite measure is not legally binding, it is clear to me that it puts African countries under a great deal of pressure.
This, in my view, amounts to a trade policy pursued at the expense of the poorest, and that is to be repudiated!
This decision by the US Congress has made that plain, and one wonders how much leverage the biotechnology and agriculture lobbies, with their business interests, are exerting on the American administration's humanitarian aid policy.
There is no doubt that recent decades have seen many millions of dollars poured into the development of genetically-modified seeds, and now, as I see it, every market is to be pressured into opening up to them.
Humanitarian aid can, however, be effective only if it does not play second fiddle to commercial interests, and so I would like to ask the Commission what it is contemplating doing about this, or what view it takes of such a development in this area.
