Mr President, I have to start by making a statement in addition to my speaking time as acting chairman of the responsible committee.
The voting lists for Wednesday that have been circulating here so far are wrong, or at least misleading.
Let me say, referring to my own report, that Amendments Nos 1 to 5, are not the compromises they are described as in the lists.
The Committee officially withdrew them.
Amendments Nos 7 to 10 are compromise amendments, but Amendment No 6 is not, contrary to what is stated on the prepared voting list.
Amendment No 6 is not part of the compromise; indeed, as I see it, it is out of order.
I ask the Bureau to check whether it is out of order, so that Wednesday's vote can proceed in a correct manner.
Mr President, please do not include this in my speaking time.
