One of the Statute's most controversial features is the amount of remuneration involved, and I welcome the agreement that we have been able to reach on this.
I have worked in the field of equal treatment for men and women for decades.
Our constant watchword was 'equal pay for equal work'.
Discrimination on the grounds of nationality is no more defensible than that on the grounds of gender.
Legally speaking, too, Article 12 of the EC Treaty prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of nationality.
Although the European Court of Justice has been consistent in adhering to this principle in its rulings, the fact that MEPs are a special case meant that it could not apply it here.
The amount of remuneration is a matter of dispute.
Comparing it with the present parliamentary salary, a Dane would regard 50% of a judge's salary as a lot of money, whilst others wonder why the work of an MEP is meant to be worth only half that of a judge.
Whatever the case may be, it is not the MEPs who determine what they are paid; it is the Council of Ministers that has to approve this proposal.
Moreover, this new regime will not apply until the next Parliament, that is, to our successors.
As regards the pension, I am amazed that the draft report proposed that it be payable from the completion of an MEP's sixtieth year.
(Explanation of vote cut short in accordance with Rule 137 (1) of the Rules of Procedure).
