I hereby declare that I have voted in favour of the Rothley report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, as I believe it to be essential that there should be, as soon as possible, a uniform statute with the same conditions applying to all Members of the European Parliament.
This also means that major differences between the salaries of Members from the different Member States are unacceptable.
In the European Parliament, as elsewhere, there must, in the medium term, be equal pay for equal work.
I am, moreover, of the opinion that salaries must, as a matter of urgency, be made transparent - it is not acceptable that MEPs should have to use the reimbursement of travel expenses as a way of topping up their incomes.
I will, nonetheless, not be availing myself of the rule's provisions.
I took my seat under the conditions that have prevailed to date, and I will, for my own part, continue to be subject to them.
