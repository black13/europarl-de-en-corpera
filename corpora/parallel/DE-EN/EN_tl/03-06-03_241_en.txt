Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to express my thanks for your very detailed, very good and concrete response and put to you an additional question.
I am not sure whether you will be able to give me an answer to it straightaway or perhaps only in writing, after this question time.
Member States are supporting minorities in the accession countries.
For example, with the agreement of the countries concerned, Germany is giving support to the German minority in Poland and the German minority in the Czech Republic.
There is now a rumour in these countries that at least part of this support by another Member State would be unlawful after accession to the European Union.
I cannot really understand that and therefore wanted to specifically ask about it because this question is currently making people extremely worried.
Can it be that the promotion of minority languages by other Member States is unlawful in the EU?
