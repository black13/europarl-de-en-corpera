Mr President, the honourable Member is quite right, of course: we will never have enough money to do everything.
However, during the European Year of Languages, we not only gave the official languages their say; we also facilitated the provision of funding for languages which are actually spoken in the territory, if that was what associations or citizens wanted.
We must be vigilant in monitoring what is happening through our schools and in society in general.
In our schools, it is inevitable that the mother tongue is the official language, the first language.
I have always demanded that we should endeavour to teach two foreign languages in addition to the base language, and this is something that our heads of state and government have accepted.
That is one point.
The other point is respect for multiculturalism, for cultural diversity in our society, and I do believe that in some regions, languages spoken by migrants are also part of this cultural environment.
That is the reality, and it must be taken into account when analyses are carried out and language diversity is subjected to academic study.
Nonetheless, the priority, in my view, will continue to be supporting traditional languages and promoting multilingualism in our schools.
