Mr President, I am pleased to hear that the Commissioner is taking action in this area and I offer her my congratulations.
On the issue of doping, I have a very specific question: time and again, when doping cases occur, it is pointed out that the athletes were not clear about the content of the products.
A fairly simple measure which could be adopted - although it is admittedly not absolutely watertight in its effect - is to identify doping products on the label, perhaps by including a red dot or a red line on the packaging, in order to draw specific attention to the content and the risks associated with doping.
Could the Commissioner take steps in this direction?
