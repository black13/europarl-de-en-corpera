Mr President, Mr Ebner is right.
We are responsible for the labelling of medicinal products.
I have already spoken to my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne about ways in which we can label medicines in order to prevent such substances entering the body by chance - although as we know, something like that does not happen entirely by chance.
However, we also know that it is not just medicinal products that are causing the problems, but also food additives, so this whole issue is fairly complex.
However, if we want to control doping in Europe, we need a comprehensive list of the medicines and additives concerned, and this list must then be distributed - in collaboration with the sports associations - to the sportsmen and sportswomen themselves.
Therefore I believe that providing information both to sports doctors and to athletes is extremely important.
I also want, however, to point out that we do not just have a problem with professional athletes.
For example, we carried out a study on fitness centres which revealed that even teenagers - primarily young men between 15 and 17 years of age - are taking banned substances because they have seen the older ones doing so and because these substances are freely available in some of these fitness centres.
We are clearly dealing with a public health issue here, and in this respect, I believe that more political action is needed than we have seen to date.
