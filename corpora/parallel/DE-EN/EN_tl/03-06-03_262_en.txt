Mr President, I do have my own favourite sports, and I must say that boxing is not one of them.
Has France banned rugby?
That is news to me.
I need to check that and see why it has done so and what the underlying thinking was.
As far as the rest is concerned - and this is the message to be sent out during the European Year of Education through Sport - I believe that sport is enjoyable; it brings people together, both as individuals and as nations, and it must seek solutions to social problems.
It should not be a social problem itself.
