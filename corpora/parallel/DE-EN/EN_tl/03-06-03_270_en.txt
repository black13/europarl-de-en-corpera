Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Flemming, ladies and gentlemen, the senior citizens' card really should also be a symbol of the tremendous purchasing power enjoyed by senior citizens in Europe.
We are all aware of the current strikes about the pensions reform.
I think that the best practice model would be appropriate here too.
We should demonstrate which kind of best-practice reforms have achieved the target most effectively.
I would therefore like to ask you this: does the Commission have any thoughts on how to promote pensioners' power as consumers in future through best practice and benchmarks?
