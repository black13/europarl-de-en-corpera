Commissioner, age is the future for Europe and - I hope for you all - it is your own future too.
I have already reached it: I am already seventy years of age.
I am also very proud that the European Union, in Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, has the only constitution in the world to include a ban on discrimination on grounds of age.
Yet this is no longer provided for in the Convention's draft.
My question to you is this: do you see any possibility of bringing influence to bear, even at this stage, so that this unique ban on discrimination which currently exists in Europe can be included in the new constitution as well?
