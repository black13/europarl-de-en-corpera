Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that it has been possible to achieve a common position between the Council, the Commission and Parliament here.
It would have been very sad if no consensus had been reached on such an important issue.
As Mr Lund has already mentioned, the Council initially agreed unanimously that the exporters must have the approval of the importing country before they undertake the first transboundary movement.
However, in order to meet the Commission halfway, the Council and the Parliament then voted in favour of the requirement for this approval to be provided in writing prior to the first transboundary export of a GMO.
It was also possible to reach a consensus between the Parliament, the Council and the Committee with regard to the exporters' notification documents.
The exporter is required, for a period of a minimum of five years, to keep a record of the notification and the acknowledgement of receipt from the competent authority of the importing country.
He is also obliged to forward these documents to the authority of the Member State from which the GMO is exported and to the Commission.
The Commission then makes these documents available to the public in compliance with the European regulations on access to environmental information.
This new-found consensus between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission will, I believe, give the public the opportunity to be informed at all times about everything that happens.
I am certainly convinced that these provisions will be effective.
I hope very much that this new European regulation will overcome much of the public's mistrust of GMOs.
