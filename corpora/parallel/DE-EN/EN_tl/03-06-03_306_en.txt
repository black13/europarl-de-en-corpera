Mr President, I too would like to pay very warm tribute to the rapporteur.
This regulation is a great success.
It means that the eight remaining Member States yet to ratify the Protocol can now begin the process.
The Protocol will therefore come into force very soon, marking the start of a new era in international environmental law, an era of international genetic technology law.
The Biosafety Protocol is the first international treaty to regulate genetic technology, and it does so explicitly and exclusively.
It is to be hoped that the voices still raised to dispute that there is any difference between genetically-modified and conventionally bred organisms will at last fall silent.
This House has greatly improved the regulation before us on numerous points, often in exemplary cooperation with the Council.
On many key points, the regulation goes far beyond what is required by the Biosafety Protocol itself.
The fact that all groups support the compromise reached is therefore encouraging and a hopeful sign for the implementation of future environmental agreements.
