Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am now faced with the very difficult, if not impossible, task of finding something new to say.
Everything has already been said, but not yet by everyone.
I shall therefore follow everyone else's lead and express my warm thanks to the rapporteur for the good work and positive cooperation.
I would also like to congratulate him on his excellent substantive work, as well as on his great sensitivity during the negotiations, which enabled us to achieve a compromise among the parliamentary groups and among the European institutions.
I think that is absolutely crucial.
It has already been said repeatedly here today that the speedy entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol is naturally an issue that is close to everyone's hearts.
However, I do not want to pass up the opportunity to express my great regret that the largest exporter of genetically-modified organisms, namely the United States, again remains outside the frame on such a key issue, where global multilateral regulations are essential.
We face a major political challenge, that of convincing our counterparts in the United States of the need for such regulation.
The common position is also a great success.
In substantive terms, the Council endorsed almost 70 per cent of the position adopted by Parliament at first reading.
I note with satisfaction, especially as rapporteur for genetically-modified food and feed, that there is clearly something of a tradition here, with the Council generally following Parliament's position.
I hope that the vote tomorrow will be a major step towards the ratification of the Cartagena Protocol.
