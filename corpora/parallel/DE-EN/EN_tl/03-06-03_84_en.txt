Mr President, criticism has already been expressed this morning of the ways in which strikes are bringing life in France to a standstill.
Although, along with the criticism, there has also been sympathy, I do not comprehend how it is that strikes in France are a reason for this House's air conditioning not working.
All morning, it has been quite impossible to do any work in the offices on the side of the building facing the sun.
As far as the current temperature in the Chamber is concerned, the union probably would not allow work to be done under these conditions.
(Applause)
