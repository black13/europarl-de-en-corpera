Mr President, I voted in favour of the Turmes report.
I think it was an excellent report, and I would like to praise Mr Turmes very highly once again.
Without his commitment this report would not have been so outstanding.
The main achievement in this report is the introduction of electricity 'labelling', so that consumers will in future know where their electricity comes from and how it is produced, so that they will finally be able to decide if they want to buy nuclear electricity or electricity generated from renewables.
This also gives consumers an opportunity to participate in decisions about environmental policy, and that is a tremendous achievement.
Because we know that only freedom of choice creates responsible citizens capable of mature judgment, and such responsible citizens conversely want that freedom of choice so that they can take part in decision-making.
I hope that it will be possible to implement this in the Member States in a practical way so that consumers really are given this opportunity.
Otherwise, I am also very happy of course that we have finally found a means of ensuring that competition law also applies to nuclear energy.
It is time we finally stripped nuclear energy of its privileges.
It should not be possible, in a liberalised internal market, for nuclear energy to have a special status and not to be subject to competition law.
