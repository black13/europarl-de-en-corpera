Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly hope - and I say this from the bottom of my heart - I truly hope that Turkey will one day be a democratic country, for then some people in this House will find it hard to formulate speeches.
My dear Mr Langen, I think very highly of you, but I have heard this speech often in the past, irrespective of what is happening in Turkey.
It will no longer be possible to make some of these speeches because they always say the same thing, no matter what is going on in Turkey.
In reality - and Commissioner Verheugen discussed this in some detail - we can see that a great deal is happening, but that it is not enough - quite right!
We want more, we criticise Turkey - quite right!
Please be honest, however, ladies and gentlemen!
For many of you - you have heard only four speeches - all the human rights and civil rights are nothing but a facade.
Many of you simply do not want Turkey.
Just say it honestly, and then we will know where we stand.
Let us tell Turkey straight, and we can dispense with this performance!
Anything else really is just a performance.
As a Member of this House I am pleased that the Council and the Commission have a greater degree of competence as regards shaping foreign policy, because the Parliament of which I am a Member is not capable of doing so.
