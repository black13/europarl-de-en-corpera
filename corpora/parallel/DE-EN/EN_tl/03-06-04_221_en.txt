Mr President, thank you for your very sound answer.
Even before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Bavaria maintained a close partnership with Ukraine and my colleague Mr Radwan and I have just given a massive boost to trade with Ukraine.
Trade and business need a framework, however.
For this reason, I would like to raise two quite specific questions: first, to what extent is the TACIS Programme being intensified, with a focus on institution building and training up a new, younger generation of executives to work in the government, the judiciary and the administration?
This, after all, is where the shortage is greatest, and the reason why the economy is unable to function.
The framework for the rule of law is not functioning.
My second specific question, Mr President, concerns the geostrategic situation that you mentioned.
Here, of course, the countries in the southern Caucasus play an important role, although they will not be direct neighbours of the EU.
I wanted to ask you what the role of the southern Caucasus is in terms of cooperation with the Black Sea states?
