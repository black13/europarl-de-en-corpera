Mr President, I hope my question is addressed to the Council, because Member States still have authority over matters of foreign and security policy.
I would like to point out at this juncture that although GALILEO is primarily a private-sector project, and one in which we also want to have private-sector services, in a common project for a stronger European Union foreign and security policy we should be setting the course now to ensure that in future infrastructure services and information services will be available and can be purchased at European level.
Up to now, unfortunately, we have not had the infrastructure.
We talk about a rapid reaction force, and in order to be able to act in future in the area of foreign policy, we must be able to rely on GALILEO.
This is why a line should be made available here, and this is certainly something that is also in the interests of the Council.
