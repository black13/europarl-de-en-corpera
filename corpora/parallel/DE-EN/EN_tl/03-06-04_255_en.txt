Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to make a brief comment regarding my question 3 concerning Ukraine: it goes without saying that this is a matter for the European Union, because the accession of Russia and Ukraine to the WTO has consequences affecting this and this will probably also be a topic for discussion at the Council in Thessaloniki.
My question concerning the Thessaloniki Council, however, is this: the Council called for an impact study to be carried out on Basle II, the framework agreement on the creditworthiness of businesses.
The Commission has not yet done this.
At the last sitting you promised me you would takes steps to this effect.
What has happened here as regards the Council's enquiry or as regards the Council's cooperation with the Commission?
Are there plans to undertake such a study?
