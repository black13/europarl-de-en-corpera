Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome this discussion enormously.
I also thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, because had it not been for this initiative on the part of Mrs Smet, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport would probably not be in the situation at all where our enquiry is being debated at least in this Parliament.
Mrs Pack pointed out that the Committee on Culture has been waiting for months for our questions - just the questions - relating to applying coordination in the field of culture, education, youth, the media and sport to be dealt with here at all.
This makes it abundantly clear that something is not right with the system.
The debate this evening is an opportunity to lay the issues on the table, and I hope that we will also come to some conclusions.
The method of open coordination can certainly make an important contribution to helping us meet the public's expectations, and to improve coordination in important areas of policy where we do not want harmonisation.
In my experience, however, this process will not gain public approval if it is not a democratic process.
And to date it has not been democratic; it has been intergovernmental.
This is why it is up to us to do something about it.
If we believe efficiency to be contradictory to democracy, or flexibility or transparency contradictory to the responsible involvement of Parliament, then this - in my opinion - is indeed a sad reflection on our own shortcomings.
This is why I hope that this debate and report can help to ensure that we finish our homework within a few weeks after the conclusion of the Convention, and that this House - and especially the two committees concerned - can respond to these questions.
