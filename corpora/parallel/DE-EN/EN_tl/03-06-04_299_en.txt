Madam President, I cannot support the report as a matter of principle.
The objective of the so-called open method of coordination is to have a legislative effect in various areas of policy, and there is no proper legal basis for this in the EU Treaty.
This means that the Council and the Commission can create competences at the European level at will without having the legitimacy to do so.
This does nothing for legal clarity or for legal truth, and it certainly does nothing to gain public acceptance.
I also know, however, that coordination in various areas is already possible, definitely necessary and perfectly sensible.
We can always learn from others.
But turning this legal, voluntary coordination into a set of quasi-legislative instruments and conferring on it, moreover, the power to apply sanctions, makes European actions completely incomprehensible.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, of which I too am a member, knows exactly how sensitive and varied are the traditions in individual Member States; the fact that it is precisely this committee that is approving this presumptuous acquisition of competences by the back door, as it were, in an own-initiative report, is, I think, much to be regretted.
We have always promoted a clear delimitation of competences for Europe and respect for competences in the nations and regions, which demand these things, and open coordination amounts to a slap in the face for them.
Furthermore, I could not celebrate the involvement of Parliament in this method as a great achievement, because it would not actually change anything about it.
Indeed, I believe it would make matters even worse, because it would give a veneer of democracy to this method, which in no way corresponds to the principles of the rule of law.
