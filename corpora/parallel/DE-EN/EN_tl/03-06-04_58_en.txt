Mr President, I propose that we should reject that suggestion, for the simple reason that in its opinion the Commission clearly spelt out that this is a very serious proposal.
We have now been discussing this subject for five years, and it would not make any sense at all to re-run all those discussions.
It is high time we made a decision on this subject, and I can only call on the House to reach a decision now and not to perpetuate this never-ending debate.
I therefore call on you to reject the proposal for referral back to committee.
(Applause)
