Mr President, the Commission has certainly made a positive contribution here, for which I offer my sincere thanks.
Its support for the Parliament's position is welcome.
There has, incidentally, been a misunderstanding about Article 33 that would not have arisen if we had based our discussion on the German text.
On the subject of misunderstandings, I would like to point out that the amendment tabled by my group to delete Article 5 of the resolution simply means that, as the Bureau has agreed the reform, it no longer makes any sense of course to call on the Bureau to adopt this particular reform.
That has been settled, and there is nothing more to it than that.
Perhaps you will permit me, Mr President, to make a further point.
We are voting on the Statute today; it is to be adopted today.
This is a decision under Article 190(5) of the Treaty.
We are not voting on whether we want the reform or not, as some newspapers have suggested.
That is not the case at all.
We all want the reform.
But I would be grateful to those who are highlighting this aspect in particular if they would finally stop denigrating the majority of this House by suggesting that we wanted to block this reform by linking it with other, legitimate political objectives.
This is therefore a decision under Article 190(5).
Nevertheless, as far as taxes are concerned, we are open to the Council's proposal that an additional national tax should be introduced for a limited number of Member States.
We are quite open to that suggestion.
Mr President, your speech yesterday following the vote was a very worthy one.
It was a fine speech that was a testament to your political wisdom.
It was also courageous, and I hope that this House will summon up the courage to accept its political responsibility.
There is a great deal at stake here today.
I implore you, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of the peoples of Europe, those whom we serve, to summon up that political courage!
(Applause)
