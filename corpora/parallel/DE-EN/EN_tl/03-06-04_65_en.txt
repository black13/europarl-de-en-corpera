Mr President, with the next three reports this House is voting on the package negotiated with the Council on the decision to create an internal energy market in Europe.
As acting chairman of the committee responsible, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I am obliged to make a statement here before we continue.
The House is voting on 50 amendments in three reports.
This compromise document is accompanied by two statements.
One is the statement by the Commission, which the Vice-President of the Commission presented to the House during Monday's debate, and that is recorded in the Minutes.
It is also accompanied by an interinstitutional statement by Parliament, Council and Commission, and it has been agreed that this statement should be read into the Minutes of Parliament, that both statements should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union with the legislative text and that this arrangement should also be recorded in Parliament's Minutes now.
I am therefore obliged to read out the interinstitutional statement here.
I can reassure you that it is not very long.
It reads as follows: 'The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission underline the need for Member States to ensure that adequate financial resources for decommissioning and waste management activities, which are audited in Member States, are actually available for the purpose for which they have been established and are managed in a transparent way, thus avoiding obstacles to fair competition in the energy market'.
Mr President, I ask you to sign this statement on behalf of this House and to arrange for its publication in the Official Journal.
