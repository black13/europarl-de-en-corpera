Mr President, this report is about the phasing out as quickly as possible of old oil tankers, which have been responsible, for example, for the Prestige disaster.
We have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission that what the committee has agreed is also a common decision, and that we can complete the first reading today.
I therefore urge all honourable Members to vote in favour of the committee's proposals; otherwise we will put the timetable at risk.
If we can complete the first reading, this regulation would come into force in the summer, allowing us to achieve a major improvement in maritime safety in our European waters.
Amendments Nos 33 and 34 have been withdrawn by the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, and I therefore hope that other Members will only wish to vote on the committee's amendments.
