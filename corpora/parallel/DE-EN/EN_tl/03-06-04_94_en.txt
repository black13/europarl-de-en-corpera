Mr President, I voted against the Rothley report for the following reasons.
I would in principle have been in favour of the Statute for Members, but I find it unacceptable that we have not succeeded in introducing a proper scheme for travel costs or in aligning the pensionable age with that which is customary in the Member States.
I believe that we have undermined our credibility as a parliament.
I myself have never had any problems, for example, with the fact that our Italian colleagues have more money than we do.
We have to accept that a lot of work in the EU Member States is not uniformly remunerated.
I believe that a statute of this kind only makes sense if the arrangements that have been adopted up to now in the guise of a travel scheme are appropriately modified by means of that statute.
Another point is that I feel I should be subject to the same taxation as my constituents.
We represent our constituents in our Member States, and I believe that our pensionable age and tax status should be the same as for those who elect us.
Otherwise we are creating special rights for Members that are inappropriate, especially at a time when the cultural crisis means that ordinary citizens are struggling to make ends meet.
That is why I voted against this report despite being in favour of the statute in principle.
But I do not think it is acceptable, because it creates too many unjustifiable privileges, and because we have unfortunately not succeeded in changing the travel arrangements.
