I have a great deal of understanding and admiration for the tremendous amount of work that all our rapporteurs have done under Mr Daul's excellent presidency.
I know how difficult it was to obtain majorities for these reports.
I regret therefore that I cannot give Mr Cunha's report my unconditional support, because the proposed solution of partial decoupling would place a considerable burden on the existence of multifunctional agriculture in the less-favoured region of Luxembourg, with very familiar economic, social and environmental consequences.
This is a responsibility that I cannot and do not wish to assume.
Problems with the transfer of payment entitlements will arise whether decoupling is full or partial.
I fear that the proposal which concerns transfer of payment entitlements with leased land will lead to big problems of a financial and legal nature, as well as to unpredictable speculation at the expense of active farms.
The fundamental problems with modulation also remain, even if the percentages of reduction are set at a low level.
Reducing aid through modulation leads to an unreasonable drop in agricultural income.
For our farmers, the figure of EUR 7 500 is too low.
That is why I have tabled an amendment to raise this to EUR 10 000.
Otherwise, practically all of Luxembourg's farmers would suffer losses in income of up to 20%, which would be catastrophic.
