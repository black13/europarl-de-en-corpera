I am to a large extent in agreement with the reports on the organisation of the milk market, because the quota arrangements are being retained until 2014 as an instrument to regulate production and guarantee prices, which will give the reliability that is so essential for the continued existence of the family farm and will give farmers the security to enable them to plan accordingly.
However, I am in favour of those proposals on the reports concerning the milk sector that quite rightly point out that it is in the disadvantaged areas in particular that milk production plays a vitally important role, and that for this reason, when deciding on the basis for calculating the milk subsidy, the special situation of individual Member States should be taken into consideration by the differentiated lowering of the intervention price for butter and skimmed milk powder.
In the areas in question an extra EUR 5 per tonne should be paid in subsidies.
I should also like to say, about the agricultural reports overall, that I am not entirely convinced that the compulsion to take action is so great that we should have to shoot all our bolts now, in one go, before the next round of negotiations in Cancun, thereby running the risk of having to make even greater concessions which would lead to the demolition of the common agricultural policy and with it the demise of the small farmer in large parts of Europe.
Finally, the farm budget has been set up until 2013, which is why the budget-policy constraints that we are always hearing about are not present to the extent that is repeatedly asserted by the Commission and even here in Parliament.
