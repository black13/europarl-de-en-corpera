Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I should like to make the following comments about the Oostlander report.
We have agreed to this report, because it would be a way of bringing Turkey closer to European standards.
However, we attach importance to the conclusion that this report should not automatically be the start of anything.
With regard to Turkey's possible accession to the European Union, many members of our group do not share the view that it should join the European Union, although naturally we would like to have close and friendly relations with it as a partner.
To that extent we believe it is important to state, having given our agreement to the Oostlander report, that, if and when it comes to a decision on Turkey's membership of the European Union, it will be up to individuals to decide freely, that any such decision lies in the future, and that our agreement to the Oostlander report in no way forms a preliminary decision anticipating any such decision that may be taken in the future.
