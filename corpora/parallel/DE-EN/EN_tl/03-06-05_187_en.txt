Mr President, I am entitled to make both a personal statement and a statement concerning the Rules of Procedure.
Mr van Hulten has invited me to respect democratic decisions.
It was a democratic decision of this House that this report should be dealt with this afternoon.
Therefore it is not I who have gone against a democratic decision.
Secondly, you have taken Rule 145 as your basis, and I should like to draw your attention to Rule 145(2), which states quite clearly, 'If the proposal or request is carried, only one member may speak from each political group which has not yet provided a speaker in that debate'.
That means that, if Rule 145 had really been applied, an opportunity to speak would have had to be given to one Member from each group!
I am therefore really asking that these things should be clarified.
