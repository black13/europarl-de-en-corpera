Mr President, Commissioner, in Burma twenty leading opposition members have been arrested, including Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the holder of Parliament's Sakharov Prize, and the President of the League for Democracy.
Over one hundred offices of the League have been closed down, its supporters have been persecuted and arrested, and according to our information just recently seventy sympathisers were killed in the North of the country by armed troops of the military junta.
In the past few years, after the European Union had quite rightly suspended trade-facilitation measures and blocked foreign capital, the first positive effects were felt.
In 2002 Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest, and there were justified hopes of reform, and so the EU decided to withdraw certain sanctions until the end of the year.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is asking that the Government of Burma should now release from arrest the Nobel Prize winner, her fellow-campaigners and the political prisoners.
Persecution and murders must be brought to an immediate end.
Universities, schools and the offices of the League for Democracy must finally be reopened.
We are also asking for free elections under independent international observation.
If the military junta continues to refuse to introduce a course of reforms which is so badly needed, then the visa ban must be extended and capital must remain frozen, without any possibility of licences being granted.
The ASEAN States, the United Nations and the international community must be made to discharge their obligations, so that pressure from Europe receives wide support.
