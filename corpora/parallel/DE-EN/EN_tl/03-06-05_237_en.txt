Mr President, I wonder how often we want to continue going through the Zimbabwe ritual here in the topical and urgent debate process.
We have passed so many resolutions that we refer to them only en bloc, and hardly even bother to count them anymore.
I could really just play back a recording of my last speech, because fundamentally nothing has changed there, unfortunately.
If anything things have just become worse for the people in Zimbabwe.
Even those who have written for our esteemed Commissioner the words that she is just about to say to us could probably, in the main, have substituted what they wrote last time, because the situation has not changed.
The real political problem facing the EU is not so much what it does as what it does not do.
I would like to say to the Council, which as usual is not present, that one can do wrong even by doing nothing.
Must it come to a situation like the one in the Congo?
What Mrs Maes said was right: there are worse situations in Africa than the one in Zimbabwe.
Do conditions have to become like those in the Congo?
How many deaths will it take before the Council at least stops making the Zimbabwe Minister for Industry and Trade welcome in the EU, or even takes effective action against Mugabe?
We are sending an intervention force to the Congo.
Obviously the requisite number of people must have been killed there.
In the case of Zimbabwe, however, we did not even refuse entry to a minister.
I am very much in favour of our attempting, jointly, under French leadership, to restore peace in the Congo, but I would also like to say clearly that we cannot accept it when France, on the subject of Zimbabwe, has for years prevented or delayed effective measures or has actively blocked them.
The Council must obviously face up to its responsibilities here and, if necessary, we must invite the relevant individual governments to come and explain themselves to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
