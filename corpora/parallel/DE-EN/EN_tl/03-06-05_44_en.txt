Mr President, we have a very good report here, thanks in large part to the rapporteur, who leaves us in no doubt that he understands this matter in practice as well as theory.
It has just been said that we have to distinguish between businesses on the basis of size.
I would be cautious about this though, as it is a question of transparency rather than size.
We talk about creating transparency through the 'from stable to table' concept.
Well, small businesses are transparent precisely because consumers understand them and have direct contact with them.
If something is wrong, they report it.
Mr Schnellhardt, you write that 'confidence is good, control is better'.
I would agree with this, but nevertheless, confidence has to be discerning.
We have to know in whom we can put our trust.
The big problem is that meat is marketed anonymously and no one actually understands how.
This anonymity is a cover for business deals that are criminal and practices that only just border on legality and of which the consumer would certainly not approve.
We have just heard about water with protein being added to chicken in order to sell something cheap at an expensive price, and protein so subverted that it is not possible to detect the DNA or determine from which species of animal it comes.
These examples show how the ethics in food consumption - if I may use this expression - are being abused as a result of this anonymity and at the cost of the consumer's health.
And that is why it is a question of increasing not just confidence, but legitimate confidence.
This has to do with making consumers more discerning.
Of course, producers do have responsibility, and we have talked here about their individual responsibility, but so do consumers, who have to take responsibility for their health by informing themselves.
