Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, is of course part of a far larger project.
Mr Schnellhardt's education makes him an expert, which is why his reports are extremely sound and often, perhaps, even a little too technical for the layman.
But that probably says more about him than about us!
I would like, therefore, to start by congratulating him on the document we have before us.
We need food safety.
This is something that we are all aware of, and that we support.
This report is even more significant, though, because meat, milk and fish are basic foodstuffs.
Professional controls are of crucial importance here.
To adopt highly comprehensive standards is not enough if, at the same time, we either ignore controls and sanctions or take insufficient notice of them.
Official controls are in the safe hands of veterinarians here and I hope they are duly appreciated, even by the consumer.
Mr President, of course I completely understand that fellow Members coming in to the room might not give much attention to the subject under discussion.
I am frequently in the same boat as them.
But if you could at least see to it that the noise level improves, I might even be able to hear myself speak above this terrible din.
I had hoped that you might at least listen to me, Mr President, as Mrs Diamantopoulou is doing.
(The President cut off the speaker and called for quiet in the Chamber)
Thank you, Mr President.
The problem of the size and transparency of businesses has been touched upon many times.
Commissioner, I think that we simply need more flexibility for smaller businesses.
We cannot treat large slaughterhouses like artisanal small businesses.
I would ask you, therefore, to give appropriate consideration to creating the conditions for small- and medium-sized businesses to survive, whilst, at the same time, taking into account the vital matter of consumer protection.
