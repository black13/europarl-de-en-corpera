Mr President, I would like to come back to Mrs Malliori's request.
I spoke on this subject about a week ago, to be exact on the last day of the part-session.
The problem is that the agenda is adopted on Monday, but not adhered to by Thursday.
I believe it is inaccurate for Mrs Malliori to say that her report is being postponed until this afternoon.
Today's agenda states that the time allocated to all reports - from Mrs JÃ¶ns's through to Mrs Fourtou's - is 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., which gives us until 4.30 p.m. to discuss this report.
If it becomes the accepted thing to request that reports are dealt with without debate in order to be finished by 12 noon on Thursday, then people should say on Monday that a debate is not required when we are adopting the agenda.
Last time, I said that this was a dangerous precedent, and indeed it is one.
We have had two hours for the topical and urgent debate on the reform of the Rules of Procedure taken away from us for nothing, on the grounds that this time was needed for other work, and leaving us with just one hour.
This time should then either be used or given back for the topical and urgent debate.
