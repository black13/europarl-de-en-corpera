Mr President, I have just two points, which are however important because they are questions of principle.
Firstly, in future we should decide on Monday whether a matter is important enough to require debate or not.
On Monday, we scheduled this matter for Thursday afternoon, so why are we cancelling it now?
If it is important, it makes no difference whether it is discussed in the morning or in the afternoon.
Secondly - and this is a crucial point which I last brought up during another debate on a Thursday afternoon - you have, or your predecessor has, just taken a vote which is not permissible.
According to our Rules of Procedure, only the President of Parliament can decide whether to cancel a debate.
It is his decision alone, and there are extremely important reasons for this.
We voted to establish the agenda on Monday and I have to clarify whether or not this decision to change it is the President's.
According to the Rules of Procedure, this decision is his alone, but in this case he has not taken on that responsibility.
(Applause)
