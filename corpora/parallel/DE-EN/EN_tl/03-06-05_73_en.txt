Mr President, the next vote is on Amendment No 33.
Part 3 of the preamble to this amendment concerns an external source of protection.
The German version of the text reads 'suitable external source of protection' and the original text reads 'qualified external source of protection'.
The two things are not the same, and therefore I should like the German version to be corrected so that it is in line with the original, even though it may not read like good German.
I should also like this point to be recorded in the minutes.
