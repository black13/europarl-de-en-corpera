Mr President, regarding the question that Mr Posselt has raised, I would just like to say that I think you acted correctly.
I would, however, prefer to give my opinion on this matter later in view of the votes that still have to be taken.
In the new Rules of Procedure, there is a provision allowing the Council and Commission speaking time to comment on the report after we have heard from the rapporteur.
There seem to be more and more cases now where the rapporteur speaks for five minutes, and then the Council for fifteen minutes and the Commission for ten to fifteen minutes, and often not even really on the subject of the report.
This means that Members themselves are receiving less and less time to discuss it.
I would therefore ask that the speechwriters of the Commission and Council Presidency be told to comply as far as possible with the speaking time of five minutes, with a maximum time of ten minutes.
Otherwise a good provision in our new Rules of Procedure is misused to give lengthy explanations, which often have nothing to do with the report.
I would ask the President, if he agrees with me, to notify both institutions of this.
