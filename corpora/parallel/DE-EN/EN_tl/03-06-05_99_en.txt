Mr President, in my opinion, Mr van Hulten's approach is not the right one.
This does not have to do with those who were in favour of Fridays, but who were never here then.
It has to do with those who were not in favour of Fridays but who now treat Thursday in the same way they used to treat Friday, that is, by being absent.
Today, some of the leading players who were not in favour of Fridays have been gone since midday.
We need to finally get through to these people!
