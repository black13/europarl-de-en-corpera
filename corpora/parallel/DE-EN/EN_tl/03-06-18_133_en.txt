Mr President, some of the previous speakers have pointed out that, without parties, there is no democracy, and to that I have to add that there is no democracy without gender equality.
We know that women are still very much under-represented, even though they make up half of Europe's population.
If women are not adequately represented in political life, this also shows how little progress the political parties have made as regards gender equality.
The political parties now have the task of making the principle of equality a political reality, and parties funded with European money also have the task of representing the public in an appropriate way.
We therefore want the Statute on European political parties to make the allocation of funds conditional upon a balanced male/female ratio.
The parity that we are proposing should be an obvious thing, and it is indeed regarded as such in a number of Member States, France being an example.
The French National Assembly unanimously adopted a law on parity.
We should not merely be paying lip-service by stressing how important equality is.
Today, we have again made this clear in the Convention, where equality of treatment has been set down, once and for all, as a fundamental value.
Nor must we merely appeal to the business world and demand that it should refrain from discrimination, if we ourselves are not willing to do so.
That would lose us our credibility.
I therefore appeal to you to adopt our proposals as a matter of urgency.
