Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday and following long negotiations, the Council reached agreement on the statute for European political parties.
We therefore have a major opportunity today of passing, at first reading, this law that is so important for democracy and transparency in Europe.
If that is to be possible, we must, in the course of the codecision procedure, make the Council and Parliament texts compatible.
All the compromise amendments before you fulfil this objective.
Whoever, therefore, wants us today to take the momentous step of deciding upon this party statute must vote in favour of the compromise amendments and reject all the others.
The translations had to be carried out very quickly between Monday and Wednesday.
I would therefore ask Parliament's language service to check the text for compatibility with the Council's text, especially where the numbering is concerned, and also to add paragraph 3 of the Council's text, which we ourselves forgot about, to Amendment No 55.
