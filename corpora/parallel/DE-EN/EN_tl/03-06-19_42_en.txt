Mr President, my congratulations to Parliament and to all those who have also offered their help.
This really is a good day for European democracy.
There can be no European democracy without European political parties.
As we also said in yesterday's discussion in connection with the constitution and the outcome of the Convention, this statute is an important step towards giving politics a fully European dimension.
Allow me to thank all those who have offered their help: Mr Tsatsos and also Mrs Schleicher who, with this Parliament's reports, prepared the way years ago; and next, of course, the Commission, which submitted the draft law to us very quickly once the Treaty of Nice had come into effect.
Most particularly, I should like to thank the Greek Presidency of the Council, for which this was quite a major commitment, and a very successful one.
My sincere thanks to my Greek fellow MEPs.
We have a lot of European statutes that are not yet operational.
Today, we finally have one that can come into effect and that works.
(Applause)
