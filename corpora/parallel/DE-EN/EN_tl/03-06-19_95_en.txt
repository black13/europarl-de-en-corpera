I am voting against the report, since a political document that is silent about the conditions in European jails designed for deportees, about deaths at the borders, basically caused by European border controls, and about the structural racism of European immigration policy does not deserve to be endorsed.
What is more, European migration policy pursues two objectives: it increases the isolation of Fortress Europe by shifting border controls further upstream, namely to countries of transit and origin; and it optimises the economic exploitation of what are, from a capitalist point of view, 'usable' labour forces.
The report before us attacks, however, neither the reduction in the level of protection for refugees to the lowest common denominator nor the hypocrisy and double standards in the so-called 'fight against illegal immigration', aimed at militarising the borders at the same time as purloining cheap labour forces.
It even still welcomes the introduction of common border controls.
The deportation agreements that are being urged upon third countries by the EU are not up for debate.
The report before us does not even begin to criticise this repressive and xenophobic behaviour.
Instead, a large majority in Parliament applauds a toothless report representing the wretched political mainstream.
I do not add my voice to this majority.
