Mr President, I do indeed have an objection to make to this.
That this House takes lawmaking seriously and treats it as being important is good practice.
You will be aware that, tomorrow, as the Conference of Presidents has decided in its wisdom, we will first be having an associated second-reading debate on genetically-modified food and traceability, followed by a joint debate on food legislation, part of which will be on a second reading, and then there will be other debates, also on second readings.
Without wishing to belittle the oral question put by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I am convinced that the order of debate proposed by the Conference of Presidents was the right one.
I sympathise with the Commission, which evidently has organisational problems, and I am sure - indeed, I have absolute confidence - that it can sort these organisational problems out, and that it will be in a position later in the day to give an answer to this question.
