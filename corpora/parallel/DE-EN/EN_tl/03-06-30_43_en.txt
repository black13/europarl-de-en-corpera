Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I share Mr MacCormick's view.
Mr Camre's utterances, which are at issue here, are surely utterly unacceptable and intolerable, nor could they ever enjoy anyone's political support.
That, however, is not what this was about.
This was simply about the question as to whether this is one of those instances - to be found in previous exemplary cases - in which we have, in the past, come to the decision that a Member's freedom of speech is inseparable from his duties as an MEP, that is to say, from his mandate.
Mr Camre came out with these utterances at his party conference in Denmark, and this is a quite classic case in which we must assume that he was acting in connection with his mandate as an MEP.
I might add that Mr MacCormick's report, as well as the opinion that our secretariat has been so kind as to draw up, clearly show that this is the decision we came to in the past.
I believe that this House is also under a self-imposed obligation to continue to come to similar decisions, most especially when it is obvious that political activities are concerned.
Apart from that, the different ways in which each Member State deals with these things will, in the long term, only be resolved if - as Mr Rothley has mentioned in his report - a single European immunity law is soon on the way.
It is the Council that holds the key to this.
Let the Council simply adopt our statute.
The Council would also be making a great contribution to progress if it were to give some thought, perhaps in the course of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as to whether it might be appropriate and possible, in line with our resolutions, to amend the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities as part of the new Treaty provisions.
