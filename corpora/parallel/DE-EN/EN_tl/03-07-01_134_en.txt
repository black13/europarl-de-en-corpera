Mr President, although a lot has been said in today's debate about threshold values, and about their being politically arbitrary, I would like to emphasise how important it was for this House, at first reading, to specify a figure of 0.5%, even though many were not happy about it.
The fact is that, if this figure of 0.5% had not been hammered out and adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we would not have such a rigorous Common Position and also the present basis for negotiating an acceptable compromise on co-existence.
The second point I would like to address is that I do not think it is very fair for us to be now acting as if we were about to vote 'yes' or 'no' to genetically modified organisms.
We know for a fact that we do not have the option of saying 'no', whether to GMOs or to many chemicals and other products.
That is one reason why I campaigned for the most stringent conditions in the authorisation process and for comprehensive labelling.
Mrs Flemming's criticism was that the method of labelling was politically dishonest.
I would ask her - although she is no longer here - whether not labelling something that was 100% composed of GMOs would mean that we were being more politically honest with consumers.
I believe that the European public are perfectly grown-up enough to come to their own opinions on this, and also that biotechnology cannot but become more credible and be taken more seriously if it does not hide behind badly-framed rules on labelling.
To those who draw attention to their energetic campaigning for labelling as 'GMO-free', I have always said that the fact that products are 'GMO-free' can be indicated by additional labelling.
We cannot conceal from consumers the fact that genetically-modified organisms are everywhere.
I believe that we have to stress the fact, and bring it to people's attention, that this stance was friendly only to industry and not to the consumer.
