Mr President, both these regulations are meant to establish a single new, Europe-wide, legal framework for the authorisation, labelling and traceability of genetically modified food and feedingstuffs.
Consumers have minds of their own and want to be informed - about ingredients, composition, and additives; some of them want information about methods of production.
We have to meet this need for information, especially in those areas where ignorance gives rise to fears.
Consumers want to use choice as a means of getting rid of uncertainty.
People are afraid of anything that is new.
As we have no long-term experience of GMOs, information is urgently needed if there is to be freedom of choice.
I support the compromise.
If we are to put this important regulation into effect, we now have to avoid a conciliation procedure.
Only if it is adopted soon will it be possible to end the moratorium, thus avoiding trade disputes with the USA, Canada and Argentina.
I hope that the EU will shortly abandon its reservations about GMOs.
If people had opposed the wheel when it was invented, we would still be going everywhere on foot.
