Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to be able to catch your eye.
I have just one question for the Commissioners.
Do you not think that there is a certain contradiction inherent in the recommendations?
If you are in favour of more incentives for research in order to get better medicines to the patients more quickly, and if all the G10 countries have said so too, then why does it appear from the policy agreement on the pharmaceuticals package as if the provision being made for data protection, as regards the creation of a return on innovations, is insufficiently long-term, so that research is not being driven forward?
Do you not also think that the safest and best way of providing patients quickly with better medicines would, in principle, be a fast and simple central procedure, and that it would be better if the Commission and the Member States were to hand out more money for research projects and at last get round to submitting the new legislation on children's medicines to Parliament?
That would enable us to do something more quickly about getting people better medicines.
