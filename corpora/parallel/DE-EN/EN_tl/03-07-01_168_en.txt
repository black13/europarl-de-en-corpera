Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lage's question addresses the issue of access to Portuguese continental waters, which features in the Council's consideration of the new regime applicable to Western waters.
The Commission's task in this is to ensure that two principles are maintained, the first being the principle of relative stability, which is laid down in Article 20 of the new framework regulation for the common fisheries policy.
This principle, according to which fishing opportunities are to be shared out among the Member States, applies, of course, to Portugal and to Portuguese waters.
Another principle in the common fisheries policy, in addition to this one, is that of free access to waters outside the twelve-mile-zone, which is laid down in Article 17 of the new framework regulation, and which is of fundamental importance.
When dealing with the issue of access to Portuguese continental waters, the Commission clearly has to adopt the same approach as it does to all other Community waters.
Although all Member States have to have access to waters outside the twelve-mile-zone, this access can be restricted on biological grounds, but restrictions of this sort must not be discriminatory in their effects.
For that reason, it is not possible in law to protect fish stocks by denying fishermen from a neighbouring country access to these waters.
There is a solution, however, and the right one is to have relative stability, together with total allowable catches, quotas for stocks of economic importance, and any further technical measures that may prove necessary.
