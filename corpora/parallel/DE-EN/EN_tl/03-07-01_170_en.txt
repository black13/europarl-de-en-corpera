Mr President, I am aware that various sections of Portuguese society have reacted in this way, but you will also understand that the only option open to us is that of acting within the legal framework available to us.
I have told you that there is a solution in practical terms, above all if the Spanish and the Portuguese are willing to meet each other halfway when quotas are laid down.
What is actually at issue, and of the essence, here is sardine fishery, for which, in this stretch of sea, no quota has been set up until now.
We are, however, prepared to set such a quota, and it stands to reason that, when this is done, it will be possible to specify how much of this quota is to be fished by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen respectively.
We would then have a solution that would, I believe, be acceptable to everyone.
