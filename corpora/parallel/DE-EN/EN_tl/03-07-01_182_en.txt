Mr President, I am obliged to the Commissioner for his reply.
As we know, we tend to see Africa as very largely characterised by single industries; on the other hand, though, Africans see Europe as very much made up of conglomerates.
What I want to ask you is what the Commission is doing in order - and I do know that this is in practice very difficult - to build up cooperation between sub-Saharan Africa and the European Union as regards small and medium-sized enterprises.
There is virtually nothing moving on that front.
I would like to know what is being done in the area of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises.
Although most small businesses still do not dare to venture into the region, I do believe that they would make very important partners for Africa, if it is not to be dominated by single industries and conglomerates to the exclusion of all else.
