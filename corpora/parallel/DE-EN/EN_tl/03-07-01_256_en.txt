Mr President, Commissioner, the point at issue is that the wording in the compromise is 'studies currently in progress', and I stressed in my speech the fact that these things have not been researched before.
If our new directive leads industry to consider requesting a study, is it possible that it is only now that I would commission one?
That was the question - not whether current studies would be taken into account, but whether it is possible that future studies will be.
