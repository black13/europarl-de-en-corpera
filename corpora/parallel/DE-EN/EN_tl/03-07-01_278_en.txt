Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Corbey has presented for its second reading a report the essentials of which I can endorse.
We need the best possible systems to deal with what amounts to some 58 million tonnes of packaging material produced every year in the European Union, an amount that is increasing from year to year.
In so doing, we would be ensuring that the environment is better cared for and giving important sectors of industry the security to plan ahead.
Among those we will be voting on tomorrow, there is one amendment that I regard as particularly important.
Amendment No 4 has to do with packaging materials in small quantities, which are therefore subject to a very low market penetration in the Member States.
One material that occurs in small quantities of this sort is ceramic packaging; for example, ceramic bottles, pots, and bowls made in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, are mainly used for the packaging of brandies, chocolates, and pat√©s.
Ceramic packaging accounts for only 0.1% of the packaging waste produced in the EU - in other words, just 58 000 tonnes out of 58 million tonnes.
Ceramics consist of baked clay, and their artistic and creative appearance means that, in many households, they are kept or re-used, so that they do not end up in the household rubbish.
Ceramics can be neither re-used in the production of energy nor recycled.
They pose no problems for the environment.
To treat ceramics separately, collecting them and transporting them thousands of kilometres across the Member States, would make no sense either in environmental or in economic terms.
I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 4.
Waste management, which was already introduced on the basis of this directive, or which has yet to be introduced in certain Member States, should deal with those materials that are suited to recovery; it must concentrate on materials the collection and recycling of which is profitable in economic and environmental terms.
