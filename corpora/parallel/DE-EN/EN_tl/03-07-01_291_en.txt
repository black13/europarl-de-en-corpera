Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is taking us down a new road.
Until now, we had used direct taxation as an instrument of environmental policy, and we could have done that here by specifying CO2 threshold values for certain types of plant.
Rather than do that, we have opted for indirect taxation via pricing, and, as one finds with indirect taxation, here too, our problem is that it sets off many side-effects that we had not initially wanted.
That being so, Commissioner, it is the Commission's particular responsibility to take matters in hand as regards any such side-effects.
I will mention just three of them.
The first is that emissions trading may of course have an effect on enterprises' balance sheets and end up being a factor in their shutting down production or moving it elsewhere.
That has nothing more to do with the protection of the environment; it would be a purely commercial calculation.
This is where, as a principle, climate protection must, without doubt, be given priority over factory closures and the transfer of production.
The second question, Commissioner, is whether there are safeguards ensuring that emissions rights are indeed issued for the sake of climate protection and not as part of individual Member States' policies on industry.
One of your core responsibilities is to check to see that they are issued in accordance with fair criteria and with the aim of reducing greenhouse gases that affect climate.
Thirdly, might it not also be the case that advantages in terms of comparative costs will lead to the indirect promotion of atomic energy?
Here too, it is for the Commission to take responsibility for ensuring that no indirect impact is envisaged here.
I hope that you will have plenty of staff and plenty of courage to enable you, in the interests of workers, to discharge that responsibility.
