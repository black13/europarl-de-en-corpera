Mr President, it was quite remarkable how the Commission and Parliament were able to reach a tidy compromise under the providential leadership of the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva.
I think it is also an expression of European identity, because climate policy has a good name in Europe.
May it continue to do so.
When it comes to emissions trading, we must be careful not to confuse two things.
Trading in emissions does not save one tonne of CO2; that is only saved by investment.
But emissions trading encourages investment, that is to say it triggers a search for the cheapest way of cutting CO2.
It is also sensible from an economic point of view and industry and many government leaders, many of whom still find emissions trading strange, need to see that.
Secondly, Mr Sepp√§nen - and, to some extent, Mr Lange as well - have rightly pointed out that a few questions are still unanswered.
For example, are emissions rights securities?
How are they treated?
These are questions for which an answer will probably have to be found in the future, at either national or European level.
As regards cost factors for undertakings, Mr Lange is quite right to say that undertakings' balance sheets will probably look different in future than they do today, especially if CO2 costs more than it does today.
Today it costs EUR 5 to EUR 6 a tonne.
Once it costs EUR 20 to 30 a tonne, the picture will be quite different and will naturally have effects on energy policy.
Let us hope that these will be the ones we are looking for, namely cuts in CO2.
