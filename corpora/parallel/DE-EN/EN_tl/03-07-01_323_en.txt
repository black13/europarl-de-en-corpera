Mr President, I would just like to come back to the remark made by the previous speaker, Mr Walter.
He compares the EUR 32 million called for with a sum of money we once paid to Portugal and Spain and with which we now want to assist a few other states.
That is not the case.
This money is for the entire European Union.
That can be checked in the Minutes and, at the Commission's suggestion, it will be made available only if the Council is willing, because it has agreed to the fisheries policy reform.
I just wanted to make that correction.
