Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, early or late we can now discuss the implementation of the 2003 Budget.
I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr FÃ¤rm, most sincerely for carefully reading the figures that he has kindly made available to us.
What he read was of course not so pleasing, and I would like to sum up in only very general terms by saying that, as a member of one part of the Budgetary Authority, I have to ask myself what force and what decisiveness we must bring to bear in order, together with the Council, to prepare a budget - which is, after all, policy in figures - when those who have to implement it are far from being in a position to implement that policy in the way the Budgetary Authority wanted.
That is in fact a fundamental criticism that I have already voiced in this place on a number of occasions, and things get no better, they get worse.
That cannot of course be the Commission's long-term strategy.
The budgets we present are always tight ones, and then we want to make ourselves more popular with the Member States by not spending the money we have just argued over so passionately.
I now have a large number of complaints on the table where individual groups that are supposed to be supported out of the Community budget, as is stipulated in the rules on the matter, are faced with massive administrative problems in negotiations with the Commission, especially this year because of the new Financial Regulation.
All the rules must be followed, but my plea here would be that we also help to ensure that in the end resources actually can flow.
Bureaucracy - or the proper control of the use of resources - is not there to make payments basically impossible.
