Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without a doubt these six months of the Greek Presidency have been some of the most dramatic in the recent history of the European Union, and I think that we can compliment the Greek Presidency on doing its job with great sensitivity, consistency and energy.
Three major issues have dominated this period as they do this debate: enlargement; the war in Iraq and the significance that it has had for Europe and will also continue to have in the future, and the Convention.
Enlargement - the great historic project of our generation - is well on the way to being completed successfully.
For us enlargement already has a human face, in the shape of the colleagues who are already working here as observers.
As an aside, I should like to mention that we in Germany were interested to note that after Parliament's decision on enlargement the Czech Government for example issued a statement on the injustice of expulsion, which is along the right lines and gives us hope that here too the process of reconciliation may reach a successful conclusion.
The war in Iraq made it clear where Europe's borders lie and showed where we need even more Community: primarily in the field of foreign and security policy.
So far Europe has played no role at all here or at best a pitiful one.
It really should strike people that where Europe uses the Community method, such as on internal market issues, we operate on an equal footing with for example the United States of America, but that where we work on an intergovernmental basis, we play no part at all.
This has to change in the future and the Convention needs to make a contribution to achieving this.
I hope that it will still succeed in doing so before 10 July of this year.
