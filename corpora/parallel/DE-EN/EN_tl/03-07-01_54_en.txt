Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the statement issued by the Thessaloniki Summit on the European Union's security policy was an important step towards a common European Security and Defence Policy.
The United States have set out their security policy in clear terms, and it guides their actions on a day-to-day basis.
A constructive response to it from the European Union is overdue and necessary.
The paper tabled here is the beginning of a joint reply of this kind.
If we take a closer look at it, we see that when it comes to analysing new threats in the world, joint statements are made that are extremely detailed and also completely accurate.
But when it comes to defining the answers to them and saying what now needs to be done, we see that the system of unanimity makes it extremely difficult to come up with a coherent statement.
That is why this paper can only be a beginning, a beginning with important statements.
Nevertheless, we need a broad debate about this in the European Union, including in Parliament, so as to gradually formulate a common security strategy.
We need clearer statements on our relations with NATO, on our relations with the United Nations, and on the roles that Russia and also Turkey will play in this security concept, and we need a clearer mandate - this too is addressed to the Intergovernmental Conference - for the arms agency that is now being proposed.
Above all, however, we need a step-by-step plan.
We have seen that the European Union has only ever carried out projects successfully when it has first had a plan setting out clear tasks and deadlines.
Our job now is to formulate a more precise strategy of this kind for the European Union.
