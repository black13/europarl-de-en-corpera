Mr President, we too voted for the compromise on emissions trading, because it really is a new tool in the environmental protection armoury, one that will in future effectively cap 50% of CO2 emissions.
This provides a unique opportunity and should be regarded as something positive.
We also welcome the fact that in Germany the Ministry of Economics and Labour has not succeeded in securing an exemption from the directive for entire sectors, but that we have instead ensured that virtually all sectors of industry are covered and that only certain types of plant with very stringent requirements are exempt - which in practice means that none at all are.
We hope that this instrument will result in all Member States actually presenting their national allocation plans in spring next year, making this a genuine economic instrument that I hope will help climate protection.
We will then see that climate protection makes sense for industry, and makes sense for everyone.
Nevertheless we also need new arrangements in future, and we need an action plan for CO2 emissions from road and air transport, which are increasing dramatically.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have voted for this compromise.
We regard it as a good instrument.
It will mean that climate protection is taken seriously and that we can meet the obligations imposed on us by Kyoto.
Only then will we have credibility in the eyes of other countries.
I also hope that this decision will mean that countries that have not yet ratified Kyoto, such as Russia, will now do so, so that we can really start tackling climate protection.
