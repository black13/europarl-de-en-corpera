Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the referendum on 23 March as a first step in attempting to stabilise the situation in Chechnya.
I also welcome the administration's efforts to make life more bearable, to gradually reopen schools, and to partially reinstate energy supplies, public transport and medical care in Grozny at least.
But that is by no means enough.
The Russians really need to make reconstruction a top priority.
Against that background, I hope that the elections in December 2003 or March 2004 will lead to political stabilisation in Chechnya.
The European Union should be prepared to provide whatever assistance is needed to hold free and fair elections.
Nevertheless, I regard it as highly problematic that international organisations have still not been given free access to Chechnya in order to provide urgently needed humanitarian and medical aid.
As has already been mentioned, the refugees' plight remains precarious.
Humanitarian aid must not be cut, nor should refugees be forced to return against their will, unless and until the necessary conditions have been met.
I am concerned that since 11 September the Council and the Commission have effectively stopped discussing the actions of the Russian army in Chechnya, which have chiefly resulted in enormous suffering amongst the civilian population.
Whilst we condemn acts of heartless violence by Chechen terrorists, we also condemn the disproportionate use of military force and arbitrary acts by the Russian army.
You cannot cherry-pick when it comes to human rights, and it is not by breaching human rights that the conflict will be de-escalated.
If the European Union wants to help resolve the conflict, it must work with Russia and press it for further changes in its policy towards Chechnya.
