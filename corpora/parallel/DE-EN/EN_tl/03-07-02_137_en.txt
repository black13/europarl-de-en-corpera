It was suggested earlier that the war in Chechnya is linked with the war on terror.
I wish to make it very clear that I believe that what Russia is doing in Chechnya is not a war on terror, but that it is actually giving rise to terrorism.
We need to be quite clear that Yelena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov's widow, is right when she says that what is happening in Chechnya is genocide.
I shall not mince my words - I believe that this is a colonial war driven by the energy interests of Gazprom and others.
That is what it is really about.
So it is vital that we should not deceive ourselves.
Many well-regarded international human rights organisations came to the conclusion that the so-called referendum was a total sham.
Convenient partners for bogus peace talks have been created.
The OSCE has already observed elections in Chechnya.
There has already been peace in Chechnya once.
Mr Mashadov was democratically elected in the presence of OSCE observers, so why are we not negotiating with him?
Why has he been forced to go underground?
This has happened precisely because he represents his people and is not a puppet.
This will not lead to peace, Mr President-in-Office, so the basic presumptions underlying this debate are utterly false.
Choosing puppets as your partners in talks has never been effective and has never led to peace.
I would therefore like to make one point very clear: what I regard as being dishonest about this debate and about many of the speeches we have heard - including speeches made by Mr Putin, who used Chechnya as the bloodiest election platform in history in order to come to power - is the word 'normalisation'.
When was the last time we heard about 'normalisation'?
It was in 1968, when the national uprising by the Czech and Slovak peoples was put down.
That is not the sort of normalisation we want!
