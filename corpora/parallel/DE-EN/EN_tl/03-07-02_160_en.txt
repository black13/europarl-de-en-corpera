Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Commissioner that, together with the Interparliamentary Union, the European Parliament will, as we have done before, be staging an event in Cancun.
The object of the enterprise is that members of the parliaments of countries belonging to the WTO should meet together in order to exchange information.
An additional consideration is that, in our view, many trade issues are moving further and further away from what have traditionally been considered as such, with which they formerly coincided, and touch on very sensitive areas that are of great interest to many members of the public.
These include the service sector among many others.
The event will be held in Cancun on 9 and 12 September, and this House will be playing a leading part in it, with many of our Members being present.
We would of course be glad if all Members of this House with an interest in these matters were to circulate information about this event.
Let me also address a second point, one raised by Mr Clegg, that being the issue of whether you will at all agree - whether or not the Convention so decides - that this House must approve the agreement negotiated in Cancun, no matter when or how it is concluded?
Now for my third point.
Might you consider reiterating today that Parliament is to give its approval and have - within the Article 133 Committee - a right equal to that of the Council to be involved and informed, and, furthermore, are you able to make a statement to the effect that Parliament should also have a part to play in allocating seats on it?
