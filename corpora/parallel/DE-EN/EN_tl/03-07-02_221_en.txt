Mr President, I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for that very good and clear reply.
I would like to put just two supplementary questions.
Firstly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights refers merely to 'reproductive' rather than to 'therapeutic' cloning, although the two are one and the same thing.
Germany, France and other countries are trying to get the United Nations to ban all types of cloning throughout the world.
I just wanted to ask if the Presidency of the Council might also take some action along these lines.
Secondly, you are right, with regard to this issue, to invoke the subsidiarity principle, but is there not the danger that, in such areas as that of embryo research, the European Union might modify or undermine many Member States' more stringent provisions on the protection of embryos?
