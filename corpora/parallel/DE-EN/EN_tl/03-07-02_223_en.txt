Mr President, I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for that statement.
For the sake of precision, I would just like to put a supplementary question.
I think the Presidency will be aware - as Professor Sirchia, the Minister for Health, has taken a very active interest in this issue - that it is Parliament's firm opinion that the legal basis exists for a comprehensive ban on cloning - the prohibition of both what is termed reproductive cloning and of cloning for research purposes.
Parliament adopted this position in the course of the codecision procedure on the report on quality and safety standards for cells and tissues.
At the Council meeting on 2 June, Professor Sirchia expressed the view that Parliament's position was well-founded.
I want to ask if the Presidency is aware of the importance Parliament attaches to this issue, and of Parliament's intention to resubmit this motion at second reading stage.
