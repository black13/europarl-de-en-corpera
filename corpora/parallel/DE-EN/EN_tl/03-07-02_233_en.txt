Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would ask Mrs Izquierdo Rojo to adhere to the formalities of this House.
We have to understand that the President of the Council's function is, of course, simply to perform the Council's duties, and that he does not bear responsibility for the individual Member States.
It is for that reason that I want to ask whether it is actually known whether it was possible to liberate from Iraqi prisons political detainees who would otherwise have faced the death penalty?
