Mr President, I have another question for Mr Frattini.
There has been a great deal of discussion about the unused monies in the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which are returned to the finance ministers every year.
There is now very intensive debate about whether this money would be better allocated to extending the trans-European networks.
Is this being discussed in the Council, and what timetable do you have in mind for these funds to be put to use, as soon as possible, for the benefit of the world's most competitive region?
