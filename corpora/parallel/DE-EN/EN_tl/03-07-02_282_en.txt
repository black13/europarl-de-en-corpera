Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jarzembowski, we may not hold the higher moral ground, but we do have higher mountains.
We Austrians are not asking for a solution for the coming decades ...
... but we are, quite simply, asking for a very brief transitional period until such time as the Europe-wide solution is in place, one which will, once and for all, cover the Alps as a whole.
This is not about Austria; this is about the Alps.
As an Austrian, I can say that we are very proud of what we have achieved where the environment is concerned.
We have a high level of awareness where the protection of the environment is concerned, and, with the possible exception of Switzerland, no other country in Europe lives in and with mountains to such a degree.
To quote our national anthem, we are 'a land of mountains, a land of valleys'.
We live with mountains; they are part of our soul, and we cannot live without them.
Please do not make life hell for the people who have lived on their farms in the mountain valleys for centuries.
Do not rob these people of their homeland!
The Alps belong to us all, so stop thinking only of your own countries, and think, instead, in European terms.
Remember that the Alps are our common possession, and that we want to protect them for the benefit of all.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for thinking in pan-European terms, and I implore my fellow-Members of this House to do as the Council has done; only a short space of time is involved.
And, Mr Jarzembowski, all our mountains are topped by crosses, and, although I am seventy years old, I still keep going up them, and the next time I do I will say the Our Father for you, in the hope that the Holy Ghost will enlighten you.
(Vigorous applause)
