Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it is unfortunate that the Italian Presidency's programme of work in the field of transport, as it stands, contains two major omissions.
The first is to expedite and complete the conciliation procedure on the second rail package, and the second is the conciliation procedure on the ports directive.
As European Parliament rapporteur, I appeal to the Italian Presidency to give priority to these two legislative proposals, since promoting rail transport and ports could well be in Italy's national interest also.
The Italian Government in particular could have a great interest in the further gradual opening up of rail networks, thus revitalising the rail sector and shifting more goods and passengers from road to rail.
As Parliament's rapporteur, I wish to offer the presidency an early conciliation procedure in the context of the second reading in Parliament, so that we can complete the second rail package by the end of the Italian Presidency.
Increasing the efficiency of port services by means of increased competition and transparency could, however, also be in the interest of the Union as a whole, as well as of Italy with its long coastline and its pivotal role in the Mediterranean.
That is why I hope that the Italian Presidency will take this conciliation procedure seriously and accept it as a priority.
Mr President-in-Office, I would like to take the liberty of calling on you, as a former member of our group and as a friend of our group, to help us in expediting these two important transport projects, that is opening up rail networks and opening up port services to increased competition and greater efficiency, by working quickly and effectively with us.
Thank you very much!
