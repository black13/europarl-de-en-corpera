Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor.
I do not need three minutes.
I will be very brief.
During his statement, if the translation was correct, Mr Berlusconi said that a director is currently shooting a film in Italy about the concentration camps, and was inviting me to take the role of the Kapo ?
? that is to say, the role of the SS henchman.
I have only one thing to say to you in response: my respect for the victims of fascism prevents me from saying a single word about this.
However, I am quite clear in my mind that it is very difficult to accept a situation in which a President-in-Office of the Council, when he comes up against the slightest contradiction during a debate, loses his composure in this way.
(Loud and sustained applause from the left and centre left)
(Standing ovation)
