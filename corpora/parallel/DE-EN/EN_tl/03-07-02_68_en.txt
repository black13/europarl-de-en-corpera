Mr President, if I have observed correctly, you have not yet taken a vote on Amendment No 75 tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.
This amendment needs to be voted on before all the other amendments, because the objective is to reject the Council's common position.
