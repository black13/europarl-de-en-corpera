Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we voted for the compromise reached between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, because today is a good day for consumer protection.
We have finally managed to achieve comprehensive labelling, so that consumers can no longer be hoodwinked, with products being required to bear accurate information about any genetically manipulated ingredients they may contain.
I think this will give industry pause for thought before it uses GMOs, because the majority of consumers do not want these products.
It does, however, mean that we will have to carry on working to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place for seed.
I was very disturbed yesterday by the Commission's failure to answer my question about how this is to be regulated in future.
We need this labelling.
It is a good proposal and it will mean that consumers will no longer be treated like children who have nothing to say for themselves, and will instead at last be given the chance to freely choose whether to opt for these products or not.
Then we will really see whether these products are accepted, because the markets will decide.
So it is not the EU approval process that is the great problem, as the industry would have us believe.
No, the problem for industry will be the market, because the market will decide, and the market is made up of individual consumers.
