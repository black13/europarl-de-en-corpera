Mr President, Commissioner, that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should entrust the drafting of its opinion to a man, and that the women on it should agree to that, is a demonstration of the importance we attach to this problem of equal treatment and equality of opportunity, as we take the view that these are issues not only - and here, 'not only' is not meant to be restrictive - affecting women's social, environmental and cultural achievements, for there is no doubt that they do, but also the economic development of rural areas.
Women play a decisive part in the economic development of rural areas.
Women's continuing role, especially on small farms, as invisible workers - to which reference has just been made - is also made apparent by agricultural statistics according to which the proportion of women varies slightly from 0.2% to 0.3%, although nobody can deny that, as there is such a wide range of tasks to be done, women may well do more work on farms than men.
This, then, is where we have to focus more on women's role in the labour force.
Commissioner, nobody will now expect the Agriculture Directorate-General to turn itself into an equal opportunities office for women - that would surely be to ask too much of it - but the programmes can of course include priorities that also take women into account, and I acknowledge that the Commission is already doing something about this.
If we consider the ways in which funds are allocated, it becomes clear that what we call bottom-up approaches - that is to say, those in which local labour is involved - provide specific opportunities for women.
On the whole, they are much more actively involved than are the men.
If we give our attention to this, we will enhance women's role as workers and give them greater economic clout, and that will benefit rural areas as a whole.
If I may, as a man, conclude my speech by saying so, women will of course - as they must - defend their own interests, and we see in rural areas that they are very well able to do this and that they are already playing their part in shaping agricultural policy.
