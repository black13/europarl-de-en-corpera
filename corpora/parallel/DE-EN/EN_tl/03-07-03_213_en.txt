Mr President, I would just like to make brief reference to something that happened this afternoon, and which gives me pause for thought.
Specifically, I refer to a report to the effect that my group had lost a vote, even though, according to the Rules of Procedure, we had won it.
The vote was on Amendment No 17 to the Lisi report.
There were 457 of us here in the Chamber for the vote.
In Germany, there is a novel entitled 'Der Sommer, der ein Winter war' - I do not know what it was called when translated into other languages, but I think we can start writing a novel entitled 'The Thursday that was a Friday'.
I would like to ask the bureau to find out whether a majority of our Members want to ascertain whether the last 50 cents of our allowances were spent on a stamp or whether we might perhaps do some real legislative work here on a Thursday.
A vote by 457 Members, 160 of them voting against, means that we are, in some sense, neutering ourselves as a legislative body with the power of codecision.
This state of affairs has to be stopped, and measures must be introduced in order to do so.
