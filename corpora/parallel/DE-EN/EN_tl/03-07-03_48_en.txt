Madam President, this report is not about creating conflicts, but about harmonisation, and it is not about levelling down, but about equal treatment.
To my mind, that is a very important distinction, and one that we should not forget.
Gender budgeting does not involve creating separate budgets for men and women, but it does mean working to ensure that funding is distributed fairly and efficiently.
Contrary to what we are often told, public budgets are not gender-neutral; in terms of both income and expenditure they have different impacts on men and women.
We want to highlight these differences and take account of them.
Few people are aware of the impact of budget policy decisions on women in economic, social, and societal terms.
That is why we need a budget analysis.
Such an analysis means investigating the impact of budgets on women, and on tax systems, that is to say different types of taxation.
How do women perceive cuts and how are they affected by them?
The answer is: very often more than men are.
To make gender budgeting possible, we need transparency, consultation and joint decision-making.
A group of highly committed Austrian women have written a book entitled 'Women, Power and Budgets - Public Finances from a Gender Perspective'.
I can recommend this to you as a starting point, and it could also provide a basis for the information leaflet the Commission has promised us.
That leaflet should be widely published, easily accessible and go hand in hand with an information campaign.
Statements like the ones you have just heard should then be a thing of the past.
