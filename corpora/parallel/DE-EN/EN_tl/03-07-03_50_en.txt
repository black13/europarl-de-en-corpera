Madam President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti on the fact that there are not just 20 Members present to debate this report, but that for once we are at last considering equalities issues with a full House.
Gender budgeting is a relatively recent idea, which was developed at the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing.
In the context of gender mainstreaming, it involves analysing public budgets to assess their differing impacts on men and women, and to raise awareness among political and economic actors - which we have ample opportunity to do today.
Discrimination very soon becomes apparent when figures talk and we see that only 6% of the Structural Funds are geared towards helping women.
Let me give you another example from the EU Budget: the forest protection programme has a budget of EUR 52 million, whereas the programme for the protection of children, young people and women is allocated only EUR 41 million, a clear 20% less.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities hopes, by means of this report, to stimulate a debate that will expose the inequality and discrimination in the Budget.
But we need instruments to achieve that, and this point is addressed to you personally, Commissioner Solbes Mira: please work within the Commission to ensure that we finally get the directive under Article 13, which relates to discrimination on grounds of gender, which will at last give us a significant instrument.
(Applause)
