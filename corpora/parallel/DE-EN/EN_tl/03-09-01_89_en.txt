Mr President, Mr Radwan, ladies and gentlemen, what is Basel II about?
It is about credit standing and the collateral needed for it.
Therefore, our main interest is in how this affects SMEs.
After all, they account for two thirds of employees in Europe and pay 80% of taxes.
Therefore, we would also call for preparation for the implementation of Basel II with a stability pact for SMEs.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy commissioned STOA to carry out a study.
One of the most important findings was that, according to rating procedures, banks required up to 400% more deposit for venture financing and start-ups.
This, I believe, should show us that we in the Committee on Budgets should also get involved.
As a member of the Committee on Budgets, and jointly with Mr Mulder, the rapporteur, I submitted a proposal for starting a pilot project in this area, which, through the European institutions and the European banks, would support guarantees for SMEs.
In particular, guarantees of up to EUR 25 000 should be available for SMEs.
We want a package that amounts to tens or hundreds of millions so that we can help small businesses.
We also want a training package, especially for finance ministries.
Here, as with the Lisbon process, we need to look into what repercussions the tax law will have on various equity capital structures, reserves, funds, depreciation, corporate income tax, provisions on non-profit activities, for example.
There is a lot to be checked and I call upon the Commission to look into these issues in their report, which is long overdue, so that the Member States and their ministers can adopt and prepare for Basel II as best as possible.
