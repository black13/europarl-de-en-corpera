Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, we can see that another essential round is on the cards.
What this is about is the successes that we are meant to be chalking up for Europe, and Commissioner Lamy was right to make the point that this is about opening up the market to trade, and I would like to emphasise that this is to be on a reciprocal basis.
Our problem is, however, that there are still many technical barriers to trade, particularly for our European structure of small and medium-sized enterprises, in which two thirds of Europe's workers are employed.
This means that it is also important to set out positive effects of the Canc√∫n round, showing what our chances are of growth in Europe and what kinds of new jobs might be created here.
I have a second question.
What is in fact the situation as regards regional quality products?
We were focussing our attention on some forty of these products - one in particular from the candidate countries being Budweiser Beer.
