Mr President, while the Commission certainly bears some degree of responsibility for this, primary responsibility lies with each and every Member State that is desirous of making this investment.
The fact is that the project as a whole runs under the title of 'Structural fund support as part of support for Objective I areas', and, within this framework, a cost-benefit analysis of this project does indeed have to be carried out in order to establish whether such support measures can be implemented in the first place, and whether the conditions for support have been complied with.
It follows that this is a task for the Member State setting the project in motion.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that it will be the Commission's task - in this case, a structural support task - to examine whether the estimates that have been carried out are realistic and make sense.
