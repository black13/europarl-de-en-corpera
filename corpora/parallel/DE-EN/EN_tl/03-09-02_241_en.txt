Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I can give a succinct answer to that.
You take the specific example of Andalusia and say that it will be necessary to inject more funding in Andalusia in order to give farmers better training in order to enable them to adapt to the new situation - well, that is a matter for the Andalusian Government.
It will have to put forward a proposal for reprogramming its rural development programme.
If it complies with the general conditions, we will certainly approve it.
I do not see a problem in that.
I might add that the time for discussing my proposal has been and gone.
A decision has been taken; the ministers took it unanimously - and that means that Spain voted for it.
This means that discussion of changes to the proposal is now idle talk.
The reform stands.
What is now far more important is the question of how you implement this reform in Spain, for you will be aware that the latest decision made a certain degree of flexibility possible.
What matters now, for example, is whether, in Andalusia, you decouple everything or whether, in animal husbandry perhaps, you retain certain coupled elements, with the stipulation that this task could, under certain circumstances, devolve upon the rural communities.
Such a possibility exists, but it is now for you to make your move.
It is you who must decide!
