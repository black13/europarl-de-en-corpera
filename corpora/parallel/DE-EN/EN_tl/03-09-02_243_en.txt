Mr President, Mr Bushill-Matthews, let me first make it clear that 'Objective 1 areas' is in parentheses, so this is not just about areas that are generally in decline, although the question made specific reference to Objective 1.
Turning, secondly, to your own question, the flexibility that we are creating in the rules is there to be used.
Right now, I can do no other than to encourage the Member States to make use of the flexibility that is there, and to do so in such a way that they meet to the maximum possible extent the needs of the specific situation in an actual region, such as the one to which you refer.
