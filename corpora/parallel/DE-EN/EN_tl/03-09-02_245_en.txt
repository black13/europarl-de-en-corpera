I would like to tell you quite frankly, Mr Parish, that I do not believe that we have weakened our position in the negotiations, since even if the Member States use the maximum of the coupled elements that are permitted to be retained, at the latest possible point in time, we have in any case decoupled 70% of payments.
Even now, though, we can see a whole array of Member States declaring that they want to introduce decoupling - 100% decoupling, moreover - at the earliest possible opportunity.
Even states such as Ireland, which take a critical view of decoupling, have in the meantime made clear their decision to proceed with it in full.
I believe that this example will be followed by many others, and so I have no fear that we are now in any worse a negotiating position.
