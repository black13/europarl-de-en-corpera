Mr President, Commissioner, you are quite right to say that business people must sort this out among themselves, but we all know that, in order to do so, they need a marketplace, that is to say, an exchange where it is possible to trade in these rights, these CDM projects.
Do you think it possible that the Commission might take the initiative in providing such an exchange with a base in Europe?
