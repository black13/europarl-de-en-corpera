.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly thanking you, Mr Ojeda Sanz, for your report on the extension of the Guinea fisheries protocol to 31 December 2003.
I am glad that you give our proposal your full support.
In your report, you ask the Commission to resume negotiations with the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea as soon as this year, in order to reach longer-term arrangements concerning our fishing relations with that country.
I can already tell you that this has been done.
A new fisheries protocol, to run for five years, is to enter into force on 1 January 2004.
Even before negotiations commenced, we commissioned a study on the ex post-evaluation of the current protocol and to analyse the impact of the new one.
This study produced results in good time for the beginning of negotiations, and so these could provide input into the new protocol.
The proposal will be presented to this House and to the Council as soon as the Commission has formally adopted it.
Let me now turn to the amendments.
Although I can agree to the first, I would like to point out to you that the Commission has already, under the Interinstitutional Agreement, forwarded to Parliament the information you demand.
In essence, then, this amendment is no longer necessary.
I regret to say that the Commission cannot endorse the second amendment, as it would contravene the procedure applicable to fisheries protocols.
The protocols are annexed to the framework agreements, and so no new negotiating mandate is required for them to be extended.
