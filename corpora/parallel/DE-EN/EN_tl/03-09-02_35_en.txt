Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an Austrian who comes from a country with many border regions, a significant rural sector and mountainous areas, I welcome the reports that have been tabled.
I would like to comment on three areas.
Firstly, Europe is a Community of peace.
This presupposes that we have a transparent, efficient democracy that is close to the people, that we respect freedom and accept responsibility, practise non-discrimination and show solidarity.
It is solidarity that we are talking about today.
For me, solidarity is not a question of charity, but of distribution and holistic thinking.
Neither is solidarity limited to the nation state.
If we want to make the internal market into a domestic market then we must not renationalise the Cohesion Fund.
My second point is that if you look at the Constitutional Treaty our vision has won through, because now it is actually a question of negotiating our statement of beliefs.
The policy areas mentioned are only the means of achieving those objectives.
I should like to quote Article 3 just briefly: 'The Union shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth, a social market economy, [that is] highly competitive ...
It shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and shall promote social justice and protection ...
It shall promote economic, social and territorial cohesion, and solidarity among Member States' Two of our fundamental values in Article 2 are solidarity and non-discrimination.
And in doing so it is all about putting definite measures in place to achieve the European Union's objective.
My final and third point is that I would also ask the Commission to take into account the areas that we have mentioned today when it is drafting a framework regulation on services of general economic interest.
