Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is about nothing less than the future of European cohesion policy after 2006.
My thanks also go to Messrs Mastorakis and Pom√©s Ruiz for their outstanding work.
Promoting economic and social cohesion must be given top priority, particularly in an enlarged Union.
The discrepancies between richer and poorer regions will be much greater in the Union of 25.
The past has shown, however, how meaningful programmes under European regional policy can make an important contribution to creating similar living conditions.
It is obvious that in the future it is precisely the regions in the acceding countries that will be in receipt of European aid, because it is in regional policy that we actually see Europe in action and catch a glimpse of European solidarity.
As a Member from Saxony, I know what it has been possible to achieve thanks to European solidarity in eastern Germany, in Saxony.
That is why I can only welcome the Commission's talk in the Second progress report of a just settlement for the 18 regions in the current Member States that would be caught by the statistical effect.
I do not need to convince you that just because the regions are calculated to be rich from a statistical point of view does not mean that their structural problems are resolved.
That is why it is not only a just but also a robust solution that needs to be found for the 18 regions concerned.
Special transitional arrangements must make it possible for them to be treated in the future if not as Objective 1 areas then at least as similar to Objective 1 areas and to have their aid administered accordingly.
Only in this way will the funds that they have received hitherto pay dividends in the long term and not prove to have been worthless.
