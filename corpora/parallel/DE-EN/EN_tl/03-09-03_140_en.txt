Mr President, Mr Frattini, Commissioner Patten, I was one of those who, like Mr Morillon, warned of what could happen after such a war.
I wish I had been wrong in my predictions, and take no pleasure in having been proved right.
This is not about establishing who was right, who was to blame, or anything else of the sort, but about finding a way to resolve this situation.
Most of us, I believe, take the view that an international solution is the only way out, but that requires international legitimacy, and that must first be established.
It is because of the absence of such legitimacy in the past that the UN and the occupying powers must determine who does what, when, and where, and must clearly mark out their areas of responsibility.
I agree with you entirely, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Iraqis themselves must be involved at the earliest possible stage if, instead of concentrating on security and waiting until it is established, we consider as a whole the reconstruction measures that will be necessary - by which I mean the process of democratisation, the re-establishment of government, the creation of order, and of course the safety of all the people in Iraq, along with the rebuilding of infrastructure such as electricity, water, and roads, as well as hospitals and schools.
The sooner the people of Iraq themselves take on responsibility for the rebuilding of their country - its political system and democracy, not forgetting of course the technological, social and cultural dimension - the sooner we can expect the situation to return to normal.
If they are to do that, I believe, they will have to have a definite prospect of taking their destiny into their own hands in the very near future; that is why we have to set very tight deadlines in the expectation that a constituent assembly will be elected in Iraq, perhaps by the end of this year, giving the Iraqis a sense of working together with us on these matters.
I think that if international legitimacy is established and the Iraqis are enabled to share responsibility for what happens to them, we in the European Union will be able, by means of common action, to make what is in fact an important contribution; today's debate has shown that the great political and national differences of the past are no more, and that we all agree, in principle, on the same objective, that of seeing this country rebuilt.
