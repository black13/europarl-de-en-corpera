Mr President, it is too late now to discuss whether the war in Iraq was right or necessary.
If anything, it is the responsibility of the United States of America to think about whether mistakes were made in this context.
Unfortunately, what has happened is what we feared.
The dictator Saddam Hussein has been ousted, but the country is not at peace, conditions are chaotic, and aggression on the ground is increasing, not only in Iraq.
That is why it is important to play our part, together with the USA, in bringing peace, order and hope to the people of Iraq.
As Europeans, with our experience, our culture of peace and our economic opportunities, we too are called upon to make our contribution towards a better future for Iraq.
A retaliatory or 'I told you so' attitude is counterproductive now.
I say this as someone who visited Iraq shortly before the war and warned about precisely the outcomes that we are witnessing today.
Our duty, our responsibility now is to rebuild the country, and it is probable that we Europeans will be judged by whether we can now find a solution to the problems in Iraq, and that means policies.
We must find a solution if we are to regain any credibility in this context.
