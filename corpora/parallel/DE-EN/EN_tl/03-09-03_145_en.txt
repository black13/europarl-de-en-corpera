Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the developments we are currently witnessing in Iraq are, in some ways, reminiscent of what happened in the former Yugoslavia.
Once the totalitarian regime that had suppressed them had been toppled, all internal forces were unleashed, sometimes violently.
It is the same with Iraq.
Under these circumstances, an 'I told you so' attitude or gloating is inappropriate and unwarranted; rather, the situation is something for us to be concerned about.
A regime of criminals has been ousted and that is a good thing, and it was necessary, but we are certainly not on a direct road to peace, stability and the rule of law.
That is why the Europeans need to play a part.
In my view, it is not enough to point out to the Americans the obvious fact that they are incapable of restoring peace by military means alone.
That is why Europe's hour has come.
We must provide help.
It is our responsibility, and it is also in our interests to do so.
I therefore want to say this to Commissioner Patten: he can count on the support of the CDU/CSU delegation in this House, both for his commitment and for the fact that we must put our money where our mouths are - for it will cost money.
We will have to justify why we are spending the money.
So let me say again: it is in our interests to make an effective contribution, together with the United Nations and, of course, with the United States of America and Great Britain, to support the road towards peace, stability and the rule of law in Iraq.
