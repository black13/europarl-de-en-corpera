Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, competitiveness naturally has to do with employment as well.
What interests me, therefore, is how far the Council deals with taxation issues.
We all know that taxation has very substantial impacts on national economic development.
Is there an opportunity here, using benchmarking and best practice, to ascertain how taxation can influence competitiveness, not only in Europe but internationally?
