Mr President, although we welcome the Commission communication, I regret that it does not adequately reflect the fundamental principle - stated in Cotonou - of participation by non-state actors (NSAs).
Support from the Commission for non-state actors must be ensured, especially in countries where such support is not provided by government agencies.
In doing this, those NSA projects that already have a successful track record should, in the interests of continuity, remain under NSA management, thus averting any risk that EU funding will trickle away into government structures.
It has long been undisputed in the EU that civil society is an important pillar of its social development.
The contributions made by civil society during the European Convention's negotiations on an EU constitution are a recent example of this.
Yet the increasingly robust civil society in the ACP states had no chance of participating in the negotiations on the current Cotonou Agreement.
This, in my view, is where the Commission wasted an opportunity.
The German Development Minister condescended to hold a joint press conference with a number of NGOs at the time, but she failed to give adequate support to civil society's direct participation in the negotiations.
Of course, there are still some developing countries that deal with aid funds in a fairly arbitrary way.
That is the flip-side of the developing countries' greater individual responsibility for the formulation of development policy, which is what we are seeking to achieve.
Nonetheless, part of the balance can undoubtedly be restored by a strong civil society in the countries concerned.
It is hardly surprising that most governments in the ACP countries reject such demands.
For many ACP governments, non-state actors are still synonymous with opposition.
It is even more important, therefore, for the Commission to take this step in the right direction at last.
