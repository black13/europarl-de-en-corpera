Today, I have taken a firm stand in favour of extending the EU's Action Programme to prevent violence against children, young people and women (Daphne II) from 2003 to 2008.
Our main objective must now be to make the necessary funding available in good time for 1 January 2004 and to avoid a long drawn-out conciliation procedure.
The financial framework needs to be extended to EUR 50 million, as demanded by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in order thereby to be able to fully meet the requirements and needs in the candidate countries.
I hope that this measure will be adopted without delay in order to avoid a conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Council and so that a realistic financial perspective can be put in place.
The proposal for legislation also envisages the development of filters to prevent the dissemination of paedophile material, and provides for the situation of street children, especially in major cities, to be ameliorated.
As a whole, then, Daphne II is on the right track, but it will be crucial that the available resources be put together in the most appropriate and effective way possible, so that both funds and actions may have a direct effect on those for whom they are intended, rather than petering out in various channels.
