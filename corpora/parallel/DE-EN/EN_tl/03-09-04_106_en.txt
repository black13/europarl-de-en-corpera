Mr President, I am glad that this report has been adopted.
The report by Michl Ebner from the South Tyrol is successor to a long line of great reports adopted by this House on this subject since the 1980s, beginning with the Arf√© Report, produced by a great Social Democrat from the Valle d'Aosta.
I rejoice in it.
It was the eastward enlargement that made it necessary to send out a clear signal concerning these matters, for a very large number of minorities and ethnic groups will be finding their way to us: Hungarians in Slovakia, Germans and Poles in the Czech Republic, Poles in Lithuania, Lithuanians in Poland, and so on.
Taken together, members of the minorities will, numerically speaking, be the second largest Member State in the enlarged EU, after Germany but before France.
That shows the immensity of this issue in quantitative terms, and even in qualitative terms it is of great significance, as these minorities can become either the mortar in the foundations of the EU or an explosive charge.
We want them to be the mortar that holds us together.
