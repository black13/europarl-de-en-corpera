Mr President, for the first time I regret seeing you in your seat, as I would have liked what I have to say now to have been addressed to your predecessor.
I have, out of conviction, voted in favour of the van den Bos Report, but I will emphatically not endorse Amendment No 16.
I am also grateful to the rapporteur for showing magnanimity in helping the President out of a tight spot and finally giving ground, but there was no moving this particular horse.
The President's right to have the last word in certain matters is founded upon him, or the Vice-President in question, enjoying the confidence of this House.
I must say at this point, and to my great regret, that the Vice-President who previously occupied the chair no longer enjoys my confidence, as he abused the trust placed in him in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
