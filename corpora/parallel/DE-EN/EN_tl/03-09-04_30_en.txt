Mr President, I am speaking today on behalf of my colleague Mrs Echerer, who has worked hard to secure the acceptance and recognition of sign language.
Today we have heard many minorities speaking up for themselves.
It is unfortunate that we do not have today interpretation into sign language, as we did with the Lynn Report.
I am grateful to the rapporteur and also to the Committee for finding room for sign language in this report and in this programme, which opens the door to its being recognised.
Several Members have expressed the view in this debate that sign language should be promoted as a health resource.
I think this would profoundly violate the rights of the deaf minority.
Sign language is not a crutch or a wheelchair.
Not only is it a language used by 15 000 people, but we should also bear in mind that it is the only language in which these 15 000 people can carry on a conversation.
For recognising them as a linguistic minority and acknowledging that their language also contributes to the diversity and richness of European languages, I am grateful to all who have had a hand in this report.
