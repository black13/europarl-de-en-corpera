Mr President, Commissioner, we have now heard many answers concerning how the television directive is applied, but also questions, and I think we must and should make some changes.
We must unreservedly guarantee basic principles such as the requirement that the cultural diversity of the media be protected in order to maintain freedom of expression, diversity of opinion and pluralism, creativity and the right to free access to information.
Public broadcasters must perform their educational function, by which I mean that the quota for the transmission of European programmes and works by independent producers could be increased.
This is an aspiration with which I wish to associate myself.
There must, however, be clear, workable and manageable definitions of what is meant by European works and independent producers.
I see the requirement that levels of media concentration be monitored as being the most important.
We have examples of media power and political power being concentrated in one pair of hands.
I believe this cannot be conducive to democracy, and so this is a vitally important area of concern.
We will no doubt have to work towards a directive founded on our demands in the 20 November resolution, and, if all these things come together, I hope that we will be able to do all that media diversity in the European Union requires of us.
