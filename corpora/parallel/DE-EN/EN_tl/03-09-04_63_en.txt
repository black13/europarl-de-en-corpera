Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several journalists have told me that 'Plenum Aktuell', the German-language summary of our debates, has recently proved to be particularly deficient.
The German text contains neither Monday's debate on Basel II nor the debate on the outcome of the Convention, which many of us regard as historic.
Until 11 this morning, there were no reports at all, something that seems to have something to do with the reorganisation of the press service.
I think this bodes ill for the quality of the reports on our debates, and I would be glad, Mr President, if you would set the relevant inquiries in motion.
