Mr President, the right of individual Members to demand that the outcome of a vote be checked is a matter of good practice in this House.
It can indeed happen that a President - and we assume that all Presidents and Vice-Presidents have a good overview of things - from time to time asks whether a check is what the individual Member really wants.
Earlier, though, there was Amendment No 4, when so many Members asked for the result to be checked, that I do not think it was proper of you to ignore their requests.
I continue to regard this amendment as still outstanding and ask you to have a check carried out.
