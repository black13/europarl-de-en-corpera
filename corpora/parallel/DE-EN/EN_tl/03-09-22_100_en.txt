Madam President, Commissioner, let us try an experiment.
Try to imagine, if you will, that you have to argue the case for what you are setting before us here in an election - one in which your own future is at stake.
What arguments would you use?
A new authority, even more security in someone's hands in such a way that you can not see where things are leading, and withdrawal to a central location?
In this election, your fellow-candidates would be those to whom you have been listening - Mr Beysen, Mr Langen, Mr Kronberger, Mr Rapkay, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, and Mr Linkohr - and the only person who would vote for you would be none other than Mr Caudron.
If you were to do that, would anyone be aware of what your fundamental political convictions actually are?
I have been in this House for four years, but a proposal for enforced blessings the like of which you have come up with is new to me; I have seen it only in another Union, one that imploded on itself not least because it demanded that sort of thing.
I think that what you are working towards is the meeting of a need for what Socialists and Communists used to call security 'from the cradle to the grave', but by the wrong means, and the way this constantly comes across in speeches in debate suggests to our minds that this security is a false one.
I think we really have to go in another direction.
One cannot evade the impression that this is a Commission that is slowly running out of ideas on energy, which again has to have recourse to directives on the subject; energy should take you where we really have to go.
How do we leave behind us fossil fuels and dependency on them, and achieve transparency?
If I am actually to leave security of supply in the hands of the regions and of enterprises, then this has to be clearly documented and the citizens and consumers concerned have to know how it is to be secured.
Please, though, let us have no new centrally-enforced blessings.
