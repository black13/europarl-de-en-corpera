Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will not be surprised to learn that my view of this differs from that of the Group of the Greens, and that I am at one with Mr Kirkhope in believing that this proposal for a directive is absolutely necessary as part of a policy on removals.
If the European Union is to establish and implement, in a credible way, a policy on legal immigration and an effective asylum policy, it must ensure that illegal immigration and the abuse of asylum meet with consequences and that those whose applications for asylum have been rejected, who have gone right through the legal system and have not been recognised as refugees, must leave the country.
This means, quite simply, that a common removals policy must form part of an EU immigration policy.
The proposal that Mr Kirkhope has submitted is a very balanced one, demonstrating due appreciation of the concerns that individuals have and taking them into account, whilst, however, guaranteeing that the rules imposed by immigration policy are actually complied with in the way that they must be.
A removal policy is an essential component of immigration policy and the proposal put forward today adds a piece to that jigsaw, enabling it to be properly implemented.
Mr Kirkhope and his excellent proposal therefore have my wholehearted support.
