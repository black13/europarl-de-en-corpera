Mr President, we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are emphatically in favour of hearing what the Commission has to say on this point.
This presupposes that the Commission has at length come to a decision enabling it to set out its position tomorrow, as there would be no point in initiating a discussion if the Commission were still engaged in deciding what to do.
It is perfectly clear that this company's immense economic significance for the French, and indeed the European, labour markets, and the particular technological dimension involved, mean that everything possible has to be done to keep the company afloat.
We in the Socialist Group back the motion.
By way of qualifying that, though, I would like to say something that I discussed with Mr Wurtz earlier, namely that we should take the trouble to listen to the Commission, and dispense with a resolution; I do not think it would make much sense for us to draft one under extreme pressure of time.
If that proviso were to be accepted, we would support having this item on the agenda.
