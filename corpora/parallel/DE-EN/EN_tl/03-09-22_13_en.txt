Mr President, I believe that Mr Schulz's reference to the need for preliminary investigations, as well as his serious approach to the problems, indicate that a debate on them would be premature.
At the moment, I do not see that the conditions he has enumerated for a serious debate have been fulfilled, and it is for that reason that we oppose the motion.
The fact is that we should not have a debate if it is to be conducted only on the basis of an emotional response to day-to-day politics, in the absence of the necessary conditions for a debate, and without us being able to complete it with a resolution.
