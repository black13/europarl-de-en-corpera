Mr President, I would like to register my formal protest.
I had to be in my constituency early this morning, which is not far away - around 150 km - and would have arrived in time for the vote had it not been for the demonstrations that were being held in front of the building.
This is why I did not arrive here until half way through the Sterckx report and missed most of the roll-call votes.
I would ask you formally, Mr President, to discuss in the Bureau how it can be ensured that Members are not prevented from attending the vote.
In terms of my journey time, I should have arrived punctually, but this was impossible due to the demonstrations blocking access to the building.
Most parliaments in the European Union have laws defining a zone around parliament where demonstrations are prohibited.
Unfortunately, we do not have anything of the kind here, and apart from the matter of my expenses, the Bureau should give serious thought to this issue and how we can ensure that Members are not prevented from attending votes.
I know that in Westminster, which you know well, it is an offence to prevent a Member from voting.
I have been prevented from taking part in at least five roll-call votes today, and I want this to be noted specifically.
