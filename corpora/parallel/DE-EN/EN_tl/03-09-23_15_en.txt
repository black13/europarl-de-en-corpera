Mr President, on behalf of the CSU, I too would like to voice support for Mr Trichet.
This is due firstly to his professional competence and secondly to his personal qualities, for he will continue the tradition established by Mr Duisenberg.
Although my highly esteemed colleague Mrs Villiers criticised Mr Trichet on the grounds that he did not have anything new to say, that is precisely what we are looking for.
We want him to stand for continuity as the head of the ECB.
This applies especially to the ECB's core tasks - low inflation, a commitment to the ECB's independence, and the struggle to uphold the Stability Pact.
In this context, I especially hope that, as a Frenchman, he will deal critically with his home country.
I also hope that the two Commissioners who are our guests here in plenary today, Mr Solbes and Mr Bolkestein, will fight to uphold the Stability Pact.
Sweden showed us how the wrong budgetary policy in the Member States can influence the vote.
What I really do not like about this debate is the constant criticism of the ECB.
The ECB is being held responsible for meeting the Lisbon objectives.
The main responsibility for meeting the Lisbon objectives lies not with the ECB or indeed with the Commission.
They can both contribute to the process, but the chief responsibility lies with the Member States, and a great deal of time has been lost here because Member States have not done their homework.
I would ask all of you who regularly hold the ECB responsible and voice criticism of it to be equally or even more critical of the Member States' failures.
I think that would take us much further forward.
