Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Commissioner Fischler, I want to focus on rural development.
By topping up the funds for this area, the committee has made it clear that it is to this that we attach a higher value and that the cutting back of the market organisations demands that there should be compensation for farms that take themselves to market.
We note with concern the evidence that the groups - and, so one gathers, the Commission - are discussing how to use long-term financial planning as a means of trimming this area rather than extending it, or the possibility of putting it under the Structural Funds.
Commissioner Fischler, I see the fact that there is now a structural line devoted to 'rural areas' as a great triumph on your part.
It would be fatal if the forces that want to put things back the way they were were to prevail, as the Structural Funds criteria for rural areas are not very favourable.
When expressing your view of the 'Leader East' issue, you pointed out that you wanted to adjust the SAPARD programme accordingly.
We have had this discussion before.
I hear what you say, but I lack the faith to believe that the administration will actually put it into practice and that a sensible practice will be the result.
A 'Leader East' programme should therefore be set up for Bulgaria and Romania, in order to involve the ordinary population in the development of rural areas.
Let me conclude by saying that it was also with great disquiet that we heard - as we shall shortly do in the committee, when you will give us your comments - that the offer was made to make the Green Box a subject for negotiation.
Such a development we really would regard as crazy.
If something that is necessary from the point of view of rural development is now to be seen as a subsidy currently laid off and liable to be cut back, then we should discuss that in this House and make our position clear in the next round at the WTO.
