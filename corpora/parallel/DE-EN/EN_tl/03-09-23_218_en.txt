Mr President, I make this statement on behalf of the Committee on Home Affairs and as its rapporteur.
I am very glad that this House's rapporteur, Mr Mulder, has noted that everything related to home affairs and justice policy in the European Union has a close connection with enlargement, and that he himself has already made some necessary proposals.
It makes things much easier for those of us who deal with home affairs and justice policy if the rapporteur who understands us best is right alongside us.
I must, secondly, extend warm thanks to Commissioner Vitorino for the excellent cooperation with his staff, which has gone outstandingly well.
Although our proposals relating to the 2004 Budget were adopted unanimously, I must simply point out, now that we are debating them in plenary, that this year, we have a priority issue in the shape of our three agencies.
What particularly makes our agencies in Vienna, Lisbon and the Hague very important to us is the fact that we will soon have ten new Member States, which will make more work for the agencies in the areas of combating racism, drug crime, criminal activities and terrorism.
Our monitoring centres in Vienna and Lisbon, along with Eurojust in The Hague are three agencies in need of active support, and that will cost money.
I take it as read that my fellow-MEPs who sit on the Committee on Budgets will join with us in seeing the need for this and in giving us their support in this House.
Thank you.
