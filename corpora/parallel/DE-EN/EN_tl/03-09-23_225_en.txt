Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I believe that today finds us again at an important and decisive point in the history of Europe.
It is quite clear to us that small and medium-sized businesses are of particular significance in terms of Europe's economic development.
Whilst we have heard that in many contributions to today's debate, we know that we are directly affected by many developments on the international stage, one example being Basel II.
That is why we have decided to seize the initiative and introduce a pilot scheme facilitating guarantees through the European banks for especially small businesses.
I believe that such guarantees will play an essential part in the future of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Support of this kind is especially important when businesses are being set up.
My second point is that we have just got through the failed assembly in Canc√∫n, the failure of which is attributable to the presence in the ministerial conference of certain persons who make a very healthy profit from their own system and are therefore unwilling to do for their national economies something that we would see in a favourable light.
This leads us to believe that there is an urgent need for a parliamentary assembly in this area.
We want to lend our active support to this in future and to discuss the possibilities with parliamentarians from the countries in question, with the opposition in certain countries also being given the opportunity to state its position on international issues.
With this in mind, we should concentrate on representing Europe on the international stage, taking a share in decisions rather than just sharing in paying the bills.
Thank you, Madam President.
