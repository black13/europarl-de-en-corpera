Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, honourable Members, I too wish to be brief.
The importance of enlargement goes without saying, and it has also become clear how important the other priorities are for the 2004 Budget.
The debate has also, I believe, made it clear that the Commission must have the necessary human resources at its disposal.
This is an area in which I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for being so frank in what he said.
I am quite happy to provide any information required by the members of the Committee on Budgets, by the Council, or by Parliament, and the Budget Directorate-General is also at your service.
If I might take up again the issue of the quality of public service at the European level, the Budget Directorate-General has a department with seventy staff to handle everything to do with drawing up the Budget - the drafting, the hearings, all the information, the transfers, the supplementary budgets, the lot.
When I compare that figure with the numbers required in the Member States and compare the quality involved, I can say loud and clear and with a clear conscience that the service is first-rate.
Those who have any dealings with it will, I think, be able to back me up on that.
I would like to say how very grateful I am for this debate, and that I am confident that we will be able, once more, to produce a good European Budget for 2004, one that will do a good job of promoting enlargement.
