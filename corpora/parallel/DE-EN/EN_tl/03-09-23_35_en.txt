Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is rare for our legislative activity to be the focus of so much public attention at such an early stage as Mrs McCarthy's report.
That has certainly not made it easier for her to complete her very demanding task, but it has generated a flood of information and arguments.
Much of it was important and very informative, both for the rapporteur herself and for all of us.
However, mountains of paper were destined for the waste paper basket from the outset.
Our intensive work and the fact that it was monitored so closely by stakeholders has produced the compromise which I would encourage you to support and which is reflected in my group's proposed amendments.
It aims to release us from the pitfalls contained in Article 2 and Article 4, where a new definition of 'technical contribution' opened the way for the patenting of software.
Ladies and gentlemen, this loophole has now been closed to some extent.
Admittedly, I would have liked to have achieved more, and the small and medium-sized enterprises in particular had hoped for more.
Above all, I do not believe that we have made it sufficiently clear that we do not simply want to restrict software patents.
We actually do not want to grant any more of them in future at all.
This is because software patents make life particularly difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises, to whom we have always pledged special protection and support.
To put it another way, anyone who patents software is playing into the hands of big business, not helping those with great intelligence.
Let us therefore send out a clear message which goes beyond this compromise solution.
Say no to software patenting!
