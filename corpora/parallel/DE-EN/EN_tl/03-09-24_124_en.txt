Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Jonckheer report, as we now need to make it possible to at last give favourable tax treatment to non-food crops.
We should welcome the European Union's declaration that the increased use of renewable sources of energy is one of its objectives and the Commission's definition of binding objectives and timetables in its 'Renewable Energies' White Paper.
The right conditions and instruments are needed, though, if these objectives are to be achieved.
If the European Union wants to discharge its obligations under international law to reduce greenhouse gases in line with the Kyoto commitments, this directive on the taxation of energy can be only one of many steps that will end up taking us in the right direction.
Not only is the use of renewable energy sources CO2-neutral, but it also makes for added value in the regions and creates new and modern jobs in rural areas.
