I am especially glad that this report, which, for the first time, subjects the EU Member States' commitment to the adoption of a common approach to the future of pensions policy to detailed and systematic scrutiny, addresses the problems of women in the way that I successfully insisted on in the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
We clearly have to ensure that all the Member States banish from their pensions systems discrimination on the grounds of gender.
They ought to have done so ever since the directives in the 1970s on equal treatment for women and men in social security matters.
With variations from one country to another, women receive between 16% and 45% less in their pensions than do men.
In the case of those women retiring now, that results from, among other things, the fact that they, in their younger days, were, quite legally, entitled only to between 80% and 90% of the wages paid to men with the same qualifications.
This discrimination lives on, in that women suffer from it to the end of their lives.
Just as I had suggested, the report also makes reference to the problem of social protection for divorced women.
As long ago as 1993, Parliament had adopted, on my initiative, a report on the pension entitlements of women who were divorced or living separately from their partners.
