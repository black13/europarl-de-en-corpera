Mr President, the reason why I abstained is that I regret that our amendment relating to our Judaeo-Christian heritage was not adopted.
Not even a Marxist history teacher can deny that Europe's roots are both Christian and Jewish; without them Marx and Marxism would not have existed, and if Europe turns away from God, Christianity and Judaism, it is cutting itself off from its roots, only to be swamped by materialism and to collapse.
The second point I want to make in this connection is that it is an illusion to believe that this Treaty can be put under glass and can never again be amended.
Twenty-five governments are not going to meet together just to do nothing; they will work on the Treaty, and we hope that they will improve it.
It is to be hoped that they will include in the preamble reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots and also make a number of improvements in the institutional sphere, such as having one Commissioner per Member State, which I too regard as essential.
While we do not want the package to be completely unwrapped, there are some definite improvements that the governments should carry out in October.
