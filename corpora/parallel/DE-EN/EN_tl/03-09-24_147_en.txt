Thank you, Mr President; although I cannot spare you the inconvenience of my rising on a point of order, I intend to be brief.
I had no prior intention of holding my fellow Members up, and technology is normally very friendly to me.
Perhaps my slowness has fallen victim to its delightful speed.
In any case, my vote on Amendment No 21 to item 21a in the Gil-Robles report has not been recorded; I wanted to vote against it.
In asking for the floor, I actually want to refer back to yesterday.
I am delighted by the large number of roll-call votes today, which means that I am not going to be suspected of speaking in the interests of my own wallet.
That was not the case yesterday.
Today, though, it so happened that the exits from the Parliament building were once again blocked by demonstrators, so that vehicles on their way out had to use the way in, and those of us who wanted to get in - I managed it at twelve minutes to nine, having had to return briefly to my hotel - formed an enormous queue.
Following on from what was said yesterday, I would like again to urge the bureau to give some attention to the question of how MEPs are to be guaranteed adequate access when exercising their right to vote.
If the bureau is not willing to concern itself with this and inform MEPs as soon as possible, you will have to reckon with me constantly raising this issue in the plenary.
