The Members of this House belonging to the CSU have voted in favour of the report by Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos recommending the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference on the EU Convention's draft of a European constitution.
We do, however, believe that a number of amendments to the draft are necessary.
As a matter of urgency, we call for the incorporation, in the Constitution's preamble, of a reference to God and to Christianity.
As Europe has been shaped by the Christian West, its policies should also aspire to put Christian values into practice.
In order to make it possible for the EU to slim down and concentrate on its core tasks, we call in particular for there to be no extension of competences for the coordination of economic and employment policy, in order not to compromise freedom, competitiveness and the ownership of policies at national level; for no legal basis to be created for harmonising services of general interest, especially in water supply and sewerage; for competence in asylum and immigration policy to be limited to minimum standards, with the exception of rules on third-country nationals' access to the labour market; for there to be no extension of authority to promote and coordinate in the areas of sport, energy and civil protection; and for internal market competence to be restricted to measures primarily and directly intended to remove tangible obstacles.
