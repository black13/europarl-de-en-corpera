I find it regrettable that the majority in the European Parliament has not supported the amendment by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats aimed at incorporating especial reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots in the draft Constitution.
Even in its present form, however, the Constitution contains elements that are important in terms of Europe's Christian heritage, in that the preamble refers to Europe's religious inheritance, and the Christian conception of mankind becomes one of the Constitution's important foundations through the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Article 51 of the draft Treaty, moreover, gives explicit recognition to the status of the churches and non-confessional organisations.
So the Constitution includes important features relating to Europe's religious heritage.
By means of its amendment, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sought to add another important dimension to these elements.
It is now for the Intergovernmental Conference, and hence for the Member States, to take on board this proposal and add it to the draft Constitution.
