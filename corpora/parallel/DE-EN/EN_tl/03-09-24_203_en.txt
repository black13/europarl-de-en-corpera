Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have repeatedly given our very close attention to developments in the Middle East, and I think there is consensus that we all want to do our bit to ensure that the roadmap to peace can be adhered to.
I see this, though, as giving rise to three specific demands.
First of all, in the first phase of the roadmap, there is reference to the need to destroy the infrastructure of terror.
What contribution are we making to that?
What contribution can we make to it?
This is where there is a need for further initiatives, especially together with the United Nations, if we are to make a positive contribution in this area too.
Secondly, I am very grateful to the European Union for now having blacklisted the civilian wings of certain movements.
I would ask, though, that we now do what the Palestinian Authority has already done, and block their accounts, so that there is no possibility of terrorism being funded through European bank accounts.
In this, we should not merely make declarations, but take the appropriate action.
Thirdly, there is something that has been for many years a major concern for me as a member of the Committee on Budgets, namely the issue of the form of the Palestinian Authority.
It is a fact that we in the European Union have been spending a very great deal of money, and I would like to see it achieving something.
We cannot be expected to invest in a system that does not correspond to what our Budget regulations require.
Instead, we must ensure the creation of stable structures capable of giving a country like this peaceful civilian administration in the long term.
