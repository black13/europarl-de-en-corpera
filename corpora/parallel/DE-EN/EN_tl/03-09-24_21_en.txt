Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control welcomes the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos and congratulates the rapporteurs on it.
Our opinion sets out a few points from our area of activity on which we would like clarification.
The first is that, in line with its institutional status, the Court of Auditors should be included among the institutions listed in the draft constitution, and its functions should be set out more clearly later on in it.
Secondly, the giving of discharge - including to the agencies - should be referred to under the Budgetary and Financial Principles, in order to make it clearer that it is Parliament that exercises democratic control.
Thirdly, as regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor, we recommend, on the basis of the original motion put to the Convention by Parliament's delegation, that the establishment of this public prosecutor's office be put in clear terms rather than being left as an optional provision, and that the present unanimity principle in the Council be replaced by the legislative procedure, in other words, by qualified majority voting.
We believe that these recommendations would help bring about a Europe of freedom, security and justice in the Constitution.
