Mr President, I shall begin in the same way as many of the previous speakers and thank the rapporteurs.
Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos have done good work, and so we should endorse what they are basically saying, that is, that the consensus achieved by the Convention should not again be unwrapped.
There was, though, one area of the Convention's work where consensus was no longer sought, in which a number of the 'more equal' in the praesidium ruthlessly forced through their interests and those of Europe's 'big boys'.
The issue to which I refer is that of the composition of the Commission, the outcome of which was one to which the small and medium-sized states in the EU cannot say 'yes'.
A Commission in which not all the Member States were always fully and equally represented would lose the political legitimacy that meant that all the previous Commissions were fully-fledged players in the European Union.
It might well survive as a perhaps more efficient body, albeit one consisting exclusively of technocrats.
The Council would then cease to be part of the present balance and would start to assume supreme power.
That cannot happen; it must not be allowed to happen.
In the interests of all Europeans, not only of those from the small and medium-sized Member States, we need the IGC to give a different answer on the one point where the Convention's praesidium no longer sought the consensus of all.
In the interests of all Europeans, we will need, in the future too, a representative and fully-fledged Commission with one Commissioner from each country, one that will carry political weight and really give every one of the EU's citizens the feeling of being equally represented in all the European institutions.
That is what the IGC must ensure; it should not do much more than that.
