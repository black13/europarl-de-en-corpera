Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge you most earnestly to adopt the recommendations drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
They represent an attempt at making a new start and desisting from the disputes of the past.
They are about finding a solution to the problem of how we help the people of Iraq in the aftermath of war, and that of the competences of the United Nations, which must progressively take over the leadership in this area in order to be able to permanently stabilise the region.
It is for this reason that I am pushing for the rejection of those amendments that seek to re-ignite the disputes between us from the time before the war in Iraq.
We owe it to the people there to look to the future rather than perpetuating old disputes, and so I would recommend that you reject all the amendments, with the exception of Mr Sakellariou's on the International Court of Justice, which I recommend that we adopt.
If you do, you will achieve a great majority in this House, enabling the European Union to be in a stronger position when it goes to the donors' conference and us to take on a great deal of responsibility in a constructive way.
