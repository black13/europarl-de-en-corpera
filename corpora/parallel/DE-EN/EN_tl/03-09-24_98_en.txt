Mr President, I, too, voted against this draft directive, which I find bitterly disappointing.
It is lamentable that Parliament has bowed to pressure from the USA and, above all, pressure exerted by the major software companies.
This is a great disappointment, especially for consumers.
It is they who will have to pick up the tab for this decision; for them, it will mean higher prices and less diversity in products, reducing their freedom of choice.
Software patents stand in the way of a growing, dynamic and diverse European software industry.
It is primarily consumers and software users who feel their effects.
They increase dependence on software giants, such as Microsoft, which have secured many trivial patents, and quite manifestly curtail freedom of choice, but this is also a grave blow for the development of software in Europe, which is being hampered by the monopolies that are establishing themselves.
Not only does this go counter to the interests of consumers, but it also hampers innovation, instead of encouraging competition and diversity in the software market.
It is also a real defeat for Europe as a location for business, even though its advocates see it as the very opposite.
That will become apparent in the future, and this decision does the utmost damage to the prospect of an open, free and sustainable knowledge-based society.
