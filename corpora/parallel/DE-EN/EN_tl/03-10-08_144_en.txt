Mr President, honourable Members, I would just like to start by warmly thanking all those who have spoken in this debate for their constructive contributions.
My concluding remarks can be relatively brief.
In particular, I would also like to express my gratitude for the great deal of support that our report has received.
The one thing that has to be clear is that we cannot apply double standards.
The principles that we in the Community apply to our own Community waters must also apply in agreements with third states.
That is particularly the case when a sensible and effective conservation policy is needed, but also when seeking to ensure that any decisions taken are based upon current best knowledge.
It is by these principles that we want to be guided in future.
What do we actually mean by a partnership agreement?
A partnership exists when, to coin a phrase, the parties to it can meet on the level, with neither dominating the other.
That is what we intend to ensure in future.
This is about cooperating not only when we want to fish in a third state’s waters; it is, moreover, about us playing our part and working with these countries to enable them – provided that they have an interest in this – to build up their own fishing industries, not only as regards the catching of fish but also its processing.
This is an essential aspect of the development that we want to promote – as we indeed should.
All this, of course, can only work if these states are wholeheartedly interested and collaborate fully, but we are discovering in practice that such is increasingly the case, and so I can see our concluding of these agreements developing a very positive way.
I can only say that these principles must be put to the test in concrete negotiations, when Parliament, too, will have the opportunity to ascertain whether or not every one of these newly-concluded agreements comes up to scratch.
