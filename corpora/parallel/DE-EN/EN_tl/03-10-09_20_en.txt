Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the High Representative has just talked about the dreadful and ongoing death toll in this territory between Israel and the Palestinians.
We in the European Community must consider what contribution we can make to ensuring that, in the long term, peace is restored to this tormented territory.
The question is this: What contribution can the European Community make?
Indeed, is the European Community powerful enough to make an effective contribution here?
The European Community is certainly powerful in the economic field, and its economic contribution to stabilising this territory in the past undoubtedly outstrips the contribution made by others in the same way.
Yet on the other hand, when it comes to taking final decisions and to providing final guarantees to one side or the other that its people can live in peace and security in this territory in the long term, the European Community in its present state is obviously still too weak to make this vital contribution.
That is why I too have a question for the High Representative, who is working with great commitment in this region: What role does this territory play in the European Unionâ€™s security strategy, which is currently being drafted?
I am aware, Mr Solana, that your staff are working very intensively on this security strategy.
This security strategy also involves the circle of friends with which the European Community is surrounding itself, and so my question is this: how much priority will be given to this particular conflict within that framework, and in developing this circle of friends, will the dreadful conflict which we are discussing here today be given adequate priority?
