– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with Commissioner Wallström’s statement.
My reasons for taking a decidedly sceptical view of the whole business have to do with considerations of environmental policy.
As Commissioner Wallström said, this is where it is enormously important that the proximity principle should apply.
Surely, I would think, a country such as the USA must be able to lay its hands on the know-how and the technology to dismantle old ships – whether they be warships or mercantile vessels.
Mr Bowe is shaking his head, but I believe that a country that calls itself the best democracy in the world must be able to deal with its own problems.
I would like you to tell me, Commissioner, whether this discussion included any reference to the possibility of involving the non-OECD countries, where there is, of course, a great danger of enormous damage to health and the environment.
The ‘polluter pays’ principle should also apply here.
I would like to conclude by re-emphasising that I am very satisfied with your statement, and that I believe that the proximity principle must apply in such a serious case as this.
