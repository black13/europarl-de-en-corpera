– Mr President, Commissioner Reding, it is encouraging that we are able to initiate two new educational programmes today, which, although they perform different functions and tasks, have a common goal, that is to say to make Europe more attractive and thereby to arouse greater interest in Europe across the world.
The point has already been made that the programme, which generally applies to higher education institutions and students from across the world that have gained a first degree, must, however, also take account of vocational training, such as technical courses for engineers and higher technicians, which are included in the category of ‘higher education institutions’, and for which appropriate proposals are to be drawn up.
Close cooperation between various European universities will make it possible to increase quality and increase international competitiveness.
The compromise on the financial framework of EUR 230 million is just that – a compromise and no more – and I believe that this programme will only succeed in achieving its ambitious goal if all parties involved – the European Union, Member States and universities – accept these challenges and do their bit.
EUR 230 million alone will certainly not suffice.
Furthermore, it must be made clear that these financial resources must be raised in addition to other educational programmes and not redeployed from them.
