– Mr President, Erasmus Mundus will significantly improve the quality of higher education in Europe: 250 European university courses, more than 4 000 scholarships for post-graduate students, 1 000 visiting professors from third countries, 4 000 students, 800 university scholars by 2008, partnerships between universities in third countries and Erasmus-Mundus universities in Europe – these are all important elements in boosting Europe as a place of knowledge and – as Mrs Pack said – in creating a European learning area.
The financial perspectives do not seem quite so impressive; in the first reading we made it clear that EUR 200 million was not enough, we called for EUR 300 million.
I agree with other Members that the Council’s proposal of EUR 180 million is completely unacceptable.
Increasing the funding does not, by any means, put a burden on existing programmes.
Mrs de Sarnez’s proposed compromise of EUR 230 million is sensible and it is in accordance with the new Interinstitutional Agreement.
I think the excellent Commissioner Reding is certain to vote in favour of these perspectives.
What is the point of a highly ambitious Lisbon objective if we do not have plenty of specific measures?
In Germany, we have learned from experience – and the Pisa study has made it very clear – that these do not come free of charge.
What is the point of it when we are not investing enough in education in our ?
We will then be clearly lagging behind.
It is the European Union that must award the ‘Erasmus-Mundus Masters Courses’ quality mark, so that we can then clearly identify a particular higher education, with good proficiency in the languages of at least two Member States.
We have left a clear political mark both in terms of courses and in hosting students.
There is one more thing that I feel is important.
Vocational training – such as for engineers or higher technicians – must be integrated in such a way that we achieve uniformity in higher education too.
