– Mr President, Mr Lange, we are indeed heirs to a fine tradition in this area of European lawmaking.
We have laid down rules for cars, motorbikes, ships, and motor-driven saws, and now it is the turn of non-road vehicles.
This House is characterised by its continuity, in that you do not have to agree with every word, but every time, we have the same problem.
The industry that builds the machine says, ‘We’ll sort it out’.
Those who use the machines will of course say, ‘Oh God, we will need to use this for a long time before we can write the investment off.’
All this is understandable, and so I believe that the compromise at which we have arrived is the right one.
It is in particular the fact that we are in step with the Americans that means we are on the right track when it comes to doing our bit to reduce distortions in competition.
I am quite convinced that the reduction of emission values is more expensive in an area as industrialised as Europe than it is in other countries.
Our problem is a simple one; there are more and more machines.
They may be getting cleaner, but machines as a whole are becoming more numerous, and so we cannot take as rosy a view of our pollution of the environment with exhaust gases as we might wish.
Although I am glad that we have found a way to accommodate the railways to some extent, a degree of harshness is still apparent, so there are two or three amendments with which I am not quite so happy.
It is quite clear, though, that if people want, in the long term, to run these large motors – which are not 80 horse-power jobs, but check in at between 600 and 1000 kW, and have a correspondingly massive output – then they will have to put their hands in their pockets to do so; they must realise that they will have to do that in future, and they must make preparations.
I believe that we are on the right track.
If one thing or another remains to be sorted out, then our injured rapporteur will be able to handle that.
