– Madam President, we have heard various speakers on behalf of the committees, and I would like to know why we have not heard from all of them; for example, there is no speaker listed for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I would have thought it would be normal procedure for a speaker from each committee to be given the opportunity to put forward his committee’s opinion.
