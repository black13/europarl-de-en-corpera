Commissioner, I also emphasised in the various questions that the Commission acted appropriately on this matter.
My concerns merely lie in the fact that the toll has been postponed indefinitely and that this working group, which you have already put in place, has also helped us to show that shortcomings have arisen and that this has also led to discrimination between various Member States.
My question is, therefore, whether the working group will be able to continue its work in this transitional phase.
If it will not, will the Commission open infringement proceedings?
I think that it is clear that the toll system in principle is not being called into question, rather that, amongst other things, the control apparatus, which will be used to collect this toll for Germany, is a system that, firstly, has shown technical shortcomings and, secondly, will not be available to all businesses.
That is enough, as far as I am concerned, to continue this investigation, that is to say, the monitoring.
