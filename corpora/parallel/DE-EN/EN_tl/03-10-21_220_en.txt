– Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, I would like to thank you for your detailed reply.
I note – if I understood you correctly – that the Commission will, in its proposal for a directive, consider all of the points and demands I made in my question – with the exception of the area of collateral, where the process for forming an opinion has not yet been concluded.
I would like to ask you, therefore, what consequences will result from postponing the timetable for the Basel Committee to make a decision?
You say that you will submit your draft directive immediately afterwards; in that case, it is likely to be autumn 2004 and that leaves a relatively tight timeframe for debates in Parliament and with the Council and a very tight timeframe for a preparatory phase for businesses before it enters into force at the end of 2006.
What are the consequences of the new agreement in the Basel Committee and the fact that the timetable has been put back by almost a year because of the Committee’s hesitancy?
