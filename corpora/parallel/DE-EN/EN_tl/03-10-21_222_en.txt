– Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, the case that Parliament completed the study a long time ago, and our conclusion from it is that we urgently need a training programme.
We had already considered something to this effect in the Committee on Budgets and earmarked EUR 6 million in the budget for training related to Basel II.
Furthermore, we have a pilot project – which we hope to be able to vote in favour of on Thursday – of EUR 91 million for building up collateral, because ultimately collateral must be built up in order to obtain a credit rating.
I would be interested in knowing if it would still be possible for us to incorporate into the Commission study how we can best equip the training programme and how we could optimise the preparations for the introduction of Basel II in the pilot project together with the European Investment Bank and other European banks.
