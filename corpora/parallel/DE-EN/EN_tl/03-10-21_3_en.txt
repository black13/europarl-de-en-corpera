â€“ Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2003 Parliament adopted, by a large majority, a report by Mr Belder, in which we called for there to be no more ad hoc Parliament approval on urgent macro-financial assistance and for this no longer to be allowed.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can only be amazed that, this morning, we did exactly the opposite in a report by the same Mr Belder.
