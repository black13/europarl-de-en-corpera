â€“ Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in the realm of rail transport will not be solved by liberalisation but only by removing the obstacles to fair competition that are stacked up against the railways.
We urgently need an end to social dumping.
It is a scandal that the Italian Presidency of the Council is not putting the Markov report on its agenda.
It is a scandal that road and air carriers are still not required to foot the bill for the social costs of their respective transport operations; we need an internalising mechanism along the lines of the Swiss model.
The great demise of the railways, incidentally, is not confined to freight traffic.
Are you aware that even a privately operated passenger service such as the Thalys high-speed link between Paris and Brussels is not profitable?
In fact, all European passenger lines are running at a loss today, and liberalisation will not change that.
In other words, we need less ideology and more political action; we need investments in the infrastructure, financial compensation for anti-rail dumping on the basis of the model we have in the domain of renewable sources of energy, where we subsidise losses to compensate for the fact that producers of energy from non-renewable sources do not pay for their environmental impact, and, thirdly, an end to social dumping.
