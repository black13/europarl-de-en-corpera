â€“ Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs and the entire committee for their work.
The harmonisation and liberalisation of rail transport in the EU is an important step towards the aims of transferring more transport from road to rail and creating an integrated intermodal transport system.
In view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, it is essential that the trans-European network projects affecting the eastern part of Austria should actually be implemented on schedule.
This infrastructure is needed to preserve the quality of life enjoyed by the population of those areas and to ensure that they remain favourably disposed to enlargement.
These are normal projects, relating to the rail and road networks and the Danube improvement scheme.
One word on a topical issue: we all know that every Member State has its own particular set of circumstances and its own problems.
May I therefore appeal again today to all those involved in the ecopoints negotiations to work out a compromise that is acceptable to all parties.
