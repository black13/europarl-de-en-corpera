â€“ Mr President, I was glad to hear Mrs Stihler speak, and also that a number of Socialist Members have rejoined us, as we covered two important human rights issues without the second strongest group in this House saying anything about them.
I was already worried that the group had ceased to exist or had abandoned human rights policy.
I would just like to ask, in the event of their no longer needing their speaking time, whether the Rules of Procedure would allow it to be transferred to us in future.
We would be very grateful for that.
