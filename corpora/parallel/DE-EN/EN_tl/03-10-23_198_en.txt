– Mr President, I do not want to prolong the proceedings, but you will have become aware that the cry of ‘Check 16’ has become a running gag in the House.
Because of an event that you will probably be able to follow up – although you are again the wrong person for me to be telling about this – I asked, during the last part-session, for the House secretariat to pay attention to the circumstances under which a vote is re-examined when one or more Members ask for this to be done.
Neither then nor now have I received any notification from the secretariat.
We often talk about the dignity of Parliament, but that also involves us being given an answer to this question by the secretariat.
