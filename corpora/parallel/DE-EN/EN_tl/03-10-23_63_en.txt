– Mr President, although the Jarzembowski report is certainly a significant milestone on the way to a European rail market, I would like to say that we have, overall, a vast amount of catching-up to do in European railway policy, and wish to highlight above all the utter neglect of the lines connecting the east with the west and the west with the south-east.
It is my belief that the unification of our continent, which is currently underway, makes the rail link running from Paris via Strasbourg and southern Germany to Vienna and Budapest, as well as the route from Stuttgart to Prague, of pre-eminent importance.
Our discussions of railway policy give me the feeling that it is far from clear to many of those responsible that far more is at stake than whether or not this or that area is opened up to traffic; this is really about a great transport project called ‘European Unity’.
What we have achieved to date is fragmentary at best, and I wish to appeal, above all to the Council, the governments and the Member States to make substantial funds available for railway policy.
I believe that this is not only of paramount economic importance, but also that the unification of Europe as a whole cannot succeed unless we at last do massive extension work on the routes between east and west.
Although these connect the most important regions of Central Europe with one another, it is unfortunate that they do not link up to most of the national capitals.
It is for this reason that many states that focus on their own capital – Germany, for example – regard them as far too peripheral.
