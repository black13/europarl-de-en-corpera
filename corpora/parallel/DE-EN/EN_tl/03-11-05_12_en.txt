Mr President, I too, want to be brief.
Tomorrowâ€™s agenda includes a vote on a resolution on the liberal professions.
The fact that Parliament was not sitting last week meant that it has not been possible to put together a compromise in good time, so I ask that the vote be postponed to the next Strasbourg part-session.
Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Rothley have also agreed to this.
Thank you.
