– Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteurs and I would like to concentrate on one question, in fact on the area of culture and Mrs Pack’s report.
It goes without saying that we are emphatically in favour of a transparent and secure legal basis, but we must ask ourselves the question here as to what extent a common European cultural policy will in fact still be possible with this procedure, or are we concentrating exclusively on a procedure and the citizens are no longer so important?
Take the action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture, for example.
There are two funding structures, two sets of rules, one for so-called permanent organisations and one for the second area, which operates by calls.
There is no question but that we want to promote as many new initiatives as possible from the existing budget allocations.
But the way proposed here and which was in particular decided by the Council at the first reading makes it impossible any longer to include European initiatives that actually deserve such support as permanent bodies.
As the report mentions, there is the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, which is supposed to be one of these permanent bodies, but it cannot be the only one in the whole of Europe to have the right to be a permanent body of this kind.
The European Youth Orchestra, the Institute in Florence, the Institute in Trier, the College in Bruges: what sort of a proposal are they supposed to make?
How many European Youth Orchestras must there be to ensure sufficient support?
If there is any doubt, we must join with the Commission in entering into litigation with the Council to really make support for these possible.
