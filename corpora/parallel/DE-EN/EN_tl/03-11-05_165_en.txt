. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I am pleased that today’s agenda also includes the discharge of the Agency for Safety and Health at Work.
This meets our central demand from last year, namely that there should be an individual discharge procedure for all decentralised agencies, thereby at last having equal treatment for the agencies.
My committee is of course in favour of discharge for the agency in Bilbao, just as is the Committee on Budgetary Control.
We therefore also agree with the verdict of the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the Council.
Let me say a few words about this Agency, which was created in 1997.
Bilbao has now become the driving force in the field of safety and health at work.
I need only mention its outstanding work in implementing the special programme for SMEs in 2001 and 2002.
The splendid work it has done was also confirmed by an external evaluation.
It was therefore only logical that in our resolution on the Community strategy for health and safety at work for the period 2002-2006 in October last year we called on the Commission to prepare a multiannual programme for small and medium-sized enterprises in the future.
It is of course clear that there must in future too be the best possible coordination between the agencies in Bilbao and Dublin.
Even though there are no grounds for criticism from our point of view, we welcome the fact that the two agencies have concluded a specific cooperation agreement in order to improve complementarity and banish all danger of overlapping in their work.
But we shall remain very vigilant here, especially in the light of enlargement and a possible redefinition of agency policy.
