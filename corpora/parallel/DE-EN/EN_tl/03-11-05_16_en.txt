Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say that I definitely support the proposal that we should vote right now on the motion for referral.
Members cannot be expected to come to this Chamber half an hour before midnight tonight just to decide whether or not a debate is to take place.
Any majority would be quite fortuitous.
Such a thing is not commensurate with the importance of this proposal.
At the same time, though, I would ask you to give me the floor, so that I may oppose this referral without debate.
