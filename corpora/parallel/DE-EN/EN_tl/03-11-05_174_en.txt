. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we know that CO2 emissions from road traffic will increase by 31% by 2010, rather than falling by 8% as we agreed in Kyoto.
That is why, six years ago, we agreed a CO2 strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from traffic.
The first pillar was a self-imposed commitment by the motor industry to reduce emissions to 140 g by 2008.
That seems to be working.
The second pillar is consumer information, labelling for new cars, and that is not entirely working yet because it has not yet been implemented in all Member States and thirdly, tax incentives for low-consumption cars.
I have to say that this is not working because we have in fact a patchwork of different registration taxes or annual taxes in the European Union.
In that respect, the Committee on the Environment – and I think Parliament as a whole – would like to have a framework for tax incentives for low-consumption cars so that this third pillar of the CO2 strategy can also be implemented and we will really manage to reduce transport-related CO2; this will enable us to keep to our Kyoto target and get greenhouse gas emissions, and with them global warming, under control.
I believe we also need a change of heart for the sake of the consumer, however, because we really do have a patchwork of tax legislation.
Reforming the group exemption regulation has not helped.
The price advantage is not being passed on to consumers because the effect is being absorbed by this patchwork of taxes in the European Union.
That is another reason why, more than ever, we need a framework for sensible motor vehicle taxation in the European Union to enable consumers to benefit from this internal market advantage.
I therefore support Mrs Honeyball’s report.
