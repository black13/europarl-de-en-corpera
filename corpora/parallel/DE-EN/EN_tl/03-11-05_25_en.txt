Mr President, I wish to speak to the same topic.
My group has of course discussed the effects that these publications and figures have had.
Speaking on its behalf, though, I want generally to welcome your desire to put the issue of the handling of such an opinion poll, and the manner in which the questions were arrived at, on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents.
I think that is where it belongs in the first place, as it is very difficult to have a wide-ranging discussion in plenary on an opinion poll, the overall basis and background of which I have at present only fragmentary knowledge, derived from references in the press.
Before I venture to pass judgment, I would say that it is right and proper that we should consider it in its entirety.
I would also warn against our approving of opinion polls only when we find their results agreeable.
As a long-suffering German social democrat, I, in particular, can say that this is always a problematic venture for any politician.
Opinion polls, whatever questions are put, can sometimes tend to make you feel queasy.
We cannot discuss, here in this plenary, whether or not the questions have this sort of suggestive effect or whether or not the answers that have been given are to our liking.
After all, who knows what would have come out if other questions had been put?
I would therefore counsel against us taking premature decisions or carrying out premature assessments; instead, let us just put this on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents and have discussions with the Commission on Eurobarometerâ€™s operations as a whole.
