Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all rejoice that we have got as far as we have, and for that I want to extend warm thanks to the Commission, to its President Mr Prodi, and to Commissioner Verheugen.
Having said that, I intend to keep it brief.
You mentioned the material that has been published.
I find it intolerable that certain things should get into the press without Parliament having the documents in question.
Commissioner Verheugen, to what do you attribute this state of affairs?
Now for my second question.
Whilst I would encourage you to work towards the candidate countries actually implementing what has been agreed, I would also ask you whether it is not the case that we have to set them a good example, for example in matters of stability policy?
Do we not also, for our part, have to do everything possible to adhere to the Treaties, in order to give a good example to our future partners in the European Union?
My third point has to do with Turkey.
We are all very glad that Turkey has chosen this particular way forward.
The Turks are our friends and partners, but do we not also have to distinguish between that which is theoretical and what is put into practice?
Where Turkeyâ€™s membership is concerned, I ask you to consider the possibility of another form of relationship, for example by way of a privileged partnership.
The majority in our group favours good, strong and neighbourly relations founded upon a privileged partnership.
