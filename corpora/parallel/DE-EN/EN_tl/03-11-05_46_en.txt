Mr Titley, the two monitoring reports that we delivered in the first half of this year have indeed resulted in positive outcomes.
At the same time, we also identified problem areas and then sent out what we called ‘early warning letters’, the sort of thing that in my schooldays in Germany was called a ‘blue letter’ – I believe that, in English, they are called ‘red letters’ – which always contained the threat that if you did not buckle down to work at once, then you risked having to repeat a year.
The results were very interesting.
Almost half the cases that we identified have, in the interim, already been sorted out, so that they do not appear in the concluding monitoring report.
We will now also be writing to the governments, and I know that, in every case, the Commission’s insights will be accepted – nobody disputes that – and that all the governments will be cooperative, so I believe that we will be able to sort the problems out.
Some of the governments, for example, have told me that the relevant legislation is already on track.
Monitoring has undoubtedly proven its worth as a method that helps us to make progress.
The only thing I can say in response to your comment on Romania is that the encouraging political and economic stability that we have seen in Romania over the past two years is continuing, and that, in view of this stability, Romania is actually in a very good position to achieve the objective it seeks.
