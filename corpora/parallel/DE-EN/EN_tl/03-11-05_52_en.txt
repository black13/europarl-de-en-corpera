Mr President, on the subject of the European Economic Area, Mr Titley, I appeal to Liechtenstein, in the interests of the functioning of the European Economic Area, to not associate signing the Treaty with problems stemming from Europe’s past, but rather to seek dialogue with the Czech Republic concerning these difficulties.
At present we are working extremely hard to show the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic a possible way out of this problem.
I cannot yet predict how successful we will be, but we are trying, and we are doing our best, but obviously, you never know.
I agree with you, Mr Oostlander, that it is precisely in the area of the military that we had hoped for more progress in Turkey.
There are two issues that give me particular cause for concern.
The first is that Turkish military personnel are still in supervisory authorities controlling important areas of civilian life, such as the National Council of Education or the National Council of Radio and Television.
The military have lost nothing there.
It is also the case that large portions of the Turkish defence budget are not subject to the control of parliament, and when a budget is outside parliament’s control, then that clearly indicates a lack of democracy.
There is no question about that.
I do not think that we need new benchmarks for Turkey or a new deadline or anything else.
Turkey itself will decide whether or not the end assessment will be favourable.
It is up to them to press ahead with reforms and, as Mr Poettering quite rightly said, to put these into practice, so that we can make an assessment.
The political conditions governing accession have been met.
The roadmap is clear: a decision at the end of next year.
The Commission will accomplish this task seriously, fairly and objectively and will not shy away from this responsibility.
