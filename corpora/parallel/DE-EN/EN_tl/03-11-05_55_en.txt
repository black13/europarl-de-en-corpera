– Mr Verheugen, I understand your anger with the media.
I have three questions.
Firstly, it was announced in the media in Poland that fifty-one complaints have been lodged, and in Parliament it is said that an iron fist is needed.
Perhaps you should also use the iron fist in your area, but when the iron fist is directed against people, then it will be difficult and not just the officials will be affected.
I have the impression that the social burdens in Poland will increase; the wind is blowing in the government’s face.
The second question is what do you think about the regional processes in the candidate countries?
In Prague there is 3% unemployment, in the industrialised area of Northern Moravia there is approximately 30%.
My third point is that we want good partnerships.
We have just spoken about the Roma and if we want to have a good partnership with Russia then the issue of Russian minorities in the Baltic States must be tackled with greater consistency and seriousness, without political reservation and discrimination, but rather in a way that really leads to a solution.
