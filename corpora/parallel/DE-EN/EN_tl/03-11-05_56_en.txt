Mr President, Mr Modrow, I am sorry that I did not understand your first question or your first accusation.
I do not know what you mean by fifty-one cases and an iron hand.
I am familiar with neither the number nor the choice of words.
As regards Poland, I believe that it has proved itself capable of fulfilling the conditions governing accession and of implementing the , and the Polish Government is working hard at dealing with the problems that have been identified, but there are nine of them rather than fifty-one.
As regards regional differences in development, this is an issue that the Commission takes very seriously and on which we report regularly, and we are including these regional differences in development into the strategy for the structural funds that will be introduced in all of these countries from next year and which should significantly help to reduce these regional discrepancies.
In the case of the Russian minority in the Baltic States, Mr Modrow, I do not agree with you that the issue is being dealt with in an inconsistent manner.
On the contrary, I think that the Commission is handling the issue extremely well, but that there are nationalistic forces in the Russian Duma that are irresponsible in their approach to it.
I can go into further detail if you so wish.
As far as the situation of the Russian minority is concerned, we have been rigorous in ensuring that Estonia and Latvia meet the corresponding standard, and they are doing so.
That does not mean there is no room for improvement.
I also mentioned, in talks last week in Moscow with President Putin and the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, and other leading representatives, that we are able and willing to bring about improvement, but that overall the standards that exist in Europe regarding minorities have been met in both countries.
