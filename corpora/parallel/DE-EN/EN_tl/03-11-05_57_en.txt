– Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, first of all I would like to express my appreciation for the great work that has been carried out.
Having said that, I have a specific question relating to Cyprus and Turkey.
I greatly welcome the clarification in the progress report of the fact that the non-resolution of the Cyprus issue is an obstacle.
I think that it is also extremely difficult to imagine beginning negotiations with a country that is, at the same time – as will be the situation under international law from May next year – occupying part of the EU territory.
This leads me to ask a specific question: at present Turkish citizens in their masses are being given passports for the illegal North Cypriot state, which is intended, on the one hand, to change the demographic situation and, on the other, to prevent an opposition victory.
That is the current situation.
Even if we do not recognise this election, we know that the result will greatly influence what happens next.
I think that it will also be extremely important for Turkey.
My specific question to you is, therefore: do you think that it is possible to influence Turkey in this area and to make it clear that we want to put an end to this?
