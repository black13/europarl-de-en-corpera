Mr President, Mrs Rothe, this is, in actual fact, about elections to a parliament in a country that we do not recognise.
Nevertheless, these elections are politically important, especially this year.
I have noted with satisfaction the assurances given to me by my Turkish partners in dialogue that Turkey would not allow a shadow to fall over these elections.
What we, and many sides, are describing means, however, that one already has.
That is clearly an attempt to manipulate electoral lists so that the desired election result is achieved.
The possibilities of influencing it are extremely limited.
I am aware that these elections are being monitored by both independent media and independent non-governmental organisations, which will regularly report on them so that a European public opinion can emerge and exert pressure.
This, Mr President, is one of the cases where Parliament can do more than the Commission and I should be grateful if it would avail itself of this opportunity.
I know that you yourself have already done this.
