Mr President, I am in danger of being tripped up here.
You know, Mr Swoboda, that all parties in this Parliament must be completely at liberty to pick out any European problem as a central issue.
I have said so many times: I cannot and will not prevent any one from also raising in elections an issue of such fundamental importance to the future of Europe as the possible accession of Turkey.
Indeed, where else are they to do so if not with the electorate in the run-up to an election?
As I understand the basics of democracy, citizens have the right to have such issues discussed with them.
That is completely clear to me and I will not, therefore, criticise anyone.
I can only repeat what I have already said, namely that the discussion should be conducted in such a way that no harm is done and that in doing so the common European interest is always taken into consideration and that the public are told that we want something from Turkey.
What we want from Turkey is that in its political, strategic and geographical situation they take on security functions from us, both politically and economically, which no one else in the world is in a position to take on.
We need Turkey on our side.
The public also needs to be told this.
