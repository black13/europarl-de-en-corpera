Mr van Orden, I would just like to repeat what I have already said.
I must apologise for the irregularities and derelictions of duty that have been blamed on staff unknown to me, but I cannot allow the fact that duties were neglected anywhere to lead me to also violate my own and to disregard the Commission rules.
I ask for your understanding.
We sent the document to all rapporteurs – and to you – a few minutes after it was adopted by the Commission.
I would, however, urge you to evaluate the progress in regular personal dialogue with me as we often did last year.
As regards Bulgaria and Romania, I agree with you.
The one country should not wait for the other, and we have also guaranteed this, but at present there is no need and no reason to contemplate decoupling the one country from the other in this accession process.
