– Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference is destroying the Convention’s success.
That was almost to be expected because this method of national and sectoral egotisms is in fact something quite different from the work of the Convention, which has tried to find the European interest.
It is now very striking that the governments are starting to attack the European Parliament and its rights.
The loss of the legislative council is the loss of a partner for this Parliament in making legislation.
Law making will be weakened as a result.
The reduction in this Parliament’s budgetary powers is an attack on the very legitimacy of parliaments.
Parliaments were created to exercise democratic control over public finances, and anyone who disputes those rights, the European Parliament’s budgetary rights, is attacking democracy in the European Union, and not only the European Parliament but all our colleagues in the national parliaments, too, should make a stand against that.
The sectoral councils actually have no part to play in the Intergovernmental Conference, and the Ecofin Council’s attempt is directed not only against the Convention but also against the Thessaloniki summit.
In Thessaloniki it was said that the heads and the foreign ministers negotiate, not the sectoral councils, and I can only call on the Italian Presidency to resist these attempts.
They should not allow it and should really pay no more attention to the sectoral councils than they do to political proposals made by the legal services.
Technical proposals, yes, but I see political proposals being made here, even in the area of defence policy, for example to throw out the mutual assistance clause, to throw out structured cooperation.
That is all a change in the substance.
The Convention created a good atmosphere.
The Intergovernmental Conference is spreading a bad atmosphere and we can do without that in such an important year as 2004.
