Mr President, although I am of course unable to make any statement about the state of affairs at Ford in Genk in the brief speaking time available to me, but I would like to make it perfectly clear that there has been no breach of the European Works Councils Directive.
The European Works Council has been notified, and there has been a breach of Belgian law on collective labour agreements.
As regards the European Works Councils Directive, I can explain it to anyone, as I was its originator.
I was myself chairman of the works council of Ford Europe for six years.
I would recommend waiting to see what comes out of the discussions between the trade unions and the European Works Council, as I am sure that Ford Genk will get compensation for what it was promised in the collective labour agreement.
There is no wages bargaining in the European Works Council; that is a matter for the parties to the collective labour agreement and not for the European Works Councils.
