Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, let me say, very briefly, that I have taken written notes of all the suggestions, demands, and aspirations you have expressed here today, and that I will pass them on to Mrs Diamantopoulou.
Basically, the one thing I can tell you is that I share your view, firstly, of the enormous significance of the policy set out in what we term the Lisbon targets, and also of the tasks we are presented with in the field of future social policy.
I also agree with you that it is now in particular, so to speak on the eve of enlargement, necessary that we have to give particular attention to how these issues fit into this context, and, like you, I believe that this is a matter of urgency.
Fundamentally, I believe, we have to continue to take action on both fronts, for we must not overlook the close connection between issues of employment and social security and the question of whether we will succeed in recreating proper growth in Europe.
That is one of the basic conditions, and we will bring about growth of this only if we take appropriate action regarding the various elements that are necessary if our European economy is to be restructured.
On the other hand, though, it should not be thought that this is only about growth, in other words, only about the economy; it is also, of course, about social protection.
I have already told you in my opening remarks what the Commissionâ€™s current plans are.
I hope that these measures will indeed enable us to make the necessary improvements to the situation.
