Madam President, Commissioner, we have now heard a great deal about a very old topic, one that we have already been discussing for years – always, in fact, on the same level – and I wonder what progress we have made.
We take pride in the 30% of Members of this House who are women.
If we had 50%, that would be parity.
We content ourselves with only 30%, or tell ourselves that we have made progress because we have done very well in comparison with other countries.
What this means is that, for a century, we have been progressing one millimetre at a time, and that what we have achieved is far from being secure.
When I say that there is the danger of us sustaining more setbacks in this area, I am not just referring yet again to the new Member States, but also to the present ones, which have to make enormous efforts to get that sort of quota into this House.
Yesterday, when the progress reports were presented, I heard not one word said about the under-representation of women.
This is something else that we should take into account and incorporate into progress reports of this kind, enabling them to show what is lacking and where changes still have to be made where equal opportunities policy is concerned.
If we say there is a lack of women candidates – something of which we are very often accused – then we have to give some thought to how women are supposed to combine career, family and politics when they are constantly, too, having their consciences pricked by questions like: how can you do this, that, and the other, as well?
This, I think, is where society has a part to play, and this is where there must be consequences for those Member States that fail to do what they have undertaken to do, namely create really equal opportunities.
I find myself wondering what mechanisms there are and what are the consequences when they fail to do that.
