Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has just described the ways in which industry, especially the motor industry, must constantly be modernising its plant.
We know that there is no getting away from this and that every investment in technology results in the loss of between 9% and 25% of jobs.
We must indeed find the means to counteract this loss of jobs, which occurs as a result of technology.
I was interested to hear the Commission’s statements to the effect that we had minimum rules for workers’ rights.
Such a statement is, of course, no use whatever to the workers in Genk.
I hope, though, that the Commission will remember this statement when it amends the European Works Councils Directive, as it is shortly to do, and will at last take account of something that has, in some places, become common practice, that is, making the European Works Council responsible when European mainstream issues are under discussion in a firm, and will also extend the rights of information and consultation in such a way that rights of participation – and I am not talking about consultation, but about participation – are built in.
Thirdly, it is essential that the Commission should learn how, in the social dialogue, to make it clear to the social partners that they have to expect penalties for failing to abide by these agreed ground rules, or else such rules will become a joke.
