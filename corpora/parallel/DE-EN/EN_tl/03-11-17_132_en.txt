– Madam President, I cannot but endorse the rapporteur’s view, as Europe needs more fiscal competition rather than less of it.
The average tax rate in Europe already stands at over 40%, which is markedly higher than in Japan and the USA, and with its consequences we are all familiar.
We have to contend with rising unemployment, fewer enterprises being set up, and declining levels of investment.
The Commission is aware of these facts, yet it nevertheless advocates the introduction of tax increases, taking away the dirty work from the Member States’ finance ministers, who increase the taxes and shuffle off responsibility onto the EU.
Doing this would be simple if we were to jointly commit ourselves to making the internal market a reality and were to ensure that the competition rules were not cut back.
As the Member States would have to commit themselves to slimmed-down structures, this would automatically reduce their administrative obstacles and taxes.
If we do not seize this opportunity, Europe will become an ever-expanding giant, but one enfeebled and dried out.
It could also mean a great idea running into the buffers.
This would be a pity, as we need a strong Europe.
