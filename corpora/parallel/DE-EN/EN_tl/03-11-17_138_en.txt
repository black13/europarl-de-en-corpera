–Madam President,because Commissioner Bolkestein has used what I have to describe as intellectually dishonest comparisons to pillory my country and has presumed to describe our taxes as far too low, I must, with some regret, put him right on some points.
I do not know how good Commissioner Bolkestein was at geography in primary school, but I have to point out that Luxembourg just happens to be where it is, and when Mr Blokland travels from Holland to Strasbourg, he is not indulging in ‘gasoline tourism’ if he does so by way of Luxembourg.
That is the easiest way to get here, and it just so happens that he has to fill up his tank .
That, after all, is one of the common market’s freedoms – free movement of goods, of capital, of people, and so on – and it is one of these fundamental freedoms, the free movement of goods and services, that the Commission is now seeking to jeopardise.
I would also like to point out that, every day, 100 000 people cross the border into Luxembourg every day to work, coming from Belgium, Germany and France.
They are entitled to fill up their tanks there.
We are creating jobs for 100 000 commuters across national borders, who would otherwise be hanging around on the street in France and in Belgium.
Your arguments, Commissioner, do not hold water, and I find it regrettable that you have presumed to adduce them.
