Mr President, I am just taking over the minute allotted to my colleague Mrs Ahern, who has unfortunately been unable to get here on time.
I have to ask you again, Commissioner, whether it is true, as we have been informed, that this has to do with only nine of the 15 000 projects forming part of the Biomed programme?
If this is just about these few projects that we are discussing with such passion, then I cannot repress the suspicion that this is an un-called for attempt at making embryo research respectable in the EU.
All the Member States that want to engage in this sort of research, and which has passed legislation permitting it, can do so, but without funding from the European Union.
I get the impression that your concern is with something else, that this is about preparing to breach an ethical dam and open the door to research on embryos.
If this is just about these few projects, then I ask myself why you are doing this and thereby needlessly bringing discredit on the Research Programme as a whole?
I can tell you right now that, although I hope it will not happen, if a majority in this House supports research involving the destruction of human embryos, then that will have to be tested against European and constitutional law.
In Member States such as Austria and Ireland, it is a criminal offence, and it is not acceptable for something punishable within the European Union to receive funding from it.
This amounts to a major problem for European and constitutional law.
A few final words on stem cell research.
Why the dates?
What matters to us – if this fallback position …
