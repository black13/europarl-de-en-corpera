– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats unreservedly endorses the very fine report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos.
It is important that the rules drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation should actually be mandatory.
We had lengthy discussions about whether this was even permissible, as shipping is a global business.
No, though, we have to transpose the most important points into Community law, that being the only way in which we can really ensure that the IMO rules are promptly applied across the board in EU waters and in European ports, thus protecting the public from the potential dangers arising from terrorism, piracy or other illegal activities.
We, too, of course, regret having to discuss these issues with relative speed.
Along with the problem with financial sustainability, which Mr Folias has just addressed, people in the ports are constantly asking whether what we are prescribing is workable, and whether it can be implemented in practice.
I hope that the Council will work very carefully through the results in practice when these regulations are transposed, but, as the IMO rules are to apply from 1 July next year, we believe it to be important that we should now create legal certainty, and so we endorse the rapporteur’s request that agreement be reached at first reading.
We hope, however, that the rules devised jointly by the rapporteur and the Council will indeed result in workable and practical regulations in ports, as these are crucial nodal points which we want to make safer without hindering them from functioning.
They must function, and I hope that we can achieve that.
