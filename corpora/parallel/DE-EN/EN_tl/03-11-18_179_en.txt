â€“ It may perhaps have escaped your notice, Commissioner, that in Austria this issue has for some years now been a cause of immense commotion, which has resurfaced in the last few weeks.
All the provinces, all the parties and also the major daily newspapers are in agreement; rebellion is everywhere in the air.
Water, as you know, is life.
Austria is still a very agricultural country, and if you so much as hint to a farmer that his water is going to be taken away from him, then war is on the cards.
I cannot imagine Austria ever agreeing to the liberalisation of the water supply, and I hear similar things from other countries, such as Germany and the Nordic countries.
Will the Commission, in the face of this vehement resistance, seriously rethink the liberalisation of this area?
