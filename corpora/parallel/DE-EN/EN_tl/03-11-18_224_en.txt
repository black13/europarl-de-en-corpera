– Mr President, I have a quite specific supplementary question for the Commissioner.
There are recurrent debates in this House about what precisely is meant by the expression ‘reproductive health’, and that also features in our choice of organisations.
I just wanted to ask you, Commissioner, whether the expression ‘reproductive health’ includes abortion or excludes it.
