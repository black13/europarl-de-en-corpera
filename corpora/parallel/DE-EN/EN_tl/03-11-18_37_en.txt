Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission President began his statement this morning by saying that the Union is in a good state of health.
What planet is he on?
The Stability Pact, one of the foundations of our single currency, is in jeopardy, and the single currency is one of the pillars of this entire Union.
With his extremely ill-considered description of the Pact as the ‘Stupidity Pact’, the Commission President has himself contributed to its derailment.
Two major countries have blatantly departed from compliance with the Stability Pact’s rules.
Regrettably, this includes my own country, which pushed for the launch of the Pact in the first place.
How, and with what authority, does the Commission President intend to call these countries to order given that he himself has helped to undermine the Pact?
What is the Commission President actually doing to counter the threat to the Pact which also emanates from the Convention’s draft?
Who actually authorised the Convention to delete the goal of price stability from the catalogue of Union objectives?
Price stability is the basis of the Union’s entire monetary constitution.
In Germany, we lobbied for our public’s endorsement of the single currency and the phasing out of the Deutschmark by assuring them that price stability and the independence of the Central Bank would be guaranteed.
We will feel cheated if the goal of price stability is now softened and price stability is put on the backburner.
That is why, Mr Prodi, we expect you to give Commissioner Solbes your backing on this matter, not stab him in the back.
As a second point, you mentioned the Lisbon strategy.
In ten years’ time, we will supposedly be the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world.
Is this anything more than empty words?
Believe me, Mr President, you will need to change your legislative culture in more ways than one if we are to achieve this objective!
