Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eurostat affair is now a matter of public knowledge; it is a scandal and we cannot erase it.
What we can do, however, is learn lessons from it.
Firstly, this means that in future, the Commission must listen to Parliament, the directly elected assembly representing Europe’s citizens, instead of disregarding Parliament’s reports out of a strange mixture of ignorance and arrogance.
Had the Commission listened, the matter would not have assumed such proportions.
Secondly, we have an obligation towards our citizens to rectify the things that have occurred during this period, that is, during our, and your, term in office.
We have put forward a number of proposals in this context.
The report will be tabled in this House shortly.
It has already been adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Among other things, it raises the issue of the financial regulation, which you have not touched on at all so far.
For example, it addresses the fact that it is apparently still possible for firms to enter into contracts with the European Commission without being required to disclose details of their financial circumstances.
There are firms that have their company headquarters in the Bahamas and it is rumoured that some European Commission officials are behind them.
That must change.
Directorates-General can currently exist outside the scrutiny of auditors.
That must change too.
Eurostat is a case in point.
This is not good, and we must change this situation.
Thirdly, we propose that the financial regulation or the internal rules be amended so that internal audit capacities are subordinate to the Head of Internal Audit.
Had this been the case, the Eurostat issue would not have occurred on this scale.
We want a solution, Mr Prodi, and we want it now, not in one or two years’ time.
We must act now.
The things that have happened must be rectified, and then we can restore voters’ confidence.
