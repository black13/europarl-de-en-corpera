– Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to President Prodi for coming to the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning.
The plan of action that he presented to us needs some commentary, and I would like, in the first instance, to deal with the continuing failure to sort out the issue of communication between the administration and the Commission – by which I mean the Commissioners, even though I can see how many measures already exist on paper; the September 1999 code of conduct, the ‘Charter for Delegated Authorising Officers’ of December 2000, and so on.
I do believe that what we need in this area is not new rules, but the application of the ones that already exist, and that is what I want to press for.
Secondly, it is clear that new mechanisms have to be created to do this.
President Prodi, let me warn you most urgently not to create even more bodies, but instead to strengthen the ones we have and implement reforms where these are needed.
I see little point in this new machinery to collect all the information on possible instances of fraud.
I see no point in having a body to uncover financial irregularities.
I do not see that there is any need to set up a management committee as a replacement for OLAF’s Supervisory Committee.
You have touched on a great deal, and there is good in that, but the issue of whistleblowing still has to be sorted out.
Reference has already been made to the fact that it is no longer a live issue.
There is so much for us to do together, and so I urge you, before you issue the communication, to take Parliament seriously, to talk with us, to have a look at the Bösch report, so that we do not go down false trails.
To do so would harm the European budget and hence the European taxpayer.
