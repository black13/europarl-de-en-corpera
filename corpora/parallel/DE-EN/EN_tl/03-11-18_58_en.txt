– Mr Poettering, I am seriously worried about you, as it was in July last year that Mr Prodi proposed that a list be drawn up this year.
You woke up to this five months later.
Your party has made a serious error in taking five months to realise that Mr Prodi is on the political trail in Italy.
Secondly, I say this because it is absurd that you should set yourself up as a preacher of morality in this matter out of a desire to protect Mr Berlusconi, who, politically speaking, is currently cutting a poor figure as President of the EU.
I find it intolerable that you should stand up in this House and say, ‘I have built bridges and you have not gone over them’.
Mr Prodi is entitled to cross the bridges of his choice rather than the ones you build.
You have to understand that once and for all, my good sir!
It is absurd for you to stand up in this House and say, ‘What you say is in fact perfectly correct, and I regret that Mr Berlusconi did not say that.
That is why you, Mr Prodi, may not say that, as I would rather Mr Berlusconi did it’.
That is your problem.
Sort it out in your own group and leave the rest of us in peace, and let Mr Prodi be politically active in whatever way he wants, without constant moralistic attacks by you.
