In good time, the Commission has submitted its communication on ‘Wider Europe’ and clarified how it might shape its relations with its ‘New Neighbours’ following enlargement in 2004.
It is regrettable that the region of the Southern Caucasus is not included in it, even though we will have immediate external borders with it when Romania accedes to membership.
It is not only from televised images of the post-election demonstrations in Georgia or the confusion in Azerbaijan, also following elections, that we know how explosive the situation in these countries is.
When, too, the European Commission constantly stresses that Europe has more of a presence in these countries, is exerting greater influence and providing more financial support than is generally known, it is all the more surprising that this region is not even mentioned once in such an important document on the European Union’s future relations with its eastern neighbours.
I am, then, all the more grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Napoletano, and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for remedying these defects and, in their excellent report, making explicit reference to the Southern Caucasus region.
I very much hope that the Commission will take Parliament’s demands seriously.
