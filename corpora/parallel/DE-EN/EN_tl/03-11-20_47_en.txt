. â€“ Mr President, solely in my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Imbeni.
We worked together very well.
There are differences of opinion as to whether the result is very good or very bad, but I am grateful to the Vice-President.
Together we tried to bring out what was best for Parliament.
