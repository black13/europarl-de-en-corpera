. – Mr President, the Commission should perhaps finally decide whether it is satisfied with OLAF’s work or not.
I almost have the impression that we are criticising OLAF out of the blue, yet I had the feeling that President Prodi has been taking OLAF apart with his criticisms while we have been defending it, since so many Members of this House, speaking in today’s debate, have stated that Eurostat is not an OLAF matter, it is a Commission matter.
The Commission must finally adopt its own identifiable line here.
Otherwise, I am very pleased that it is happy with everything to do with OLAF.
In that case, though, I really do not want to hear any more, not from the President of the Commission, about the obvious shortcomings, in terms of quality, which have arisen in connection with Eurostat.
That does not mean that we have not moved from our position, and I think there are still a number of misunderstandings as regards the independence of the Supervisory Committee.
The Supervisory Committee must, like OLAF’s Director-General, be appointed on an interinstitutional basis; today, it is part of the Commission, and not – lest any myths arise – in a vacuum.
We think that there must be a separation, and that includes a physical and financial separation.
It is unacceptable that the staffing of the Supervisory Committee, which exercises a monitoring function, should be the ultimate responsibility of a body which is the subject of that monitoring.
We have adopted a firm position here and I hope that this House will endorse this position tomorrow.
