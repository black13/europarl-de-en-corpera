Mr President, honourable Members, I can continue where I left off.
This concerns the Fisheries Agreement and the renewal of the Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Mozambique.
First of all, I would like to thank Mr Stevenson for his report and also for supporting the Commission’s proposal to conclude this Protocol.
With the aid of this Agreement, the Community’s fishing vessels can resume their fishing activities in Mozambique’s waters.
The new Agreement also expands the set of agreements on tuna fishing concluded by the Community in this major region.
Moreover, we have succeeded in establishing a highly innovative partnership agreement, for Mozambique will earmark the entire amount of the financial compensation to funding marine surveillance, research, training and various other measures designed to develop Mozambique’s fisheries and improve its capacities for fisheries management.
As regards the other amendments proposed here, let me say that Amendments Nos 1 and 2 do not seem necessary from our perspective, as we already supply Parliament with this information under the relevant framework agreement between you and the Commission.
Amendment No 3 – this is really an old story – concerns the renewal of a Protocol.
As long as it relates to a renewal of the Protocol, no separate negotiating mandate is required, as it falls within the scope of the existing negotiating guidelines.
For that reason, I must reject this Amendment.
