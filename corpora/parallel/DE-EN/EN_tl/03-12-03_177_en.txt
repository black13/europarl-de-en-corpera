. – Mr President, Commissioner, you have not provided an adequate explanation of why you are submitting this proposal at the present time.
Nor have you provided an adequate explanation of why you are unwilling to allow this experiment with reduced rates of VAT for labour-intensive services to continue, even though you must realise that the analysis of the findings is inaccurate, given that the Member States’ reports are so general that they did not stand up to scientific scrutiny.
The Commission is obliged to supply Parliament with a well-founded opinion, not just a general opinion containing snippets of information simply hinting that no tangible impact on reducing ‘black’ work can be identified.
Commissioner, there are economic research institutes which can undertake this study on your behalf.
There are social science institutes that can do so too.
This Parliament – and, indeed, you yourself – must have a sound basis for a decision, and you are well aware that a six-month period is really not long enough to carry out studies of any kind.
With this in mind, I urge you to set this experiment, which no one has taken seriously, on a serious footing at last and let it run for the next six years.
