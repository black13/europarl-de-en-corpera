– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is Parliament’s last opportunity to express its mind in the form of a resolution before the Intergovernmental Conference on a new European constitutional treaty, which we hope will complete its work before the end of December.
That the Convention’s draft was important as a foundation is not in dispute, but nor is there any dispute about the need for various points in it to be improved.
One hopes that all the politicians want to bring the work to completion and to find a compromise with which all parties can live, including on the composition of the Commission, with each Member State having one Commissioner who is entitled to vote.
Public opinion in the EU is one reason why we should not create Commissioners of unequal weight.
Something else to be welcomed is the European Court of Justice’s monitoring of the decisions of the EU Council, which will make for judicial control and transparency.
There is also a need to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact, not only to make it more solid and substantial, but also to improve its flexibility, for there must be no repetition of what has just happened with Germany and France – bad examples must not be allowed to catch on.
In security and defence policy, a commitment to mutual assistance along the lines of Article 51 of the UN Charter should have a permanent place as a self-evident act of solidarity in a shared Europe.
Issues of the weighting of votes in the Council should not be over-valued; after all, in the European Union’s political practice, it is usual to arrive at a consensus and a compromise in which ‘small or large’ is not the determinative issue.
The dual majorities – 15 States, 60% of the population – appear sensible, and I agree with those Members who say that Parliament’s original budgetary rights are important and must not be curtailed.
