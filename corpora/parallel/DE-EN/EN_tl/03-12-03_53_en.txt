– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why I rise to speak on this point is that the experience of the last few weeks in connection with the handling of the Stability and Growth Pact, that is to say of European law, have made clear how important it is that the Intergovernmental Conference should still include price stability in the list of the EU’s objectives in the European constitution.
Another reason why I have asked for the floor is that the experience of recent days and weeks has shown how important it is that the Protocol of the Stability and Growth Pact should, like other protocols, be appended to the constitution as an annex.
And I have asked to speak also because I believe that the experience of the last few weeks also clearly shows us that the debate on the constitution has been, in part, nationalised, and that we must take care that the nationalisation of a European project does not jeopardise this great project through national referendum.
If there is to be a referendum, then let there be one consultation of the European people, with one Europe-wide result and dual majority of votes and countries.
We have talked about how the Constitution must make Europe more transparent and more democratic and bring it closer to the people, which is what it is meant to do.
So I appeal to the President of the Council to see to it that the Commission is strengthened, that this House’s rights of codecision are extended, that Parliament retains sovereignty over the Budget, and nothing is done to aid and abet the attempt by the finance ministers, in their letter to the President of the Council, to force the Commission and Parliament to keep silent about their rights.
The Europe we need is Community-oriented rather than intergovernmental.
The Constitution is the outward expression of strengthened Community institutions, and I ask you to counteract all the attempts made by groupings within the Council to hand back Europe to the nation states.
