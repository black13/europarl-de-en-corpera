I really do ask that of you.
Today, in my own country – and I am not now speaking as a German, although I am from the largest country in the European Union – many people no longer have any confidence in the ability of the European Council of Ministers to defend the stability of Europe’s currency.
We want Europe’s currency to have a future; if it ends up failing, that will mark the failure of the whole project of European integration.
I am a very frequent visitor to the candidate countries and often speak with our counterparts in their parliaments and governments.
In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, in the Czech Republic, in Slovakia, in Hungary, in Slovenia – the situation is different in Malta and Cyprus – they are asking us how it can be demanded of them, the Central Europeans who want to join the European Union, that they should pursue a policy of moderation in their budgets and work hard at reform when certain countries in the European Union give them such a bad example.
That is a bad, indeed a terrible sign, not only in terms of economic policy but also more generally speaking, and my advice is that we, together, get back on the path of virtue, for it is not acceptable for some larger countries to do things that are not permitted to the smaller ones.
This also has to do with European psychology and with the dignity of states, and so there must be no repetition of what happened on 25 November.
I hope this is the last time that our group will be obliged to criticise this sort of action in such forthright terms.
