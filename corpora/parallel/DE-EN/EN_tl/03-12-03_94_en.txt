– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a community founded upon law; the law and its pre-eminence are what this European Union is about.
Acting in the name of Germany, the German finance minister has just trodden this law underfoot by joining with France in doing serious damage to the Stability Pact.
In so doing, Germany not only broke the law but also destroyed trust, not only at home, but also among its neighbours in Europe and without doubt also in the countries seeking to join the European Union.
Rules can be changed, but not by breaking them.
At best, this amounts to rule by might rather than right, and hence to the antithesis of what holds the EU together.
This malevolent spirit of national egoism and Franco-German high-handedness will dog Europe for a long time yet.
Berlin shrank back in fear from cutting EUR 6 billion from total expenditure of EUR 1 000 billion.
Such an amount is in no way crucial to the success of a recovery – not that there are any indications of one.
The EU’s foundations have been tampered with, and a long-planned alliance has been forged against the European Commission.
That, in essence, is the strategic position, the strategy underlying this course of action, the strategic heart of the Berlin-Paris soft-currency axis.
Who, then, will blame the smaller states and the Eurosceptics if they again become more suspicious?
Nor will anyone be so keen to rely again on the Commission to protect them.
It was a black day for Europe when this damage was done to the Stability Pact, resulting in a crisis of confidence and a political crisis within the European Union.
