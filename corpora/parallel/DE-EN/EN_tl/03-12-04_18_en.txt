– Madam President, perhaps I can give Mr Fabra Vallés, the President of the Court of Auditors, a tip on how his institution can be better appreciated by the other institutions, for that – as you, Mr Fabra Vallés, said, and as I also believe – is what is lacking at the present time.
Perhaps you should make your reports a bit clearer.
Perhaps you could just state that the Statement of Assurance is absent or that you do not believe that reforms will be in place by the time promised, or perhaps you could just report that, where agriculture is concerned there has been no preparation for enlargement to speak of.
If one can talk in terms of only 2% funds getting to their intended recipients, then this policy has proved to be a non-starter.
That is the simple view taken by our fellow-citizens.
I cannot see any way of putting a cosmetic gloss on these things.
If reform is the issue, then we have our own indicators.
I am not talking about the time before 1999, but about the present day, when I say that, when we are told by a Commission that the report will be produced a year later, in contravention of the law it exists to guard and uphold, then something has not happened, that something being a learning process within the Commission.
When one has to wait months to get a reply to questions relating what is currently going on in Eurostat – that is, questions relating not to the distant past but to the mistakes being made right now and to the continued waste of taxpayers’ money – then nothing has happened.
When we are told that, if we want reforms and proposals for legislation by the end of December, we will get them in January, then, again, someone has failed to learn anything.
It is by these criteria that we judge whether a reform has happened and has been successful.
As you will by now have gathered, we are highly sceptical.
