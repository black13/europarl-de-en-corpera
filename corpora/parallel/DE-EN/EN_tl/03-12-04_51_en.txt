. – Mr President, as rapporteur, I am obliged to make a comment and recommend the rejection of the amendments other than those originating from the Committee of which I am Chairperson.
I would, though, like to observe at the very outset that, whatever the different political groups to which we belong, we worked together very well on this, and this is particularly true in the case of Mrs Hermange – the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – and myself.
Although it was no longer possible for that committee to put together an opinion and vote on it, we are voting the same way.
I would furthermore like to make it clear that we disregarded group boundaries in voting together on one point on which the House has taken a political decision, namely the reduced rate of tax for labour-intensive services, and were outraged to hear Commissioner Bolkestein say yesterday evening that he envisages extending this for only six months, even though even the Council is thinking in terms of two years and we in terms of six.
The Legal Service told the Committee that Amendment No 22, which is before us today, was not permissible, and the Committee voted it down for that reason.
I fear, though, that Amendment No 22 could, today, politically speaking, send out the wrong message.
The plenary can of course be wiser than a Committee, and so I recommend that it adopt Amendment No 22, thereby making a clear statement that we are extending the lower rate of VAT for labour-intensive services beyond 31 December 2003.
In exactly the same way, by means of Amendment No 21, we can do the same for films.
