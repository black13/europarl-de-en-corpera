. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this amendment requires clarification.
I personally am in favour of its substance, and, like the majority in this House, I also voted in favour of it at first reading stage, but the Council could not be persuaded to accept it.
We have just voted on a compromise with the Council.
Amendment No 38 is not part of the compromise package agreed with the Council, but Amendment No 58 is, and replaces it.
I believe that if we vote in favour of Amendment No 58, we will be making it possible for the directive to be adopted without a conciliation procedure.
That does not mean that Parliament has changed its mind in this matter; indeed, we made this clear not only at first reading but also, repeatedly, on other occasions.
In this procedure, though, we should not insist on the amendment.
Somebody asked me, ‘How, if you have principles, can you compromise on such important issues?’
I believe that Europe demands compromises of us in matters of policy in order that we may make progress.
I do not believe that politics should be left to people who have no principles.
That is why I ask you to vote against Amendment No 38 and in favour of Amendment No 58.
