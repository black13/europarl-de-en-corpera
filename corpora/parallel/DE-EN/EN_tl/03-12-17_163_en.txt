Let me point out to you, Mr Martin, that I am obliged by Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure to call you to order.
I will also point out to you that, should you repeat your actions and thus oblige me to do so again, a note will be made to that effect in the Minutes of the sitting.
If this warning is of no effect, then I will, with regret, have to order you from the Chamber, so I ask you to desist from your disorderly conduct.
