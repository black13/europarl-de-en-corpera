– Mr President, I did it because I was, until this morning, on the list of speakers, and was then ‘deselected’ by the parliamentary business manager of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, thus being deprived of the right to speak.
For the time that I would have spoken, I wanted to show, symbolically at any rate, what an independent in this House can stand for, even when someone from his own group prevents him from speaking.
I do, though, thank you for your understanding, Mr President.
