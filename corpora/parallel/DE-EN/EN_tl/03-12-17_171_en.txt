Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Austria the Conciliation Committee’s decision was received with anger and dismay by the government, Parliament, the entire population, by all parties and all the media.
There can be no talk of electioneering here.
I believe we could fill the empty chairs in this room thousands of times over today with people wanting to tell you of their anger and consternation.
It is the first time in the Union’s legal history that the vital interests of a Member State have been treated in this way.
Many of you speak of forbearance – think about the word: Austria is treated with forbearance, privileges are granted, prerogatives are extended.
Many of you who speak in such terms seem to believe we built the Alps out of spite and we filled our countryside with the continent’s most sensitive plants so that we can stir up national hysteria.
What people in Austria feel is that there is a tremendous danger, and it does not involve only Austrian interests.
It is the danger that the right to the free movement of goods, with which we all agree, is becoming a religious right violating the human right to health and protection of the environment and that we are only taking accompanying measures but not guaranteeing people their basic right to health and environment.
I will not comment further on this never-ending story with its pitiful outcome.
But what you are doing today, Mr President, is raising a question of legal policy.
You are turning an environmental conflict, an ecological disaster, into a legal conflict that is unique in history.
Austria does not want that solution.
Nobody wants it.
Do you really want to force this regulation on us against this country’s will, a regulation that is eyewash, camouflage, and which Austria will not enforce?
Is that really your intention?
