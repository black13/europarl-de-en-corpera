Mr President, tomorrow we shall be voting on a report that no longer deals with the original problem, namely the reduction of atmospheric pollutants by means of a qualitative and quantitative restriction on transit traffic through Austria.
The outcome of the Conciliation Committee is that far more ecopoints are available for vehicles remaining in the ecopoint system than are actually required.
The upshot is that this system in effect no longer sets any limits on transit traffic through Austria and is quite simply pointless.
Moreover, Austria is required to introduce an expensive counting system that is virtually unfeasible technically and brings only expense and no ecological benefits.
In view of this, the fact that the arrangement will apply for three years and not only for the Alpine passes but for the whole of Austria is completely irrelevant.
To agree to this arrangement would be sheer and utter nonsense and in the end will damage the standing of this House.
I therefore ask you to reject the report tomorrow.
It would land on the list of senseless decisions and that list is already long enough.
With every yes vote on this report we, the European Parliament, will be making ourselves a mockery six months before the elections.
