Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why was it so difficult to reach an agreement?
Because we were faced with the task of finding a solution for a country that has not itself played a constructive part in the process.
We have known what Austria does not want since the first reading here in the European Parliament on the Council decisions.
To this day I do not know what Austria does want.
I only know that again they do not want the compromise.
So I ask for your understanding when I say that we have dealt with the matter quite seriously.
How can we find a continuation of the ecopoint system that does justice to Austria’s legitimate interests if Austria does not take part in the decision-making process?
I can only say that I and my group agree with this compromise, even if the newspapers and the Parliament’s Minutes and press releases said I voted against it – I only voted against the number of points because I thought 6.9 million was rather too low.
The Commission also had other calculations, but I was unable to get my way in the parliamentary delegation.
I am therefore naturally for the compromise that was reached.
When Mr Swoboda says we succeeded in introducing modern technology into Europe, he is right except for one country.
I would like to reiterate that here at this point: because of the ecopoint system the lorries on the roads in southern Germany and northern Italy are more modern than the ones the Republic of Austria itself has licensed in its own country because it does not use the ecopoint system.
Austria could have set a good example here with national rules.
The directive on the introduction of Euro 3 and Euro 4 made provision for this, for using tax incentives to encourage modernisation of the HGV fleet.
Then much of what has been said to us so emotionally today would have been easier to believe.
I hope that the compromise will be given a large majority here tomorrow.
