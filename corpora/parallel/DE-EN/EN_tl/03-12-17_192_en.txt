Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, since rapporteur Lisi has already given us an excellent explanation of the compromise, I would simply like to deal in my address with a few rumours or arguments.
Some Member States have recently been having doubts about the compromise, thinking it places too heavy a burden on the airlines.
But that cannot be the case at all.
The European Parliament has clearly reduced the rates of compensation in the airlines’ favour.
The European Parliament has introduced clear rules for cases of so that airlines do not have to act if they are not responsible for the circumstances leading to a cancellation or overbooking.
The Parliament has even put back the entry into force for 12 months because we take the airlines’ particular and difficult economic situation seriously.
So these entire arrangements will not come into force until 2005.
If the transport industry, be it the tourism sector or some other one, is now voicing doubts about this compromise, then I have to say that it is more than unfair and not at all acceptable.
Many governments need to think whether they want to risk being shown by us as a Parliament to be clearly hostile to the consumer if they take this line in the Council.
European elections are looming, should the Council wish to take this subject up.
May I make one further remark in conclusion?
The budget airlines, who did not take any of this at all seriously at first, are now coming and saying that these levels of compensation are far too high.
If a budget airline offers a flight for EUR 50, then it is still obliged to make the flight, despite the low price.
Because the rights of the citizen who wants to go somewhere at a particular time, be it for business or tourism, have been violated and he must be compensated if he is left standing or can only fly a day later.
Even budget airlines must compensate their passengers.
