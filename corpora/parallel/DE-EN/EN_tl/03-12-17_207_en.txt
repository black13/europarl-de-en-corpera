. – Honourable Member, I asked this very same question when I came to deal with your question.
I am therefore in the happy position of being able to give you a very precise answer.
First, you need to know what a Dublin Group is.
The Dublin Group is the grouping of industrialised nations, that is all the EU Member States, the USA, Canada and Australia, which coordinates initiatives to combat drugs and drug trafficking.
In cooperation with third countries who do not belong to this Dublin Group, this group deploys ‘mini Dublin Groups’ with a regional coverage, so a mini Dublin Group in Ankara would mean that the members of the Dublin Group and Turkey cooperate in these matters in Turkey itself.
