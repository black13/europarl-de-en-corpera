. â€“ Honourable Member, the Commission is not at present planning a communication on the application of the competition rules in sport.
The Commission believes that the established practice of action on a case by case basis, which now goes back several years, provides sound guidance as to when and to what extent the competition rules apply.
The international sporting bodies that are primarily responsible for regulating sport are generally aware of these rules in any case.
The competition rules of the EC Treaty apply only for economic activities in connection with sport; they do not of course apply for genuine sporting activities.
There are borderline cases and there may also be borderline cases where it is hard to make the distinction between economic and non-economic activities.
But those problems are best dealt with on a case by case basis because account can then be taken of the particular nature of the sport in question.
