. – That, honourable Member, is an interesting reference to the current debate about the constitution.
The Commission can in fact well imagine special attention being paid to sport in the proposed constitution.
However, if I rightly understand the discussion that has taken place about it in the Convention and in public, the issue is not so much the question of the application of competition rules but rather whether the European institutions can also be given a ‘soft’ competence in the realm of sport.
Coming back to the issue of competition policy, the Commission does not for the future rule out a definition that would then be embodied in a communication.
But for the present I can only repeat our position that we believe it is better for all concerned that doubtful cases should be decided as they arise in the light of decisions already taken.
