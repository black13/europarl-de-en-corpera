– Honourable Member, I am very grateful to you for this question because it in fact touches on a very, very important aspect of the whole accession process.
And I can inform you that the question of human rights and thus of respect for and protection of minorities have been key elements for the opening of accession negotiations since the introduction of the accession process by the Copenhagen European Council over 10 years ago.
I would like to say again expressly here that fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria is a prerequisite for the commencement and conclusion of negotiations with applicant countries, and we define this as meaning that applicants must be fully developed democracies, that the rule of law must be fully developed, that human rights must be fully respected and minorities must be protected in accordance with the European standard for minorities.
The Commission has always followed developments affecting minorities in all applicant countries closely for the pre-accession strategies and the Europe agreements.
The regular reports on progress in the applicant countries have dealt with this question in detail every year, and they have not only reported on improvements and advances, but have also, as you know, always been very clear about shortcomings.
All this has been possible because we have been and are in permanent contact with the parties involved in the process, including the representatives of ethnic groups and minorities.
Apart from the Commission services’ regular contacts through EU delegations visiting a country or administrative centre, the Commission has sponsored or taken part in many committees and seminars on various questions affecting minorities.
These contacts will continue to be cultivated in the months ahead even after accession.
I would like to assure you that the Commission has always cultivated close contacts with minorities and their representatives or the relevant non-governmental organisations in Europe and will naturally continue to do so.
