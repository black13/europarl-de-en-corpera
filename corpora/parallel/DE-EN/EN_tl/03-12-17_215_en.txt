I have just one question concerning the group of countries that will now be acceding on 1 May.
Will you until 1 May still be the point of contact for any minority representatives in those accession countries who still wish to raise a concern before then?
Is that still within your field of competence?
That is one question, and the second question is, who will be the point of contact in the Commission following accession?
