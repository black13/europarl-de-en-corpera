. – This question gives me an opportunity to make that clear because it is obvious that not everyone has understood it yet.
My competence for relations with the accession countries is complete and undivided up until 1 May 2004.
That therefore means that anything that still has to be discussed with those countries passes through me and if minority representatives want talks or if something still needs to be raised with the governments in this area I am naturally willing to do so.
Quite by chance, I met with the representatives of the German minority in Poland in Wroclaw only a few days ago.
So if there should be any concerns I am ready to do so.
After 1 May – after accession – the commissioners will be responsible for the areas of falling within their portfolios.
So in the matter of the protection of minorities I think my colleague Mr Vittorino will be taking over after 1 May 2004 and if I know him he will certainly be very committed to seeing that the rights of minorities are safeguarded everywhere.
