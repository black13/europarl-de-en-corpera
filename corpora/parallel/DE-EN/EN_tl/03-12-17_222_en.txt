. â€“ Two brief comments, honourable Member.
I think we should not misunderstand one another.
I did not say that the media are exaggerating things.
I did say that in the specific case of information about the situation in the Czech border areas sensational reporting has resulted in demand for child prostitution becoming really visible.
I meant that as an appeal to the media to show a measure of restraint in their reporting.
I fully agree with you that it is essentially a problem of the poverty that is a consequence of the transition and that this problem is by no means confined to the Czech Republic but that there are still far worse situations in Europe.
I was in Moldova a few days ago, and there the problem is much more shocking in extent and is quite clearly a consequence of the bitter poverty in which the people there live, so the strategy of increasing the chances for economic prosperity for the countries in transition within Europe is quite certainly a right one.
The other is better cooperation in the field of police and justice.
Now so far as the specific problem in the Czech Republic is concerned, I can tell you from my contacts with the German and Austrian Governments and also from direct contacts on the spot, with police stations in Bavaria, for example, that our assessment is that cooperation with the Czech police and the Czech judiciary now satisfies the requirements.
There were times when this cooperation was not sufficiently developed.
