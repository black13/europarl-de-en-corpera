. â€“ I do not know, honourable Member.
I do not know because that is a question that is definitely not within my field of competence and I would not like to anticipate my colleague who is competent in this matter and who has prepared to answer this question but who will be giving his answer at a later point in this question time.
Please understand that I do not have the competence to answer your question.
