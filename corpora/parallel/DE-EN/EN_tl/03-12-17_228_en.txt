â€“ Mr Dunn, I am happy to admit that the Commission cannot know everything.
Unfortunately there is no that would allow us to gather accurate information from the current Member States.
However, I am happy to follow up your comments.
What is more, I believe that our assessments coincide.
If you receive information about individual or recurring cases of this kind, please do not hesitate to contact me directly and in person.
I have no problem picking up the telephone in such cases and contacting the relevant Head of Government himself in order to explain what we expect from him and his country.
As regards the Czech Republic, I had an opportunity to speak to the relevant members of the government just a few days ago in the course of a visit to Prague.
I expect an answer from Prague very soon, and that will point the way forward.
