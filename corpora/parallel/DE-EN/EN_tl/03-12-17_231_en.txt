– As I understand it, Mrs McKenna’s political statement contains a question as to what I think of it.
It is one that I am happy to answer.
I agree with you, Mrs McKenna.
I agree with you except on one point: the European Union has never implemented sanctions against Austria.
This must be made very clear.
It was the Member States, acting as sovereign states, who introduced restrictions on bilateral relations.
The EU as such never imposed any sanctions on Austria.
Like you, I believe that we cannot allow double standards on human rights in the European Union.
This means that if we deal with a matter as a human rights issue, it will be treated as such across the board.
Consequently, if we identify human rights abuses relating to psychiatric treatment, we have to address the issue in all Member States, both new and old.
Obviously, this can still be done after accession, since the relevant Treaty provisions will remain in force – the provisions that refer to the need to obey and respect the fundamental values on which the European Union is built.
There is no doubt that these values include respect for human rights.
