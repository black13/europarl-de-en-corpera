– Mrs Zorba, the Foreign Minister of Turkey was in Brussels a few days ago.
I had a long talk with him.
He did not tell me what might be contained in the compromise his government is currently seeking with the Turkish Cypriots.
Having spoken to him, however, I had the impression – and he went on to state this publicly, as did Prime Minister Erdogan – that, following the elections in Northern Cyprus, the time may be ripe for relaunching discussions on the basis of the Annan Plan.
I hope they will continue to think along these lines.
I regard Prime Minister Erdogan’s statement, which you also quoted, as a positive signal.
I can endorse this statement and say that this election clearly and unequivocally demonstrates the will of genuine Turkish Cypriots, namely those who actually live in Cyprus.
It shows that they want both a solution to the conflict based on the UN plan and also to accede to the European Union.
It would be wise and appropriate to respect the clear will of the majority of the population.
Thirdly, on the subject of the election observers and their findings, I can tell you that even before the elections I received regular updates from them regarding what they saw.
On several occasions before the elections I publicly highlighted the manipulation of the electoral registers and also asked the Turkish Government to ensure that this was rectified.
I have no doubt that the number of voters in this election was in fact artificially inflated, with the intention of manipulating the results.
