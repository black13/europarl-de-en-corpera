– Something happened yesterday which does not belong in the Minutes, where it would merely be out of place, but rather in the full session report.
I must take advantage of you being here again.
Yesterday I addressed a question to the Italian President-in-Office of the Council and received an answer.
I then asked a follow-on question.
In the full session report, you will remember, I asked whether he was saying yes or no, and his answer was no.
This ‘no’ does not appear in the full session report, although I recorded it on tape myself.
What is more, the full session report repeats the second part of his written reply, distorting the overall sense of the question time.
I would therefore ask, since I am sure you still remember this whole yes and no business yesterday, that the records be corrected.
