â€“ Commissioner, it is not only Parliament that is divided over this issue, but also the Council.
There are even divergences in the criminal law provisions in different Member States.
Let me therefore ask once again: given that the Council cannot agree on this extremely important matter, and given that there is a blocking minority, can the Commission not decide to set the subject aside until the Council has reached agreement?
That is my first question.
My second question is whether you know why Commissioner Busquin never takes part in question time debates on this subject.
It is not the first time this has happened.
