– Commissioner, let me start by saying that I sleep particularly well in Brussels – I am not sure why that is.
I want to speak, though, as a member of the delegation for relations between the European Union and Switzerland, and we have a problem with night flight restrictions and Zürich airport.
What is your view on the way in which flights between southern Germany and Zürich have developed, and how will the legal situation evolve in years to come?
The fact is there are numerous complaints, meaning on the one hand that aeroplanes are not supposed to approach over Zürich, while the Germans do not want them either.
As a result, at the moment there is a ban on approach routes over southern Germany, which in turn has led to an increased number of flight approaches over the city of Zürich.
I would therefore be interested to hear how the European Union, and in particular the Commission, expects this problem to develop in future.
