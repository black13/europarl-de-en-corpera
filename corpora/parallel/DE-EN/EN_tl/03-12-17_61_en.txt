. â€“ In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to make a brief statement for the benefit of Members.
Today, we are voting on the compromise package on medicinal products legislation, a compromise influenced by a lot of different ideas from this House.
I therefore ask Members to support Blocks 1, 2 and 3, but not under any circumstances Block 4 or parts thereof.
If even only one amendment from Block 4 is adopted, we will have to go to conciliation, and it will not be possible to adopt the Common Position today; hence my appeal to you.
The package we have put together with the Council is a good one, so please support the compromise.
