It was almost twenty-five years ago now that the Members of the European Parliament were, for the first time, directly elected by the people.
That was a milestone.
To this day, though, there is no Act on Members’ Legal Status to regulate on one single basis the rights and duties of MEPs, and that is a disgrace, but not, admittedly, one of which this House should be ashamed.
If anyone should be ashamed, it is the Council.
I was first elected to this Parliament in 1994.
Since then, I have had, time and again, the experience of seeing how the Council, when it came to the issue of a Members’ Statute, allowed us to run round in circles.
The second attempt at one that I have experienced was this summer, and when we had at last adopted a Statute full of concessions and willingness to compromise, I thought that we were out of the woods.
All that was needed was the Council’s approval, but the Council adopts its customary stance of nose in the air and absolute immobility.
Shame on them!
I have voted against the resolution, because I cannot see why we should now throw away the Statute we have adopted and present the Council not with a law on the legal position of MEPs, but with mere pay scales, of which we cannot be other than ashamed and for which the public will laugh us to scorn.
