The World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva has barely featured on the European Parliament’s agenda beyond the insider interests of a small number of Members.
Unfortunately, as a result, Parliament and, indeed, the other institutions were hardly represented – beyond the official statements by the Member States and the Commission – as active participants.
The evaluation of the Geneva Summit and the ensuing implementation measures must now be geared towards the second phase of the Summit in Tunis in November 2005.
For the first time at one of the major UN conferences, civil society groups were included as partners, and this proved very beneficial.
The presentation by the developing countries, with multifaceted initiatives to overcome the digital divide, was impressive.
Surprisingly, the ACP Council of Ministers produced an ACP/EU common position for signature.
The basis for an implementation strategy, which I called for in my 2001 general report and which is long overdue, and which must focus on the social benefits for all sections of the population, has therefore finally been established.
This must include the right to freedom of opinion.
The Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action must be evaluated by the Commission and Parliament in terms of their implementability.
At the same time, the remaining contentious issues must be resolved before Tunis, including how the Digital Solidarity Fund demanded by Senegal can developed in a sensible way.
