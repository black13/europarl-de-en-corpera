.
Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, you have successfully concluded the 2004 budget procedure, and I would like to emphasise that this outcome is the result of excellent cooperation between the European institutions.
You have done your homework, and from a budgetary perspective, the preparations for enlargement are now complete.
Let me say this: outsiders might think, from the results of the 2004 budget, that the budget specialists are able to produce minor miracles.
However, it is not a miracle; it is the outcome of a great deal of good hard work.
This result was achieved thanks to the outstanding chairmanship of Mr Wynn and the excellent work by the rapporteurs, especially Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill.
The last budget in this parliamentary term is a real masterpiece.
On behalf of the Commission, thank you very much!
