.
Mr President, honourable Members, this report demonstrates yet again that the European Parliament is willing and able to identify compromises.
We are concluding this matter at second reading.
I would have wished that the cooperation, especially with the Council, had been as good as on trade.
In these negotiations, the Council was a little less willing to compromise than in the other negotiations.
Nonetheless, we have achieved a result that we can rely on and that we can accept.
I would therefore ask my fellow Members to vote for the amendments in Block I, and I think that although one or two Members might feel uncomfortable about the outcome of the conciliation process, by and large, this report is acceptable.
