.
I would just like to make a brief point on the vote.
We have the opportunity to conclude this report at first reading, that is, during the current legislative term.
Let me comment briefly on the vote itself: I would ask you to support my amendments, which I have tabled on behalf of my group.
I would like to reject the amendments on the internalisation of external costs because they have nothing to do with this report.
This is a technical report, and the internalisation of external costs will be regulated next year when we deal with infrastructure-charging systems.
The two issues must be kept separate.
Amendments which relate to the protection of the London system, that is, Amendment Nos 22 and 44, but also 41 and 45, are completely redundant as the draft directive has nothing to do with urban systems or other island solutions, and by island, I do not necessarily mean the British isles.
Let me make a comment on Galileo.
Amendment Nos 43 and 48 are identical.
They both aim to achieve the same thing.
Amendment No 48, which I tabled, is in the more appropriate place, in my view.
I would therefore ask you to support it.
Please, ladies and gentlemen, take heart.
Vote with my group, and then we can do the right thing and conclude the matter during this parliamentary term.
