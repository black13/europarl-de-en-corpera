Mr President, I would like to inform my fellow Members who are streaming out of the Chamber that I voted against the Costa report.
I did so quite voluntarily, because I pressed the wrong button.
I am absolutely convinced that this compromise is not a sound compromise.
The fact that those concerned felt it would be better to allow a free-for-all rather than conclude this compromise speaks volumes: a free-for-all, in practice, is better than this compromise.
I hope that during the discussions on the directive on road charging in the coming weeks and months, we will pursue the channels and utilise the available opportunities to establish the safeguards for the health of local communities in sensitive areas, such as narrow valleys, that are necessary to meet current standards.
I would therefore ask the House to provide its assistance and support in connection with the directive on road charging as well.
