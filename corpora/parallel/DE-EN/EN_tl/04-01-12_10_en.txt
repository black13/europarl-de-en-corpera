. â€“ Mr President, I wish to speak to this topic on behalf of the rapporteur.
I have been advised that he would have been quite happy to have this report put to the vote this week, one reason being that we know from experience that attendance is higher when we are in Strasbourg than when we are sitting in Brussels.
This topic is of particular importance, one that has been under discussion for many, many months already, and our committee has put off voting on it over and over again, not least because it is so momentous and problematic.
This time, though, we believe that the time for a decision on the matter has come and that it can be taken this week.
