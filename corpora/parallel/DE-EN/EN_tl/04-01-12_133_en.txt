â€“ Mr President, just a few words on the support measures: to be sure, past decades have seen a lot of money poured into the promotion of nuclear energy, just, incidentally, as it is today into renewable energies.
I think that is right.
If you put that in terms of kilowatt-hours, in the case of nuclear power, the amount is down in the one-thousandths, whilst, with renewable energy, we are talking about tens of cents.
I am not saying that I am against it; I just want to make the proportions clear.
Tomorrow, the issue of the Euratom loans will probably boil down to the question of whether we should support nuclear power stations in the course of construction or those that are being used, on which subject the only thing I have to say is that we are indirectly supporting nuclear energy in Russia by buying more and more gas from the Russians.
Russia will be unable to supply much of this gas in future unless it cuts back on gas at home, which will be replaced by electricity from coal-fired power stations and from nuclear power stations that are being built.
Perhaps we should give some thought to that when we talk about a European energy strategy.
Our increased use of gas does, it is true, mean that we are improving our record on CO2-emissions, but elsewhere, more CO2 is being produced from coal-burning power stations, or nuclear power is being promoted.
That is something else we should bear in mind; it shows that our own energy strategy is not always consistent.
I believe that we should vote in favour of these Euratom loans, quite simply because of the improvement in safety.
It was for this reason that the Council of Ministers, after Chernobyl, increased the funding for Euratom loans.
I believe that the argument still holds water today.
