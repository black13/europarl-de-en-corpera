– Mr President, I did not actually want to make a statement, but, as a number of Members have spoken, I will do so after all.
It must be absolutely plain to us in this House that we will not allow anyone – be they terrorists, anarchists or anyone else – to bring pressure to bear on us.
We affirm that European integration is a labour of peace, of understanding and of reconciliation, from which nobody in Europe or anywhere in the world will succeed in diverting us.
We should therefore consider how we can improve our security, but should also be utterly determined to press on with our labour of peace in uniting Europe.
