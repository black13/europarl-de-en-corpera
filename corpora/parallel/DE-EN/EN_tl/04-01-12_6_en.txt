– Mr President, the agenda for this afternoon includes Mr Pex’s report on sanctions for pollution offences at sea.
Mr Pex is well, as are Mr Doorn and others, and I am telling you that so that you are not dismayed by what I also have to tell you, which is that they have been in an aircraft accident.
It would appear from what I have been told that the aircraft ran off the runway, but all of them are all right.
Mr Pex has asked that his report should be taken today rather than being adjourned, and that it should be presented by Mr Bremmer, who, although he is not a member of the committee, is well-informed about the issue.
I was more than willing to convey this request to you.
