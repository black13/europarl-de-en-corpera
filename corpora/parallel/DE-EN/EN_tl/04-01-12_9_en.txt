– Mr President, on Thursday, we are due to debate and vote on the Zappalà report on the recognition of diplomas.
Although there is no reason whatever why the debate should not be held on Thursday morning, I would ask that we defer the vote on this report until the sitting in Brussels at the end of the month.
There are two reasons for this request, which I am making on behalf of my group.
The first is that there are a few amendments that still need to be checked before they go for translation today, and there is very little time left in which to do it.
I believe that the total number of amendments will be over 300.
The other is that a large number of Members of this House are flying off to India on Thursday morning for the Social Forum.
The recognition of professional qualifications is such an important topic, and one that affects so many members of the public, that it really would be sensible and proper for there to be a very large number of Members in this House to vote on it.
That is a reason for us to do it at a time when we can guarantee that many of us will be present, and so we ask that the vote on this report be held in Brussels at the end of the month, but that the debate should still be on Thursday morning.
