. – It is a fact that tuna is the canning industry’s most important product, not only in this Community, but also worldwide.
A number of countries belonging to this Community have a traditionally strong position in the tuna sector and are vulnerable to changes in the market.
It is clear, not only from the Committee on Fisheries’ hearing, but also from what my colleague Mr Varela has said, that the time has come to act.
Third countries, particularly those in Asia, have recently sought to secure for themselves a major chunk of the tuna market, which is a lucrative one.
I see one explanation for the success of our non-European competitors as being the fact that they have an advantage in terms of costs over the owners of ships belonging to the Community fleet.
European shipowners have to comply with Community regulations on hygiene, supervision of fishing activity, production conditions, protection of the environment, and social security for their workers.
Important and right though that is, it costs money.
In order to prevent shipowners from abandoning the Community flag for the sake of competitive advantage, I call for defensive action.
Firstly, there is a need for coordination of the Community policy measures that affect the tuna fleet and the canning industry; secondly, additional fisheries agreements are needed; thirdly, if third countries want to sell their products on the EU market, compliance with health and hygiene regulations must be an absolute requirement; and, fourthly, duties on canned tuna must be maintained until such time as import and trade restrictions are lifted.
What this boils down to is that the EU’s strategy must be a coordinated one and conceived at international level.
