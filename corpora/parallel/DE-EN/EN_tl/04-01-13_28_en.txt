– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we have to bear in mind is that this is not a legislative procedure, but we are discussing our position on the Commission’s Green Paper.
Although we had asked for something else, the Commission has responded to the Langen report by presenting us with this Green Paper.
Secondly, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, who have approached this from many different angles in the course of the discussion process, for preparing, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a very good resolution, and one that is likely to get majority support now that it is to be voted on by plenary.
Thirdly, the question arises of what services of general interest are.
We take the term to mean services for the public that are provided in the interests of all.
They are meant to provide services where the market alone cannot do so on a universal basis, at a reasonable price, or, in many instances, free of charge.
Services of general interest ensure security of supply.
Service providers may compete among themselves, but they do not have to.
Support from public funds is required.
What is crucial is not who provides the services but the fact that they are provided.
Services of general interest are an expression of the European social model and of the ecologically-responsible market economy.
What was crucial for me was the safeguarding of the subsidiarity principle; I can endorse the Social Democrats’ Amendment No 18.
I welcome the statement that the liberal professions perform services of general interest for the good of all, and I am glad that we have made it our concern that the definition of services of general interest and responsibility for them should be matters for the Member States rather than for Europe as a whole.
