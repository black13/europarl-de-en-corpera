– Mr President, as permanent rapporteur for the agencies, I would like to make the following budget-related points in addition to the opinion on this project, on which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has led.
My first point is that this regulatory agency should have its headquarters, for reasons of cost, close to the Commission.
The second is that the functions of the regulatory agencies should be limited to the creation of secondary legislation linked to the Commission’s initiatives and should be subject to the approval of the budgetary authority.
Thirdly, I believe it to be important that the new regulatory agencies should exercise their autonomy subject to the direct control of the Commission and to the political control of the European Parliament.
Fourthly, it should also be laid down that all the provisions of the Financial Regulation and of the Staff Regulations shall apply to the regulatory agencies.
Fifthly and finally, the Commission should, before submitting any legislative proposal for the establishment of a regulatory agency, present an assessment of its budgetary consequences and of its profitability, as well as proposals for the redeployment and management of human resources.
