– Mr President, we agree with Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, when he tells us that the EU is to have the most modern administration in the world.
If this goal is to be achieved, though, all the administrative units must be modernised; not just the Commission’s main offices, but also the subordinate offices, the agencies, and I can also see that the establishment, organisation and control of these is flourishing unchecked.
There is too little transparency; often there is neither the necessary efficiency nor adequate control, and that is why the agencies of the future need to be put on a new footing.
In its report, Parliament now demands that an agency should be established by a law adopted by way of the codecision procedure.
The joint involvement of the Commission, Parliament and the Council in this decision must become the norm in future.
The legislative act of establishment must also stipulate where the agency is to be based.
I could spend all my speaking time on what went on between Helsinki and Parma with regard to the food agency.
That was a tragedy.
Nothing of the sort must be allowed to happen again, and the choice of headquarters must be made by reference to competence and cost-efficiency.
We have to cut back the number of types of agencies; having fifteen agencies divided up into twelve types makes for an impossible situation.
As these agencies are subject to the Commission, it is the Commission that should appoint their directors.
I will conclude by thanking Mrs Almeida Garrett for this report, and by expressing the hope that it will get through.
