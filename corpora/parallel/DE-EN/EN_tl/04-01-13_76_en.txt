â€“ Mr President, I regret having reacted too slowly.
I wish to remove my name from the Breyer report in view of the decision by the majority in this House to support nuclear power stations in the course of construction within and outside the EU, which is diametrically opposed to my own position.
I would therefore ask you to have it recorded in the Minutes that I wish to resign as rapporteur for this report.
