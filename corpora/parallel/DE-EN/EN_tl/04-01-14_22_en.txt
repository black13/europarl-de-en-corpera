– Mr President, we can fully endorse two remarks about the draft Constitution and the Intergovernmental Conference made by the President-in-Office of the Council.
You spoke, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, of the excellent work done by the Convention.
Mr Cohn-Bendit mocked your comments.
I will take them seriously and at face value.
Your words indicate that you will not allow your colleagues at the IGC to destroy that excellent work and again leave it in tatters.
We know that the IGC will not adopt the draft text exactly as it stands.
Nevertheless, the draft Constitution is more than just a starting point – it is balanced, fair, and contains all the key elements for a solution.
In a Union of states and citizens, Mr Poettering, the double majority system forms part of that essential factor: balance.
That is why it is included in the draft Constitution, and not to give any Member State an edge.
Your second comment, Mr President-in-Office, was that you want to move ahead swiftly.
You want to report back in March and we fully support that aim.
On this point, Mr Poettering, I agree with you for once.
The rumours and prognostications about a two-tier or two-speed system, about centres of gravity and so forth must stop, and the best way to do that is by providing a European Constitution, and fast.
Mr President-in-Office, you expressed your conviction that the European Union needs a Constitution.
Obviously, we share that view.
However, we do not need any old Constitution; we need the Convention’s proposed text.
What is more, we need it now, not just in two or three years’ time.
The world and the new challenges it brings is not going to wait for Europe.
If I may, I would also like to address Mr Poettering.
Mr Poettering, you called for the results of the elections to be taken into account when the next President of the Commission is appointed.
I am very happy to hear you speak out so clearly in favour of a Commission President from the ranks of the social democrats.
