Perhaps I could also say a few words about Mr Poettering’s speech.
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants a Commission President from within its ranks.
That is all very well.
In that case, however, Mr Poettering needs to name names before the election.
He cannot expect the citizens of Europe to buy a pig in a poke.
