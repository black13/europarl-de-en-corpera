– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today you have unambiguously declared yourself in favour of multilateralism.
You have called for the United Nations to be strengthened and mentioned the UN General Secretary’s visit to the European Parliament, which is scheduled for the end of the month.
I do not think many presidents-in-office have begun by speaking out so clearly in favour of multilateralism and the United Nations in this House.
Moreover, I believe that the challenges we will be discussing in great detail over the coming weeks – international terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, disintegrating states, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings – are too much for even the world’s strongest nation to tackle alone.
It is multilateral solutions we need.
Mr President-in-Office, I think this is another reason why we need the Constitution, however.
The European Union is not ready to put up a united front against the United Nations system.
There are too many stakeholders.
The European Union is a member of the FAO, with a seat and a vote.
As yet the European Union has no legal status in external relations.
We have a Commission office in New York.
We have a Council office in New York.
We need this Constitution to enable the European Union to obtain this legal status and act in this sphere as well.
Consequently, both for the purposes of external relations and in terms of working within the United Nations system, where the European Union is the greatest contributor, we need to increase our political influence and express our political strength together.
That is why we need to have a Constitution very soon, and I ask you to take that into account during your consultations.
If Europe wants influence, there is no place for division.
The only way is to act as a community, and your declaration in favour of multilateralism is a very significant starting point.
