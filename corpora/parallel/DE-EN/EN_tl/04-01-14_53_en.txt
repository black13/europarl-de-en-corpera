– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with all those who have said that the Irish Presidency’s most important task is to secure the adoption of a Constitution which is as close as possible to the Convention proposal.
I believe that in December we explicitly agreed to ask you to produce a consolidated text.
Enlargement and the elections are both scheduled for this year, and both will suffer if we do not begin them with a clear message on this subject.
Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned research policy, which is a very important subject.
We have to do more on this front, especially in comparison to the United States.
The disparity is particularly striking in the fields of biotechnology and medicine.
In the US, NIHs (National Institutes of Health) receive USD 28 billion every year for medical and biotechnology research.
The EU is spending EUR 2.25 billion over four years under the Sixth Framework Programme, and even adding in everything done in the Member States, the figures are a great deal lower.
This is the main reason why young medics and researchers are still migrating to the United States.
That said, we do also need a clear ethical framework for research, and I know that within your own country, as in the European Parliament, opinions vary: on the question of whether the European Union should support research on human embryos, for example.
Unfortunately, no agreement was reached on the subject under the Italian Presidency.
Commissioner Busquin’s behaviour was also somewhat ambiguous.
I think it is now up to you to pick up the ball and run with it.
It is your responsibility to work with your Minister for Research and devise a solution that is acceptable to all sides.
We cannot allow this matter to be resolved behind closed doors under the comitology procedure.
The political responsibility lies with the Council of Ministers, and I call on you to respect this.
