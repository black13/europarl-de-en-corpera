– Mr President, it is lamentable that the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe is turning into a never-ending story.
There are no positive developments within it to speak of and few from outside it to report.
The only positive aspect that comes to my mind is that the Commonwealth, at least, has not changed its stance on Zimbabwe.
The Council, too, though, when the situation first got worse three or four years ago, took a very ambivalent approach for a very long time.
As the main criticism in debates on matters of topical and urgent importance is often directed at the Council, I would like representatives from it not only to be present on such occasions, but also to make statements on the accusations levelled at it.
Where the travel ban is concerned, the Council always hides behind what it claims to be obligations under international diplomatic agreements, when – as usually happens – ministers from Zimbabwe are again allowed in.
Nowhere is it stated that a criminal regime must be accorded all diplomatic honours.
Of course one can take diplomatic reprisals against those who fail to abide by any human rights convention.
Of course you can also seize these people’s bank accounts and freeze the money until such time as circumstances change.
Nor, in my view, has the Council really made plain to South Africa the seriousness of our insistence that it too should bring this necessary pressure to bear.
I do not believe that we can sit by and wait for this problem to resolve itself.
We can of course try to avert our gaze, but the situation will become ever more pressing.
Other Members have already referred to the situation that people face, to the many millions of them who are already in South Africa illegally, and I see this as a situation in which pressure is needed, and must be brought to bear from every quarter.
There is no reason why our own governments should look away when these things are going on.
