â€“ Mr President, we are shocked by the murder of Archbishop Courtney, whom, in the five years that he was here in Strasbourg, we knew as a diplomat, pastor and also as a personal friend.
I simply have to say that he was one of the truly great ecclesiastical figures in the tradition of the great Irish churchmen of the Middle Ages, who was always actively committed to the cause of peace and humanity; it was he who made it possible for us, here in Strasbourg, to join together in a service once a month, something he started along with a few of us in this House.
I can still remember how Archbishop Courtney took his leave of us when he went to Burundi to actively involve himself in the peace process there.
As soon as his aircraft landed there, it was shot at; there were rockets to welcome him.
He then, in peril of his own life, spent five years participating in the peace process, drawing on the wide experience he had gained from his missions in trouble spots on four continents.
He was meant to go to Cuba this week to take up office as papal Nuncio there and help human rights and freedom of religion to prevail.
His mysterious, brutal and deliberate murder put a stop to that.
We should honour his memory.
He would certainly not, though, want his murder to be the only reason for us to focus on Burundi and thereby forget that murder is a daily occurrence in that country.
In recent years, over 200 000 people have been murdered there, not because of what we term ethnic conflicts, but because of a deliberate policy of genocide, and the fact that the situation in nearby Rwanda is even worse, and that in its neighbours Uganda and the Congo no better, should not hide from us the fact that we have a special obligation to this region, tormented as it is by ethnic killings that know no borders.
Europe does have obligations here, and our respect for Archbishop Courtney and for his legacy demands that we take appropriate action.
