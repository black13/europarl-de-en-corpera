. â€“ Mr President, I wish to table another oral amendment.
Have no fear: it does not take up any new issues.
I have noted that one of the amendments has been incorrectly translated, and I do not think it accurately reflects the opinion of the Committee.
The text of item 8, which I have also forwarded to you, should properly read as follows: 'considers that, in the area of collective exercise of rights, the enlargement of the European Union means that there is a need for suitable measures and that action may be required'.
I think Members need have no qualms about voting for this.
