Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the Lisbon objective of becoming the most competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based society by 2010, this is not just a question of economic and industrial policy but above all a question of education and training.
Another area is the operation of the labour market and how it is changing as a matter of necessity.
At the interface between the two areas lie the efforts to promote high quality training and further training and the protection of mutual cross-border recognition of professional qualifications.
I therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal.
In my address today I would like to go into one aspect in particular, namely the equality, in terms of level and conditions, of the professional qualifications of service providers and for freedom of establishment.
The requirements for the activity are the same, regardless of whether we are talking about a service or an establishment.
The activities are no different.
I cannot therefore understand why recognition of professional qualifications is provided for establishment, but no provision is made for the recognition of professional qualifications for the provision of services.
I do not think this distinction is right.
The present arrangement may even be contrary to Article 50 of the EC Treaty.
This allows services to be provided in an EU Member State subject to the same conditions as that State prescribes for its own nationals.
The conditions include equivalence of evidence of qualifications, provided such evidence is required in the host Member State.
To remove this problem, I ask you to vote in favour of Amendment No 213 tabled by Mr Zappalà and myself.
