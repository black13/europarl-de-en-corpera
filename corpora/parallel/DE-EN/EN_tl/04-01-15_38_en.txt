Madam President, it goes without saying that we must back the joint prosecution of tax fraud in Europe.
However, the EU continues to be outsmarted by professional tax fraudsters because our systems are far too complex.
We are flinging the doors open wide to such fraudsters and in so doing indirectly encouraging tax fraud.
If we are to do anything effective against it, we need not only more effective controls and close cooperation, but also tax laws that are easy to understand.
We urgently need a reform of our VAT system, for example.
The highly complex dual VAT system where national sales are treated differently from EU sales is a major factor in billions being evaded relatively easily in the EU every year.
That is why we need a simpler VAT system that is easier to understand and where all sales in Europe are treated in the same way and not differently, so that tax fraud can actually be combated effectively.
Proposals have already been made to this effect; we only have to implement them.
I therefore propose that we at last introduce the tax card into the VAT system and treat sales the same, not differently, so as to achieve the aims we have set by actually cutting tax fraud.
