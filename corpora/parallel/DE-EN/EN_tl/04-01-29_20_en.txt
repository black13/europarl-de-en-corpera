– Mr President, this report definitely belongs in the list of top-quality Parliamentary topics.
If only there were not such a great gulf between theory and practice, between the words and reality, we could vote to approve it.
The report refers to a European Constitution that does not yet exist, and unfortunately the draft Constitution text is more focused on increased defence activities and greater ability to intervene in situations around the world than on disarmament and civil conflict resolution.
The report takes up the cause of multilateralism and strengthening the role of the UN, which is right and good.
It refrains, though, from criticising the aggressive unilateralism of the US, which opens the door to violence and arbitrary action.
As the war on Iraq has shown, no lie is too risky for use in justifying a preventative war.
Those who support the war are called yes-men; those who do not are called obstructive.
This is how people seek to divide what will soon be a Union of 25 Member States.
The United States’ high-handed decision to override the UN has proven a miscalculation for which the national economy is having to pay, as we are now seeing.
With its calls for reform, the EU is the only constant in an ever-changing world.
The EU would be well-advised to develop its relationship with the UN rather than to strengthen its ties with NATO.
The report highlights the importance of development and cooperation, but should be even more specific.
Instead of spending huge sums on the arms race and military operations, money should be spent on education, healthcare, economic development and the fight to eradicate poverty.
If we are to weed out violence and terrorism, we need as much money as possible and more effort.
