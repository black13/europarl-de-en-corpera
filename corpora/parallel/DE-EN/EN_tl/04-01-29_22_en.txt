– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me thank Mr Laschet, the rapporteur, for his excellent report, which should receive the support of the vast majority of people in plenary today.
Many speakers have emphasised how important it is that the global community should take joint action, failing which many problems will remain insuperable.
I would like to remind you of the importance of environmental pollution and the fight to eradicate poverty in particular.
These are subjects that can only be tackled together, and Amendment No 7, which has been submitted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, stresses the importance of the water supply.
I would, however, like to mention one subject that has not, so far, been discussed in very great detail, and one to which I urge Commissioner Patten to give his particular attention.
This subject is a common approach to human rights in the field of modern medicine and biotechnology.
A few months ago, Parliament approved a very good report produced by Robert Evans of the Socialist Group, on combating illegal trade in human organs.
Yet when we look at developing countries and newly industrialising countries, there is a great deal to be done in this area, and I think this is another task on which the EU and the UN must cooperate.
What is more, Parliament has often underlined its opposition to human cloning and its desire that the UN should intervene in this area too.
We are following the debate in the UN Committees with great interest – and let me emphasise once again, Commissioner Patten, that the European Parliament supports the Costa Rican initiative, which also has the backing of over 60 other members of the UN.
This is expressly stated once again in Amendment No 8.
While Kofi Annan is with us, I think we should reiterate the importance of this new task for the UN, for new developments demand new responses.
