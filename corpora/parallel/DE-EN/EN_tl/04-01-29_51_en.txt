– Mr President, this part contradicts a resolution already adopted by this House on the liberal professions.
I therefore ask that it be amended along the lines we have already agreed to, so that the oral amendment would read: ‘Considers that the Commission should not only take account of the market situation in applying the provisions of competition law to the liberal professions, but must also bear in mind the social aspects and tasks in the public interest.
Calls therefore on the Commission to allow associations of the liberal professions the discretion to take measures to permit them to perform their functions correctly.’
