– Mr President, I just wanted to raise something briefly.
A report by me on industrial associations has been put on this week’s agenda, without my knowledge, and, above all, also contrary to everything agreed by Parliament with the authorities here.
I learned of this when someone from in London phoned me about it.
On being asked how this could come to pass, the Parliament office responsible stated that it had been done with the groups’ agreement.
When I asked them, I was told it was the Parliamentary services that had done it.
This does not show this House in a very favourable light.
I now note – with gratitude, of course – that the report’s arrival will be subject to the rapporteur’s agreement, as certain groups are aware that it is the subject of important negotiations that are still in progress.
In practice, though, it would have been nice for this to have been done a bit more transparently and efficiently.
