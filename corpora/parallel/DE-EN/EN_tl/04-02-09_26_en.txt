– Mr President, I apologise for bringing this issue up again; I have so far heard that only in the original language.
I would just like to reiterate that there was a clear agreement with the Parliamentary services that this report would not be put on the agenda until March or April.
I then learned from in London that it was given a slot in February.
Only then did I say, ‘please, not yet!’
This is where you must not confuse cause and effect!
