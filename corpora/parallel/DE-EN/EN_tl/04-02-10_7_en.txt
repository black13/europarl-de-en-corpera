– Mr President, I am quite happy to agree with the Commissioner that his staff deserve thanks.
You said, Commissioner, that work is being done right now, on the ground, to combat the epidemic.
Good though that is, were you on the spot straightaway when the epidemic started?
Were you informed of it then, or only later on when the press picked up the story, and when there was general uproar among us?
You said, Commissioner, that small businesses have been affected, and that this could provide the impetus for industrialisation.
I take the view that it is precisely the moves towards industrialisation that have taken place in these countries that have created the conditions for this pandemic, for they have brought indigenous and adapted breeds into contact with genetically developed breeds that may have adapted to industrialisation but have genetic defects and lack resistance to this disease.
So, if you favour on-the-spot controls in this case, as we do, they must form part of a constant analytical process if these problems are to be addressed.
It is not the small-time poultry farmers who export to the European Union, but the large industrial plants, and their standards of hygiene must be equal to our own.
That will not, however, be achieved by having controls at borders or by tightening up the ones that are already in place – and always in a visible way, as the sort of reaction that Mrs Roth-Behrendt described; what we need instead is special external protection.
What this means is that prevention does not start at the border; rather, we must impose our standards, and monitor adherence to them, in the countries that supply us, enabling us to guarantee preventative observation and action to reorient production in these countries.
Thank you very much.
