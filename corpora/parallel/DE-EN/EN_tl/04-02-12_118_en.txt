Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also took part in the visit to Iran.
I am thankful that Iran is seeking dialogue and cooperation.
It has made us Europeans an offer, which came from the Supreme National Security Council, for the creation of a joint commission to engage in a bilateral Euro-Iranian dialogue centred on the fight against drugs.
At the present time, Iran has about two million drug addicts, along with some eight million occasional drug users.
These are very high numbers in a country with a population of 60 million.
The bulk of drugs leaving the region currently goes to America, but we can expect Europe to be targeted soon for a massive wave of drug smuggling.
This is why I am particularly grateful that the head of the Supreme National Security Council has made an offer to the European Union to work with him and his organisation to stop this flow of drugs from the war lords in Afghanistan.
The second offer, for another bilateral commission which would engage in a joint effort to combat terrorism, is one which, in my view, we should not refuse, likewise the offer made by the judiciary to cooperate with the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg in order to accelerate the training of Iranian judges in this field as well as simply to show them the advantages and disadvantages of the various systems.
This should be put at the heart of our bilateral relations.
Similarly, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the promotion of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises in Iran and those in the European Union, is a means of strengthening democracy.
I believe that the business contacts in this domain could point the way to more fruitful cooperation in the domain of dialogue and democracy.
Another point of particular importance to Europe, of course, is partnership in the domain of energy.
Security of energy supplies is the issue of the future.
