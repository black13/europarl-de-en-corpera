Mr President, over the past few weeks, three politicians from the Sam Rainsy party have been murdered.
Chea Vichea, a founder member of the party and president of the free trade unions, was shot on 22 January.
He is the latest victim in a long series of killings.
The absence of retribution for political assassinations is tantamount to an invitation to commit further atrocities.
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats utterly condemns these assassinations but also condemns the slowness of criminal investigations.
Cambodia needs vigorous political leadership.
Its leaders must enact reforms that put an end to the continual violations of human rights.
I also refer in this context to the country’s record on child prostitution and forced labour.
For some time now there has been an agreement between the Cambodian Government and the United Nations on the establishment of a war-crimes tribunal.
All that stands in the way of its creation is the ratification of the agreement by the Cambodian Parliament, and that must be done without delay.
We therefore call for a UN delegation to be sent to Cambodia.
We must help, and we want to help, so that a sustainable process of normalisation can take place.
