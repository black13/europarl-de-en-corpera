– Madam President, one reason why Afghanistan is a topic of crucial importance is the need to demonstrate that not only can terrorism with State links be defeated, but that peace can then be won too.
Things are not looking too good in Afghanistan at the moment.
It is rumoured that Taliban groups in the south are making mighty advances, one hears – as the Russian defence minister, Mr Ivanov, said in Munich last week – that the cultivation of drugs has increased nine times over since the war began, and we see how soldiers from Europe, who are supposed to be working for the country’s future security, are unable to take action against it.
It appears that they were watching over the drug routes along which the drugs find their way to Europe and to our children.
To my mind, this is a very problematic situation and is the reason why it is urgently necessary that we should make every effort to facilitate the establishment of the rule of law and of democracy under a strong and guaranteed central power that also takes account of ethnic differences and of diversity.
There will be no peace in Afghanistan for as long as – as has been the case – the provision of aid and the division of power are one-sided, with the Pashtoons losing out.
This, I believe, is something else that we have to stress.
The elections need to be properly prepared, so that it is clear who is entitled to vote and so that the elections may gain legitimacy, and the new constitution needs to be used in order for this balance of power to be achieved.
The new constitution brings with it both opportunities and problems, for it makes Sharia law possible.
While the courts still have judges as conservative as the present ones, nothing that comes out of them will be acceptable to us in terms of our view of what the rule of law means.
This, I believe, is why we must, over the coming weeks and months, devote much attention and a great deal of effort to looking after this country.
