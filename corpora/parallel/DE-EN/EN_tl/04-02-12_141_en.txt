Mr President, for eight months now, Greek and Filipino sailors have been held by the Pakistani authorities.
Their tanker ran aground outside the port of Karachi, causing the greatest environmental disaster in the history of Pakistan.
Thirty thousand tonnes of crude oil spilled into the sea, contaminating the coastline and destroying the livelihood of fishermen.
In the view of the Pakistani Government, the disaster was caused by incompetence and negligence on the part of the crew.
As Mr Hatzidakis and the previous speakers have pointed out, however, the tanker was incontestably under the command of a local pilot at the time of the accident.
There can therefore be no clear-cut apportionment of guilt.
The Pakistani Ambassador has informed me that judicial proceedings will shortly be instituted against the sailors.
Shortly?
According to media reports, they have been under house arrest since October 2003 and are not allowed to leave Pakistan.
Government sources have assured me that the sailors have unrestricted freedom of movement within the country.
That will have to be verified.
International law actually covers unresolved compensation issues.
In the domain of oil pollution there is an International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, to which 124 nations have now acceded.
I hope that Pakistan will soon do likewise.
On both humanitarian and legal grounds, the Group of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats appeals to the Pakistani Government to allow the crew members to return to their homes and families, subject to a pledge to return to Pakistan when the judicial proceedings take place.
Such pledges are made on word of honour and must be redeemed.
