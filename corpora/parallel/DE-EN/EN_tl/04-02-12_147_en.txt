Mr President, I believe it is paragraph 5 of the resolution which states that observation of the elections did not take place because of the refusal of the Iranian authorities.
That requires correction in so far as the request was also made by Parliament.
It should therefore be worded in slightly more neutral terms, in that ‘the authorities’ should be replaced by ‘the Iranian side’.
May I request that correction.
It is merely a matter of factual clarification.
