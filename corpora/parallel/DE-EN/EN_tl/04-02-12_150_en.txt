â€“ Mr President, I only wish to move amendments to recitals D and F. In D and again in paragraph 7, it should be political figures rather than opposition members, since three of the five assassination victims belonged to a governing party.
And then the date in recital F should be 7 January instead of 4 February.
These are technical rather than substantive amendments.
