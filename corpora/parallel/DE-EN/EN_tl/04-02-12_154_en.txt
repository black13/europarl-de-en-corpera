Mr President, this is also just a small technical amendment, but I do consider it important, because it is, after all, about people in custody.
The text refers to Greek and Filipino sailors, but the title refers only to Greek sailors.
I believe we agree that the Filipinos should be released too.
For this reason, I move that the title be amended accordingly.
