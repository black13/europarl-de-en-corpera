. – Madam President, as we all know, Afghanistan is a country with more problems than it has mountains and valleys.
It is home to over 30 different ethnic groups, among them Pashtoons, Hasara and Tajiks, who co-exist in an equilibrium that has developed over history, but is very unstable.
It is thus clear to us all that Afghanistan’s problems can be resolved only if proposed solutions and aid programmes are in harmony with Afghan culture and history.
As the rapporteur said, the situation of women in Afghanistan is particularly tragic.
The rate of maternal mortality is among the highest in the world; that is also the case for deaths of infants and children.
According to official estimates the incidence of illiteracy among Afghan women stands at 90%.
I believe that the position of women can be improved only if we involve the men.
Women cannot be helped without persuading their husbands, fathers, brothers and their clan chiefs as well.
If we want to help Afghan women, we have to respect their culture, and, in a country in which women have endured years of oppression, it is the men to whom it has to be explained that, if things are good for their wives and children, then they will be all right too and so society as a whole is better off.
As has been said, women and men must be accorded the same rights.
It is also important that we should build schools for girls – and for boys too – so that there can be some changes in the way they think.
Reference has been made to the Afghan constitution, which accords equal rights to women and men, and which prohibits discrimination of any kind.
As it gets involved, the European Union should continue to respect all this and allow its aid measures to benefit the population as a whole.
I wish to thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation on this issue and am behind both him and the Commission in their conviction that Afghanistan must continue to be a priority on our political agenda if the people who live there are to be helped.
