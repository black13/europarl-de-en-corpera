– Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention, and to that of this House, something I regard as a very sad situation in Slovakia, our neighbour and soon to be a Member State.
It would appear from television reports that the government has cut social security benefits for the Roma, which has prompted many women and mothers – and, appallingly enough, their children as well – to loot food shops in order to get food.
I do not in the least want it to be thought that I approve of violence in any form, but the Roma must be in a truly tragic predicament, and I would ask you, Mr President, to seek information and an explanation of this.
