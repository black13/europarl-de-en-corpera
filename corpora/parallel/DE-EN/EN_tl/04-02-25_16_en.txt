â€“ Mr President, I wish to bring to your attention a written statement by Mr Glyn Ford, a Member of this House, in which he urges the boycotting of the products of a company in the European Union.
I would also like this statement to be forwarded to the Council, the Commission and the Member States.
I would ask you to call upon the Legal Service to make a statement as to whether this is in any way permissible.
In Germany, my own country, it would be prohibited by law.
