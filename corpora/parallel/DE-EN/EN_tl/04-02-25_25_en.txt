Let me start with many thanks to Mr Garriga Polledo for his assurance of continued support for the Commission.
I think we really have to stress the fact that enlarging by adding ten new Member States is no trifling matter, and the public expect the European institutions to apply the law even-handedly from the word go.
Doing that also requires the necessary complement of personnel, not least, of course, where languages are involved, and we have to guarantee that those positions will be filled.
I will answer your last question as to what the 2005 Budget will be like by saying that we have of course not got as far as a draft Budget, but it is already plain that the Council has already decided on certain increases.
What this means is that there are more or less external factors that we have to take on board, and our consequent decisions have to respond to this reality.
I would see it as a very bad sign if, just before enlargement, we were to start questioning the decisions taken in Copenhagen.
Nobody wants to do that, and we will of course take that into account in the preliminary draft Budget.
I can assure the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, that the preliminary draft Budget for 2005 will be submitted in due time.
