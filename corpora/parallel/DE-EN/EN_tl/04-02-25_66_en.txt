– Mr President, I am almost tempted to start a debate with Mr Langen on moratoriums; I opposed moratoriums in biotechnology, and I would be against one in this case too.
I would prefer, though, to concentrate on research, for we need a policy on it if the European economy is to be competitive.
The astonishing thing is that this is an area about which we are all agreed, and yet, especially in the Member States, it has experienced cutbacks over recent years.
Most spectacularly of all, in France – for the first time in Europe – researchers are even taking to the streets, and their counterparts elsewhere are perfectly prepared to do likewise, so it is not just the farmers who are demonstrating; the researchers are obviously doing it too.
I see that as interesting, but also regrettable, for this makes it quite plain how the high-flown utterances of Heads of State or Government contrast with the austerity of their actions.
Now, along come the finance ministers and tell us that there is no money.
The question is, though, whether we cannot do any research because we have no money, or whether we have no money because we are not doing any research.
To take just one Member State as an example, Finland shows us very clearly how it is possible, even when times are hard, to succeed by investing in the future.
Today, Finland keeps on being hailed as the highest-achieving country in the European Union, and it has not even been a Member State for that long.
What this means is that Finland has done a great deal, even without the European Union.
So I would urge us in this House to keep on track in campaigning for the 3% expenditure on research and for the launching of an innovation strategy for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
I will conclude by urging Members to this House to be present at the Science Convention that we intend to organise in Brussels for early April, in order to make it clear that this strategy still enjoys support from this House, at least.
