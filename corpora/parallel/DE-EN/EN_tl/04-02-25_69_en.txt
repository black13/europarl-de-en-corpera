â€“ Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I sometimes get the feeling that there are those who have, very recently, been blowing the dust of history off the nineteenth-century theory according to which all you have to do is to unchain market forces,
and then, suddenly, masses of jobs will be created.
I see that as utterly false.
If we take a close look at where, over the past few decades, there have been the greatest increases in growth and employment, they have occurred precisely in those sectors that Mr Langen listed earlier, namely in sustainable development and in the protection of the environment.
I believe that it is also in these that investment has to be more vigorously encouraged, particularly as regards urban renewal, both in relation to its social and environmental components, and also transport.
Here too, it appears that it is in relation to the social and environmental components that there is the greatest potential for growth, and so it is here that there are, potentially, the greatest effects on employment.
As, I believe, an unregulated market cannot do other than result in adverse consequences for the environment, it naturally follows that investment in these areas would help to secure the ecological bases of our existence.
I believe that we have to be faithful to Lisbon and Gothenburg in our approach and in our seeking sustainable production methods in Europe, which will induce growth and employment, founded upon the ecological bases of our existence.
We have, in the past, come up with sound approaches to this, and we should continue on this road in a credible way.
Internationally, I believe, we will lose our credibility in many areas if we now proceed to dump our own objectives and what we agreed to in Johannesburg and Kyoto.
We have to hold fast to our own objectives and carry on down this road.
