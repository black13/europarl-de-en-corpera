â€“ Madam President, I wanted to warmly thank the rapporteur for his statement, which we in this House regard as a very good one, just as his criticisms are, in the final analysis, justified.
This is why I am glad to note the statement by a Member State to the effect that this Agency will not supplant the national authorities, but is meant to work alongside them, supporting them and evaluating their performance of the horizontal tasks.
It is quite explicitly not to have any legislative powers, and the Member States are to retain responsibility for guarding the external borders.
This being so, I really am very happy that this Agency is at present unable to take responsibility for carrying out any major implementing tasks, as there is absolutely nothing to be gained from setting up an agency with such precipitate speed and without proper cooperation.
We are right behind the rapporteur in making these critical observations.
