. – Mr President, we would like, if at all possible to get this report dealt with before the end of this Parliamentary term by using a first reading agreement, which would mean that we would have to hold the debate this week but defer the vote until April, in order to be able to negotiate agreement with the Council.
When it comes to the vote, there will be, at most, a very narrow majority.
It may be that the decision, be it favourable or unfavourable, will be taken by a very small number of votes, and then, in any case, at least 50% of MEPs – to be fairly precise about it – will be less than happy.
I would ask that we should debate the report tomorrow but defer the vote to April, by which time we will have been able to discuss matters with the Council.
Preparations have, in essence, been made for this, so we may yet be able to conclude a first reading agreement.
