â€“ Mr President, I do not believe there was any need for further deliberation.
There was in committee when we asked for an expert opinion, or rather, a cost-benefit analysis, on this report to be drawn up, something that you, Mr Kronberger, opposed.
Now that it has been produced, and makes perfectly clear in what direction policy must go, I cannot see any reason to hold over the vote rather than have it today or this week, quite simply because we already have far too many reports to deal with in the other Strasbourg sittings.
If Mr Kronberger joins us, he will be on the right side.
I do ask, though, that the vote should take place.
