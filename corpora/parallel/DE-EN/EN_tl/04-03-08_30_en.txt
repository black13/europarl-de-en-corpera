– Thank you Mr President.
We do not want to discuss the substance of the report; we have already had a debate about it in committee.
Although we did indeed get the expert opinion to which Mr Florenz referred, it did not back up his arguments but those of my group and also Mr Kronberger’s approach.
It makes sense to hold over the vote.
We are at the end of a parliamentary term and want, if possible, to come to an agreement at first reading, so that we will not have to start from the beginning again when the House reconvenes, going through first reading again and then debating the common position.
Having the vote itself at the next sitting will not take up much time, and so I ask you, Mr President, to put it to the vote.
This is what my group will be asking for and thereby supporting Mr Kronberger in having just the debate this week.
