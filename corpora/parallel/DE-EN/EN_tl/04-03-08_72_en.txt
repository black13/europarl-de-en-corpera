– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on women’s roles is an ideological one.
There are those who say that women are meant to go out to work in order to fulfil themselves, whilst others believe that they have been allotted the traditional role of wife and mother.
I see this as resorting to clichés.
The fact is that poverty has a female face.
Although there are many modern career women for whom emancipation has become the norm, and who are often described as freeloaders, it is also the case that the dual burden of family and career is mainly borne by women.
I believe that this ideological slant has not got us any further.
The chief end of any individual’s life – the highest goal that he or she can have – is to determine the course of their life freely and in their own way.
As I see it, free self-determination involves being able to decide for oneself and to choose between the options of job, job and family or homemaking.
Such choices demand framework conditions, and it is the task of policy to provide the best ones it can.
A certain amount has been done, but it is far from enough.
Childcare facilities with flexible opening times need to be set up; parental time out has to be capable of being shared.
Right across Europe, there are interesting models, such as the use of vouchers in payment for services, which the French have pioneered and which also creates jobs, or, to take another example, the introduction of child allowances in my own country of Austria, the thinking behind which is to try to make freedom of choice a reality for women.
