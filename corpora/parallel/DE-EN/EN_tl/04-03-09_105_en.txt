Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council intends to establish a border protection agency.
This House has developed an alternative model, but we all know that the Council will disregard it.
Above all, I would like to draw the attention of the members of the Committee on Budgets to the fact that this agency, in addition to the 27 staff working there, is also to be controlled by 27 members of the Management Board and also by an Executive Board consisting of five members.
The Commission and the Council really are creating a bureaucratic monster here!
I wish to ask the Committee on Budgets, before it approves the funding for this agency, to enter into a further in-depth discussion with the Council.
No matter how much we support progress in this field, we simply cannot work like this in Europe.
I hope the Committee on Budgets will back us on this.
