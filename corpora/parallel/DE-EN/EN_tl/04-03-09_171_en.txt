Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not vote for the amendments to the European Parliamentâ€™s Rules of Procedure on the financing of political parties; not because I am not in agreement with all this, but because it is the logical consequence of the fact that back in June last year my colleagues and I voted against the Leinen report.
Implementing the regulation in this way amounts to discrimination against the smaller party groupings in this House, which although they are active at European level nevertheless are not represented in any group.
Financial support is given to large party groupings but not to smaller ones, thus creating a huge gap in terms of democratic deficit between these two kinds of grouping.
We all know that parties and their organisations are dependent on financial contributions.
This creates an uneven playing field between the parties at European level, and I cannot vote for that.
