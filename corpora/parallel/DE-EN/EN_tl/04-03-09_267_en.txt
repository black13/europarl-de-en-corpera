– Mr President, Commissioner, I have three questions to put to you.
Firstly, I would like to know if the extension of the Tempus programme to Tempus Plus is a response to the question raised in Thessaloniki as to whether the educational programmes were being extended to the countries of the Balkans.
I would see that as not going far enough; I would like to see the whole of the Socrates programme extended, rather than just having Tempus as a new one.
Secondly, does the reduction of the Budget line not have the result that we, in this House and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have even less of a say as regards who gets subsidies?
What are the facts of the matter here?
Thirdly, are the programmes’ titles being lost?
Are the names ‘Erasmus’, ‘Socrates’, and ‘Comenius’ no more, or are they being retained somewhere?
It is not clear to me from the text.
Although I hope I will get an answer to this, I regret that I will not be here to hear it, as I have to go to a briefing before another meeting.
Please accept my apologies.
