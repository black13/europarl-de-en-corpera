– Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by thanking you for keeping to the timetable.
It is good to see the new programme already up and running, and I would like to put three short questions to you.
Since you want to increase and extend everything – Leonardo, for example, from 45 000 participants to 150 000, 10% primary schoolchildren rather than 1.5%, a leap from 2 000 to 50 000 in adult education, and more of the same besides – how much can we expect in the Budget?
We used to get 0.8%; if we want improved performance and higher quality, that will have to be paid for somehow.
Also, in what sort of stages is this objective to be achieved?
How is it proposed to achieve it by 2012 or 2010, and who will then bear the additional expenditure if – as I am given to understand – many countries are no longer prepared to contribute more than 1% to the European budget?
