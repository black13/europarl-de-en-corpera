– Thank you, Mr President, and congratulations to the Commissioner, who has conceived the educational programmes along very ambitious lines.
I hope that we, working together with the Commission, will be able to budget for them.
I would remind you that Erasmus aimed to include 10% of students in the programme.
Let us hope that we succeed in doing that.
Let me now turn to the new programme.
Our agenda simply describes this as a debate on the education and cultural programmes.
My fear is that young people will end up footing the bill if their concerns are thrown into a single package along with everything else.
We, I think, must ensure – and you, in your proposal, must specify – that the youth programmes must be properly funded, that the informal system of education will continue to be valued as it needs to be in the future, and will be able to be extended in order to prepare people for active citizenship.
If all these things – youth, culture, audiovisuals, media, and films – end up in a single package, my fear is that young people will end up paying the bill and losing out.
That must not be allowed to happen.
