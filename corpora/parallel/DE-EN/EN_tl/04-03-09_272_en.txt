There seems to be a fear that the various elements in the Socrates programme will be done away with.
I can tell Mrs Pack that the precise opposite is the case: the fact is that we will be extending the Tempus Plus programme to all types of schooling, that is to say, to schools, vocational training, adult education and universities.
She asked whether the names are being abandoned, to which the answer is both in the affirmative and the negative.
We now have an overall designation for the educational programmes, so that Socrates is no more, but Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo and Grundtvig will remain for schools, universities, vocational training and adult education respectively.
Mrs Prets asked me about the position as regards the Budget.
It is simple: when there is nothing left to be shared out, we will get nothing.
The Commission takes a different view; what it would like is for something to be left to be shared out, and that is why it has no sympathy with those countries that want to pay just 1%.
We need more if we are to be able to invest in the , in the citizens, in our young people, and the fact that the Commission’s budget for the future is an enlarged one means that it has made more funds available for education and for citizenship.
I have quite deliberately sought not to get involved in this debate, believing as I do that it is very important – including in political terms – to clarify what we want for Europe, where we want to take it, and what we need in order to achieve that end.
Only when we have done that should we look to see how much money we need in order to make that a reality.
Tackling this from the other end is the wrong way to go about it.
