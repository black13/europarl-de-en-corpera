Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will give a very direct answer to that question.
The Commission is prepared to conduct an in-depth investigation of the alleged abuse of a dominant position in the European Unionâ€™s fish production as and when evidence of such abuse is produced.
As long ago as 1992, we ruled to prohibit a price cartel operated by Norwegian, Scottish and Irish salmon breeders.
We are liasing on a regular basis with the Norwegian authorities as regards observation of the markets referred to in the question.
As I have said, I am prepared to examine the available information in depth and, if need be, to set in motion other investigations into this matter.
