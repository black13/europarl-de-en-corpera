Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify something here.
There is indeed a difference between agriculture and fisheries in this respect.
The fact is that I am also responsible for the international side of agricultural matters.
As well as that, I am authorised to conduct negotiations relating to the agriculture sector, in the WTO for example.
There is a different situation in fisheries, where my fellow-Commissioner Mr Lamy has responsibility for the international dimension.
I am quite happy, though, to take up your suggestion and, the next time we have one of our bilateral and trilateral meetings – as I can assure you we do – we will certainly see to it that the information will be made available at an appropriately early stage to all those who may have some responsibility for this.
