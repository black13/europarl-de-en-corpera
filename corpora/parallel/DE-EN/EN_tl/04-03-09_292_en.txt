Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 December 2003, the European Council gave the go-ahead for the establishment of a Community Fisheries Control Agency, on which, at the end of this month, the Commission will submit a proposal in which we will define this new authorityâ€™s tasks.
The most important of these will be the coordination of the joint deployment of the control services in the Member States.
The checks are to be carried out by, among others, multinational teams, with the inspection strategies to be used, such as benchmarking and common priorities, laid down by the Commission.
We will also be involving experts from the Member States in the setting-up of the agency and consulting the various interest groups.
We expect a study to be produced in September on the operational aspects of this agency, and its results will be discussed by the Council when making its decision.
On the occasion of my most recent visit to Vigo, the Galician fisheries sector suggested potential sites for this agency; I will of course examine these suggestions in detail, and they will also be considered in the studies to which I have referred.
Provided that the Council accepts our proposal, it will then be possible to appoint the board of management and the executive director, and then this enterprise will be, in a sense, up and running.
