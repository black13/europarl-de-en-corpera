Mr President, I have to be quite frank in saying that I do not share Mrs Izquierdo Rojoâ€™s view that Spain has been penalised, as there was a reform in 1998, in which absolute upper limits were agreed on, including by Spain.
It cannot therefore be said after the event that Spain was penalised.
Further to that, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I also have to tell you that what you seek will ultimately add up to over a hundred million euros, no more and no less, being spent additionally on support for the Spanish sector to the exclusion of all others.
The problem here is that I cannot, at one and the same time, do as I am required to do and keep this neutral in its effects on the budget while also acceding to your demand and getting another hundred million euros from somewhere.
The fact is that they simply are not there.
