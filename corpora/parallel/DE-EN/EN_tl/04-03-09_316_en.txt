Mr President, Mrs Schierhuber asked when the proposals may be expected.
We have said all along that we intend to present them before the summer and that is still our intention.
The only thing that could create problems is something I have not previously mentioned, namely that the EU is facing a panel in Geneva over the so-called C-quotas issue, and we need to know what can be expected from it.
It follows that another factor we have to take into account is the timetable of the authorities in Geneva.
Turning to Mrs Schierhuberâ€™s other question, Europe is of course an attractive market and it follows that many states would be happy to export to it, but our view is that we need to have clear priorities in this area, and what these boil down to is that only the least developed states should have free access to the European market.
As you will be aware, we have also devised special rules for the Balkan states.
The ACP states are to have limited priority access with a clear preferential tariff, as will the other countries in so far as we have treaties with them.
If we were to allow everyone to export sugar to Europe, we would not need an organised sugar market, but its wholesale liberalisation, which would, however, mean that at least two-thirds of European sugar production would have to be abandoned.
