Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mrs Fourtou for her openness, which was exemplary.
Right from the start all the shadow rapporteurs were involved in the discussions and also in the trialogue.
That is something I have rarely experienced in this House.
And she did that long before her family circumstances were seized upon by the press.
I do not wish to comment on that now, I shall leave that to my colleague.
So much for the form.
There are problems, however, as has already been mentioned, particularly by the previous speaker.
That this directive is needed is something on which everyone – including Members of this House – agrees.
So do the players in the market, ranging from the telecommunications industry to consumer protection organisations, from the pharmaceutical industry to generic drug manufacturers, from artists to content producers.
We need a good directive.
I believe, though, that the compromise that we have negotiated has not entirely succeeded in addressing these many and diverse needs and concerns in a single directive.
There are two specific policy areas where reasonable agreement is important.
One is that we wish to limit the scope of the directive somewhat, to use for commercial purposes; the other area is that of patents.
There is certainly scope for debate about patents and also about common practice in Europe.
But it remains a fact that we do not have a European-level patent, and we do not want to use the implementing directive to pave the way for one through the back door.
This needs to be discussed very carefully; it is not such a simple matter.
I therefore urge you to give a large measure of support to these two amendments on patents and the scope of the directive.
I believe that this directive, this compromise, will then have been sufficiently improved for us to jointly adopt it as a compromise before the end of this parliamentary term.
