Mr President, we are voting on the Paulsen report today.
It was only this morning that the amendments to this report became available in all languages.
I regard this as a very important report and there are a great many amendments.
I am not in a position to adopt a clear position on this report today, and I therefore request that the vote should be postponed until tomorrow.
