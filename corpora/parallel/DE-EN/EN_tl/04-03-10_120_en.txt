Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for his constructive and very close cooperation over the years.
The Czech Republic’s successes over the last few years are beyond dispute.
There are still deficits in some areas, however, on standards in food-processing establishments, for example.
Our consumers need have no fear, however; nothing that fails to meet our standards will be allowed in the EU internal market.
Another problem that has increasingly been brought to my attention recently is the suspected trafficking in human beings and in particular children at the German-Czech border.
The Czech Government should be encouraging victim support programmes here.
There is also a need for training programmes for the police and border guards to increase awareness of the issue of people trafficking and there should be greater cross-border cooperation on the basis of INTERREG.
So far as the plans for barrages on the upper reaches of the Elbe are concerned, I have managed to persuade the EU Commission that an environmental impact assessment for this project is absolutely essential and that intermodal alternatives must be worked out.
I live in the Elbe valley in Saxony, which was flooded in summer 2002, and I know what I am talking about.
Finally, I want to talk about the Czech parliament’s intention of honouring the former Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš.
When we have spent years dealing with the matter of the Beneš decrees here in Parliament and I found a compromise formula that was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the plenum in April last year, I find it insensitive and provocative of the Czechs now, just before the country is to join the EU, to be passing a law that not only evokes the past but actually honours it.
I do not want anyone who supports this law joining my Group in the future.
