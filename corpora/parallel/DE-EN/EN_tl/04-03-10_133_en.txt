. – Mr President, although I can do no other than underline what Mrs Smet has said, the great progress made in the new Member States must not blind us to the continuing problems they have in the social sphere, or to their mounting difficulties with employment.
Economic adjustments, combined with processes of industrial restructuring under which mainly workers have suffered, is making for ever-greater problems in the new Member States’ labour markets.
Now, when they are on the threshold of accession, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the overall goals and ambitions of a Social Europe will remain and cannot be lowered.
The successful implementation of the Lisbon strategy in an enlarged Europe is dependent on social standards and on social legislation, both of which are means to that end.
Going beyond that, the Social Affairs Committee urges the new Member States, in their political agendas, to give more attention to human capital.
In a European Union of 25 states, there is no place for retrograde developments or social inertia, which would pave the way for new conflict.
Generally speaking, and by way of conclusion, let me say that the tendency to treat both social affairs and employment matters as ‘soft law’ is a problem in terms of the overall future development of the European Union.
