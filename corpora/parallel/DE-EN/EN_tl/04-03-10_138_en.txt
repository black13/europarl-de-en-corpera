. – Mr President, it is clear that International Women’s Day has already been forgotten, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is, of course, the last to speak.
In this capacity, though, I do think that we should not be any less strict with the accession countries than we are with ourselves in matters relating to the complete transposition of the European Union’s Community acquis in the field of gender equality.
Rather than focusing on what is missing,then, we should show appreciation for the progress and the reforms that a country such as Bulgaria has managed to make, under difficult conditions, since its liberation from Communist dictatorship.
After all, many countries that have been Member States for years are still having problems with properly transposing the directives on equal rights and opportunities for women and men, something that is, let me add, apparent from the Commission’s latest report on the Lisbon strategy for the Spring Summit.
At this stage, then, in my humble opinion, we should be wary of delivering too many homilies to countries such as Bulgaria.
Instead, we should be doing everything possible to help it, and countries like it, and to encourage it and them to proceed further along the right path, on which they have encountered these difficulties, so that – as we hope – this wonderful European country can accede to our European Union in 2007.
The same applies to child protection, where there is certainly still much to be done.
