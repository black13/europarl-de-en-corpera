â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the trans-European networks, which has been mentioned in this debate, has no future.
It does not appear to be underpinned by any real and sustainable concept of mobility for the whole of Europe; on the contrary, it is no more than yet another mixed bag of national interests.
The proposals that have been tabled are the ones that it was thought would gain acceptance.
These projects do not appear to have been analysed in terms of their benefits and optimum costs, and, in many respects, they contravene European environmental law.
One of the things that make this clear is that projects given priority status are in breach of the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive.
Among them, let me mention only the Kresna Gorge and the bridge over the Straits of Messina.
The concept of trans-European networks must be able to stand up to a strategic environmental assessment if the projects are to receive European funding.
Only projects that pass this test can be supported.
European funds must be invested in a sustainable way; they must also be capable of opening up ways ahead, enabling our children to enjoy mobility in the future.
The projects we are planning are long-term ones.
We firmly reject these misconceived plans, especially those to which I have referred.
