– Mr President, obliged though I am for that exhaustive answer, my question had to do with the EU’s present borders with the candidate countries, with their future eastern borders with the states of the CIS, and more specifically with the programmes that are meant to keep in check the prostitution that is prevalent there.
What is currently going on in the area where the Czech Republic borders on Bavaria is this: most of the victims and many of the culprits are from further to the east, that is, from Russia and Romania, states that are not yet due to join us.
The scene of the crime is generally in the Czech Republic, which is an accession country, and the customers, those who spend the money, are, lamentably enough, mainly from the present EU – from Germany, in fact, so this is a cross-border problem.
What I am specifically interested in is what is being done in the border regions to sort out the great deal of prostitution that is going on there.
