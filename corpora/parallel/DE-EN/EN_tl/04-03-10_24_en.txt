Mr President, whereas peace, democracy, freedom and social justice should be the cornerstones of the European edifice, what does the Council believe in?
What does the Commission stand for?
What have we achieved here in Parliament?
Not very much; we still have peace â€“ if we disregard the latest outbreaks of civil war.
We have made little progress on democracy.
I believe there is a huge problem with the legitimacy of this Union, and what has happened in recent months seems symptomatic of further disintegration processes rather than of integration.
This is dangerous, but I need hardly say that it is also dangerous for us to hide behind the illusion that we in Parliament are the free voices in the institutional structure.
We should know better, for we saw, when Nice was being discussed, how the party leaders coaxed and cajoled the supposedly free Members of Parliament.
Here in the House we also suffer time and again from the way in which Stalinist instincts in the Socialist Group, which frequently takes the unwarranted liberty of calling itself Social Democratic, lead to repeated logjams.
This will have to change, not only here in Parliament but elsewhere too, and particularly in the Council.
There can be no democracy without transparency.
