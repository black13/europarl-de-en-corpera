Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current situation, following the failure of the summit in Brussels, is rather laughable.
In the constitutional debate, France and Germany hold forth about the need to move Europe forward, but they are the very ones who have persistently ignored the common ground rules.
The effects of such behaviour are, in my opinion, fatal.
When Jacques Chirac speaks of an advance guard and outlines the notion of a two-speed Europe, that in itself is not the end of the world.
The Schengen Agreement and the euro have already established the principle of differing speeds.
The real tragedy is that friction has been generated.
This will not help Europe to move forward.
The prospects for the draft Constitutional Treaty have not become any brighter.
The negotiations on the EU budget may well pose the threat of some sort of linkage between the constitution and the financial framework.
I can only recommend vigilance.
The substance of the draft Constitutional Treaty is a mixture of good ideas that would bring progress and, alas, questionable features such as pre-programmed conflicts of authority, which are destined to occur, for example, in the field of foreign policy between the future EU Foreign Minister and the President of the Council.
It is high time that the EU prepared itself for a larger Community.
It smacks of absolutism, in my view, to proscribe the discussion of constitutional matters by the Heads of State or Government.
I refuse to treat these Heads of Government as if they were the insurgent rebels of Europe.
At the same time, these leaders must not be allowed to forget that they sent representatives to the Convention.
I appeal for political pragmatism; what has been achieved must be safeguarded.
