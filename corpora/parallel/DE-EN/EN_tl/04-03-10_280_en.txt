– Mr President, we will have to be very careful, when voting on the report on the Internal Market Strategy, not to turn Mr Miller’s work, which is in fact outstanding, on its head, so that this House ends up, after only a few weeks, overturning the decision it took in January on public services of general interest.
Let me clarify what I mean by reference to our water.
In January, we expressed our opposition to the unrestrained privatisation of basic services such as water and sewerage, as well as health services and education.
We set down in writing our recognition that decisions on these things have to be taken, if at all possible, close to the citizen in towns and communities.
Services of general interest are the business of the people who use them; they are not to be the plaything of an unrestricted market.
That is the point that Mr Miller reiterated in his report on the Internal Market Strategy, using persuasive examples to warn of the dangers that ensue if, for example, we make our precious water nothing more than an ordinary item of merchandise.
It was apparent from the deliberations in the committee, though, that there are powerful conservative and liberal elements who believe that there are more, and quicker, profits to be made out of the public services.
This is meant to be Mr Miller’s report; we must make sure that it really is by, in the plenary, stopping them in their tracks.
The amendments needed to make good the fudge for which the committee is responsible have been tabled.
I ask you all to help ensure that our towns and communities are not stabbed in the back, which is what this unholy alliance between conservatives and liberals wants to happen.
