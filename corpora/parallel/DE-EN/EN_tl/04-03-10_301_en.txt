– Mr President, I think Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and my colleague Mrs McNally have both done a very good job of explaining their divergent positions.
Whenever there is a situation of problematic political conflict – and it goes without saying that Israel is one – this House finds it difficult to come to a decision.
I do believe, though, that it is a good thing to clarify what is involved, what we want to achieve, and what message this House is sending out by endorsing the position taken by the Commission and the Council.
This has to do with the continuation of cooperation and dialogue that are already going on in scientific and technological circles, and that benefit both sides.
Contrary to what has been said by some Members, this is not just about the eventual benefit to Israel; we too will benefit.
Not only will this benefit scientists, university departments and research institutes; humanity itself will benefit from cooperation and exchange between scientists, in which politicians too will have their part to play, and, as a fellow Member pointed out, society as a whole will benefit.
We are investing in a future in which – or so we hope – Europe will be able to do its bit in resolving a situation that is, in political and human terms, extremely difficult.
So I am both proud and glad that Mrs McNally, as my group’s coordinator, has, in the group’s discussions, always emphasised that we would endorse this report.
On just one small point, I would like to point out to the Members in the Group of the Greens, who have difficulties with the ‘dual use’aspect that the European Union does not support any military research, nor does our research programme cover it, so any cooperation in that area is automatically ruled out.
