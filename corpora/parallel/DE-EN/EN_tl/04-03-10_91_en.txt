Mr President, I am very pleased that today we have managed to vote on the new rules for the organisation of the market in tobacco.
The proposal that Parliament has made with partial decoupling is the right road because the decisions of the 2003 Luxembourg Council provided for partial decoupling for all market organisations.
As Mr Maaten said, far more than 400 000 jobs are affected.
I would like to make one more thing quite clear here.
If anyone thinks that everyone would stop smoking if no more tobacco were grown in Europe, he is dreaming.
Tobacco would then be imported and we would only damage the European economy, in other words, farmers and workers.
