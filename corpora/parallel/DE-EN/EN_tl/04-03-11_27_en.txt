– Mr President, much is being said about how older people will, in future, have to work for longer and about their special significance in terms of the economy, but far too little about how, with advancing years, they need more help and more social and health care.
The way in which we respond to older people’s needs and fears is also a cultural issue.
In care homes, human dignity and the right to personal freedom are of the utmost importance.
There is a desire to live and to strive to live innate in every person, and this mental elemental force must be cultivated.
It is, above all, strength of will that makes life significantly easier for old people themselves and also for those who care for them.
That is why it is so important that training in all health care professions – from carer to physician – should be developed.
Psychological knowledge, empathy and sensitivity are even more difficult to acquire, understand and develop than professional expertise and practical skills.
It is not only training, though, that must take greater account of increased life expectancy.
Research, too, must commit itself more to gerontology and to the support of programmes in palliative medical care and develop its own Europe-wide networks.
More research, and hence greater safety, is needed to better underpin preventive measures.
Only if there is interaction between these two will we have a guarantee of being able to keep an eye on costs in health care.
In presenting us with the issues and problems of ageing, this own-initiative report highlights one of the major social issues for Europe and calls us to ongoing work on health policy.
I would like to express the very high regard I have for the rapporteur and for her work.
