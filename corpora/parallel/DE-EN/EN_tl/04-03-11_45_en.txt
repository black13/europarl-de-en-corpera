â€“ Mr President, the only thing I wanted to say in response to that is that the Conference of Presidents, which met this morning, is already discussing this topic and that there is to be an official statement by Parliament.
We have to put a stop to the way in which rumours are constantly undermining the hard work done in this House.
Let us have the names out in the open.
If we have the names, we must also take action against the persons concerned.
