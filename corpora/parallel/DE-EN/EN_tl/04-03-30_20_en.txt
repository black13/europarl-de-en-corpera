– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, who has negotiated tenaciously for many years.
I believe that with the results before us today we have taken a step towards greater food safety in Europe.
It is also important, when food comes over the border, that we should be able to tell the citizens they can rely on that food being safe and that there are no health risks.
We have, however, also managed – at any rate better than in the Commission’s original proposal – to make the proposals practicable.
I would like to draw attention to one particular point in the first Schnellhardt report on general food hygiene.
The HACCP plan is a very good plan for large businesses.
Large businesses that employ a large number of people, possibly in several Member States, have to keep accurate records of who has handled a product when.
From the outset, I found it difficult to transfer this concept to very small businesses, because if a restaurant or confectioner’s employs only two or three people, we do not need any written documentation to know who has handled the product and where harm may have occurred.
In such cases, verbal information is enough and that is why, in the negotiations, we pressed very hard for the documentation requirement for small businesses to be toned down in line with the risk associated with this type of production.
We do not think documentation is necessary at all for very small businesses.
It would be practicable then.
It would not be detrimental to consumer protection, but we would ensure that small businesses in particular are able to apply the rules appropriately.
The outcome is not exactly what we would have wanted.
We have, however, reached compromises on many points, especially in the first report, and we are therefore able to back the reports with a clear conscience.
