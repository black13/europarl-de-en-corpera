â€“ Mr President, the latest events in Kosovo show once again how fragile the peace in the Balkans is, and we must ask ourselves what the reasons are for that.
Let us remind ourselves.
Almost exactly five years ago, NATO began bombing Yugoslavia without declaring war.
Although all the parties to the Helsinki Final Act had committed themselves to recognising the territorial status quo in Europe, the country was systematically dismembered by internal and external forces along ethnic lines; the Federal Republic of Germany led the way with its early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia.
The rapid disintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia did not bring an end to the conflicts, but gave rise to new tensions, which are now again exploding in bloody clashes in Kosovo.
What was proclaimed five years ago as the remedy for ethnic cleansing has proved to be the opposite.
Thousands of Serbian families have been driven out of a province that is still legally part of Serbia, mainly by paramilitary forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK), once classed by the US as a terrorist organisation.
It also sounds very strange when Mr Solana, our High Representative, tells the remaining Serbs that they should be brave and have the courage to overcome these difficulties.
Crimes are being committed, and they must be treated as such.
The EU must have the courage to speak out more resolutely for a long-term, complex political solution for Kosovo and for the whole of the Balkans.
