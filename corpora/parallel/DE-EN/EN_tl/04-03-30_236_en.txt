. – Although we are without doubt enriched by the food from the widest possible range of countries that is to be found on the shelves of our supermarkets, consumers want to have confidence that products are safe and of high quality, and we have to create the conditions under which they can.
As rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome the revision of Framework Directive 89/109/EEC, and thank Mrs Thors for her good cooperation.
The Group of the European People’s Party has called for a number of crucial amendments in order to make packaging, and thus also food, safer in future.
Much as the proposal for a labelling system using the legend ‘suitable for food contact’ or the symbol of a stylised glass and fork is to be welcomed, we demand that an exception be made for items that it cannot be doubted are intended for contact with food (for example, cups, glasses, etc), thereby avoiding excessive bureaucracy.
We also welcome the extension of the traceability principle to the materials used, although this must not result in over-regulation; it would, for example, be nonsensical for every item of paper packaging to have to indicate the origin of every tree.
As these are always mixtures, this is not technically feasible.
Provided that the plenary agrees to these demands, the Group of the European People’s Party endorses the compromise negotiated with the Council.
