– The many opinions and different arguments show what a sensitive subject this is and what a sense of responsibility we need to show here.
We are talking about transports of living creatures with which people work and in which they trade and which, in the end, are also eaten.
Everyone who is not a vegetarian must acknowledge that.
The question is: how do we treat those animals?
The question is also: why do animals have to be transported so far?
Is it necessary for animals to be transported across half of Europe to be slaughtered?
No, it is not.
That is why this report clearly calls for slaughter animals to be slaughtered within a 500 km radius.
I believe we must insist on their being able to be slaughtered within that radius.
It must be no excuse to say there are not enough slaughterhouses; we must ensure that there are.
That will stimulate the region’s economy and be of particular help to the animals.
That is one of the most important points and also one of the trickiest: how far should animals be transported?
Animals for fattening are counted as animals for slaughter, but I believe we should nevertheless make a distinction here.
Animals for fattening should not be lumped together with slaughter animals, but they should be taken to a farm within the same short distance.
Another important point that seems to have been overlooked is that controls are carried out.
There is a directive; there used to be one.
If anything went wrong, it was because the system was not working.
It was the failure to implement the directive properly in the Member States and the inefficient control system that caused and still causes animals to suffer.
I believe that needs to be said.
The best rules and the best directive are useless if there are no controls and they are not enforced.
In the end, that is the decisive factor and that is what will benefit the animals.
