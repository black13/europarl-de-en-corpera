– Mr President, first a brief word on a point of order.
The vote has been brought forward to today, but Members have not been made aware of it.
I think it is a little undemocratic that it is not possible to hold single separate votes or to ask for roll-call votes.
The public will be very surprised and will say yet again how undemocratic this European Union is.
I want to thank Mrs Schierhuber.
She has made a clear distinction between humans and animals and I, too, would like to reject the disgusting comparison with the Holocaust.
I would like to say something to Mr Adam.
It is not correct to say that anyone who eats meat is a torturer of animals.
You see, in Austria we have a national dish, , and if you come to Austria I can tell you precisely where the meat for it comes from, from the forest area of Lower Austria or from Styria.
In most cases, that is only two or three hours away.
In Austria, animals are allowed to be transported only for six hours.
It is not necessary to torture animals if you want to eat them later.
That is a change of thinking, and thinking is of course painful.
You see, Christian Democrats naturally have a perhaps rather different relationship with animals.
For me, animals are God’s creatures and capable of suffering.
I do not know whether you have saints, Mr Adam.
My favourite saint is Francis of Assisi, and he did not only love people, he loved animals as well.
