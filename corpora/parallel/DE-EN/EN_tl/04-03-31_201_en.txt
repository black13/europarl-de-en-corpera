– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hypocrisy of the talk about fundamental rights in this House can hardly be surpassed, especially when it comes from the Right.
When the Council and governments initiate more and more new surveillance programmes, plunging thousands of migrants into sheer despair with their Fortress Europe policy, leaving them stuck at borders, allowing them to drown at sea, and the few that make it are then interned in the EU only to be removed again as soon as possible, the European Parliament, which claims to be the guardian of fundamental and human rights, actually applauds.
Unfortunately, the reality looks rather different to all those who are deprived of their most elementary civil rights.
State, police and racist violence are everyday occurrences in the European Union’s capitalist society.
The blatant justification of torture in Germany by numerous politicians and representatives of the judiciary and police in 2003 is a specific example of this.
Unfortunately, when my draft resolution condemning this justification of torture was rejected in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this was brought about by those groups that are now defending their political friends.
