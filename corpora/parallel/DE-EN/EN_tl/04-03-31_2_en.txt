â€“ Mr President, on the way from the Chamber to a meeting of my group yesterday, I was pushed into a corner by a camera team, prevented from continuing on my way, and hurt my back in the process.
I would ask you, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that Members can go about their business in this House without interference from representatives of the media.
