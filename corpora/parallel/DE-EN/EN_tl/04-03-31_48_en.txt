– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only did the attack in Madrid kill many people, but it also undermined the sovereignty of a European state.
The fact is that, twist it how you will, the terrorists obviously succeeded in influencing the sovereign decision of the Spanish electorate.
Not least as a result, terrorists have intervened in Europe.
I wonder whether Europeans have recognised the nature of this threat appropriately and are prepared to meet it.
The reaction so far has been relatively weak.
We have resurrected programmes that we have had ever since September 11, 2001, yet which have been only inadequately implemented.
Recourse has been had to visionary ideas, such as setting up a European Secret Service, which could perhaps be considered in the distant future, but certainly does not address the real threat.
Calls have been made for someone to be appointed to deal with this – pretty much the standard response to a European problem – and someone actually has been; Mr de Vries is a highly-esteemed man and a former Member of this House.
What is important is not that he has been chosen, but rather the question of what powers he is to have.
To this question, few answers have been given.
The need of the moment would appear to be prevention, for which purpose the data available in Europe, for example on terrorists, should be gathered together.
Although the national services possess a great deal of information, there is little willingness to share it at the European level.
If Europe collaborates more closely and reliably in this area than it has so far done, it will now have an opportunity to defend itself against the terrorists in the long term and with impressive impact.
