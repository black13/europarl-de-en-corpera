– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to draw your attention to the matters described by Mr Schulz and to endorse his request for the allegations to be examined immediately and the public and ourselves to be informed.
Between 50 and 60 German MEPs have been maliciously accused of having wrongly drawn their daily allowance, allegations that I emphatically reject!
The daily allowance is not remuneration for participation in the sessions.
In addition to participating in the sessions, we all have innumerable other tasks to perform, which are not entered in any session schedule, and in order to be present for such works in Brussels or in Strasbourg daily allowances are needed to meet expenses.
Accordingly, we cannot accept being defamed in this way.
I once again emphatically reject the allegations.
A Member of this House is exploiting his parliamentary rights in order to spy on colleagues in the most unworthy and disgusting way.
For this reason also, Mr President, I demand that these events be investigated immediately and that – as I have said – the public and we ourselves should be informed.
