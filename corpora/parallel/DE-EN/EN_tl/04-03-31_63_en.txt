– Mr President, for three weeks, this House has been haunted by the anonymous allegation that Members have been forging signatures in the attendance lists.
Since yesterday evening, the ‘rumour mill’ in this House has been saying that the administration has completed its investigations with the assistance of graphologists and concluded that there are no forgeries.
I think that it is unacceptable that today, Wednesday, these investigations having been concluded, this information is not being publicly announced here in the plenary session and to the press.
What I expect of the President of this House – not you yourself, but rather the President in his capacity as such – is that the results of these investigations should be publicly made known before today is out.
