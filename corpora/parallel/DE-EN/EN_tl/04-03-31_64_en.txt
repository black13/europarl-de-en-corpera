â€“ Mr President, I would like to endorse the comments made by the previous speakers.
What is currently going on is a campaign against the European Parliament as such, one that I believe we must repudiate.
It follows that we must clarify matters completely as soon as possible, because I am afraid that it will have as its consequence very low turnout at the next elections.
If we want to regain public confidence, we need an explanation.
We urge all the institutions to play their part to wrap up this matter as quickly as possible and finally to put an end to this campaign.
