â€“ Mr President, I would like to unreservedly endorse what was said by the previous speakers.
Yesterday, in this House, we held a press conference in which all the political groups took part.
We wrote a joint open letter to a specific newspaper in Germany and set out our view of the allegations.
Only if each specific allegation is specifically refuted will we all jointly be able to restore the popular and public confidence in this House; what is at stake is the standing of every single one of its Members, the standing and integrity of the European Parliament itself.
I therefore ask that each allegation should indeed be examined specifically, as Mr Schulz has proposed.
