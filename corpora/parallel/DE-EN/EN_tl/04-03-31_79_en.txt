. – Mr President, I refer to Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
This report on ‘the new policy for the neighbouring states’ involves reorganising the lending facilities of the European Investment Bank.
In consultation with the majority of the coordinators, I would like to request that the plenary should vote on the individual amendments, but should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution, so that we again have an opportunity to negotiate with the Commission and the Council on our amendments and so that the views of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy can also be taken into account, to the effect that the negotiations should impose new priorities in connection with Russia and the new Independent States.
