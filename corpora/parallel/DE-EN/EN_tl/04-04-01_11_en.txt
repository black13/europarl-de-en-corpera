. – Mr President, quite apart from all the general political issues that we in this House have to consider in relation to Turkey, economic feasibility and the compatibility of its society with the European Union are of course not negligible considerations.
There has indeed been great progress in legislative terms, including in the areas of labour law, equality, health care and other important social protection systems, but I have to say that there are developments in quite the opposite direction that stand in an unfortunate contrast to this.
Lamentably, nothing good can come of the increase in unemployment, the sharp increase in poverty, particularly in rural areas, the increasing tendency of firms to circumvent rules on health and safety at work by illegally employing short-term workers, the failure to combat the use of child labour, and other things besides.
Labour law also lacks rules outlawing discrimination, with the consequence that legal action cannot be taken in respect of such things as the violation of the right to respect for human dignity.
That can be sorted out, but there is still a need for great effort in order to do so.
Pressure of time will not get these issues dealt with more quickly.
With these reasons in mind, and nonetheless wanting to smooth the path towards the approval of Turkey’s accession to the EU, I think that, from a democratic point of view, there is no getting away from the need for the EU of 25 to consider this issue again and for Parliament to give its prior consent before negotiations with Turkey on that country’s accession are embarked on.
