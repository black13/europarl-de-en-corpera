Mr President, even though, in my opinion, considerable elements are missing from this resolution, it is largely balanced, and so I voted in favour of it.
First of all, I believe that no solution to the Kosovo problem can be found without first making clear decisions as to the future of Kosovo.
If we do not define the status that we want to give it, then the standards cannot be achieved.
To this end, I believe that the route taken to date is wrong.
Secondly, I think that the United Nations Transitional Administration has discredited itself so much that it should be replaced there by a European civilian administration, which could be better controlled and which would – if it avoids the mistakes that UNMIK (United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ) made – enjoy more respect.
The third and final point that I wanted to raise is that it is being said that Kosovo-Albanian leaders were insufficiently unequivocal in condemning the riots, but they did do so, and emphatically.
President Rugova declared a day of national mourning for both nationalities, whilst the Serbian Prime Ministermarched at the head of a demonstration in Belgrade where there were calls to ‘kill the Albanians!’
