Mr President, I voted against the Oostlander report even though it includes many good ideas.
I would, however, like to clearly associate myself with the line taken by my colleague Mr Bourlanges.
We want a strong Turkey as a good partner, but we also want a stable European Union that is capable of action.
Those who turn Turkey into a full Member State of the European Union, destabilise the European Union.
Those, however, who only lead Turkey to believe that they really have a chance of being a candidate, are ultimately destabilising Turkey because they are, so to speak, luring the Turks in with unattainable promises and then letting them down by imposing ever tighter criteria.
This is a game I am not prepared to play.
I am in favour of an honest policy on Turkey, which says that there are limits to everything, even to a Europe that can be integrated.
Turkey must be our closest partner and as far as Byzantium is concerned, you can say that Saint Augustine came from today’s Algeria, and he was one of the fathers of the West, but even so, I would not incorporate the current Algeria or the future Algeria – even a democratic Algeria – into the European Union.
The European Union is not the amalgamation of all democratic countries in the world that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, but rather all European States that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and wish to join.
