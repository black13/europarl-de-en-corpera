– Mr President, I will be very brief, but this is important.
Firstly, I wish to protest against the dropping of today’s debates on matters of topical and urgent importance, Tuesday’s question times and the debate on the cultural capital of Europe, even though enough time was available for them.
Secondly, I wish to make a personal statement on behalf of what has been called the Friday Club.
I am grateful to the Members who are present for doing their duty right into the evening.
They used to do it right through to Friday lunchtime, until that was no longer possible.
It is monstrous that there should be someone in this House who is attempting to make criminals of these Members, of all people, who are performing their duties in an exemplary manner.
I will be working here this evening on behalf of those whom I represent, and will be doing so until tomorrow lunchtime.
That I affirm; I believe it to be our duty.
I rejoice to see all those here who are doing their duty rather than going about defaming and discrediting this House.
