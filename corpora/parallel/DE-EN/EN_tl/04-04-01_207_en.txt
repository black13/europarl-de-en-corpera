– Mr President, if you had had to be driven around this week by the so-called car service, I am sure you too would be boiling over with rage.
What goes on in the depths of this House, particularly in the evenings, is a scandal.
A group of us had to wait, in gusts of wind, up to 40 minutes for a car from the so-called car service.
I am not blaming the drivers, who do a quite outstanding job of work, but responsibility for this must surely rest with some official or other, some manager in the administration, who took 17 cars out of service for this week.
For how much longer are we MEPs supposed to put up with this intolerable humiliation by officials of this House?
I ask you to ensure that the service is organised on more MEP-friendly lines without delay.
If you want an example of a good car service, then let me, as a German Member, advise you to look to Berlin, where the car service really is worthy of the name and provides a service for the Members’ benefit.
