– Mr President, in Germany, what we term ‘bugging operations’ are used as a means of last resort in combating the most serious forms of organised crime.
The investigation services are allowed to use them in prosecutions only under stringent legal conditions and subject to constitutional law.
Our Federal Constitutional Court has recently imposed still further restrictions on their use.
Late last night, on a German television programme, a Member of this House was able to boast that he had, as a self-appointed investigator, been using this method on his fellow-MEPs for some years, without let or hindrance whatever.
In the programme, sequences filmed using concealed cameras were used as evidence of the rip-offs that are alleged to go on, particularly at the end of our part-sessions in Strasbourg.
The programme culminated in the threat that we would see this happen again, for, to quote the very words used: ‘The day after tomorrow is another Strasbourg Friday’.
Tomorrow, I will have to be here in this House, going about my political duties, and I will be recording my presence in the central register.
As I would like to be able to do that without fear of being pounced on by cameramen, I would like to know what is being done to ensure that my fellow-Members and I can do what we have to do in the service of the European public without fear.
How is this House’s security to be restored?
Will the European Parliament, which is a constitutional entity, continue to put up with these attempts at coercion?
