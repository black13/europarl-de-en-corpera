â€“ Madam President, I would like to thank, very warmly and most sincerely, all those Members of this House who have spoken, most of whom make the same speech in every debate on Turkey, in order to make it plain that they do not want Turkey or Turks in the European Union.
I am grateful for five years of cooperation and for your having tolerated me, a Turk, in this House.
I really am very, very grateful.
Thank you: your great achievement does credit to this House!
I came to this Parliament as a German, have worked very hard as a German MEP for five years, but it is as a Turk that I leave it.
Many of you have made me into a Turk, for I am ashamed of the speeches that really can only be described as hypocritical, of these speeches that really have nothing honest about them.
Others may take pride in bravely defending the Christian EU against the Turks, and may perhaps find some voters to support them, but I am ashamed; such is not my European Union.
