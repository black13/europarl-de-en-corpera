– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over and again, particular concerns are brought to me in my capacity as chairwoman of the European Parliament’s delegation to the countries of the Southern Caucasus, among which Armenia is included.
First, let me thank Mr Oostlander for his report, which was a very fair one, and also for the way in which he handles Turkey’s problems with its neighbours, particularly with Armenia.
There are two pre-eminent problems, and the first of them is Turkey’s economic boycott of Armenia.
The closure of the Turkish-Armenian border has meant that the transport of goods to Armenia is more expensive, and this frustrates the European Union’s economic aid to that country.
This also constitutes a grave breach of the Balladur Principles, which apply to all present and future candidates for accession, and according to which EU Member States must not be engaged in border disputes with neighbouring states, but must, on the contrary, maintain good relations with them.
The second problem is that what has historically transpired between Turkey and Armenia has still not been worked through, and this hampers mutual understanding and prevents the development of mutual trust.
Most recently, and unfortunately, Turkey has ensured that Armenia has had no part in the negotiations on energy transport and on the construction of pipelines from the region around the Caspian Sea, which is rich in natural gas and oil, and that these will not go through Armenia.
All these things are justified causes for complaint by the Armenian people.
It has not, so far, been possible to resolve these conflicts, which are obstacles not only to Turkey’s goal of joining the European Union, but also to that of the European Union itself, of stabilising the South Caucasus region.
