â€“ Madam President, you have to consider two things where natural gas is concerned.
The first is availability and the second is price.
In my opinion, we are right to take Article 100 as the basis now, even if Mr Blokland is right in saying we will have to take a very broad interpretation of it.
Whenever security of supply is discussed, there is always the temptation really to mean that it is an opportunity to introduce indirect price controls.
I believe that on the whole we will fail in that, because it will not work and the perspective taken is far too short-term.
Basically, we must not forget, either, that gas is dependent on price, which is in turn tied to the price of oil, and that we may perhaps be greatly deceiving ourselves about its availability.
The best form of security of supply is surely to have our own supplies, and we must therefore welcome the fact that work is gradually being done (a) to produce high-quality gas ourselves inside the European Union and (b) to feed that gas into our own available networks.
