– Madam President, I would be interested to know how we, or those who come after us, will speak about this problem in ten years’ time, whether we will have become wiser or not.
I cannot answer that question today.
One thing is certain: security of supply will be improved by more competition; we have always been clear about that.
Even competition cannot do that without supply, however, which means, I believe, that security of supply, of natural gas in particular, will depend very much on a European foreign policy for energy, in other words diversification and security of supply through access to gas.
Like many others, too, I also advocate proceeding gradually.
I believe that, as with oil, the responsibility rests in the first instance with the companies.
I imagine that in two years’ time there may be a review and we may be rethinking the present situation.
I do not believe we are under any pressure of time.
