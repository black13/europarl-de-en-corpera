– Madam President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer the rapporteur my most sincere congratulations and also my thanks.
She has taken on a very difficult and highly complex dossier at relatively short notice.
Coordination in the European Parliament has not suffered at all as a result.
We have already heard a large number of good arguments this evening for why it is so important for our environment and for the creation of incentives for industry that we should adopt this directive quickly.
I therefore share my fellow Members’ disappointment that no agreement was reached with the Council at first reading.
I understand that it is of course a very difficult dossier for the Member States, too, but we in the European Parliament have shown that, despite starting from very different positions, it is possible to come closer on very important issues.
One point on which we have not been able to agree and where tomorrow’s vote will show what the European Parliament’s position is, is the question of the legal basis.
For me, it is quite clear from the title of this directive that environmental protection is one of its priorities.
That is why I do not find it satisfactory to take only Article 95, the internal market article, as the legal basis.
If we want a good environment and energy policy, it makes no sense to put Member States that are more advanced or have stricter requirements in a particular matter on a leash and shackle them.
I know that the debate between those present has already been closed, but I would like to underline once again here that I and my group think it is very important to have two legal bases if there is to be a better environment and energy policy in the Member States.
