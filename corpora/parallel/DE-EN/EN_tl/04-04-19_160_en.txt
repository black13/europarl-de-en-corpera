– Madam President, Commissioner Wallström, I strongly support Mr Wijkman.
If we really want to enforce sustainable production, we must think in life cycles and not in individual products.
That is why, Commissioner Wallström, we also need a structural framework for the building site.
If you look at it now, what we have is a building site with the various building blocks scattered on the ground.
We have EMAS, we have eco-labels, and for batteries we have decided on eco-labels again.
Then we have limits, then for cars we have enhanced environment-friendly vehicles.
We have the public procurement system, but nothing dovetails.
Consequently, businessmen and consumers are of course not exactly clear how this integrated production is supposed to benefit them; that is why I can only strongly support Mr Wijkman.
We need a framework for the building site so that these building blocks will fit together and a sensible structure will result.
Only then, I believe, will we be able to persuade manufacturers to change their production methods and finally have environmentally friendly, sustainable production.
