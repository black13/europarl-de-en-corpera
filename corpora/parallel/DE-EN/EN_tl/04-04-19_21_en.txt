â€“ Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that, much as we could endorse a lot of what is in it, this report is, as a whole, unbalanced; parts of it make no sense and contradict each other, and everything is repeated time and time again.
I do ask most earnestly that we should distance ourselves from this report and, in the autumn, get back to the important things it contains, which, I believe, merit really in-depth, serious and proper consideration.
