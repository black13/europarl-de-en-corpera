– Mr President, politicians are always extremely adept, when elections are in the offing, at finding ways of putting Parliament’s procedures to work in the service of their own election campaigns.
Let me remind Mr Poettering that we will, as part of tomorrow’s discharge debate, be discussing a report by a member of his group, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, which contains a whole passage on Eurostat.
I would also like to remind him that all of us in this House do of course expect the Commission to comment on it tomorrow.
I do not think it makes any sense to impose on Parliament a procedure that is intended solely to promote harmony within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats after the British Tories failed to get enough signatures for a motion of no confidence in the Commission.
Many of the tricks that are used to provide grist to the mills of the election campaigns are too obvious not to be noticed, and, having noticed them, we have to vote against them.
