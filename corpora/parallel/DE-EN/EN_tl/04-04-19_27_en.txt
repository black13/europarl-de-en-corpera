â€“ Mr President, I think this does indeed represent a very significant change in, or clarification of, the American position, and a position of this sort can indeed drive a new wedge between the United States and Europe.
That is why it is important that the issue should be discussed.
If it is argued that there is too little time available, then it could, of course, be combined with discussion of trans-Atlantic relations, in which the Middle East presents a major political problem.
The fact that there are, of course, others is no excuse; if it really comes to it, it could be discussed along with trans-Atlantic relations, although this is an important issue and any statement would have to address it separately.
