– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, where this issue of an appeal to the European Court of Justice is concerned, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is being entirely pragmatic in its approach.
What concerns us is that failure to come to the sort of agreement that the Commissioner has described will lead to a great deal of inconvenience for EU citizens travelling to the USA.
If the Americans do not get by this route the information they require, they will obtain it by other means, whether this involves questioning at the border, mandatory visas or interviews in Consulates-General.
Secondly, if we do not get this agreement, our citizens will be in no better a legal position as regards data protection; indeed, they will be in a worse one, because we will have no influence whatever on what the Americans do with the data they obtain.
With this in mind, we are grateful to the Commission for its efforts, and have, as a group, expressed our opposition to an appeal to the Court of Justice not only in the course of the debate in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also in the resolution of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
