– Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on whose behalf I have the honour of speaking, also thanks the rapporteur for a very important report, one that is a key element in making the European Union a democracy capable of defending itself.
In both Conventions – both that on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that on the Constitution – our group was very active in contending that the EU is not merely an economic community, but also a community of values, one whose foundations have been laid over centuries, and one that is willing to defend democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law throughout its territory.
This Union of ours is a great thing, extending from Estonia to Portugal, and we have to ask ourselves what holds it together.
It certainly is not the market that constitutes Europe, but rather the sense of solidarity derived from our values.
Such is Europe, such is our identity – and that we must not lose.
We do of course need a mechanism to guarantee the maintenance of these values.
The public would find it incomprehensible if a Member State were to get out of hand without the EU doing anything about it.
We do not, of course, want to interfere in a state’s internal affairs – we are a Union with a great deal of pluralism and much diversity – but, when there is evidence of clear risks and of long-standing breaches of these values and principles, that is the time for the EU to act.
I am very glad to hear the Commissioner say that such action may even involve sanctions.
Cutting off funds from Brussels, not to mention withdrawal of the entitlement to participate in decision-making bodies, is of course the sharpest weapon one can use, but we have to make clear our willingness to introduce it if necessary.
I see Parliament as having a particular role to play in this, and that has been emphasised in the report, for which let me reiterate our thanks to Mr Voggenhuber.
