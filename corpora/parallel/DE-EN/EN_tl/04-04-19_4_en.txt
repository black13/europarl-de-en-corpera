– Mr President unspecified allegations of misconduct made about me and about some of my colleagues are appearing in the German press.
This is something we have already discussed in this House.
Unfortunately, it is not my work to which these reports refer; instead, there are only allegations to the effect that there is something objectionable about my behaviour, but as I am unable to ascertain what I am being accused of, I ask you, Mr President, to investigate further.
It is also stated in the German media that you are to meet a certain Member this week and that the Member in question will then hand over certain lists to you.
If this is the case, Mr President, I ask you to find out at once whether there is anything of which my colleagues or I might be accused.
If there is, then I ask that you forward all the documents, at once, to the European Court of Justice or to the Court of Auditors and to OLAF.
It would of course be good of you to inform those against whom the media are making what are really very nasty, dirty and unpleasant accusations, of what precisely they are being accused – that is, of whether they have been bad at their jobs or have broken the law.
