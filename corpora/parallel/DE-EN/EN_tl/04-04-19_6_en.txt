â€“ Mr President, I am very grateful to you for what you have just said.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt spoke on the substance of the allegations of misuse of funds by Members of this House, and then you made your own contribution.
I just want to remind the House of how these accusations came to be made over the past three years; the Member to whom reference has been made used a concealed camera to spy on Members as they went about their work.
In so doing, he violated all the rules of honesty, trust and collegiality.
I cannot see the European Parliament meekly accepting this sort of thing without a word of criticism.
It is not individuals who suffer, but the House as a whole, when this sort of espionage is used to investigate the work we do.
I would ask you to condemn this unequivocally in the interests of all Members of this House.
