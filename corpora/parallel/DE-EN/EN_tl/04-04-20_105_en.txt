Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just come to an understanding on a few more points with a view to making the voting procedure easier for you.
By agreement with my honourable colleagues, I should therefore like to propose that, beginning with the Committeeâ€™s Amendment No 10, we consolidate the votes into four blocks.
I have already indicated to the Bureau how these blocks can be arranged so that we can deal with the whole proposal fairly quickly, and I should like to ask your permission, Mr President, to present a brief oral proposal for a compromise before the vote on Article 3(2)(a) and before the vote on Article 16.
