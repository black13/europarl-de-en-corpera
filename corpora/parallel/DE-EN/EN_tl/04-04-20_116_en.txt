Ladies and gentlemen, a majority of you have come out against the inclusion of any rule on doorstep selling, and with good reason too.
The fact is that a separate directive covers these matters, and in the wake of this vote there is no more scope for the inclusion in the present directive of other rules on the same subject.
I still say that the amendment should fall.
