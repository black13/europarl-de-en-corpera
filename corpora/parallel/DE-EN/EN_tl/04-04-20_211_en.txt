Mr President, allow me to explain my abstention on the Cocilovo report.
The rapporteur took great pains to support a new approach and to pursue it boldly.
I should have welcomed an even bolder line and particularly a more receptive attitude to the amendments tabled in committee and here in plenary by the various political groupings – I myself was among those who tabled them – with a view to taking more account of the needs of people in sensitive areas.
This boldness was lacking at the first reading.
I hope this will have been rectified by the time we next deal with the proposal.
I am confident that this is the right approach, but it must be pursued more consistently and more boldly.
