Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, we are undoubtedly confronted by formidable tasks as we try to determine the future shape of the EU, and setting the right priorities for this purpose is not easy.
Top priority must attach to the real Community policies.
One of these is unquestionably the common fisheries policy, which continues to need a solid financial basis – a need which is now greater than ever before.
Allow me to enumerate briefly the main points which I identified in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries and which were explicitly and emphatically reaffirmed by the future Commissioner from Latvia, Mrs Sandra Kalniete, at her hearing.
Firstly, adequate funding of the CFP in the forthcoming financial perspective is imperative.
Secondly, the areas that depend on fishing, most of which are structurally weak regions, are in particular need of the solidarity and support of the Community.
Moreover – and this is my third point – we need more socio-economic measures; fourthly, we need greater diversification and, fifthly, we need the development of new activities.
I am convinced that fisheries in Europe have a future but only if they are adequately funded.
