Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, because I do believe he has summarised very well the content of a highly realistic proposal from the Commission.
The biggest-ever enlargement of the European Union is about to take place, and in two weeksâ€™ time we shall have ten more Member States.
If economic and social solidarity is to be achieved, an efficient cohesion policy will be indispensable.
The structural support provided by the European Union contributes substantially to the development of rural areas.
The common agricultural policy alone, even with its second pillar, is not able to perform all the tasks on the agenda.
For this reason, it remains essential that we have adequate resources at our disposal over and above the CAP budget.
We really must ensure that the rural-development programme is a sharply delineated instrument and that it is tied to the CAP and hence to active, productive agriculture.
Rural areas will account for most of the territory of the Union in the enlarged Union too.
I believe that rural areas must be active and appealing if they are to be capable of creating new jobs, more output and income opportunities.
