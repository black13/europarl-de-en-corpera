Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wishes to add its thanks to the rapporteur, who has really taken pains to produce a balanced report, a particularly difficult task in view of the short time at his disposal.
The report largely endorses the Commission’s proposal.
It does not, however, go beyond that.
Essential aims for which Parliament has been campaigning are underemphasised, aims such as sustainable development or consistency between structural policy on the one hand and environmental legislation and the Commission’s environmental targets on the other.
The Commissioner distinctly emphasised – and I certainly registered this – that Gothenburg ranks alongside Lisbon.
I consider that very important, and I would be pleased if the Commission actually succeeded in having it enshrined in the regulation on the structural funds.
To give but one example, the common policy on climate change must be a component of the future cohesion policy, and this must also be reflected in the choice of projects.
The increase in unemployment and emigration from disadvantaged regions must be halted.
Here too, clear differentiation is essential.
The regulation on the structural funds must not be organised from above – and this is particularly important, in my view – but in cooperation, on a basis of equality, with local players.
Lastly, I very much hope that the Commission will really keep the Commissioner’s promise and enshrine binding rules on partnerships in the regulation.
