Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I am convinced that people have good reason to look forward to enlargement.
It remains true, though, that they also harbour many fears, and we must take those fears seriously and allay them wherever we can.
Regional policy is an important means of dispelling such fears.
It can and must help to prevent or eliminate inequalities, injustices and anomalies within the EU.
It must not, however, encourage or sow the seeds of new injustices.
For this reason, we take a similar view to that expressed by the previous speaker, Mr Berend, in opposing any European regional policy that simply induces companies to relocate.
People will not understand or support a Europe that rewards companies for shifting jobs from one region and then only providing the same number of jobs elsewhere because we are subsidising the relocation.
Another point we have to bear in mind is that EU support funds must not be used to subsidise drastic tax cuts in recipient countries.
Solidarity is a noble value, but it must be mutual, and some of us will quickly recognise that, by promoting tax dumping, we could well besawing off the branch on which we sit.
