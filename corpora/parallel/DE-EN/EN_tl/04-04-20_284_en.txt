I believe the main point is that we must safeguard existing jobs and businesses and create new ones, and to this end we need, more than anything else, the small- and medium-sized enterprises.
These enterprises are experiencing fairly serious concerns at the present time with the introduction of the Basel II package.
There is quite simply an urgent need for the European Commission study on the implementation of the Basel II agreements, including a detailed impact assessment.
It is also a matter, ultimately, of creating new financial and guarantee instruments for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
These SMEs should be operating successfully on behalf of Europe in the global marketplace, which is another reason why I believe that the WTO assembly and parliamentary conference proposed by the European Parliament are a matter of the utmost priority, and I ask the Commission to incorporate this proposal from the European Parliament into the programme too.
