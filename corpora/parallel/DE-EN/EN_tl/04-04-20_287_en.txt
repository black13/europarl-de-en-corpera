Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, two hours ago, in my role as spokeswoman for the Committee on Fisheries, I expressed my confidence that European fisheries do indeed have a future.
I shall now continue where I left off by emphasising that these future prospects depend on systematic pursuit of the reform efforts and on the implementation of decisions.
I therefore call for due consideration in the 2005 budget of at least the main areas of action of the common fisheries policy.
Firstly, we need better staffing of the relevant services if the aims of the CFP reforms are to be achieved.
Secondly, we need the provision of a solid financial basis for the planned creation of the regional advisory bodies, and, thirdly, we need a solid financial basis for the establishment of the Community Fisheries Control Agency.
Fourthly, we need sufficient resources for the new fisheries agreements as well as for EU participation in international fisheries organisations and, fifthly, we need adequate funding to compensate the coastal regions hit by the effects of recovery plans and emergency measures.
Our decision to reform the CFP made good sense.
In the budget for 2005, the aim must now be to build a robust and sustainable financial substructure that will finally enable the fishing industry to become profitable again.
