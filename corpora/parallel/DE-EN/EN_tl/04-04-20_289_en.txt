Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ‘gender budgeting’ must become more than a mere linguistic monstrosity.
I ask and urge you to ensure that the principle of gender equality permeates this budget.
Gender mainstreaming must be put into practice and must be made quantifiable in terms of euros.
In the European Community, more women are victims of violence within the family than are victims of terrorism.
For this reason, we call for 2006 to be declared the European Year against Violence.
We want the Beijing +10 review to be used as a means of fleshing out the Beijing Platform for Action, and we want the results of the World Conference on Women to be implemented by a European Conference, for example, which would develop additional strategies.
We also call for a European Gender Institute, which would compile reliable data as a basis for our political decisions.
We expect the Commission to apply gender mainstreaming in all areas of political activity, and the 2005 budget, the first in the greater European Union, should provide us with the main indicators of its application.
