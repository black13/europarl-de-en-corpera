Mr President, first of all, I would like to say how delighted I am that this day has arrived.
As Chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South-East Europe, and on behalf of all those who have no opportunity to speak today, I would like to express my warm thanks to the two Commissioners.
I think we should all be more than satisfied by Mr Patten's and Mr Verheugen's statements, including the factual information they have supplied.
They have amply justified why Croatia can now be granted accession candidate status.
My question is this, and it has already been asked several times: what opportunities do the Commission and, indeed, this Parliament have to persuade the Council that it should grant this candidate status swiftly so that negotiations can be opened soon?
I endorse the points made by Mr Lagendijk.
Can we do anything to prevent the failure so far to sign the Stability Pact from being viewed as an impediment to the opening of negotiations?
This is an important issue, and we would very much appreciate a response from one of the Commissioners.
Once again, my warmest thanks and my congratulations on today's momentous decision.
