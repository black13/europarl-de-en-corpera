Mr President, on the question of cooperation with the Tribunal, I would confirm again that the judgment on whether Croatia is cooperating fully in this regard can only be made by the Tribunal itself.
We are not in a position to make a judgment from our own knowledge and experience, and as Mr Patten has just said, we have agreed that the International Criminal Tribunal will be the referee on this issue and we do have a clear picture at present.
Should this clear picture change in future as a result of statements by the Tribunal, this would impact on the process that we are initiating with Croatia today.
That is understood, and that is why I reiterate that this cooperation with the Tribunal must be viewed as satisfactory not only on one occasion but of course on an ongoing basis.
On Mrs Pack's question, all I can say is that to my knowledge, the European Council plans to deal with this issue in June.
However, that is a matter for the Irish Presidency.
The Commission will not intervene in any way.
We have timed the presentation of our report so that the Council has enough time to prepare itself before reaching a decision at the European Council meeting in June.
In my experience, the European Council is always grateful for guidance and advice from the European Parliament.
That is not meant at all ironically.
Such guidance from the European Parliament would undoubtedly be helpful.
