Mr President, first of all, I too would like to voice my very great pleasure at the Commission's Communication, the prior deliberations, and the positive decision.
Above all, I would like to express my thanks to the two Commissioners who are here today.
I believe, and I say this also in my capacity as Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Slovenia Joint Parliamentary Committee – Slovenia being Croatia's immediate neighbour – that we have taken a major step forward, and it is a positive step.
I have one specific question: are any efforts being made by the European Commission to assist the two countries of Slovenia and Croatia to resolve their border issue in the Piran Bay so that a solution can be reached here as swiftly as possible in a European spirit?
Let me make one further comment in conclusion, which refers back to Commissioner Verheugen's statements: we have duly noted that the Council is grateful for guidance.
As Parliament, we often wish that the Council would show greater receptiveness to the House's guidance.
However, this comment is directed at the Council itself, not at you.
