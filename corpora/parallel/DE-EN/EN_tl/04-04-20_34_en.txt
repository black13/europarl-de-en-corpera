Mr President, Commissioner, anyone who travelled at the time with the delegation of the committee to Galicia will never forget the inexhaustible assistants in their initially white, but soon oil-stained overalls, above all how they attempted stone by stone to wash away every trace of oil from the coast.
It is, sadly, the case that in particular it took so serious an accident as that of the tanker finally to improve safety in maritime traffic.
Today, however, I would like to emphasise that we will have succeeded in doing that, if we implement the measures indicated in the report and follow them up.
This needs a maritime network rather than another bureaucratic skyscraper in the big city of the European Union.
Effective protection of the coast can only be achieved through greater safety at sea at the multinational level.
Any particularist approach by small states must be relegated to the past.
What is effective is if, in the context of joint protection of the coast, synergies can be recognised and, through a joint organisation, people and materials be aligned with each other and the best possible use made of them across the countries and seas of the region.
For me, therefore, coastal protection, environmental protection or whatever you would like to call it is also a form of regional and structural support across Europe.
I take such protection to mean preventive measures for the protection of the environment and, in the context of a joint monitoring of the coast, also an effective resource for combating crime at sea.
I am proud of this and I am sure that the catalogue of measures we have decided on will achieve its objective.
This will be to the benefit of everyone in the European Union, in both the present members and the new ones, in the short, medium and long term.
A revival of the maritime ecosystem and increased readiness for investments in maritime routes, the maritime motorway of the future, will be the payoff.
