Mr President, learning from a catastrophe means facing the future.
All the laws or directives that we pass here are, at the end of the day, worth nothing if they cannot be monitored and enforced.
For this reason, we need very rapidly in the medium term a European coast guard service, not least in view of the new and emerging risk of terrorism.
We cannot sit and wait until terrorists attack vessels in European waters, but rather we must counter them in good time through a coast guard service.
My second point is that the Baltic is a sensitive maritime area.
As a committee, we called for obligatory pilots in the Baltic, but we are aware that this cannot be achieved without Russia.
For this reason, we ask you, Commissioner, to combine with the Commission and the Council in putting political pressure on Russia to ensure that Russia also at last complies with the international regulations in the IMO.
My third and final point is that we are aware that 80% of all accidents at sea are attributable to human error.
Hitherto, we have devoted great attention to technology.
In the future, we must concentrate more on the human factor, which means that we must direct our attention more specifically to the training of captains, officers and crew in accident management, fire protection and emergency measures.
