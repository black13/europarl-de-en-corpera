Commissioner Bolkestein, I cannot imagine that you feel very comfortable answering my question, for if I have understood you correctly over recent years, you yourself would probably have liked to see more dynamism and more professionalism in the preparation and implementation of the SME study.
You are fobbing me off.
You say that the findings of this study are available.
In that case, why have we not received them?
You say that the report identifies some areas where the proposals contained in the Commission's third consultative paper should be amended.
What are these amendments?
You say that we will receive the report in good time.
However, today is officially Parliament's last sitting.
It seems to me that omissions have been made here and I urge and request you to make the latest information and the findings of the study available to the market, the Council and Parliament as swiftly as possible.
I am certainly not aware of any arrangements for interested Members to discuss the report with the Commission.
