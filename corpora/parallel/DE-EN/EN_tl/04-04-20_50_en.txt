Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur warmly once again for his constructive collaboration.
He has really tried to achieve a viable compromise.
For a sustained strategy for the Eurovignette, however, the success achieved so far is not sufficient.
This is because the purpose of the Eurovignette is to achieve fairness in competition between rail and road and also to compel those who cause damage to pay for it.
We think that external costs caused by transport, goods transport by road, must be attributable to it in full, and only then can fairness be achieved.
Fairness in competition means that the long-term environmental damage must also be included here.
Mention has been made of the sensitive areas.
There too, it is obvious that not only the mountain areas, but also valleys, which have the effect of kettles and in which environmental pollution is massively intensified, and even the cities, which are already subject to strain, are all vulnerable to possible increases in the effect of traffic.
Fairness in competition also means that social dumping in goods transport must be resisted.
As we all know, it is only through more effective monitoring that this can be promoted.
We therefore take the view that greater room for manoeuvre must be created in the integration of external costs into the ‘polluter pays’ principle in the area of transport for the purpose of achieving greater road safety, sustained long-term integration and above all sustained environmental protection, because we do not want the next generation to carry the cost of the damage that we are now doing with a short-term strategy for the Eurovignette.
