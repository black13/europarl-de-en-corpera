Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are standing at an historical turning point.
With the agreement between Parliament and the Council in the Sommer report on toll systems, the comprehensive toll has for the first time been made administratively and technically possible.
An agreement tomorrow on the railway package will also make possible an improvement through better harmonisation of European railways.
The only thing that is not yet present is the political will for fairness, for fair competition between road and rail.
Here, we have extreme differences in the working conditions.
It is a scandal that the Irish Government has not even put the Markov report on the agenda.
This is a matter of life and death, not just the ordinary rest and driving times on the road.
Secondly, the ‘polluter pays’ principle must also be complied with; Mr Jarzembowski, and all the others who keep saying that there are no figures, please note: accidents, EUR 19 billion; noise damage, EUR 11 billion; air pollution, EUR 62 billion; climate change, EUR 35 billion – EUR 134 billion in damage done by goods vehicles in Europe.
Who pays for this?
This loss is paid for by those who sit up there in the public gallery, the European man in the street, and so long as you are not prepared to pass on the costs in full and therefore also to put money in the alternatives, the shameful political fight will continue against justice on the roads of Europe.
