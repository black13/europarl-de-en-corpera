– Mr President, the monitor is still giving the wrong information.
My name is Elisabeth Schroedter, and I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as already stated, in the context of the procedure of enhanced cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for this important dossier.
I will take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his constructive collaboration.
It is all the more disappointing that – as already mentioned – the Committee of the Regions has thrown out the Committee on Social Affairs’ main improvements, which had to do with the tolerance of excesses.
The committee, that is to say, has proposed that excesses of up to 20% should be tolerated.
What does that mean in concrete terms?
It means quite specifically that the 56-hour driving times that are already permitted per week can be increased by a further 20%, in other words, that a further 11 hours can be added.
In my opinion, this is physical irresponsibility with regard to the drivers, and, secondly, it puts every road user at enormous risk.
So I think that this matter will really be improved only if we agree, here in the plenary, to reduce this tolerance.
