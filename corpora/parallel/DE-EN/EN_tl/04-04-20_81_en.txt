Mr President, I am very surprised about the statement by Mr Barón Crespo, for whom I otherwise have the highest regard, in which he mentions our group in the same breath as the no-confidence motion against the Commission.
I would like here to state that I am severely critical of the fact that Commission President Romano Prodi is obviously too involved in Italian domestic politics to bother with his tasks as President of the Commission.
This is still no reason, however, for us now to consider a vote of no confidence, precisely because we have such excellent members of the Commission as the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, who is here today.
So our group has absolutely nothing to do with the no-confidence motion, Mr Barón Crespo.
I really ask that you forget about the elections for a bit
and not look for arguments that are simply not there.
That is the first point.
Secondly, Mr Barón Crespo – and I would like once again to express my high regard for him – has said that we should not deliberate or vote on Eurostat and a dismissal.
The Parliament decided to do so yesterday.
Mr Barón Crespo, we jointly have that right, that is the basis of our work, of the European Union, and for that reason I recommend that we proceed in the way that we decided to yesterday.
