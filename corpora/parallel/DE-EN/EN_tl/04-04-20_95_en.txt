Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the general plan adopted by the Council in 2002 on the suppression of illegal immigration and human trafficking in the European Union provided for the introduction of a new early-warning system, which is now to be further developed into a secure web-based Intranet site.
The Commissionâ€™s proposal is good.
That needs to be emphasised too.
We were able to work very well with it in committee, and we regard it as a decisive step towards improved coordination and communication between Member States, which is the key to successful cross-border efforts to combat illegal immigration.
Exchanges of information, of course, can only become an everyday reality if the Member States can be sure that the information they provide will be sufficiently protected.
The CIRCA system proposed by the Commission is a commendable step in this direction.
It meets the required security standard.
In particular, it permits selective access to the information within the system.
I wish to thank my honourable colleagues from the various parliamentary groups for their broad approval of this report, and I am pleased that we shall manage to complete this process before the end of the current parliamentary term.
