â€“ Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is in my capacity as chairman of the temporary committee on the Sterckx report, on which we have been working for half a year, that I ask you to vote on it in order to obviate the risk of it lapsing.
I ask you to have due regard for the work that Members have been doing for half a year and to put the Sterckx report to the vote.
