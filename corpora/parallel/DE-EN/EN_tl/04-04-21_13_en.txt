Mr President, I wanted to rise in connection with the previous item.
I also have no wish to pass comment on the debates and events that took place in committee, nor on what apparently happened here last night.
On behalf of my group, I would like to voice my support for your endeavours and simply make the point that we want a vote to be held on this issue.
We believe this topic is far too important to vanish from the agenda, however that might happen.
