In fact, I had not intended to rise, but I must respond to what Mr Watson, the Chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, has just said.
He urges our group to withdraw its amendments.
Let me point out to Mr Watson that there are 338 amendments, 157 of which have been tabled by our group.
That means that 181 come from other groups.
It is unfair to imply that our group is solely responsible for all the amendments.
A great many Members are unsatisfied with this report, and that is why 181 amendments have been tabled by other groups.
I would urge you, Mr President, to ensure that speakers do not only refer to amendments from our group.
