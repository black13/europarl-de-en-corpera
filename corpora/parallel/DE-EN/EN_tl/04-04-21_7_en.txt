Mr Poettering, you can be as sophisticated as you like â€“ the disgraceful conduct of your group colleagues in committee was not the disgraceful conduct of other Members from other groups.
If you had been there and heard the reports, you could have witnessed this for yourself.
That is my first point.
Secondly, Mr President, Mr Watson has asked a straightforward question, and we want an answer.
We want to vote at 12 noon today on when we will vote on the report.
Our group is prepared to vote on this report at 2 p.m., at 3 p.m., at 5 p.m. or tonight at midnight, whenever.
What is going on here is scandalous!
The degree of collusion between two groups, aimed at evading a vote on an important report, is a scandal in itself, and this House should respond honourably to this scandalous state of affairs by taking a vote this afternoon or tonight, whenever, in order to demonstrate that these shenanigans will not prevent us from voting on this important report.
We want to vote at 12 noon, so that a vote on this report is held today.
