Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, at the very outset, I think, it is only proper to thank the manufacturers of sporting goods for providing the least developed countries with employment, wages and taxes.
That there is room for improvement here is not a matter of dispute.
My belief is that we should concentrate on commending, and publicly encouraging, those who adhere to the ILO's rules.
We should call them in front of the curtain and congratulate them on maintaining standards.
We should be showing them how best practice works even in the least developed countries; such incentive systems would, I believe, be the best way in which we could help promote economic activity in these countries.
We stress the importance of acknowledging and integrating the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, and also especially family firms as suppliers, and of encouraging that both internationally and globally by means of objective and proper invitations to tender.
