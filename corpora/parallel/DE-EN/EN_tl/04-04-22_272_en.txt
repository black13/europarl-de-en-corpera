My request to you, Mr President, is that, when we sign ourselves into the central register tomorrow morning, we should be given ample protection from the media, who we expect to be there, and who are working for a certain Mr Martin.
Although we have nothing to hide, we do not want to be harassed.
Let me assure this House right now that I would not, until very recently, have thought it even possible that I could have been systematically spied on by a certain Mr Martin, using his buttonhole camera, since at least 2002.
I was not aware of being spied on.
Had I been aware of it, I would have given this Mr Martin a wide berth ever since 2002.
I am equally strong in my condemnation of certain German media, who are making use of a certain Mr Martin as what they call their principal witness and have thereby subjected me, among others, to a disgusting campaign of defamation in Germany.
Here in this House, I have always obeyed the rules as they were in force at the time.
