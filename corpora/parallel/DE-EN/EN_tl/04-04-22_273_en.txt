Mr President, as a personal reference has been made to me, I am glad to have been given the opportunity to reply to it, so that it is not only others who can bandy statements about in this House.
I just want to make it clear that it is in no way the case that there are people in the media working for me.
I also want to make it clear that I have not been using a camera concealed in my buttonhole, and, above all, that I am very sorry, for the sake of Europe's taxpayers and voters, that it is evidently still not understood in this House that the rules are the problem and that a self-service mentality has got a foothold in this place.
What this shows, quite simply, is that only pressure from the public will bring about awareness of the need for reform, which has been long in coming and is what a number of my fellow-Members and I are working for.
