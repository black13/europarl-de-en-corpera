Mr President, I am sorry to have to say that I had expected more from Mr Martin's statement.
I thought he was going to explain why the Minutes state that he voted on many of the amendments to the van Hulten report, even though he was not in the Chamber at all.
It is an inexplicable phenomenon how someone can claim to have voted on innumerable amendments, even though he was outside.
We could all do the same thing, with interviews of one sort or another out there and, later on, the President's lists...
