Mr President, I am glad that we can now get on with what we are meant to be doing rather than continuing to waste valuable time.
For ten years now, I have been the rapporteur on the problems of beekeeping in the European Union, and today sees me presenting my seventh report to you.
As before, it improves another half-hearted Commission proposal for a regulation on actions in the field of beekeeping.
Neither the Commission nor the Council have made much of a response to the many good proposals we have made since 1984 on saving beekeeping in Europe.
Since 1997, admittedly, there has been a regulation on the 50% cofinancing of national programmes to improve the production and marketing of honey, for which different amounts are made available to the 15 Member States every year; in one year EUR 10 million, in another EUR 15 million, in yet another EUR 16 million.
That is next to nothing in terms of the overall budget of the European Union; it is peanuts.
As, yet again, the new regulation proposed by the Commission is far too half-hearted, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted my suggested improvements by an overwhelming majority, with the particular intention of securing additional co-finance for measures under national programmes to support the restoration and development of the Community's bee population, in support of honey analysis laboratories, and for the analysis of honey.
My hope and expectation is that you will give this report your unanimous support, not as a farewell present to mark the end of a legislative period, but, as before, out of conviction.
