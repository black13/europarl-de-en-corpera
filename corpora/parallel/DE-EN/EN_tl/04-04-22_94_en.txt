Mr President, even though Mr Cushnahan and I did not always agree, I would like, first of all, to thank him for his dedication.
He really did do a fine job, and achieved a great deal.
I would like to add an oral amendment to Amendment No 6, to which many of us would be able to agree if something were to be added to it, that being the words, ‘provided that the United Nations shall not have assumed political responsibility’.
The fact is that unilateral withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the present time, without the assumption of responsibilities by the United Nations, would certainly be highly problematic and could well plunge the country into chaos.
If that were agreed to, we could support the amendment as a whole.
That is my question to the proposer of the motion.
