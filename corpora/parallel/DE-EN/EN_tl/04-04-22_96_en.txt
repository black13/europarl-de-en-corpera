Mr President, here too we find a similar lack of logic, and so I ask that, by analogy with paragraph 13, the following words, which I shall now read out, should be deleted: ‘including the completion of the transatlantic market’.
I also ask that the following be deleted: ‘aimed at achieving the free movement of goods, capital, service and persons’.
In this instance, too, I ask for Mr Brok's agreement to this.
