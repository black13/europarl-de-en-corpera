Mr President, let me put to you another suggestion, one that will, I think, represent an even better solution to this.
In Mr Elles' Amendment No 22, there is a paragraph 27a, which deals with the same point and incorporates what Mrs Mann is talking about.
I put it to you that we should get rid of the whole of paragraph 15 and insert Mr Elles' paragraph 27a in its place.
We will then have resolved the whole problem and could have the support of a broad majority for it.
