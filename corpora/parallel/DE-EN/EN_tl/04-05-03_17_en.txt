– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to make a small request.
On 1 May, we saw the final defeat of Hitler and Stalin, and the victory of Walesa, Havel, Delors and Kohl.
There are many, though, both in the acceding countries and in the original European Union, and in this House, who have played their part in bringing us to this moment.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to cause to be recorded in today’s Minutes the names of the ten rapporteurs for the ten countries.
I will read their names in the order of the countries’ accession: Schröder, Poos, Gahler, Queiró, Elisabeth Schroedter, Souladakis, Stenzel, Gawronski, Volcic, and Wiersma; also the three rapporteurs who have passed on their brief to others: Mrs Hoff, Mrs Carlsson and Mr Matella.
I ask you to honour them by having their names recorded.
