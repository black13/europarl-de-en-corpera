Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of Basel II will be on the agenda in the next parliamentary term.
This deals with credit rating and collateral needed for small and family-run businesses and is of course a very important issue in the enlargement phase.
Since Europe is shaped by small and family-run businesses, in which two-thirds of employees work and by which 80% of taxes are paid, I would be interested to know what the Commission plans to do, in order to implement Basel II as smoothly and as well as possible, so that our companies will have a chance, in the future, to ensure wealth and job security.
