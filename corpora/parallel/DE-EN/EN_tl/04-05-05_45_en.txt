I would like to address the concern that was expressed by Mrs Kinnock as to whether, in view of the current situation, the Commission is still providing enough resources to combat poverty in developing countries.
I can inform her that the funds that are to be provided within the framework of the development policy to combat poverty will, for the first time, exceed the magic threshold of EUR 1 billion in the draft budget for 2005, in line with the Commission proposal.
I believe that this shows that this Commission feels extremely committed to the aim of combating poverty.
