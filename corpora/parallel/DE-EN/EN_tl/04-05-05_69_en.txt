Mr President, it is a fine tradition for the chairmen of the groups to sincerely thank the outgoing Presidents and so I, like the other group chairmen, have asked to take the floor.
For the Group of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is in no way an obligatory exercise but rather a wholehearted and warm word of thanks, one that is sincerely meant.
Mr President, Pat Cox, you are a person who combines vision and pragmatism and you are person who is full of political and personal fairness.
You combine the best traditions of your country, the Republic of Ireland, with our European conviction.
You will always be numbered among the great Presidents of the European Parliament and you were lucky that your Presidency fell in a successful time, at a time when the constitution was being debated and when ten new Member States joined the European Union.
You mentioned the one task that remains unfinished: the Statute for Members.
Immediately after a new Parliament is elected, it will be our duty, the duty of those who are re-elected, to put into effect your work to complete the Statute.
Mr President, you can take pride in the dignity with which you held office and carried out your duties.
We all have reason to sincerely thank you and I am also doing so at a personal level.
I wish you all the very best for your personal future and for everything that you will do in your country.
On behalf of our group, I sincerely wish you all the very best.
