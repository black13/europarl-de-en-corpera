Mr President, although I am sure that I, together with the sessional services for my group, prepared the voting list correctly, questions have been asked about it.
I would therefore like to ask you to clarify again for all Members that we will vote on the report, as Mrs Theato said in relation to the corrected versions for various languages.
It should once again be stressed that we are to vote on the texts of the report.
