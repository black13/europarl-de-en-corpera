– Mr President, yesterday, you addressed us prior to your election, and your own words were that we must do away with all the grey areas that do damage to this Parliament.
There is one decision that many Members find incomprehensible, and that is the quaestors’ decision on 26 May, which has meant that over two hundred former Members of this House have drawn a daily subsistence allowance for yesterday.
I would ask you to have this matter investigated, and also to consider whether this allowance can be withheld, as it has led to the taxpayer yet again having to cough up between EUR 50 000 and EUR 100 000.
