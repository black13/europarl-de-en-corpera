– Mr President, as our new House has taken on a Teutonic style, I will offer a few words in the language of Goethe.

For God’s sake, Mr Poettering, what have you done now?
The European People’s Party members have cast their votes for Mr Borrell, and now the Social Democrats are voting against your candidate for the Commission.
Unreliable partner!
