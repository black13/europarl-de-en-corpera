– Mr President, I think that the time before the ICAO meeting at the end of September is the perfect moment for the European Parliament to speak its mind on the subject and for us – my dear Mr Schmitt – to discuss it.
That the issue of air travel and the environment is a sensitive one is something we have noticed from the reactions of some airlines, but what is it all about?
We know that air travel and global warming are connected; there is no argument about that.
We are now talking in terms of the possibility of emissions trading, and the studies carried out to date have got us no further.
That makes it absolutely necessary to keep all the options open when it comes to reducing emissions, and to do so using instruments that are both environmental and based on the market.
What matters, then, is that neither the USA nor anyone else, at the meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal at the end of this month, should slam any doors shut.
After all, we are not talking about introducing emissions trading today or in the next couple of weeks, but about the future possibility of the EU opting to facilitate this in air transport, using market-based emissions trading instruments; it is this position that the EU should keep open for itself.
That, Commissioner, is why most of us in this House wholeheartedly support the Commission’s view that, as you have said, the EU should present as united a front as possible within the framework of the ICAO.
I see it as both right and necessary that this House should underline this once again, so that no doors are slammed shut in the ICAO at the end of this month.
The USA, too, must come to understand that the EU takes something of a different approach to the environment and air transport.
