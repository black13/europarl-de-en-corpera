– Mr President, although I do not want to drag matters out, there is something remarkable about a ship being held somewhere for four years, a ship that has already been the subject of 18 proceedings for transporting prohibited materials, and one that is over 35 years old.
The effect of the over recent years, has been some small progress in lawmaking, and if the Member States were to be more prompt in processing the Commission’s proposals, we might well make some progress as regards pollution of the environment and criminal law.
It is not the Commission that is dragging its feet, but the Member States.
Even though we are seeing a changeover to a new Commission and will not be able to sort this out this evening, let me ask, Commissioner, that the Commission should respond to this calamity by producing a proper report with good analysis of both the environmental and transport aspects; then it might put forward some proposals for legislation, perhaps as part of the package.
Then we will be able to use European law to close the loopholes whose presence this calamity has made so obvious, or, where there is negligence or a lack of vigilance, we will know who is responsible.
It will enable the imposition of sanctions for sloppy work.
I think it would be possible to do this over the next few months, so that we not merely learn from this catastrophe, but also make our seas rather safer in future than they have been in the past.
