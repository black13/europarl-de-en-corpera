– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Committee, I ask that the request for urgent procedure be refused.
The funding to be allocated to the new financial instrument for the Turkish Cypriot community – amounting to EUR 259 million – relates to the period from 2004 to 2006.
Only EUR 6 million was provided this year for feasibility studies, so this should not be a problem.
I would add that the legal basis – Article 308, in consequence of which Parliament is still consulted – is not uncontentious, and I am being cautious in my use of language when I say that.
I can also tell you, however, that, although we have no difficulties of any substance as regards the content of the Commission proposal, the political significance of this issue means that we do need more time to examine it more closely.
What I would propose to you is that we should make a prompt start on the work and come to a decision on this point at this House’s second October part-session.
I think that this delay should not give rise to any problems when it comes to playing our part in improving relations between the two ethnic communities.
I would ask you to support the proposal.
