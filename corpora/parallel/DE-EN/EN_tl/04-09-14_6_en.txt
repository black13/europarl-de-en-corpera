â€“ Mr President, I just wanted to say, on behalf of my group, that we endorse the view expressed by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, that this is not a vote on the content, but about our shared view that this matter needs prompt and thorough discussion.
The message we should be sending to the world out there is that we are ready to discuss this, but not as a matter of urgent and topical importance.
