Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the primary task of the European Union’s financial policy must be to provide a sound basis for the economy.
It must be stable and predictable, but must never become ideological.
I am quite astonished to hear it said in this House that confidence in the euro has been shaken.
Where have you found even one piece of economic evidence to support such a statement?
The truth is quite the opposite; the businesses with which I am in contact are more concerned at the strength of the euro against the US dollar and at the fact that we are experiencing low economic growth.
The people with whom I am in contact are concerned at the high rates of unemployment in the European Union.
I am sure that Mr Almunia will have the opportunity to discuss confidence in the euro and the international view of the euro in his answer, and we can in any case continue the discussion in this House.
Mr Poettering, it was with great interest that I discovered how broad a discussion is being conducted on this issue within your group.
This discussion is a fascinating one, and apparently this is also the case within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).
Our proposal is this: let us be reasonable and avoid ideology, and let us support the Commission’s ideas, which are capable of making the Pact more effective and of turning a stability procedure into a Stability and Growth Pact.
It is high time for us to tackle this task.
