Mr President, I am very pleased that referendums on the Constitution are to be held in an increasing number of Member States, and I hope that the Government of my own country will open the way for such a referendum as quickly as possible.
Every effort must, however, be made in this connection in order to ensure that Europe, and, more specifically, the text of the Constitution, are actually debated.
Mr Leinen and Mr Voggenhuber are entirely correct to say that we must face the risk of the Constitution becoming a pawn in domestic political or intra-party intrigues.
There can be no doubt that one of the main problems in the various public discussions which have been initiated is a lack of detailed knowledge on the contents of the Constitution, and in some cases a fair amount of nonsense is being talked already.
More action therefore needs to be taken to provide targeted information, and this is a point that I would like to make to the Commission.
Maybe for once it should not just be the facts which are conveyed to the public, but also the difficulty of the debate, the pros and cons of individual arguments, tax policy, and so on.
Many examples can be given of debates that have already taken place in this context.
My final observation, Mr President, I would like to address to Mr Nicola√Ø.
I noted with interest that the Council is considering arranging ratification at a similar time in all Member States.
Perhaps a date should be set for May of next year?
Such a date would be of high symbolic value, as it will be the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
The aim would be to set an example for peace and stability in our continent and for greater integration, and this would be a viable way of doing so.
