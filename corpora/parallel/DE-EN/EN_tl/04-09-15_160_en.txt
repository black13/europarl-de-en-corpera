Mr President, a few days ago the Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed the allocation of large amounts of EU money to institutions whose job it is to inform the European public about the Constitutional Treaty.
Yet one cannot help thinking that this is not intended to be an objective discussion on the draft Constitution, but rather an extremely biased one, and what might even be called propaganda.
In view of the fact that to date the European public has known relatively little about the content of the Constitutional Treaty, an overly biased campaign promoting the Constitution would have a negative impact on EU citizens, who would feel that they had once again been presented with .
This would mean a further increase in the euroscepticism recently highlighted by the low turnouts in the European elections, and we will therefore need to find the courage to allow a controversial discussion on the Constitutional Treaty to take place.
We will also have to acknowledge the Treatyâ€™s shortcomings and deficits, or else citizens will not truly accept this Constitution for Europe.
Domestic referendums on a national scale and the attendant debates are in no way connected with chauvinism or nationalism, but are merely part and parcel of democracy.
