Mr President, I will go along with Mr Borrell’s proposal that we Catalans in the House should not speak our own language.
Instead, I will use a language which is very close to Strasbourg and the Alsace region.
As a linguist, I would like to make known my strong opposition to the fact that Spain is calling for the EU’s linguistic regime to include Catalan and Valencian as if these were two entirely different languages.
Catalan is spoken from north to south, from Salses, in Roussillon, to Guardamar, south of Valencia, and from west to east, from Fraga, in the Autonomous Community of Aragon, to Alghero, in Sardinia.
To speak of Catalan and Valencian is to promote linguistic secessionism, which has long been one of the strategies of cultural destruction.
As the Romans said, ‘!’ which, translated into an official EU language, means ‘divide and rule!’.
If Europe is moving closer to an ever more effective unity, what point can there be in fragmenting both languages, which in actual fact are spoken across borders and other divisions?
A Europe which does not give a voice to all its peoples will be an incomplete Europe.
We have a great opportunity to build a true European federalism.
