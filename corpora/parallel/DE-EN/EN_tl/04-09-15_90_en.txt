Mr President, one aspect of this debate that angers me is that neither the Council nor the Commission have had a word to say about women, who make up the majority of the population in Iraq, not a word about their exclusion from the transitional government or the process of democratisation.
OK, so we want free elections, but what about Iraq’s female majority?
The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality organised a hearing with Iraqi women, at which the hope was expressed that we would provide outside help, highlighting painful issues as we did in Afghanistan, and that women could be involved in the process of democratisation.
For that reason, we women in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament want this aid with reconstruction to be tied to the stipulation that women be fully involved.
No matter what the terror, hope must not be allowed to die, and it is through women and children that it lives on – the hope that they will again be able to work as police officers, as politicians, as doctors, and as university professors, as they did under Saddam, dictator though he was.
That, I believe, is why we must not forget, while demanding the immediate release of the hostages, that Iraq’s women, too, have to be set free.
