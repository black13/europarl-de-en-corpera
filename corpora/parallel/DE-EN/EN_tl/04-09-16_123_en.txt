– Mr President, following the wars against the Turks, something one could describe as Europe in miniature came into being in Vojvodina and flourished.
For centuries, it has been home to a good dozen peoples, who have lived together, sometimes relatively peacefully, sometimes very much so.
It was not only Poles, Ruthenes, Germans, Hungarians, and Czechs, but also Croats and Slovenes, who established themselves there a long time ago and have co-existed well with each other.
I might add that it was the Serbs of Vojvodina who contributed much to the tolerance in this region.
The problem is something quite different: it is that Milosevic deprived Vojvodina of its autonomy by force in order to secure himself a majority in Yugoslavia’s collective state presidency, and that wave after wave of people uprooted and expelled from other parts of Serbia were settled there, thus upsetting the complex ethnic balance, and have to date been socially and politically marginalised, unable to put down real roots.
It is for that reason that a clear distinction must be drawn between cause and effect.
We will not solve the problem without building up democracy and the rule of law, autonomy and co-existence in Vojvodina.
We must support the Hungarians, but also all the other minorities too.
We also have to tell the old-established Serbs in Vojvodina that we know of the good they have done for this multinational region, that this policy of ours is not anti-Serb, but that it is our concern, in the world of many and varied cultures that is Vojvodina, to re-establish the sort of co-existence that prevailed for centuries.
That can be done only if we stand firm against the extremist elements and also tell the government in Belgrade that it is by the way they handle this that we will judge their readiness for Europe.
