– Mr President, against the image of the Maldives as a holiday paradise of one’s dreams, we must set the political reality of uprisings, arbitrary arrests, solitary confinement and restrictions on the freedom of speech, of the press, of the right to assembly and of religion.
For over 26 years, the President has ruled over the archipelago as a dictator; only his own party is allowed to contest elections, he himself is the supreme judge, appoints one-sixth of the members of parliament, and controls the media, while economic life as a whole is in the hands of his family, something to which Mr Deva referred.
Two years ago, in response to international protests, he promised democratic reforms, but, as the Commission’s report testifies, the announcement was not followed up by actions.
There have been expensive PR campaigns aimed at conveying the impression of effective changes, but let us not be taken in by them.
In August, in order to reinforce his power, the President declared a state of emergency, and had supporters of the pro-democracy movement arrested.
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on him to release opposition elements from jail and at last initiate democratic reforms, failing which financial aid from the European Union and its Member States will have to be stopped.
As Members have pointed out, 300 000 tourists from the European Union visit the Maldives every year.
It is incumbent upon us to open their eyes to the conditions there, which are not those of a paradise.
If the President wants to avoid them being warned against travelling to the Maldives on the one hand, and a ban on his government and officials entering the EU on the other, then all he needs to do is to create the conditions for democracy.
