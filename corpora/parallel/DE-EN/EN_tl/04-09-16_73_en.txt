The coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Georg Jarzembowski, makes the following statement, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in relation to the meeting of the ICAO:
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will abstain in the vote on the joint resolution, as the resolution’s demands are too indiscriminate and as the pressure of time has prevented a nuanced debate, such as these matters require, on these demands with the Member States represented at the ICAO and with the industry and consumers affected.
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is firmly of the opinion that further steps to reduce damage to the environment, including that caused by air transport, are necessary at both global and European level.
At the same time, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that the potential side effects of such steps must be carefully discussed with the industry and consumers concerned.
It will also be necessary to take into account the extremely grave economic damage already sustained by European airlines as a consequence of the events of ‘9/11’ and the drastic rise in the price of oil.
Hasty reactions by Parliament do not do justice to the seriousness of these issues.
