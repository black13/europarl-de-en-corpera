Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how, in future, are we to fashion the area of freedom, security and justice so that it meets the needs of Europeans in the twenty-first century?
We have to ensure that the EU continues to stand for openness to the world, for liberality and tolerance.
We are agreed that we must act decisively against international terrorism and organised crime, but the measures we take to deal with them have to be appropriate.
To take one example, we set great store by the European arrest warrant, but, unfortunately, not everyone does.
We, on the other hand, have no desire to take action for the sake of it, nor any headlong zeal for collecting every conceivable item of data about people, storing them for unspecified periods of time, and passing them on to every official body.
The greater security this promises is illusory, and civil liberties and the protection of the individual, for which we have struggled for so long, must not be sacrificed to it.
These values must underpin everything we do in the sphere of justice and internal affairs.
Tampere I made that clear, and to that we must hold fast.
We still need a common asylum policy and a policy enabling us to bring illegal immigration under control and to prevent people-trafficking, without diluting or even abandoning the principle of solidarity.
What, in the future, is to be Europe’s concept of men, women, and freedom – that of the nineteenth century, or that of the twenty-first, which meets the needs of its people?
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament favour that of the twenty-first century.
Brilliant though Mrs Klamt’s speech was, there is a saying in Bavarian football to the effect that ‘narrowly wide is still not a goal’.
