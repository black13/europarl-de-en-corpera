Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I really am glad that todayâ€™s agenda includes this topic, which is of such importance to every citizen of the EU, and I am very sad that many of the groups have left the Chamber.
In this area, too, our enlarged Union is facing new challenges, simply because our external borders have been moved, and we have to be able to guarantee that these will be well secured.
A coordinated border policy is a priority, and the securing of our external borders must be jointly funded, but I regard with some scepticism the establishment of a Corps of Border Guards for the EU.
Our future objective must be the creation of common asylum law and clear rules on migration, with the fixing of quotas being reserved to the Member States.
In this context, it is important that action be taken against illegal immigration.
Sacrosanct though the right to asylum is, immigration cannot be a right.
We also have to work towards greater cooperation with the states bordering the EU in dealing with asylum and migratory flows.
The protection of our citizens demands that we take action against terrorism and organised crime, and, in the area of data protection related to this, it is important that we come up with a good compromise between counter-terrorism, our economic interests and the rights of citizens.
Our policy must increasingly focus on combating child pornography, the traffic in women and drugs, corruption and on stabilising the Balkans.
In conclusion, and speaking on behalf of my own country, let me emphatically thank Commissioner Vitorino for his commitment and for his very positive efforts for the Europe in which we share.
