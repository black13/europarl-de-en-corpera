Mr President, Commissioner, the good thing about the tail end of a debate is always that one can listen attentively, and I, personally, would say that every one of the speeches made had something plausible about it.
To come to the point, though, my position is that it makes sense, when there are so many European regulations, that there should be, and must be, a European Data Protection Supervisor.
I do believe, though, that it makes little sense to do this in the way that is being attempted now.
I think the conservatives had good reason to abstain, and that there are very, very good reasons for voting against.
Instead of making much more efficient use of what we have and retrieving things that have long been available, we are again attempting to add on new things, and to that I am indeed opposed.
I see the Data Protection Supervisor as another example of how one could manage efficiently with much less.
