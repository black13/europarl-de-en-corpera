– Mr President, I have a request to make of you.
Yesterday, the Conference of Presidents, which both Mr Watson and I attended, decided to ask the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell, to forward to the President-designate of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the letters from the various committees of this House containing the outcomes of the hearings, so that he could take note of them and draw his own conclusions from them.
I read in yesterday’s evening newspapers and in yesterday evening’s press agency reports that Mr Barroso, even though these letters are not yet in his possession, is already making statements about the outcomes of the hearings, to the effect that he is not interested in what the letters contain, regards – in as many words – his own Commission as perfectly suitable, and is unwilling to make any changes.
I would ask you, Mr President, to ensure that Mr Barroso is given to understand that my group is no longer prepared to be on the receiving end of this sort of talk.
If Mr Barroso wants the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to have any confidence in him, he will have to take a different approach to this House.
The fact is that this is not just about Mr Buttiglione, but now also about Mr Barroso himself.
I would ask you, Mr President, to see to it that Mr Barroso, when he receives these letters, also receives along with them the message that we expect a different attitude from the President-designate of the Commission.
