Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the topic that the Commission has again raised is an extremely important one, something that has been stressed several times over.
One point that I believe has to be given closer attention is that of the labelling of the drugs content of medicines, or of those medicines included in the list of doping substances.
This would certainly meet halfway the athletes, their trainers and their representatives and be helpful to them in their activities, quite simply because there would be more transparency about the issue.
Such an initiative would cost practically nothing, whilst also being a significant help.
Apart from that, I share the view of many Members that controls must simply be tightened up and made more universal, thereby enabling misuse to be better identified.
