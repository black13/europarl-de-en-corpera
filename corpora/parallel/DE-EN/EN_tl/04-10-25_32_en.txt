Mr President, in 1993, the European Parliament adopted a resolution commemorating the victims of National Socialism.
Last year, ten years after that event, an exhibition was also mounted on the subject in this House.
The German public, too, are outraged by the remarks attributed to Mr Gollnisch; perhaps we should call upon him and the not to claim that he did not say these things, but rather to make a statement in which he would clearly dissociate himself from historical nihilism, making explicit his condemnation of fascism, his acceptance that the Holocaust happened, and that the historical research available on the subject is factual.
I do believe that opposition to fascism, to anti-Semitism and to racism has always been one of this Houseâ€™s values, and one that we should continue to uphold in the future.
