Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with thanks – for the constructive cooperation and increased dialogue, for the building up of trust, which has been consistent and has met with success, and for your defence of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Mr Hans-Peter Martin has as yet been on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for only a short time, and this is the probable reason why he has not yet realised that there is a link between stable prices, low inflation, growth and employment.
I would also like to congratulate you on having helped to give a fixed place in the Constitution to price stability as a European goal and not just something for which the European Central Bank aims, and on the success of your policy of making the ECB more independent and a stronger and communicative player.
We do, of course, also have a few things for which to ask; one of them has to do with independence, that being that you should resist all the attempts by Finance ministers – and, it obviously has to be said, by the Hungarian Government – to extend their political influence over the ECB’s monetary policy and their personal influence over the national issuing banks.
I would also ask you to make yourself, to a greater extent, the prime communicator of the significance of monetary policy in terms of a strong euro, of low rates of inflation, of stable prices, of growth and employment and of the benefits to the economy.
We do know that the euro is worth more than the public think it is.
We urge you to champion the abolition of one- and two-cent coins and the introduction of one- and two-euro notes, and to ensure that transparency is not at odds with independence.
