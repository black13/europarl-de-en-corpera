Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Social Democrat Members of the European Parliament support the demand made by the workforce of General Motors’ European subsidiaries that no factories should be closed down and that no redundancies should be permitted.
What, then, lies behind this crisis?
It has been brought about by years, if not decades, of high-level mismanagement in the group.
There was no strategy capable of dealing with Europe, and perhaps the greatest error of all was that there was no strategy for the European internal market, no strategy for European consumers, and no strategy for making use of the knowledge, expertise and skills of the relevant companies’ workers.
What this very clearly shows is that a change of direction is needed here.
It has been said, and rightly, that industrial policy must be put back on the agenda for the European institutions.
A good way of doing this, we think, would be for us now to discuss how to combine General Motors’s subsidiaries in a European Company, but we also urge that the Commission should get more involved, and that we should enter into a dialogue on industrial policy with each sector, one that will facilitate the promotion of innovation in the various industries that are important to Europe.
We are only just beginning to get to grips with the future of European industrial policy.
When this House debates the European works councils, we will be reminding you of how important it is that workforces be allowed to speak and that they be involved.
I have no sympathy whatever with the Liberals and Conservatives who have prevented a joint resolution from emerging from this debate.
You, ladies and gentlemen, have some lessons to learn!
