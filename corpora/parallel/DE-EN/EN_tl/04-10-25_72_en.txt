Mr President, we Social Democrats advocate a single strategy for all GM’s sites in Europe.
In our concern for social responsibility, we always risk being pushed into a corner, and sometimes we allow that to happen, but there are points here that have to do with the economy in the traditional sense of the word.
Despite that, there are a number of mistakes on the part of the management to be added to the list, to which it had been alerted by the workers’ representatives on various occasions, one such mistake being the fact that, unlike Volkswagen and the Japanese, Opel does not sell its cars outside Europe, in the USA, for example.
I am not talking here about the top-of-the-range European models that are sold there.
A further mistake was that materials were bought in cheaply, with the resultant expense of remedial work at weekends.
New work patterns were introduced abruptly, and the group became over-centralised.
It is necessary to draw attention to these points, particularly now – and I very much agree with Mr Mann on this – that representatives of industry associations and the ideologues retained by them are hard at work dismantling the types of co-determination that we in Europe introduced as part of our social model, and pronouncing them unsuited to the modern world.
That being so, I agree with much of what you, Mr Mann, had to say, but why did your group, with its majority in this House, refuse to table a resolution?
Perhaps they did not want the substance of what you said to be adopted in this House this week.
That is a point that must be addressed head-on, for much of what you have said we Social Democrats can agree with.
It is only embarrassing that your party colleague in Bochum should raise the question of whether the crisis might have been resolved if the regional or local promoters of trade and industry had been able to do something different.
Those are narrow-minded answers – what we need now is something different!
