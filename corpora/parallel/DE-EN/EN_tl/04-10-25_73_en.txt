Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing new about this: the managers of businesses operating on a global scale always react to crises by laying off workers, but, instead of that, where management has made mistakes, it is those responsible who must be called to account!
If the crisis is a result of over-production and problems in accessing the market, it makes no economic sense whatever to give in to demands for wage cuts.
It is a good thing that the workforce are refusing to be no more than chess pieces for the global players who no longer take it as read that businesses have any responsibilities to society.
General Motors should remember Henry Ford’s dictum that ‘cars don’t buy cars’, whereby he justified doubling his workers’ wages in order to stimulate demand.
That is why we need a demand-led economic policy and, at the same time, a different structural policy.
The European Union has a number of instruments at its disposal, such as the Directives on collective redundancies and on European Works Councils, which are very important, but are, unfortunately, designed as corrective measures, shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.
What we need is preventive measures that do not leave everything to the market, all the more so if we want to take the Gothenburg agenda seriously and make development sustainable.
For that reason we welcome the Commission’s idea of setting up a working party.
This must, however, also involve a debate on the diversification of production and of services, if regions are not to become dependent on one sector.
More attention also needs to be given to research and innovation in the field of new products.
