I have just voted in favour of the report on the ECB, from which Mr Lipietz has removed his name.
I was opposed to all of the amendments that would have led to its being watered down.
The ECB has done a very good job: it has maintained price stability and always safeguarded its independence.
In so doing it has won the confidence of the public and thus overcome much opposition to the euro.
We have reason to thank the former President, Wim Duisenberg: Jean-Claude Trichet is continuing where he left off.
As the independence of the ECB’s Executive Board must be preserved, I think it would be wrong to publish the results of roll-call votes.
There is sufficient transparency because the public and Parliament are informed directly of its decisions on monetary policy.
The quarterly ‘monetary dialogue’ with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and our visits to Frankfurt deserve to be given wider public exposure.
The ECB’s commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact is exemplary.
It rightly points out that any patches of weak growth in the eurozone have not been caused by the Pact, which brings sustainable, inflation-free growth because of its insistence on sound budget management.
The ‘intelligent new interpretation’ being advocated by the EU Commission is an unintelligent manipulation of the principles of the Pact and gives tax evaders an improper alibi.
