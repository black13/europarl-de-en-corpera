Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Environment Committee is a committee with significant legislative powers, but it is also a committee with a very small budget, and the only financial instrument for the environment, the LIFE Programme, has had its funding cut yet again in the 2005 budget compared with 2004.
We are actually very thrifty.
Expenditure under the environment heading is not even 0.25% of the European budget, that is, less than a quarter of 1%.
In addition, it is our impression that the Environment DG has insufficient staff to implement the policies that we want.
The same applies, incidentally, to the Health and Consumer Protection DG.
And when we hear the word ‘health’ of course we all immediately think ‘tobacco’.
That is clear.
We spend more than EUR 950 million on subsidies to tobacco growers.
That is more than five and a half times as much as the entire environment budget.
However, we allocate only EUR 14 million to developing alternatives for tobacco growers.
This has to change!
