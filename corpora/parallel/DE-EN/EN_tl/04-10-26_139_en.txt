Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that this debate on the future of the European Union is happening today, for the future is always about money and where it is invested, and I believe that we are going the right way about investing in the Lisbon agenda, having allocated EUR 92 million to preparatory measures and pilot projects, and EUR 49 million to the financial environment, concentrating on the economic divide in the border regions.
I believe that it is the latest developments – the crisis in the motor industry, the rise in energy prices – that demonstrate the necessity of our gearing the European Budget up for growth, and appropriate communication also has a part to play in this.
Over the next five years, we will be devoting much attention to the theme of information policy.
We have to do a much better job of explaining Europe.
In the run-up to the elections, we could see that there were various elements strategically ganging up on the European Union and on democracy in Europe.
I believe that we have the task of explaining to the public what goes on in this place and how important Europe’s position in the world will be for us in the future.
It is for that reason, too, that we are committed to the infopoints, to the campaign for Europe’s future, to the Carrefours, to Prince, to all these important things, in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens and to explain it.
We all see the ‘Intelligent Energy for Europe’ programme as being very important too.
With energy prices in mind, I hope that we will add more in future.
In this House, we should even now be starting to get our technical infrastructure, whether it be information and communication technology or the Internet and television up to the very latest state of the art and trying to become the most modern parliament in the world.
