Commissioner, although I do of course agree with you that military operations are excluded from funding under the EU budget, my question relates to the police operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
According to reports I have received, there have been long delays in the arrival of equipment in the country, with six to eight months passing between the requirements being determined and the equipment actually arriving.
The European Union has decided that it wishes to provide itself with instruments to ensure that crises, especially those in neighbouring countries, are overcome rapidly.
Yet we are surely failing to achieve our aims if equipment arrives only when the crisis is already over.
I should therefore like to urge the Commission – perhaps jointly with this House – to re-examine this procedure.
