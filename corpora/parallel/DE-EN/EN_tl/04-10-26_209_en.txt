Mr Claeys, only a few days ago the Commission reported in detail on the situation in Turkey with regard to torture and ill-treatment, and I should therefore like to refer you to the Commission’s regular report published on 6 October 2004, which includes the outcome of the visit to which you referred.
During this visit, Commission representatives met representatives from five human rights organisations and from two organisations in the field of forensic medicine, as well as government representatives and representatives from the police, gendarmerie and judicial institutions.
The Commission came to the conclusion that further efforts had been made to step up measures against torture and ill-treatment, with the provisions of the new Penal Code playing an important role in this connection.
Custody procedures have been brought into line with European standards, although prison officers do not always inform detainees of their rights.
The authorities have announced a zero-tolerance policy against torture, and punishments have already been handed out to a large number of torturers.
The Commission emphasises that there continues to be a large number of cases of ill-treatment and presumably also of torture in Turkey, and that it is now a case of eradicating these practices entirely.
Further efforts must be made in this regard by the Turkish Government.
With regard to Turkey’s progress towards accession, the Commission stresses in its recommendation that reform processes and the fight against torture and ill-treatment, which are to be extended, must also be consolidated, and that the Commission will continue to monitor this process closely.
