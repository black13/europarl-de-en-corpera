Mr Claeys, the two questions you have asked are very different ones.
The answer to the first is a clear ‘yes’.
The Commission will continue to take all necessary measures, firstly to help Turkey in its fight against torture and ill-treatment, and secondly in order to monitor current developments.
Special missions will of course also be sent to Turkey in the event that this is necessary.
I should also like to make one further point; the sources to which you refer in your question, Mr Claeys, and which speak of systematic torture in Turkey, come from a political camp which you would not normally use as a reference source, and one which is diametrically opposed to your political position.
You would not normally associate yourself with views that come from this part of the political spectrum.
I am merely pointing this out for your information.
With regard to the second question, as a candidate country Turkey naturally undertakes to comply fully with the political criteria, as do all candidate countries.
Ensuring that this does in fact happen in future is regarded by the Commission as its most important task in relation to Turkey.
