Mr Czarnecki, one can, at present, do no more than speculate on this issue.
The Financial Perspective put forward by the Prodi Commission, which covers the period until 2013, does not earmark any funds for a potential accession by Turkey.
This means that it is impossible to comment on the way in which the potential costs of such an accession might be distributed.
There is no way in which detailed comments can be made on this issue at present, as Turkey cannot be expected to join the EU for another 12 to 15 years.
During this period both the European Union and Turkey will experience economic developments which are as yet unknown to us, the budget of the European Union may undergo far-reaching changes of which we are unaware, and expenditure on related policies may also change.
As a basic principle, it will be possible for any matters which require regulation to be regulated under the Accession Treaty, including matters relating to costs.
Turkeyâ€™s accession will not cost more than the Member States and the Community budget are prepared to spend at that point in time.
