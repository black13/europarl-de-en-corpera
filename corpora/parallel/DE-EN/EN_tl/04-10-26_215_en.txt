Mr Czarnecki, firstly I should like to extend my sincere thanks for the compliment.
As in the case of Poland, the elimination of regional disparities will of course also be an important factor if Turkey ever joins the EU.
At present, however, it is still entirely impossible to comment on the financial implications this will have.
I should merely like to point out that there is an upper ceiling for resource transfers into the new Member States, as well as into the old ones, which is set at 4% of gross national product.
This means that the transfer of unlimited quantities of money is impossible.
In fact this 4% ceiling has never been reached for the large Member States such as Spain, Italy or Poland, and it never will be.
It is therefore reasonably safe to assume that, when the time comes, it will not be a question of comparing Turkey with Estonia or Lithuania, but rather with Spain or Poland, and this means figures of a very different order.
