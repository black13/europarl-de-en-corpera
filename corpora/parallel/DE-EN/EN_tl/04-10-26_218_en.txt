Thank you, Commissioner.
Following the summer holidays I received a huge number of enquiries from people living in my electoral district relating to this issue, in particular with regard to the extremely slow progress of border controls at the borders between Bulgaria and Romania and between Bulgaria and Turkey, with such controls often being halted entirely for hours at a time and the delays lasting for up to twelve hours.
The issue of corruption was also raised in a great many of these complaints.
As these complaints have raised the specific issues of border controls and corruption, I should like to ask you for your views on both of these.
