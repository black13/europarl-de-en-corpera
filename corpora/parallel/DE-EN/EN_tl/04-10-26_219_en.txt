Mr Posselt, I am of course also aware of these complaints, and indeed some of the complaints we receive are probably the same.
The Commission looks into all of them.
As far as border controls are concerned, we are working with both countries to improve the system, albeit not always successfully, as is apparent, and in fact the programmes are not yet complete.
Overall, however, we believe that there has been an improvement.
With regard to corruption, you know that I have made very frequent reference to the issue in this House, and that all our progress reports call on Romania and Bulgaria to take firmer, more transparent and more decisive action in the fight against it.
Although there are signs of progress in both countries, overall I should like to make it clear that I am not yet satisfied with the progress made in the fight against corruption in either of them.
During the talks I held with both regions this stood at the top of the list of issues where the Commission expects to see significant improvements.
In any case, I should like to make it clear that, before any possible accession by Romania and Bulgaria, they need to have effective legislation and effective institutions in place to fight corruption.
