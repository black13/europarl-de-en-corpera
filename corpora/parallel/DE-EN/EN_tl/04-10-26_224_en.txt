.
Thank you, Mr Papastamkos, for your kind words of appreciation.
I should like to try once again to explain this in my own words.
There are three different programmes covering the north of Greece, including firstly those relating to cross-border cooperation with Bulgaria, a future Member State.
As soon as Bulgaria joins the EU, this programme will be discontinued and replaced by a normal INTERREG programme at the border between Bulgaria and Greece, as is usually the case between Member States.
This does not, however, mean that less money will be provided; it will merely be a different programme.
Greece also has a joint programme with the neighbouring countries of Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which are not yet candidate countries.
Provision has therefore been made here for another programme, and the Commission is planning to combine these instruments into a single Neighbourhood Programme in order to simplify matters.
This programme will run for the whole of the next Financial Perspective.
It is not my impression that a lower level of funding is to be expected at this border, indeed rather the opposite, in view of the high priority accorded to the Western Balkans in our strategic considerations.
Thirdly, programmes exist in relation to the border with the candidate country Turkey, and more funding will be made available for this border region as part of the intensive cooperation with Turkey, which is only in its initial stages.
Overall, it can be said that purely technical alterations will be made to certain aspects of the situation in the Greek border regions, but that there is no reason to expect that funding will be reduced; in fact, it is more likely that the opposite will be true.
