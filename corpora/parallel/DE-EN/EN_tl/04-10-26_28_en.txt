– Mr Barroso, I voted for you in July because I believe that you have the potential to be a good President of the Commission.
I also voted for you because you made three pledges, namely that there would be more women in this Commission – you have delivered on this; that there would not be any super-Commissioners – you have delivered on this too; and that you would remove Commissioners from their departments, take away their portfolios or discharge them entirely if they did not have the confidence of Parliament.
These pledges will once again determine how we vote tomorrow.
I would therefore ask you, Mr Barroso, to take this very seriously.
I am pleased that you wish to steer a very definite liberal economic course with your Commission.
I am also pleased that you are making human rights a matter for decision at the highest level, but Parliament is the assembly that represents the people of Europe.
Take the vote seriously; discharge Commissioners who do not have the confidence of Parliament!
That is right for Europe and right for democracy.
