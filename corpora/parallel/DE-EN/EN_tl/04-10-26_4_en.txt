Mr President, it is rather strange that we are being asked to approve this urgent procedure.
After all, just a few days ago the Commission made appropriate and indeed important amendments to the proposal on the Agency.
To make things simpler, the same can be said of the Councilâ€™s second request for urgent procedure concerning support for the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, because in both cases the Council and the Commission have only just tabled significant new proposals.
The committee will deal with these matters this evening, but in both cases and on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I should like to recommend that at this stage the request for urgent procedure be rejected.
