– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate at least shows that the European Parliament is becoming more political and has more political power than is apparent from the Treaties.
This is a further sign that, in terms of the way Europe works in practice, Parliament is often ahead of constitutional developments and it takes time for the Treaties to catch up.
That is why, Mr Barroso, the CDU-CSU Group – and I mean all of its 49 Members – want you to take office and want you to work closely with the European Parliament, more closely than is laid down in the Constitution.
Now the Socialists want to prevent you from taking office.
They are clearly prepared to trigger a full-blown European crisis, even though the Chairman of the Socialist Group has taken the precaution of explaining that it would not be a crisis but a normal parliamentary act.
The only problem is that it is so ‘normal’ that it has never happened before in Europe.
And why?
There is only one reason for this that will stick in the mind of the general public and that is the fact that a candidate for the post of Commissioner dared to express his religious convictions.
And, because this is what it is actually all about, I should like, once more, to make our position clear.
We are in fact under an obligation to respect the principle of non-discrimination.
The state has no right to poke its nose into such matters.
Nobody should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or their gender, either.
That is what is stated in the Charter and in the Constitution.
I thought this statement would have been greeted with applause; in any case, I can see heads nodding in agreement, and so I can tell you that what I just said was a quote.
I quoted word for word what Mr Buttiglione said in the hearing.
And that is what you are arguing about.
It is laughable, ladies and gentlemen!
