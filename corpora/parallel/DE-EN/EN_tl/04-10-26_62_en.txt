â€“ Madam President, we will not, tomorrow, be able to vote in favour of the new Commission as it currently stands; there are too many question marks for that.
There is one against the President, who unashamedly wishes to do as he pleases with this freely elected Parliament.
There is another against Mr Buttiglione, who has drawn public attention and disqualified himself from the post of Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs by making unspeakably discriminatory remarks, and there are many more.
I should like to single out Mrs Udre, the Latvian candidate.
She is quoted as saying that the European Union as a whole is superfluous.
At the hearing she praised improvements, but that is not enough.
This Commissioner of all people, who is to be responsible for customs duties and tax, is not so very particular about money.
The financing of her party is shrouded in mystery.
There is compelling evidence of dubious relations with the Russian oil industry, which transports a large proportion of its oil to the West via Latvia, greasing many palms on the way.
What the public expects of us is that we approve members of the Commission only if they are beyond reproach.
In this case it is personal integrity that is lacking, and, along with the other question marks, this is a further reason to reject the whole Commission.
