– Mr President of the Commission, you said that the Commissioner-designate Mr Buttiglione had been successful in one hearing and had failed in another.
I fear that this is a further example of your not listening carefully to Parliament, because the letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs also definitely contained critical remarks.
Personally, I very much regret the fact that Mr Buttiglione would not, or could not, take the opportunity of a second hearing in the Legal Affairs Committee, but he did clearly emphasise to that committee that his religious views were not in fact simply private views but principles that he wanted to guide his political actions.
He would want to assess proposals that ran counter to his personal convictions and proposals from other Commissioners on the basis of his private ideas.
Personally I am in no doubt that this goes beyond any definition of what private views are.
I should also like to say that I am still waiting for an apology for the attacks on the Commissioner-designate Mr Špidla.
