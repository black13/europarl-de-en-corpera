Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has become apparent in this House today that progress and change can result from democratic processes.
For the people who live in Belarus, such a thing is the stuff of dreams.
We cannot fail to see that the European Union is continuing to look on while a Stalinist and dictatorial system comes into being on its doorstep, with a long list of violations of democratic and human rights, and a roll of victims that gets ever longer, day after day.
Many people in Belarus resigned themselves to this long ago.
If they can, they leave the country.
There is no hope any more.
It was only by using methods of this sort that Lukashenko was able to secure power for himself.
I am very far from satisfied with the statement by the Council and the Commission, which really has nothing new to offer.
It is not true to say that a framework is in place; the fact of the matter is that there is only a piece of paper.
There is not really a change in attitude, with a specific concentration on the situation in Belarus and consideration of which measures are feasible in order to support the opposition and civil society in that country.
None of the actual instruments make that possible; they must be changed.
That must go on the agenda now, for it is now that it is urgent, and not at some undefined time.
Let me take this opportunity to remind the House of Mr Marset Camposâ€™ report on its behalf, which said in plain language what is now to be done.
Only if Belarus is democratic can we ensure our own security.
For that reason, I believe that we should be backing a democratic Belarus rather than playing the Russian card.
