Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Verheugen that, in contrast to the situation in the neighbouring country of Belarus, the presidential elections in Ukraine will involve a genuinely exciting neck-and-neck race between two strong personalities.
It really is a decision for the Ukrainian people.
Yet, as many other Members of this House have noted before me, we await this weekend and this electoral process with concern, as it is becoming apparent that the campaign is being fought on unfair terms, and with no holds barred.
President Kuchma is cracking the whip for his preferred candidate, and forcing state officials and television channels into line to support him.
We support Mr Wiersma in his call for an end to be put to this and for a fair electoral process to be given a chance.
I concur with the Presidency’s demands and share its regret that local election observers could not be deployed, as during the last elections this proved to be a key factor in ensuring that the public viewed the elections as democratic.
An extremely high turnout has made clear the country’s potential as a democracy , and it is therefore crucial that measures are taken to prevent any undesirable developments, as well as to ensure that these elections are conducted in a genuinely democratic fashion.
I have confidence in the people of Ukraine, but I also call on the Presidency and the Commission to ensure that support for democratic structures and, above all, for civil society is accorded a central role in the action plan, and is given higher priority than economic development, as the development of democracy in Ukraine still stands on shaky ground, and must be consolidated.
