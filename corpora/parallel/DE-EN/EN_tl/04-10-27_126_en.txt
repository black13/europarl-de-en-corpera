Mr President, Commissioner, Ukraine plays an enormously important role for the EU’s Member States.
It has a common border with three of them, which of course gives rise to social and economic links, and, when overall relations with it are considered, it also wields powerful influence.
In addition, it plays a significant role in relation to Moldova, a country where Ukraine’s involvement is necessary.
Having spent six years of my life in Ukraine and having known the country for over 30 years, I can tell you that it is currently following a path which leads quite clearly to democracy.
We should be rather more restrained in our demands for tremendous speed and transformation, as some things simply take time.
As previous speakers have observed, it is of course the case that some doubts always remain; for example, Russia’s support for a certain candidate can be said to present a problem.
Yet a problem is also presented by Mr Blair’s support for Mr Bush in the USA.
It is nothing new for there to be talk of checking certain votes cast by voters living abroad; indeed, a large number of Americans are allowed to vote in Germany.
It is always assumed in advance that there is an enormous risk that the democratic rules of play will not be adhered to in certain countries, whereas no such assumptions are made in the case of others.
We are all aware as well that in the last presidential elections in Florida there were heated disputes over popular votes.
We should have confidence in Ukraine.
