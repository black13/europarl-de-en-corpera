Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your detailed answer.
I have just one additional question; you referred to monitoring, which, if I understood you correctly, will be carried out primarily by the Association Council.
My question, prompted by specific inquiries from the people who live in my electoral district in Munich, is whether the public can address specific complaints relating to delays or corruption to the Council or the Association Council directly, and, if not, which body is responsible for accepting such complaints, which could subsequently be dealt with as part of the monitoring process?
