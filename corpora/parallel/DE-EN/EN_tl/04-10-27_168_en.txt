Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that this issue is dealt with better in Turkeyâ€™s legislation than in that of some Member States.
Firstly, I should be interested to know which Member States you have in mind.
Secondly, I should like to ask what you mean by this statement; that religious communities have no legal status in Turkey, or that Islam, the majority religion, is organised in Turkey by the state, or that no head coverings may be worn for religious reasons?
What did you mean to say was better regulated in Turkey?
