Mr President, this is a decisive moment for the European Union, for Parliament, and for its relations with the Commission.
Our group has had a consultation, but in order that all those who wish to speak may do so – not everyone has been invited to – we should meet this concern, as we want the decision we take when we reassemble to be taken on as broad a basis as possible.
I therefore support the request for the sitting to be suspended now.
