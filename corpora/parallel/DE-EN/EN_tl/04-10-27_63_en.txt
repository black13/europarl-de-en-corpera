And so, Mr President, I ask you to listen to this House in future.
If you listen carefully, you will get a large majority for a Commission.
That is something you need to know.
As Mr Poettering discovered today, the strongest group does not always add up to a majority in this House.
This is a democratic learning process, one that we have all been fortunate to be able to undergo in these days.
