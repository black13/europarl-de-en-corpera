Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, poverty has a face; we have already seen that it is that of a woman.
Poverty hits single parents, above all women with children, especially hard.
Our society may well talk about children being its wealth, but the end result is poverty for the people who have many of them.
This is indeed scandalous, and I believe that the Commission, in the Lisbon process and elsewhere, must do much more.
There is a need for more employment for women, and it must be one of the EU’s most especial concerns to do more about childcare, in order to improve the situation as regards education and childcare.
We know too that older women are particularly affected.
The removal of discrimination against women in private pension provision represented one small step in the right direction, but, here too, there still remains much more to be done.
There are far too few indicators at European level to facilitate progress in the battle against poverty among women, and too little account is taken of the issue when making policy.
The Commission needs to take another great leap forward in order that more account may be taken of women’s issues, of equality for women, in the EU’s policy areas.
There are too few statistics to really back that up.
I hope that the Commission will keep to its timetable for the Gender Institute and that there will be no further delays.
As the Council has emphasised, we need the Gender Institute, not only to collate these statistics, but also, perhaps, to derive conclusions from them.
Let me finally mention one point that has not been made so far, namely women and the environment.
We know that the destruction of the environment increases the risk of poverty, particularly in what we call the Third World.
It follows that sustainable development must continue to be at the top of the list of priorities on the agenda.
