Mr President, I am delighted that this is not the last time that we will have the Commissioner with us, as yesterday, in a roundabout way, we extended her contract of employment.
As I understand it, this is an oral question rather than a speech, and so I will try to keep it very brief.
As you know, this question deals with the environmental effects on whales of underwater sonar systems, military and civilian equipment that has quite considerable effects on the auditory system of whales.
We have, most regrettably, had indications from experts that whales are dying in vast numbers, something that has not started only recently, but has been going on for some time.
What we would like the Commission to tell us is whether it has been informed of new studies and whether these have been sufficiently publicised.
We would very much like to know whether it is aware that the United States has already dismantled stationary sonar systems of this kind.
Is it aware that new technologies capable of performing these functions have been in existence for some time?
We see here the potential for innovation under the Lisbon strategy.
We do not want to scrap any ships, but we do want our friends in the defence sector to continue to be able to travel under water in an orderly fashion, rather than, as is unfortunately the present case, in some confusion and disarray.
This is an opportunity for innovation; is the Commission willing to take action in this area even outside the European Union?
