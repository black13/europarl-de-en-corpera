Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset that I find it very regrettable that this House has not made use of one of the options available to us.
It is a fact that the European Parliament is not just responsible for the protection of the environment, but also for security and defence matters, on the latter of which we have set up a sub-committee.
I believe that any resolution adopted by us would carry much more weight if it took full account of these aspects.
I would say that it is extraordinarily important that we should find a solution, and that whales and dolphins have to be protected.
About this, I believe there is broad agreement in this House as a whole, but there is, on the other hand, the question of what is the best course of action.
I do not know whether it is realistic to call for a moratorium, for the continued use of these devices to some extent will continue to be necessary for security and other reasons.
For that reason, I believe it would be more realistic to seek first a suitable geographical limit and come to an agreement that these devices should no longer be used in places where whales and dolphins have died in particularly large numbers.
For that reason, I very much commend the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party.
There is yet another aspect to this, in that a preparatory programme for safety research is currently under discussion – it features in the Budget debates, Commissioner Schreyer – and it is to be introduced and funded by the European Union.
As I see it, the issue of substitutes for sonars, or that of other methods for protecting whales, should be dealt with under the heading of this programme.
