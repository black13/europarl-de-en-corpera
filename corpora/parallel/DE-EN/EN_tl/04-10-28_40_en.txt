.
Let me just briefly observe that the Commission supports this undertaking to stop the loss of biodiversity by 2010.
The second thing I want to say is that, if the Commission is to make effective recommendations, it needs sound scientific results, and that is why the study is so very important.
It will soon be available, and it goes without saying that you will have the results and proposals.
My third point is that I will bring this resolution to the attention of my successor as the Commissioner responsible for safety research, as I believe it to be very important to make full use of the options available to us in this area of research.
