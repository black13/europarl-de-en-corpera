Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transfer of responsibility for the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina from NATO to the European Union is a very important step on the road towards a European defence identity.
This operation follows on from those in Macedonia and in the Congo; it is the third of its kind and also the biggest, involving 7 000 men and women, so it is much bigger than anything of which we have prior experience.
What are we in this House now to do?
Our task is to exercise democratic control, although, at this stage, I would prefer to speak of parliamentary guidance.
There are, however, certain questions we must ask.
Is the leadership structure the right one, and is it capable of doing the job?
Will it stand the strain even in times of crisis?
What about the equipment and weapons of the soldiers who are being sent there – are they mutually compatible?
Do they meet the requirements?
It will also be very important to see how cooperation with NATO works in the aftermath of the ‘Berlin Plus’ negotiations, and particularly – in what is a speciality of the European Union and its security strategy – how well the civilian and military sides of this crisis management operation work together.
We also regard the issue of how this operation is funded as most especially important.
Time and again, we have cause for concern about the emergence of shadow budgets capable of being monitored neither by the 25 national parliaments nor by the European Parliament.
It is for that reason that the resolution we will be adopting includes the demand that the expenses incurred in this operation should – insofar as this is possible at this stage in the Constitution’s development – be borne by the European Budget.
