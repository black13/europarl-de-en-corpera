Mr President, speaking on behalf of my group, I would like to highlight the very fortunate fact that we all agree on how important it is, not only for the European Union, but also for Bosnia, that we have taken over this mandate.
If it should turn out to be the case that this is the keystone to which you, Mr Nicolaï, referred, I would like us to take another step forward, politically speaking, by expressly calling on the Bosnian Government to invite us to undertake this mission.
We have every basis in law for doing this, provided by SFOR, that is, by the military intervention that made this advance, this stabilisation, possible after ten years.
As we talk about how we see Bosnia’s future prospects in Europe, should we not strive to achieve what we achieved in Macedonia, with the Government asking us to be present in this window of transition?
I believe that would be a triumph.
Having concluded what is known as a SOFA – a status of forces agreement – with other states that have asked us for help, why should we not conclude one with Bosnia and Herzegovina too?
Secondly, we need these regular reports, and I hope that we will, tomorrow, make that a binding requirement.
This House is committed, for we have all been committed for years.
We are talking not only in terms of military intervention.
Next year will see the tenth anniversary of the attack on Srebrenica, and the anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, and I believe we are obliged to make this clear.
I hope that we will do as Commissioner Patten wishes and give close attention to Bosnia’s future.
