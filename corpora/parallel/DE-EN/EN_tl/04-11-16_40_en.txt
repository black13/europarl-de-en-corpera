Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too would like to take this opportunity to bid you farewell and thank you most warmly for your cooperation over all these years.
You have dedicated yourself in particular to the Western Balkans, where I would have preferred there to have been no need, ten years on from the wars in the Balkans, for the EU to mount further military backup operations.
As Mr Solana once said, though many years ago, this is a front with which we will have to deal for some time to come, and it is in Europe, on our own doorstep.
It is closer to us than other crisis regions, whether Sudan or the Côte d’Ivoire, regrettable though all of them are, and notwithstanding our responsibilities for all of them.
ALTHEA, though, is more than these; it is a test case for the EU’s visible role in Bosnia and Herzegovina, now that it is, for the first time, taking over duties from NATO.
The mission is part of a coordinated and coherent approach including also the Stabilisation and Association Process, which will, I hope, make further progress in view of the disconcerting fact that 16 points are still outstanding.
Although Bosnia and Herzegovina needs the European perspective, which ALTHEA is meant to help secure for them, what is essential is that there should be a clear line of command avoiding needless duplication between NATO and ALTHEA and making it as clear as possible who is giving orders to whom.
Cooperation between ALTHEA and NATO is therefore also being put to the test.
It is regrettable that financial provision is being made outside the normal EU Budget, and so the European Parliament is not as involved as it should be.
All these things considered, I welcome the report and assure you that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of it.
