Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we want a better future, we do well constantly to recall the past.
Not that long ago, the headlines were full of expulsions, murder and ethnic cleansing in the Western Balkans, in the heart of Europe, while the EU, as if paralysed, was incapable of taking any effective action to prevent these things.
Painful the memory of Srebrenica, Mostar or of Banja Luka may be, but it is right to remember them; the former military presence under NATO command may have brought Bosnia and Herzegovina a certain stability, but we need to be aware of how fragile that stability is.
It is a good thing that with this, its first major joint military mission with an extended mandate, the EU is taking on far greater responsibility in this part of Europe, and aiming in the long term to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina can be stable, at peace, multi-ethnic, and capable of cooperating at regional and international level.
It will be a further touchstone for Europe, and also for the decisions in this area that will very probably have to be taken next year and will also affect Kosovo.
I would also, however, urge this House to include support of this kind in the Financial Perspective, as well as making provision for economic development and expenses.
