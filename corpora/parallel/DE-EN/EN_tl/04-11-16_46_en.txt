Mr President-in-Office of the Council, not only did I make a speech, I also asked two questions.
I asked you in what way soldiers have been prepared for this difficult task, particularly with regard to trafficking in women and forced prostitution, and I asked you how and where soldiers are sentenced or called to account, should the need arise.
Secondly, I asked you whether you are considering phasing out the name ALTHEA, which is a terrible word and has caused problems in the region.
These were two important questions, and I should like to receive an answer.
