Mr President, the work of the European Agency for Reconstruction – which was meant to be called the European Agency for Reconstruction and Development, but which is still called the European Agency for Reconstruction – has to date been mainly focused on Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro.
It has now been assigned an important new task, namely that of managing the financial instrument for north Cyprus.
There can be no question that the Agency has efficiently performed the tasks involved in its former mandates, and I am sure that the same will be true of its activities in north Cyprus.
As in the previous cases, however, it is also important with regard to Northern Cyprus that the Commission present a report on the future of the Agency after 31 December 2006 to the European Parliament and the Council by June 2005.
South-Eastern Europe and the Agency’s future tasks are of too great an importance for the EU to allow the future of the European Agency for Reconstruction to remain unclear.
The relationship between the Agency and what are termed the ‘deconcentrated’ Commission delegations must also be clarified in order to prevent a lack of activity or the duplication of work.
The report should of course also cover the implementation of the 2005-2006 multi-annual CARDS programme for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, something which is not yet the case.
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore endorses the proposal to extend the Council Regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction.
