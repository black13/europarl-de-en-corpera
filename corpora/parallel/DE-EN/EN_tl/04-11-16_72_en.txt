Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to start by echoing previous speakers in extending particular thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mrs Rothe and Mr Samuelsen, as well as to Mr Patten and Mr Nicolaï, for their speeches today.
I believe that it is crucial to convince the government of Southern Cyprus that the European Union must deliver on the promises it has made to the north of the island.
Our goal must therefore be to authorise both trade and aid together; if necessary, however, and if there is no alternative, the two aspects should be dealt with separately, so that an end is put to the isolation suffered by the north of the island.
I would also like to take this occasion to call on the government of Southern Cyprus and the Cypriot Members of this House to state clearly, once and for all, whether they genuinely wish to help the north of the island, or whether they will keep seizing every opportunity to throw a spanner in the works.
I am delighted that the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Karamanlis, has recently expressed his firm support for Kofi Annan’s Cyprus plan.
The end of this debate has made one thing clear to me.
It is my belief that the people in the south of the island who were in favour of Kofi Annan’s plan have no representative in this House.
I have therefore decided that the role I will play in this debate will be that of a representative of the people in the Greek part of Cyprus who voted for Kofi Annan’s plan.
It is particularly in view of my Turkish origin that I should like to act as a voice for these people.
I hope that we will take this opportunity to do everything in our power to bring about reunification.
