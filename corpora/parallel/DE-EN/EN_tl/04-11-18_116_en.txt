Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Eritrea is escalating by the day.
Painful as it is to say so, the reports we are receiving are getting increasingly alarming and increasingly tragic.
No longer is the opposition merely being persecuted; its members are being locked up.
Young conscientious objectors are being locked up, threatened with death, and – or so it is reported – even shot in large numbers.
There is no longer such a thing as freedom of the press in Eritrea, where independent newspapers have been closed down.
The country is fifth to last in the world press freedom ranking drawn up by Reporters without Borders.
It is not only international protest which is now needed in Eritrea, but dialogue with civil society within the country itself, as the only way in which a peaceful coexistence can and will be re-established in the country is by sitting all the participants down at one table and endeavouring to reopen the channels of dialogue.
The situation is tragic in the extreme, and I would ask you all to vote in favour of our motion for a resolution.
