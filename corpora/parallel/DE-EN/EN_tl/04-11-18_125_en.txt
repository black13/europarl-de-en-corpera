Mr President, we propose the inclusion in this resolution of item 20 of the excellent report tabled yesterday by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on the lifting of the arms embargo on China.
If you will allow me, I would like to read out the text of this item; ‘calls on the Council and the Member States to maintain the EU embargo on trade in arms with the People’s Republic of China and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arms sales; considers that this embargo should be maintained until such time as the EU has adopted a legally binding Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and the People’s Republic of China has taken concrete steps towards improving the human rights situation in that country, inter alia by ratifying the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and by fully respecting the rights of minorities’.
That is the original wording, which met with general approval, and so we propose that it be included at this point.
