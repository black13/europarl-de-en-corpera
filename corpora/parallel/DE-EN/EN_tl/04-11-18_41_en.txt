Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement on my own behalf and on behalf of my group.
Mr Farage’s assertion is unworthy of this European Parliament.
At no time has Mr Barrot ever committed a criminal offence – at no time whatever!
Although Mr Barrot belongs to another institution, I have known him for many years, and so I take this opportunity to say, on behalf of our group, that Mr Barrot is an extraordinary person; he is honourable, he is credible, and we have complete confidence in him.
Mr President, I ask that it be investigated whether the insulting utterances that Mr Farage has come out with in this debate, could result in prosecution under criminal law.
I most firmly repudiate these utterances and wish to express our wholehearted confidence in Mr Barrot.
