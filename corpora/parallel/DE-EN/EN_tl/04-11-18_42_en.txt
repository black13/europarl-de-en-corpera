Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Poettering has just said is true of my own group as well.
We have been forthrightly critical of some candidates, but the critical onslaught that is customary in political debates must never result in peopleâ€™s integrity being damaged, or in their being condemned in advance.
So let me say, right now and very clearly, that, no matter what criticisms we have had to make in this matter, there can be no doubt about the human and personal integrity of the candidates.
I want Mr Barrot to know that, even though he is from a political family other than our own, his political integrity, in particular, is beyond any doubt.
I absolutely endorse what the honourable Member said, and would say that what has been said about the English Member applies likewise to Mr Le Pen.
