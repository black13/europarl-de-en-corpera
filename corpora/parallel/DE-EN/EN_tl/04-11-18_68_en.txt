I have just voted in favour of the new Commission.
I have confidence in Mr Barroso as a good conductor for an orchestra that has yet to tune up.
He will master scores of different levels of difficulty, including the one that Parliament has offered him today.
I would have liked the Hungarians to display a great deal of sensitivity.
Mr Kovács should not have been a candidate for a second time, and not only because of his Communist mindset.
Whether his abilities, which were not up to coping with energy issues, will be adequate for the tax portfolio remains to be seen.
Mrs Kroes from the Netherlands is likely to become the Commission’s specialist for discord.
She lacks the independence that competition issues demand, and so the current Presidency of the Council ought to have withdrawn her.
I take a rather unsympathetic view of the withdrawal of Mr Buttiglione, whose high level of expertise would have enriched the whole Commission.
Many members of the public would have liked to see him – perhaps in another position – as an interpreter, even though not all of them share his views.
Europe must remain a platform for the free expression of opinions, the free practice of religion, and for cultural pluralism.
Mr Buttiglione, a former Member of this House, repeatedly affirmed his adherence to European values and undertook to abide by the law as it stands.
I hope that future Commissioners nominated by the Member States will, without exception, be qualified for the job, with it then being left to the President of the Commission to make his own choice from among a number of talented actors.
