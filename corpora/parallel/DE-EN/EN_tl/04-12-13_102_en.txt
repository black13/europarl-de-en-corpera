Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 and 2002 the Heads of State or Government entered into an international commitment to Turkey, which they must honour on 17 December.
The negotiations must begin, not only to sustain the reform process in Turkey but also for the sake of the international credibility of the European Union.
It will not, however, be a day of great rejoicing.
For the first time in the history of the European Union, there is widespread public opposition to the accession of a state.
People are not convinced that Turkey can become a truly European country.
In the parliamentary debate too, whenever I hear anyone cite one of the benefits of Turkish membership, it is saddled with far more ifs and buts than are normally raised in connection with such a momentous decision.
Moreover, no convincing argument has been advanced to demonstrate that Turkey would strengthen rather than weaken the cohesion of Europe.
Some see Turkish accession as part of a global strategy to combat terrorism.
The intention is to turn the collision of two cultures to advantage, but this bold strategic design underestimates not only Europe’s own powers but those of Turkey too.
There is certainly one role that Turkey could never perform as a Member State of the EU: it could never be a bridge to the Middle East.
It must be a pillar of the West in the Middle East; as a member of the EU, it would be a party to negotiations, not a mediator.
One thing must be quite clear: if Turkish membership were to erode the European Union, that would be too high a price to pay – and not only for the Union, by the way, but for Turkey too.
That price must not be paid.
On 17 December, the European Council should lay down with unmistakable clarity that the decisive criteria will be not only Turkey’s readiness for membership but also the capacity of the Union to accommodate Turkey and preservation of the momentum of the European integration process.
