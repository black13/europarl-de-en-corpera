We are on the verge of an extremely important decision, not only in terms of its impact on all of Europe but also, in this age of globalisation, in its effects on the political map of the world.
Shall we have the intellectual and moral strength to take the decision on the opening of negotiations calmly, boldly and in accordance with the dictates of political logic?
Opponents of the report have once again been trying to restart the discussion on new terms, some of which are based on falsehoods, raising many of the hurdles that have already been cleared and adding many more.
Let me emphasise that I must respect the views of those among us who do not wish to support the opening of negotiations on Turkish accession, but I cannot accept any arguments that are completely divorced from reality or any allegations of the type that have been made over the past weekend by various German Conservatives.
The assertion that Turkey would import terrorism and gangsterism is libellous and an insult to our NATO ally.
The debate must not be dragged down to that level.
Since 1963, the Community and Brussels have acknowledged that Turkey is part of Europe, and in December 2002 the European Union pledged itself to begin negotiations with Turkey once the latter had fulfilled the stipulated criteria.
The credibility of the European Union is at stake.
Political honesty means abiding by agreements and keeping promises.
The scope and impact of the reforms that are currently being enacted in Turkey are unprecedented in recent centuries.
Democracy there is more stable than it has ever been.
The country is registering high economic growth rates.
Turkey will always stand guarantor for the security of the whole of Europe.
A European Turkey will serve as a shining example for the entire Islamic world and hence for numerous crisis-torn regions too.
Turkey ...
