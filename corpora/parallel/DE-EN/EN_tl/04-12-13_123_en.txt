Mr President, the Eurlings report is a rare phenomenon in this House, in that it catalogues the violations of human rights, minority rights and ethnic rights that have taken place within a particular country.
The main issues are torture, religious freedom, women’s rights, the constitution and the occupation of part of the European Union or, to be more precise, part of a Member State of the European Union, as well as the question of the Armenians and freedom of expression.
The conclusion that has been drawn – mistakenly, in my opinion – from this catalogue of violations is that negotiations should be launched, as many of my honourable colleagues have pointed out.
A few years ago, negotiations with Slovakia were suspended for far, far less, and now compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is being presented as an optional extra for the future with no hard and fast statement of the Union’s position.
Turkey’s democratisation efforts must be supported, but surely their success does not depend on membership of the European Union but rather on a policy of good neighbourly relations and fruitful partnership.
Two thirds of the European population are opposed to the opening of accession negotiations and to Turkish membership of the European Union.
In some countries, such as Austria, France and Germany, this opposition exceeds 70%.
This raises the question why the Commission, many parliamentarians, the Council and numerous Member States are pursuing policies that go against the clearly declared interests, opinions and wishes of the people.
Such action is politically incomprehensible and utterly short-sighted, because it creates enormous difficulties with regard to public opinion as well as jeopardising the future prospects of the European Union.
I am in favour of a privileged partnership, not Turkish membership of the Union.
