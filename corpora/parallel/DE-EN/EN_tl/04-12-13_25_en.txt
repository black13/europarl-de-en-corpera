Mr President, while working in my electoral district at the weekend, I was told that, following a court ruling in Iran, another woman is expected to be stoned to death in three weeks’ time.
As this information came too late for a motion for urgent procedure, I would now ask the House to examine this case and, if need be, to take action against Iran.
I do not believe that this House, let alone the European Union, can tolerate actions of this kind on the part of states.
I therefore ask you, as a matter of urgency, to determine whether a young woman is indeed expecting to be stoned to death in Iran in three weeks’ time, and to intervene in so far as you are able should this prove to be the case.
