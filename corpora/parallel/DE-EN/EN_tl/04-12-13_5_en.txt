If I might put it quite briefly, Mrs Frassoni, we are not, this week, voting on Romania’s accession, but on the report, which has a number of favourable things to say, and a number of negative ones too.
We believe that we have to show Romania – right now, at a time when things are at a critical point – the way it has to go in the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years if it is to be able to accede.
That is why we are in favour of the debate and, ultimately, the vote on Romania happening this week.
So, speaking on behalf of my group, I want to express opposition to this contribution being deferred.
