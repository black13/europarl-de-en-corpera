Mr President, Mr Poettering’s phrase about his concern that this enlargement might prove fatal penetrates today’s debate with the clarity of a laser beam.
There are indeed eventful times in store for Europe, and yet we in this House must ask whether the EU is even ready to embark on the enterprise that we are planning.
Are our institutions ready?
Do we have a constitution worthy of the name?
As things stand, Nice is the .
What is the financial position?
Where is the financial perspective?
What has become of the British rebate?
Where is the willingness for real solidarity?
To look at it in economic terms, day by day, we see tax dumping, wage dumping and environmental dumping everywhere we look.
The reality is that the EU has gone stiff.
If we ask who, at this stage, would benefit from Turkey’s accession, or from negotiations towards that end, the answer is that it would be the ones who do not want what many of us in this House were actually originally working towards, and who seek to weaken the EU.
What we will end up with is the ‘United Nations of Europe’.
That is what we already have at global level, and it no longer has much at all to do with the EU.
The USA and its satellites would benefit, the military-industrial complex would benefit, the big investors would benefit, and this at a time when we are dealing with the greatest peacetime redistribution of wealth in human history.
To those who say that there is no more to be done and that it is too late, I say, ‘better a terrible end than unending terror.’
So, for Europe’s sake, say ‘no’ to these negotiations, or else Europe will be heading for the abyss!
