Mr President, Mr Toubon has asked what sort of Europe we want.
Those who want an integrated Europe, the Europe envisaged in the Constitutional Treaty, cannot accept Turkey as a full member.
Turkey is an important partner, and we want it to remain one in future, but in a privileged partnership and not as a full member of the EU.
Turkey claims that it has been promised full membership for the past forty-one years.
That is not the case.
The 1963 Ankara Agreement had a customs union as its objective; one was promised, and it has been in place for nine years.
Even before accession negotiations have been set in motion, Turkey is now demanding of us full membership without any ifs or buts.
That is extortion.
That may be how you do politics in Turkey, but it is not how it is done in the EU.
The Copenhagen criteria apply to all candidates for accession.
The major problems Turkey has with democracy, freedom of opinion, human rights, the rights of minorities, with its neighbours in Armenia and Cyprus, and with the Kurds, have caused it to be decided that Turkey must fulfil the political criteria before negotiations can start.
There is no doubt that, even today, these conditions have not yet been met.
The Commission says so too.
Why it is that negotiations are to be opened despite that is a secret known only to the Council and to the Commission.
We do not want full membership, but a privileged partnership with a special status that both parties – the EU and Turkey – can cope with.
If accession negotiations are opened even though they go against our better judgment, they must be open-ended and capable of resulting in an alternative outcome in line with what we want.
To offer such a thing to Turkey is honest, sensible, politically far-sighted and forward-looking.
Turkey is not a European country and will not become one; that is why the demands of Europe’s and Turkey’s future together are best met by a privileged partnership.
