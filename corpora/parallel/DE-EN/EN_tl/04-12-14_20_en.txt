Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the economic policy guidelines for the European Unionâ€™s strategy are laid down in the Constitutional Treaty.
Let me cite three examples from Part III: Article 177/78, which lays down the principle of an open market economy with free competition; Article 147/48 which downgrades services of public general interest guaranteed by individual states; and Article 203, which makes employment policy subordinate to economic policy.
The result of this is merciless competition to undercut in social terms, in environmental terms, and as regards protection in the workplace.
Everything the Commission does is done according to the same blueprint; you ask for a navigation system, but you already have one, in the shape of the directive on services, the directive on ports, and the third railway package.
If you really want advice as to how the European Commission should set its navigation system, then I can give you some in very brief terms: do it socially rather than taking a radically free-market approach!
