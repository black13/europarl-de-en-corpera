Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the strategic planning guidelines must also cover the area of the common agricultural policy, for the Luxemburg Council decisions also apply to this area.
A comprehensive reform of the common agricultural policy was decided on in June 2003, and this reform, which has yet to be implemented in some Member States, has brought with it profound change; it has resulted in many discussions and much insecurity and continues to do so.
The next big step that is due will be the reform of the sugar market regime, but after that there must again be some inactivity; without that, we will not be able to offer our farmers the security to plan ahead.
This must also be clearly stated in the strategic planning.
Agriculture needs periods with which it can calculate, and policy must also offer a degree of certainty if it is to have any credibility.
As regards the Financial Perspective for 2010 to 2013, Mr President of the Commission, we have to be clear in our own minds about what we want from this Europe of ours.
An enlarged Europe makes a balanced cohesion and structural policy more important than ever as a means of counteracting structural differences.
The forthcoming rural development has to do with the overall funding of the second pillar and hence with the maintenance of active and attractive rural areas, which cannot exist without working farmers.
So it is that modulation is the source of some of the money for the second pillar.
We are also concerned about our regions, their villages and towns.
Europe needs clear objectives and strategies.
The public also expect us to offer practical solutions to the thorny questions relating to immigration, asylum and security.
When all these issues have been addressed, we will also have to budget for them.
To do otherwise would be scarcely credible and will not bring us any closer to the peoples of Europe.
