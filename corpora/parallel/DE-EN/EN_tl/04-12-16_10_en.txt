Mr President, Commissioner, if we are to believe what the Council says about this European Union of ours wanting to encourage sustainable development, and if we look at the reality of where this could be done and the way in which the Council goes about doing it in practice, we see that the Member States really cannot summon up the will to do it.
Yet again, animals have lost out when there is a choice to be made between protecting them or the profits of the firms that fatten them up.
I will nonetheless concede that the Commission has made an effort, and I will not deny that a number of changes have been made for the better, but the underlying principle has remained the same as it was before.
There are those of you in the Council who have decided not to have a limit on transport times for animals and that the permitted density should not be specified, and I am absolutely convinced that you would be quick to introduce other rules if your domestic pets were to be transported the length and breadth of Europe.
If we want to defend the right to life and the rights of animals, then we need to approach this from a different angle.
The introduction of the GSP satellite navigation system does, of course, achieve something; it means that checks can be better carried out.
There is no disputing that.
Likewise, if it is ensured that the animals are given water and improved ventilation, that is of course a small advance, but it does not solve the problem.
If you want regional development, this is a real opportunity to demonstrate it, for you can raise animals, fatten them up, and process them on the spot or within the local area without having to organise these transports from one end of the European Union to the other.
I really cannot understand how Mr Maat can describe this as tremendous progress.
I cannot see it as such.
It patches things up, without doing anything to deal with the main problems and remove the main causes of the torment these animals undergo.
