Just two brief points, Mr President, the first of which has to do with the vote on Turkey.
During the vote on Turkey – on the Eurlings report – I voted in favour of Mr Langen’s Amendment No 16.
That has not, however, been recorded; perhaps the machine was not working.
I would ask you to correct that.
Secondly, we voted yesterday on the EU-Russia summit.
In so doing, we said that all sectors of Chechen society should be integrated into the peace process.
I have learned today that the family of President Maskhadov, whose election took place under OSCE supervision, has been abducted and interned by the Russian secret services.
They include his siblings, who are between 69 and 75 years of age.
I would ask that you have this information verified and, if it proves to be accurate, protest to the Russian authorities about this.
