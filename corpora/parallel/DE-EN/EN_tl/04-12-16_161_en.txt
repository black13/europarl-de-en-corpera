Mr President, I would like to raise another point of order.
Yesterday, we were voting until 2 p.m.
It has in fact always been the custom of this House to vote between noon and 1.30 p.m., because we do of course have a lot of lunchtime commitments and we end up keeping our guests waiting.
I would therefore ask the Bureau to make it a rule – as it was in the previous legislative period – that voting ends at 1.30 p.m.
I would also like to take the opportunity to wish all those present in the Chamber a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
