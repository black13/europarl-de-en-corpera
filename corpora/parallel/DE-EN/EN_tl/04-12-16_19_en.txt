Mr President, the Commissioner spoke of the emotions that are present in this House.
That this should be so certainly has to do with the subject matter, but also with the fact that what we are dealing with here is a never-ending story.
This is not the first time, not the second, and not even the third, but perhaps the umpteenth time that we have had to give this our attention.
For well over ten years, we have sought to make improvements in this area, and there has always been talk of progress, but the crucial progress has not materialised.
We will, I believe, achieve a real breakthrough only when this House acquires the right of codecision in agricultural matters as well.
I believe we are more likely to get that than the satellite navigation system.
It is there that I have greater confidence in our ability to get our way.
Turning to the matter in hand, I would like to say that this is, of course, also about transport times, but what is of the essence is whether the conditions are right, that is, whether the animals are carted off in torment or whether they travel as our fellow-creatures.
If someone goes to the Middle East and buys an Arabian stallion for stud purposes, they do not need to worry that it will arrive here in a poor condition.
Likewise, if our animals travel to the Olympic Games, they will arrive in a fit and proper state.
It follows that it is the conditions that matter.
What matters, I think, is that we should comply with what the consumers want.
In Germany, we have set up programmes for quality meat in which transport time is among the quality criteria.
Organic farming is another example, with the nearest slaughterhouse being the one that is used.
Where that is a measure of quality, it will also become accepted practice.
