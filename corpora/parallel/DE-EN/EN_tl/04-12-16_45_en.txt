Mr President, there is nothing secret about the statement I now make on the basis of Rule 157; on the contrary, I make it openly.
Our group has had a discussion about the amount to be approved under item 3.
This has to do with a great gathering in the Rhineland, from which I come, where the Catholic Church, among other bodies, is organising a great gathering of young people.
I myself am familiar with this meeting, having once been able, in another capacity, to take part in it.
It is a good thing.
This meeting is to include a state visit by the Pope.
His Holiness will be attending this meeting, and what we would like to be certain of is that the gathering’s organisers are asked to provide the EU institutions with documentary confirmation that none of this money will be used to fund the Pope’s state visit.
The Vatican itself will have to pay for that.
