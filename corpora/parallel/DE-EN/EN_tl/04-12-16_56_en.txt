Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give a very brief explanation of why our group has withdrawn its support for this joint motion for a resolution.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament was opposed in principle to this procedure, it being our belief that the Commission should first present its programme, with Parliament then stating its position with respect to it.
We did not manage to get this accepted by the Conference of Presidents and the procedure was adopted.
Up to a certain point, we were able to support the wording of the resolution as it stands; it also includes many points that we can live with and accept.
There are, however, a number of essential elements in this text that lead us in this Group – after a long debate yesterday evening – to believe at present that it is the Commission that should first state its position on these points rather than Parliament.
We therefore want to adopt the procedure that is normal in every Member State, under which the government first presents its programme and the parliament then states where it stands on it.
That is what should be done in this instance too, and so we now expect the Commission to present its programme.
We will not be participating in this vote.
