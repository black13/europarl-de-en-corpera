Mr President, I will be very brief.
I wanted to say that I voted in favour of the report and that I hope we will be able to make considerable progress in this area in future.
I also addressed a question to the new Commission about this, suggesting the introduction of civilian service for young people in the European Union – whether male or female – primarily to create the right conditions in such situations, resulting in a greater sense of responsibility and awareness among the people in the European Union, not only when disasters strike, but also during a civilian service designed to increase solidarity.
As I have said, I am generally in favour of this report and am glad that further work is to be done along these lines.
