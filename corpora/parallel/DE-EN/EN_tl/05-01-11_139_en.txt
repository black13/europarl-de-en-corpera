Mr President, I am very much in favour of the European Constitution, and would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their outstanding report.
The Constitution, which above all strengthens the area of freedom, security and justice, marks a milestone on the road to a more secure and just Europe.
We have taken a giant step towards a Europe of citizens with this Constitution, as by enshrining in it the Charter of Fundamental Rights, by EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and by simplified access to justice, citizens’ rights have been given an enormous boost.
In addition, we now have increased opportunities to coordinate our efforts in the fight against such evils as crime, racism and xenophobia in Europe.
I welcome the fact that the members of the CSU in this House will vote in favour of this report.
Unfortunately, many members of the CSU in the German , which has yet to ratify the Treaty, appear to have no inkling of the significance and implications of the Constitution, as they have announced their intention to vote against it.
This is yet another example of the double game which the CSU is so fond of playing, which involves being progressive here in Europe and flying the flag for the benefit of the outside world, but speaking out in opposition at home, just in case.
This is, however, one of their traditions, for it was the CSU that, in 1949, voted against Germany’s Basic Law.
