Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by addressing the citizens of Europe, and urging them to care about the Constitution.
We must do everything in our power to ensure that the European public accepts this Constitution, because it will make Europe clearer and more citizen-friendly, transparent and democratic.
My impression is that we are all in far too much of a hurry to get down to business as usual.
The Constitution is on the table, but it has not yet been ratified.
It is a political milestone for the European Union, and for a more citizen-friendly, transparent and democratic European Union.
So far, though, the Constitution has been a PR disaster, and I should therefore like to warn that we need an information and communication plan for all the European institutions, the Member States and the national parliaments, and we need a European Constitution Week in all the Member States.
We also need to abolish unanimity in the Council, thus strengthening the common, transparent and democratic Europe as provided for in the Constitutional Treaty.
I would call on the Heads of States or Government to ensure that it is the spirit of the Convention and of the signing ceremony in Rome which sets the tone of domestic political debate, and not a lack of criticism and discussion, or aloofness and indifference.
What we need is for the debate on the Constitution to be Europeanised, not for the ratification process to be nationalised.
The Constitution is not merely a code of practice for the EU institutions; it affects all Europe’s citizens.
We should however be fully aware that work will begin afresh with tomorrow’s vote.
All that this vote must therefore do is to send out a clear signal.
