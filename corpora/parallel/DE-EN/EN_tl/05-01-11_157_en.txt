Mr President, my questions follow on directly from Mrs Roureâ€™s comments.
Firstly, we welcome the fact that the Commission has taken the initiative on this matter, and I hope that, this time, the Council not again stand in its way.
I believe that the European dimension of this task is more important than the individual interests of the Member States; this is why it is essential for us to adopt European rules, as without such rules for this field we will be unable to create an internal market.
One could, however, be forgiven for wondering at this point what the precise nature of these European rules will be.
Mr Frattini, I have noticed that in your statements so far you have failed to say that the key regulations which are already in force, such as the ILO Convention, will be taken as a basis.
What part will be played in the Green Paper by the key issues referred to in the ILO Convention on migrant workers?
In this connection, I should like to note that the European Parliament has already asked the Commission to incorporate these rules.
