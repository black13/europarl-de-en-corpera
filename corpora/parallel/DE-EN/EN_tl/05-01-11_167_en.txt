Mr President, I am particularly keen to pick up on Mrs Lambert’s comments on transition periods.
We should do our best to avoid perpetuating the absurd situation whereby third-country nationals are invited to work in the European Union or in the European labour market whilst restrictions on employment opportunities for those from EU Member States are still in place.
A balance of some kind must be found, and I am confident that this will become possible in the course of further work on the matter.
I would however like to thank Commissioner Frattini and his staff for their efforts in continuing work on this issue, above all because employment is by far the best form of integration we can offer our citizens, as has been brought to my attention in many conversations with groups and individuals affected.
On a slightly different note, I have noticed that the Green Paper is littered with a great many questions.
Given that the issue of labour migration is such a complex one, it would perhaps be better to leave some of these to one side, in line with the principle of ‘keep it simple, stupid’.
