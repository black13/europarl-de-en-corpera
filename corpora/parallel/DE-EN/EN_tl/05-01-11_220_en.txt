Commissioner, I should also like to congratulate you on your first Question Time.
Your detailed replies would seem to indicate that the Commission will in fact be working very actively in Belarus.
I should like to ask whether you believe cooperation with the current Belarussian authorities to be possible, even in the present circumstances?
