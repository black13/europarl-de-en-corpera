Madam President, there can be no question of us cooperating with the authorities at present.
What we can do, however, and as I mentioned before, is to provide particular support for civil society, and also to focus efforts on working with the academic community.
I can tell you that we are planning to hold three workshops in order to identify exactly what we can do, involving non-governmental organisations and as many neighbouring countries as possible, as we share the view that support for civil society is the only opportunity available to us at present to bring about change in Belarus.
