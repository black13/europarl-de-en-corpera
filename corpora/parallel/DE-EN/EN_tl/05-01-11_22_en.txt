Mr President, in the area of trade policy, this Constitution puts the European Parliament in a much stronger position.
When, as was formerly the case, the European Parliamentâ€™s democratic control did not extend to trade policy, that gave rise to constant criticism.
This House did not even have to be consulted when the autonomous trade legislation was adopted.
In future, necessary measures will have to be laid down by European acts and framework legislation, so, in principle, Parliament will participate as an equal.
That is something in which we should take great satisfaction.
It is still, however, a source of anguish that it has still not yet been possible to make qualified majority voting the norm in the Council.
On this, the Convention was more advanced than the Intergovernmental Conference.
Nevertheless, this Constitution makes for greater consistency in the trade policy matters that we have been dealing with within the WTO ever since the Uruguay round.
This Constitution puts the European Union on a better legal footing for conducting negotiations.
