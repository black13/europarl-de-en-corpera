Mr President, although Mr Leinen has enjoined us to consider the whole forest of the Constitution, and not just individual trees, I must, as spokesman for the Committee on Industry, give brief attention to the trees of industrial policy, some of which I might wish would grow better than the Constitution makes provision for.
Some significant progress has, though, been made.
The example I would like to give is that of space policy, for which Europe now has additional powers; it may well not sound either particularly everyday or convincing, but I am not talking about us competing with the Americans or the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else in sending our man – or woman – to the moon or to Mars.
Rather, what I am talking about is our making use of the means of information afforded by space policy for what we have to do in Europe and also around the globe.
Consider, then, the great disaster that we now have to deal with: we need better information and warning systems, and Europe has the technology to provide them.
Consider the day-to-day problems and tasks in connection with information and navigation that our Galileo has to deal with, and, finally, let us give thought to security policy.
We cannot deploy our troops without the information they need being provided from space.
If we want a proper policy of military security around the world, then we also need a proper space policy, with an emphasis on civilian and peaceful use, and for that the Constitution provides additional possibilities.
For that reason, the Industry Committee, too, fully and wholeheartedly supports the European Constitution.
