Mr President, Commissioner, ever since the advent of the common agricultural policy nearly half a century ago, the European Parliament has been little more than a consultative body when it comes to the making of laws.
Right up to now, the Council has been able to take decisions without reference to Parliament, and over half the European Unionâ€™s Budget is disposed of without any democratic control.
This is something that the European Parliament, and the Committee on Agriculture in particular, have never accepted.
Unofficially, we have found ways of delaying final votes as a means of forcing the Council into a sort of codecision.
We have also done sterling work on handling such crises as BSE, which means that our being conceded codecision in principle is something we have, to some extent, earned, and that is something we welcome.
It has to be clear to us, though, that a number of points remain to be rectified.
In one article in particular, the Council has reserved to itself the right to vote on quotas, prices and restrictions on quantity, without, this time, consulting Parliament at all.
We still, then, have much to do in the future.
We will still have to draw on our creative powers in order to exert our democratic influence in these matters and in getting it stated, in principle, that agricultural policy will be subject to codecision.
If it is, though, Parliament will be given more responsibility, and I hope that this House will continue, as before, to give the interests of agriculture and of rural areas the attention they deserve.
