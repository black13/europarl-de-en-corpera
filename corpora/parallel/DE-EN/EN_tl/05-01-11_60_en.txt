– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution, or Constitutional Treaty, is a better legal basis than any we in the European Union have previously had, and, as it is a good and acceptable compromise, our group really can vote to endorse it.
We should regard the European Constitutional Treaty as being, above all, a great chance to construct a shared European identity.
That is what we in Europe need: a sense of being ‘us’, a feeling of belonging together, with us all seeing ourselves as Europeans and also Germans, Westphalians from the north of the Rhine, and, in my case, citizens of Cologne – all this made possible by this European Constitutional Treaty.
We have written our shared values into this Constitutional Treaty, thereby making this old continent into something of a new world, for the wonderful thing about this Constitutional Treaty is that we are defining in precise terms what holds us together.
If this feeling of being ‘us’, this identity, is to come into being, it is quite vital that all Europeans should be able to decide for themselves whether they want this Constitution.
That is why we are campaigning for referendums on it in every European country, for although most of the people can now vote on the Constitutional Treaty, not all Europeans can.
If the people of Europe are to know, firstly, that this Constitution exists, and secondly, having given it some thought, that they want it, it is vital that they themselves should be asked.
We should therefore let people themselves vote and make an effort to ensure that referendums are held in every country.
It will not, unfortunately, be possible to organise it so that they are held all on the same day, but, if people themselves are asked, it will in any case enhance their sense of identity, their awareness of being ‘us’.
