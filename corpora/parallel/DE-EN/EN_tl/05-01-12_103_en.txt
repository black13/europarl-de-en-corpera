Although there is, both in the Member States and in this House, general approval for this text, there is also a critical public that regards it with concern.
In criticising it, we are not arguing from the restricted vantage point of the nation state.
What we criticise is that the treaty aims to further militarise the European Union to the point of enabling it to wage war on a global scale.
It is intended to secure ‘operational capacity drawing on military assets’.
The Constitution requires rearmament, in that ’the Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacities’, a process to be supervised by an ‘agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments’, which will also implement ’appropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sector’.
We are also critical of the way in which the principles of neo-liberalism are to be enshrined in the Constitution.
The general ‘Objectives of the Union’ do admittedly gloss over matters by talking in terms of ‘a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress, and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, but the part that actually deals with policy then speaks in plain language of a commitment to the ‘principle of an open market economy with free competition’.
Far from reflecting this view, the draft report takes a completely uncritical view of the draft Constitution.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left cannot, therefore, endorse it.
