Mr President, I too would like to speak on behalf of the Group of the Greens in thanking all those who have made donations or pledged them, but I also want, in my capacity as chairman of the delegation for relations with Iran, to emphasise my concern that the events of a year ago may repeat themselves, for, on 26 December 2003, an Iranian village was destroyed by an earthquake.
Massive amounts of aid were promised, but the money never arrived.
Terrible anniversaries like these stick in our minds, and in everyone else’s.
The credibility of this House and of the European Union depends on three things being done.
Firstly, the other areas must not be neglected; secondly, when remitting debt or allocating donations, it must be ensured that they are not misappropriated and used for military purposes; and, thirdly, I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that we need – and as part of the European security strategy – the capacity for humanitarian and civilian intervention.
We have already decided to set up the European Civilian Peace Corps, and it is in our Constitution.
Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we should take up Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s proposals by preventing deficits and doing away with those that occur.
