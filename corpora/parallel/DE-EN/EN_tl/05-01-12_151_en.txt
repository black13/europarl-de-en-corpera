Mr President, I have just two points to make.
The disaster in Asia may well have been natural, but it was also an ecological one.
Enormous damage was done to wide stretches of beach, reefs were destroyed, their coral filled with sand and dirt, and machinery washed out to sea constitutes a ticking time-bomb.
All this makes these regions less attractive to tourists.
The first priority, along with the repair of the damage to the environment – in so far as this is possible – is the reconstruction of facilities for tourists.
Although foreign tourists play an important part in the economy, unplanned mass tourism is not environmentally sound.
Any reconstruction must be broader based and more sustainable.
Lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the past.
The disaster can also be seen as an opportunity.
In this respect, the pilot project undertaken by the Thai Ministry of the Environment jointly with the UN and the World Bank to repair the environmental damage on the island of Koh Phi Phi strikes me as showing the way ahead.
