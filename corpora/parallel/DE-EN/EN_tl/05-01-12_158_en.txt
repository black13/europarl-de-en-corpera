– Mr President, the globalisation of solidarity is having a visible effect.
On Monday, we had a meeting with the Commission to discuss what concrete financial aid the EU could provide, thus backing up its words with practical action.
It is encouraging that sufficient funds have been made available, but it is doubtful whether it will reach those who need it.
In the EU, people have donated billions; one television programme in Germany brought in EUR 40 million.
Those who are often accused of being interested only in themselves did not look away; when reports were shown of the hell in paradise, they were watching them.
It is to be hoped that the measures that have been planned will succeed; I am thinking here of, for example, the installation of satellite-based early warning systems – to which Members have referred – to prevent disasters.
There is also the need for the speedy reconstruction of villages, towns and the environment on which people depend for their livelihoods and for expert care for traumatised widows and orphans.
What particularly concerns me now is the aftermath; if the survivors are to be helped in the long term, we need partners and allies in the shape of NGOs, many volunteers who can help people where they are, and we also need effective structures to develop partnerships between towns.
Some of these have not yet come into being.
Tourism must be revived there; these ASEAN and SAARC countries, some of which I know well, are waiting for us, their friends, to return to them.
Let us hope that people will still be helped when the newspapers have found other things to write about and the cameras have been switched off.
