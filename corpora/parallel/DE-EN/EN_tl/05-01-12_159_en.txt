Mr President, the whole world is struck with horror at the extent of the catastrophe, and so I welcome all the more the great generosity on the part of the EU, the Member States and, above all, of the public.
While there is an urgent need for emergency aid, we also need to ensure the long-term and sustainable reconstruction of the stricken regions, and it also appears to me that the donor nations need, as a matter of urgency, to discuss seriously the generous remission of the affected states’ debts, and, in addition, work towards a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Aceh.
It is a matter for shame, though, that a debate is now being set in motion as to whether Germany, among other countries, is even in a position to help.
I am referring here to Mr Stoiber and Mr Wulff, who otherwise always parade the Christian aspect of their party around as if it were a monstrance.
Fortunately, though, the overwhelming majority of people takes a different view, not only in Germany and the EU, but also around the world – something that the people of Beslan have shown by their outstanding example.
