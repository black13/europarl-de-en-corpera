Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disastrous floods in South-East Asia have shown us how great is the world’s need for cooperation between Europeans and Americans, who, even though their abilities certainly differ, can, when they combine them, give the world the vital aid that it needs.
The disaster has also shown, though, an urgent need for closer cooperation between us.
A friendship must be able to cope with criticism and plain speaking.
I am sure I will not be saying anything new if I list the critical issues that need to be put on the agenda again and again.
From Kyoto to Guantanamo Bay by way of the International Criminal Court, there are problems that we must – and will – raise with our American friends, but we want to be fair too; we want to give President Bush a chance to mend the relationship in his second term of office.
We very much welcome his statement that he attaches particular importance to Europe.
Nor do we want to overlook the fact that, despite all the difficulties we have had and still have, cooperation is proving successful in many areas; whether between federal states, between think tanks or citizens’ initiatives, cooperation is working with extraordinary success in many areas, as well as in business and the economy.
As for the future, many tasks await us; there is the conflict between Israel and Palestine, there is the mullahs’ regime in Iran to be brought to heel, but there is also hunger and disease to be combated.
Here we must cooperate; the world cannot afford unilateralism.
