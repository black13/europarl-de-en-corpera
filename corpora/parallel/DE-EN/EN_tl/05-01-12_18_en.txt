Mr President-in-Office, there are many in this House who have, for some time, been keen to see you sitting opposite where you are now, and I am one of them.
The work programme you have presented is enormous, but you also have a reputation for working wonders, and it is to the wonder-worker in you that I would like to appeal, asking you also to give attention to the Members’ statute.
We urgently need a fair and credible statute of this kind.
Somewhere between your country and mine is to be found not only the problem, but also the solution to it.
We are told that the German Government does not want one before the next elections, but, at the same time, the German model – as regards Members’ remuneration rather than additional earnings and lobbyists – could serve as a basis for an agreement of this kind.
We have to put a stop to the unworthy greed in this place.
This House must cease to be a parliament of the insatiable, or else serious damage will be done to democracy, which is what this place is all about.
