Mr President, there is a simple reason for this.
Canada has already been mentioned several times, but I believe that this report and the resolution should really concentrate on Europe and the USA.
If the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission wish to make repeated references to Canada, however – and such references are indeed sensible and necessary – I would ask them not to forget Mexico.
As Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, this is a matter of some importance to me.
If we are going to discuss NAFTA, then we should discuss NAFTA as a whole.
I would ask you to bear this in mind.
