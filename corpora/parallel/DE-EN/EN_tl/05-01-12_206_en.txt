Madam President, the world finds itself in an extensive and continuing debt crisis, which continues to be one of the main obstacles preventing countries of the South, or at least a great many of them, from achieving independent and dynamic economic growth.
This is made clear by two figures; firstly, a great many of the poorest countries are forced to spend over 40% of their GNP on debt servicing.
In such circumstances, independent economic growth becomes all but impossible, and this is why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative.
Secondly, for every euro we now give in development aid to the countries of the South, an average of nearly EUR 1.50 is paid back to the countries of the North in interest payments.
This is another reason why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative; given that Indonesia, the country we are currently debating, would have to pay back EUR 4 billion this year, it is abundantly clear that this would immediately cancel out any kind of development or disaster aid.
I was therefore delighted to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say today that he was in favour of full debt cancellation for Indonesia.
We need an international conference on debt relief, but the Paris Club, being no more than a meeting of creditors, is incapable of staging one.
We need an international conference in which participants include creditor countries and debtor countries, as well as civil societies which have been affected and which would act as monitoring bodies, with all participants having equal rights.
Both the European Union and this House should lend their support to the holding of such a conference.
