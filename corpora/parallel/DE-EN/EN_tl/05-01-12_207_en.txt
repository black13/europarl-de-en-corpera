Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, no one can have a good conscience about asking the developing countries to keep on repaying their debts, as they have already paid these debts back seven times over, and yet their liabilities are four times greater than they were to begin with.
I should therefore like to contradict you on one point, Mr Potočnik; you quoted absolute per capita figures, yet such figures are not the decisive factor.
Every inhabitant of Brandenburg, my home, is in debt to the tune of EUR 16 000, but our national economy is structured in such a way that we can cope with it.
The national economies of the developing countries cannot cope with such debt, however.
In my opinion, therefore, the main issue at stake is not whether we grant a debt deferment, debt reduction, debt moratorium or suchlike, but whether debts are cancelled, as these countries need the money that at present they spend almost exclusively on interest – not even on repayment – to tackle their economic, social and environmental problems.
We would be helping them to help themselves.
Anyone who thinks that this would cripple the rich industrial nations should take note of the fact that the Iraq war costs the USA USD 150 million every day.
President Bush has asked Congress for a further USD 80 billion, and yet Pakistan’s debts run to a mere USD 11 billion.
A comparison of these figures makes it obvious that the debt could be cancelled entirely, and this must be our goal.
Furthermore, it is often said – and I have heard it said again in this House today – that debt is offset by development aid.
I am sorry, but if the political will is there, and if we genuinely wish to help these countries, the poorest countries’ debt must be cancelled entirely.
In addition, the rich countries must finally adhere to their voluntary commitment of spending 0.7% of GDP on development aid.
Such an example should really be set for these countries and for the European Union.
