Madam President, I should like to join the previous speaker in thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schmit, for having placed our concerns regarding a new debt relief initiative in a broader context from the very start.
I am somewhat disappointed at the Commission’s statements, however, which did not go anywhere near far enough.
I agree with Mr Schmit that it should not only be the countries affected by the terrible natural disaster that are considered when talking of the implications of foreign debt.
It is not only natural disasters which affect countries; it is also the devastating effects of poverty, which is on the rise throughout the world, as well as the fact that the amount spent by many countries on debt servicing is many times greater than that on social expenditure, and the fact that we are a very long way from meeting the Millennium Development Goals agreed on by all UN members.
We are currently all very proud of our unprecedented readiness to make donations and provide assistance.
I believe that we are entitled to be proud, but – and this is a point I should like to make to the Commission – we must not give a little with one hand and take away a lot with the other.
The relevant figures have already been cited, and we must also ask ourselves whether it is morally justifiable, and compatible with good governance, for poor countries to have paid back the debts they incurred in the 1980s seven times over.
Parliament’s resolution also states quite clearly that the HIPC Initiative, which has been described by Mr Potočnik as the most comprehensive debt relief initiative ever undertaken, is only a small step, and is of course by no means enough.
I should like to know what the Council Presidency’s specific goals in this field are, both working alone and in cooperation with other international partners, as on the basis of your comments my impression is that the driving force on this issue will be the Council, not the Commission.
