Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in reply to your comments I would merely like to say that the proposal we currently have on the table does not take sufficient account of Parliamentâ€™s resolution.
This is also becoming apparent within the Council, as if it did we would not have seen increasing criticism over the past few weeks, for example in the Dutch and German parliaments and in Poland, of the political agreement reached within the Council.
I should therefore like to ask whether the present proposal you are drafting will differ in any way from what we have already seen.
I should also like to ask which rules will be used as a basis for voting within the Council, or in other words whether or not the Nice rules will be used.
