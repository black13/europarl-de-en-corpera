Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should also like to return to the comments you made which suggested that the directive currently being decided on and debated within the Council is in line with Parliament’s wishes.
This is far from being the case.
If the majority voting rules are taken into account it is no longer even in line with the Council’s wishes, as there is no longer a majority in favour of the proposal.
Could you please explain how you propose to deal with this state of affairs within the Council, which is far from satisfactory in terms of the directive’s content and which has negative implications for the entire IT sector?
