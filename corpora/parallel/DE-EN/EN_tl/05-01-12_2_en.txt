Mr President, I rise to ask a question under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure.
We saw this House spied on in a disgraceful manner during the last election period, and it appears that this is already happening again, in that I heard yesterday that at least one attendance list from December 2004 was given – I stress given – to a Member in order that he might make a copy of it.
There are two questions I would like to ask about this.
Firstly, is there any basis in fact for what I have been told?
Secondly, if there is, is there any basis in law for this being done?
