Mr President, I would like to say that I think there is something very unusual about the way in which statements of vote are being dealt with in this instance.
The report on which we have just voted states that: ‘the greatest advances brought by the Constitution are to be found in the specific area of common security policy’.
That is the principal reason why I reject this Constitutional Treaty for the EU.
Its Article I-41, paragraph 3 states that ‘the Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacities’, which means that the EU’s Member States are obliged to rearm.
When we turn to foreign and military policy, we find that the Constitutional Treaty evidently aims to equip the European Union to wage global war.
Article I-41, paragraph 1, states that the Treaty is intended to secure operational capacity drawing on military assets, so that the Treaty makes rearmament an obligation.
An armaments agency is to be set up to monitor all this and to implement appropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sector.
I think there is a whole array of other points demonstrating why the Constitutional Treaty, which militarises the European Union, must be rejected.
That is what I wanted this statement of vote to make clear.
