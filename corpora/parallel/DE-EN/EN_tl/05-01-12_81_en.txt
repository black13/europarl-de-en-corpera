Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Constitutional Treaty represents significant progress in the process of bringing Europe together, and that is why I voted in favour of it.
At the same time, there are aspects of it that give me cause for concern, one of them being the open coordination method as cooperation – with non-binding legal status – between Member States in the fields of social and employment policy, research policy, health policy and industrial policy.
The Commission is now, in these areas, empowered to take the initiative in enacting guidelines and action plans.
What this means in practice is that policy initiatives – new ones – are taken first, and then the related powers and responsibilities may be created.
The open coordination method represents the incipient transfer to the European level of what were formerly national areas of activity and blurs the demarcation of powers and responsibilities between Europe and the Member States.
Competition between the Member States is necessary, but this process is likely, to say the least, to shut it down.
