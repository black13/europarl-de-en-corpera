Mr President, I wish to make a statement on the way I voted.
I voted in favour of the Convention because, despite my misgivings about it, it represents an improvement on the present situation and the law as it stands.
I am saddened, though, that this Constitution contains no reference to God.
It is a disappointment to me, and to millions of European citizens, that the 25 Heads of Government and this Parliament did not have the will or the strength to get a reference to the Deity inserted.
A European Constitution would have benefited from it being stated in the preamble that we are responsible for actions both to God and to man.
Another reason, though, why I voted in favour of the Constitution, was that its Article 57 makes it possible for Turkey and other countries to be offered a long-term and privileged partnership in the context of special relationships.
It is my hope that it will prove possible to incorporate the reference to the Deity in the Constitution at a later date.
