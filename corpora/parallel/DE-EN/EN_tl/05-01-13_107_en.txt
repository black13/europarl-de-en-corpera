Mr President, as you were about to say, we now come to the matters of urgency and the human rights issues.
Today we have three topics related to Asia, but serious violations of human rights are still going on in Europe.
I am therefore glad that we have with us two campaigners for human rights, Mr Kovalev from Russia and Mrs Estemirova from Chechnya, who are here today to receive the Robert Schuman Medal from the Group of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I am glad that these campaigners for human rights, who have thus exposed themselves to great dangers, are listening to this important debate today.
We can assure them that we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that human rights prevail in Russia and in Chechnya.
