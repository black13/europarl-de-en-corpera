– Mr President, 26 January will be the second anniversary of the execution of the monk Lobsang Dhondup.
This execution called forth both protests from around the world and a resolution from this House, which Beijing ignored.
In January 2003, we made efforts to prevent the execution of his spiritual leader, Lama Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, and did likewise in November 2004, when the two-year stay of execution expired.
Yesterday, in a conversation here in Strasbourg, the Chinese Embassy assured me of the high probability of the death sentence being commuted to life imprisonment.
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regards that statement as a triumph for the many initiatives taken by this House and others.
We have never ceased from speaking out and winning support from parliaments and human rights organisations.
Again and again, we have urged the Council and the Commission to press a change of course on those in power in China.
Our demands are still on the agenda.
A new trial is to examine charges of sabotage and involvement in bomb attacks.
This trial must be in accordance with the rule of law and monitored by international observers.
In essence, unfortunately, little has changed as regards human rights in China.
Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo, who belongs to the underground church, was recently arrested.
It follows that the arms embargo must be maintained.
The possibility of his being pardoned opens up a way ahead, and I hope that we will be able to go down it.
What we are aiming for, and will continue to aim for, is the recognition of minority rights and the acknowledgement of the right to religious practice.
One essential step in that direction would be the stepping up of dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama.
