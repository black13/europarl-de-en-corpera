â€“ Mr President, despite the sign of hope we have been given today in the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, we must continue to demand that the case against him be reopened and conducted according to the principles of the rule of law.
If we do not, we will forever more be stalling, and we will always have cases of this kind on our hands.
Not just in this case but in many others, a fair trial is what is needed.
Now that we have passed our resolution on the Constitution, we in this House must continue to defend human rights and endangered minorities throughout the world, supporting their efforts and protecting them against arbitrary repression.
We have to demand of our own governments that they do not allow themselves to be dazzled by the prospect of good business contacts, so that human rights fade out of the picture.
We have to make use of developing relations with China to help human rights to prevail there too and to return autonomy to the people of Tibet at last.
