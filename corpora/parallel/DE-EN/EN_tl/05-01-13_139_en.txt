Mr President, we are all agreed that trafficking in women and children is a crime; this case in Cambodia is, alas, but one among many, and there are a great many such cases around the world that are not known about.
Over recent weeks, public opinion around the world has been disturbed by reports in the media according to which child victims of the tsunami are being trafficked.
What makes this case in Cambodia all the more disconcerting is the fact that it is only by chance that it has reached the public – us in this House – and is, unfortunately, not unsettling people around the world.
Nonetheless, where the worldwide trade in women and children is concerned, it is but the tip of the iceberg.
I believe that it shows how prevalent corruption is in Cambodia, that the country’s justice system has not been reformed, and that, no matter what the sex industry is up to, the Cambodian Government should have ensured that the pimps were not, within a matter of days, set at liberty to again be a menace to their victims.
We must also, though, ask ourselves questions about what lies behind this trade.
The constant increase in the number of landless people in Cambodia is contributing to an ever-worsening situation, in that these people have no prospects unless they sell their sons and daughters.
This is something we have to denounce; this is where we really have to point out where the problem lies and at last bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Cambodian Government, so that nothing like what has happened there can ever happen again.
We also have to voice our concern that the committee that has been appointed may well be a mere formality, a sort of sedative pill to calm down the public and us as well.
We therefore hope that the debate in this House will prompt others to bring these crimes more to light and to the attention of the world, and to combat them.
