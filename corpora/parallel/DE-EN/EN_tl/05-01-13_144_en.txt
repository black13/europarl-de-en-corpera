Mr President, please accept my apologies, but I had already said at the beginning of this debate on human rights that two prominent human rights activists, Mr Kovalev from Russia and Mrs Estemirova from Chechnya were here today to receive our group’s Robert Schuman Medal.
Although you had extended a warm welcome to them, they were not actually here yet.
They have now arrived, and I would like to assure our two guests that we will not cease from the fight for human rights in Russia, Chechnya and throughout the world.
Commissioner, I can still recall how, one Thursday afternoon, this House declared its support for human rights in Slovenia and for that country’s freedom.
Today, we have a Slovene Commissioner, and I hope that we in this House will live to see, one day, freedom, human rights and independence for Chechnya and Russia.
