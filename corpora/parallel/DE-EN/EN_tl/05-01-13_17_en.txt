– Mr President, it is very appropriate to quote the Bible in this debate, for there were glad Christmas tidings from Kiev, announcing the birth of democracy and freedom.
Were it not for the presidential elections in Ukraine being overshadowed by the disastrous floods in Asia, that would have been for me the second-best Christmas in political terms since Prague in 1989.
I was with Parliament’s delegation in the electoral districts to the south of Kiev and can confirm that the election not only ran peacefully, but also in a very correct manner.
We congratulate the democracy movement, and Mr Viktor Yushchenko on winning the election.
His victory is an outstanding one, gained under difficult economic circumstances and in a region still suffering the effects of the Chernobyl disaster, and, most of all, of the Soviet regime.
We support the democracy movement and the renewal of an ancient European country, Ukraine, as it moves towards the rule of law, human rights and democracy.
This tremendous movement will extend its influence into Russia and Belarus, but I wish to refute Commissioner Potočnik’s claim that accession to the EU is not on the agenda.
I believe that Ukraine is part of Europe, and, if that is the case, Ukraine also belongs in the EU, provided that it fulfils the conditions.
We should do everything necessary to ensure that it does.
