– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what the Commissioner has said has not, in fact, persuaded me; I still have the impression that the Commission, by the decision it took last June, really was in breach of the agreement arising out of the 1997 trialogue.
As far as I am aware, this House was given no advance information about this either, and it is pretty dubious that the decision to dismiss the teachers was taken at the last meeting of the Commission before the European elections, as if it had been assumed that we would then hear nothing more about it.
The second thing I want to say is that I do not think it acceptable that the Commission, which is, after all, engaged alongside us in the fight for a social Europe, should ditch its social responsibility and its obligations as an employer when it comes to safeguarding its own interests.
How else is one to explain the fact, to which reference has already been made in this debate, that the teachers were not informed in advance of their dismissals, not to mention the way in which, for years on end, returns to the Belgian authorities described them only as part-time employees, so that their actual working time could not be taken into account?
We are told, thirdly, that teaching is, in future, to be provided only by language schools.
The first tenders have already been invited, and it is reported that the first contracts have already been awarded.
We can now therefore reckon with the possibility of some of the Commission’s language teaching being provided by the British Council, and, as that body has, as we know, a new head, it is interesting to consider the implications of this.
I would ask the Commission to have an independent inquiry into this whole affair, in order, if possible, to conclusively refute the accusations that have been made.
