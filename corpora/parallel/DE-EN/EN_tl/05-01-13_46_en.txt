Commissioner, we will be examining your measure to see how much cheaper it really is.
For you to say that Parliament wanted us to take these steps is somewhat impertinent.
If we look at the trialogue, signed – and not fortuitously – by the then chairman of the Committee on Budgets, item 7 of which clearly states that there is no intention to cancel the present language teachers’ contracts, I think it is a bit rich of you to now want to avoid taking the blame!
I would ask you to sort this matter out, or else we will have an interinstitutional problem on our hands.
