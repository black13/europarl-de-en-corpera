Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to recital A. A number of discussions have taken place over the past few days and during the past hour, and I can perhaps go some way towards ending them by briefly explaining this amendment.
It is undoubtedly true that we are all faced with a difficult situation, in that on days like today every word must be weighed very carefully.
Whichever wording is used, our primary consideration must be the victims’ dignity and the perpetrators’ guilt.
In order to take everyone’s concerns into account, I therefore propose that we amend the second phrase of recital A, the original of which read; ‘the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Hitler’s Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau...’.
We propose that ‘Hitler’s Nazi’ be replaced by ‘Nazi Germany’s’, with the text then reading; ‘...Nazi Germany’s death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau...’.
As I see it, this would convey Germany’s guilt and special responsibility, whilst at the same time making it clear that it was the Nazis who placed themselves under the burden of this guilt.
It is a fact that there were German victims too, and this wording also commemorates them.
I therefore ask the House to vote in favour of this amendment.
