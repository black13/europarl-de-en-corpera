Mr President, Mr Schulz is right; all our words and all their consequences are of enormous importance.
One thing is certain; Mr Schulz’s amendment has nothing to do with the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and should be regarded as an entirely separate issue, because the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group contains unacceptable statements that we cannot and do not wish to tolerate.
We would therefore ask that there be no confusion over this matter.
This was the first point I wished to make.
The second point I should like to make is as follows; we acknowledge that the two largest groups in this House – and rightly so – wish to reach a broad consensus on this issue, and this is why we are able to join this consensus.
We would, however, like to stress that some of the discussions that took place on this resolution during preparations for this session were – and are – unworthy.
This is a point we must emphasise.
