Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that everyone in this House agrees that all those who took part in this crime – whether they were German, Austrian or of other nationalities – should be condemned, and this is conveyed by the phrase ‘Nazi Germany’.
The key point is the responsibility of all those involved, and it is to this responsibility that we must draw people’s attention.
I therefore ask that a vote now be held and that Members consider the matter once again.
It is not a question of whether it was Germans or non-Germans who were involved; what matters is that we refer to all those associated with the criminal regime of Nazi Germany.
This is the gist of Mr Schulz’s amendment, to which Mr Poettering has lent his support.
