Mr President, the Prime Minister of Pakistan having visited this House this week, I should like to remind everyone that the parliaments in Pakistan have repeatedly demanded that democracy be implemented, and called on President Musharraf to separate his civilian and military functions.
He promised not to appear again in public in military uniform as of 1 January 2005, yet nothing has changed and he continues to do so.
I believe that this House has always supported democracy and opposed dictatorships.
We should therefore support the parliaments in Pakistan in their calls for more democracy, and, during our contacts with the Pakistani authorities, urge that President Musharraf keep the promises he has made.
