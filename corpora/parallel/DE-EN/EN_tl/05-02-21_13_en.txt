Mr President, I am not sure whether I have misunderstood something.
You said that matters requiring the presence of the Council must be completed by 6.00 p.m.
Does that also apply to Question Time?
Question Time with the Council is scheduled for Wednesday, and the Council will naturally need to be present then.
