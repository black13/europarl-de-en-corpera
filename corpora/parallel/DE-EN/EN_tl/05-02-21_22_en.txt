Mr President, this House should wholeheartedly welcome the referendum held in Spain and the Spanish public’s clear ‘yes’ to the Constitution.
I believe we should thank the Spanish Government, and everyone else involved, for having informed and engaged the public, and in particular for having involved civil society in the referendum campaign.
I myself spent several days in Spain with other Members of this House, and was able to see how openly, democratically and peacefully the referendum passed off, providing a genuine example of European democracy.
What Mr Pęk has said in this House is utterly absurd, and I am sure that only a small minority of Members share his views.
At the same time, however, turnout for the referendum demonstrated the need for the public to be provided with even more information.
Mr President, we should call on the governments and the Commission to pursue, once and for all, a policy of proactive information on what the Constitution contains.
We have no more time to lose, as the dates for the next referendums have already been set.
