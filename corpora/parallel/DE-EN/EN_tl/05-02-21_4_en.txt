Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were delighted to hear what Mr Borrell had to say on the American President’s visit to Brussels, and we agree entirely with his comments.
Our group has always been very much in favour of the President of the European Parliament being present during this visit, whichever institution held the meeting.
I would call on the European Council and the governments to ensure that a discussion of the kind we have seen over the past few days and weeks is not repeated in future.
I should like to express my wholehearted thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, for having made it possible to achieve such an outcome, but there should be no more discussions of this kind.
It should be self-evident that Parliament is involved whenever a president – in this case the American President – visits the European institutions.
I hope, Mr President, that your visit to Brussels tomorrow will be successful.
The European Parliament is the epicentre of developments in Europe, and your presence at tomorrow’s meeting is therefore to be welcomed.
