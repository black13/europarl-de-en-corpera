Madam President, may I say to Mr Barroso that he devoted his speech today to three splendid aims: prosperity, solidarity and security.
That naturally arouses great expectations among us Members, and I have to say, Mr Barroso, that my reaction was similar to that of Mr Swoboda, for what you went on to say about the directive on services under these headings actually turned out to be rather insubstantial.
If you really want us to achieve prosperity, solidarity and security for our citizens, you will have to deal a great deal more thoroughly with this directive on services than you seemed to indicate today.
If you are serious about your partnership with us, and indeed with all the institutions, you will have to go much further yet.
Moreover, we must not forget something that is even more important, Mr Barroso, and that is our partnership with the people of the European Union, with all of its 450 million inhabitants.
It is for them, and for no one else, that we make our policies.
