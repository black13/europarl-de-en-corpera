Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, having listened to this debate, I cannot but repeat that we need to think more like Europeans and stop engaging in national and party politics.
We need more optimism and confidence, more serious intent, more clarity and scrutiny and the political will to honour the pledges we make from our soap boxes.
We need more leadership â€“ more leadership from political circles, more leadership from those in government and more leadership from the Commission.
I should also like to appeal to everyone here to reflect a little.
All of us are here to make the four freedoms a reality in law and in fact, and everything that serves this purpose is good politics.
We must reflect on what we have enshrined in the Constitution.
I really do not understand why we are arguing about these things today.
In the Constitution, we proclaim the principle of a social market economy.
In so doing, we are clearly stating that the market is not an end in itself but a means to an end, that we need an efficient market which fulfils its social and environmental responsibilities.
We have set ourselves the aim of full employment, and we have set ourselves the aim of sustainability.
Why do we keep conveying the impression to the general public that we are playing off these aims against each other?
We do not need any more short-sighted populism; what we want is greater responsibility for the future.
May I therefore make this request to the President of the Commission: apply a subsidiarity test before the presentation of proposals.
Explain to the public what there is to be gained by legislating at EU level.
Define the benefits in terms of growth, competition and employment.
Define the target group.
Define clearly the motives, aims and effects and say who has to do what by when, so that we can exercise our parliamentary right of scrutiny.
