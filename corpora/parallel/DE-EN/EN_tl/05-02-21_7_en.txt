Mr President, I am not sure whether I have correctly understood the formal announcement you have just made.
Our group would agree to the situation in Lebanon being included in Wednesday morningâ€™s debate on the Mediterranean region.
We would then be able to consider an appropriate way of discussing the issue in greater detail in March, perhaps on the basis of an oral question to the Council and the Commission.
This would allow us to leave the agenda as it stands, and then to discuss the issue in more detail in March.
I was somewhat surprised to have been given the floor, but I hope that I have been able to help resolve this minor problem.
