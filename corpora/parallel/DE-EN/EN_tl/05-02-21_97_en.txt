Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an unfortunate fact that what both our first debate today and the one we are now holding have in common is that they appear to be dominated by confrontation rather than cooperation.
I would like to see the World Economic Forum and the World Social Forum merge, thus enabling us to talk to each other, rather than about each other.
Although you said, Mr President of the Commission, that the EU is a global player, I do believe that we have yet to become a global player rather than a global payer.
Tomorrow will be an important step in this process, and I wish you the best of luck in this respect.
The EU is needed, and it bears responsibility.
We share responsibility, while yet being reliant on others; we both shape events and are affected by them.
Our understanding of fundamental freedoms and human rights, our rejection of the death penalty, of child labour and of discrimination of any kind, our concept of what it means to be human; all these things know no borders, whether these be borders of countries or of continents, and it is in this sense that we also bear responsibility for what happens in the rest of the world.
The answer to globalisation must not come from Europe alone; what is needed is a debate on a model world order.
We need a global code of ethics and global principles of action, in spite of the fact that different cultures exist.
I therefore believe that we should speak up in favour of multilateralism, that we should support the initiative for a global Marshall Plan and that the EU should hold a UN conference, and that this House should call on churches throughout the world to convene an international ecumenical conference and to agree common principles of action.
I believe that the European model of an environmentally friendly social market economy could become a worldwide hallmark of the EU, and that this would allow us to help change the unfair rules that currently govern the global economy.
