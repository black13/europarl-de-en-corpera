Mr President, I merely wish to inform the House that a meeting of the coordinators was held yesterday at which the coordinators of all parties, including the committee chairs, confirmed that the amendment just read out had been accepted, but had not, because of a drafting error, been included in the report.
So in the interests of fairness we should vote on the amendment now.
