The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the report, as it does not stand up to the pressure emanating from the Commission to privatise services of general interest, but, if anything, intensifies that pressure in parts.
It is made even more difficult for municipalities, regions and Member States to offer the services to the public that they are often legally required to provide.
Public undertakings will have to compete even more with global operators in the field of service provision.
From the public’s point of view, the provision of public services will further deteriorate: the market functions according to neither social yardsticks nor need, but simply lucrative demand.
We are particularly critical of the fact that compensation for services of general economic interest will continue fundamentally to be treated as ‘state aid’ and will therefore still come under the state aid regime.
In addition, only a few public undertakings will continue to receive compensation in any case.
The report also strengthens the Commission proposal as regards hospitals and social housing.
Instead of extending the exemptions provided for, to cover at least care services, education, culture and the public media, bureaucratic procedures are now being called for across the board.
The report totally fails to mention those employed in undertakings providing services of general interest and the general interests of social welfare, such as the protection of the weaker members of society.
For the big service providers, privatisation initiatives in the field of services of general interest mean profitable business.
Anyone helping them to achieve those objectives should be conscious of what they are doing.
