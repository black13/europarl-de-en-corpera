Mr President, Commissioner, there can be no one who does not believe that nature and the environment need to be protected, and Natura 2000 is an outstanding idea and a positive initiative.
When it comes down to brass tacks, however, and the time comes to provide money for initiatives of this kind and to get them off the ground, a large number of those who had previously expressed their enthusiasm beat a pretty hasty retreat.
The number of people who put themselves out in any way, or who are at least willing to do so, is small.
A number of teething problems have been experienced with regard to the implementation of Natura 2000 that could potentially have been avoided.
For example, the Netherlands has taken the opportunity to ban hunting in many parts of the country, using Natura 2000 as a pretext.
I believe that this has given rise to a great deal of opposition, and in fact Commissioner Wallström stated clearly during the previous parliamentary term that Natura 2000 is entirely compatible with hunting.
It is also important that knowledge be shared and that uncertainties over application be resolved.
I am firmly convinced that the officials in Mr Dimas’ DG have done splendid work in the past, yet no matter how much effort is expended, work of this kind cannot be carried out unless the groundwork has been laid.
Natura 2000 must not be implemented at the expense of landowners or agriculture, and compensation must be granted instead of depriving people of what is due to them.
Natura 2000 must not be implemented at the expense of the common agricultural policy or rural development.
Natura 2000 sites cover 15% of the old EU, and funding measures for the remaining 85% – not including cities and built-up areas – come under rural development and agriculture.
No further reductions should be made to this large area, and I therefore believe that separate and ample funding would be the best solution.
