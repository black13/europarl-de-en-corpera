Madam President, what the Commission should really have done in this Action Plan was to put forward legislative proposals.
The latter are an essential part of any action plan, and I hope that Mr Dimas agrees that the central focus of this Action Plan ought to have been the protection of children.
Yet if we ask ourselves what Mr Dimas has turned the Commission’s SCALE programme into, the answer must be that SCALE is now short for ‘stopping caring about legislating for the environment’, and this, Mr Dimas, is the major criticism that must be levelled at your proposal.
It is true that you inherited it from the previous Commission, but an action plan cannot consist merely of research, research and more research, with not a single genuine measure to reduce environmental pollution and impact on health, in particular children’s health.
An action plan should also not be something that uses a lack of scientific consensus to put off action indefinitely, as that would be to turn the precautionary principle completely on its head.
What we expect from you, Mr Dimas, is action, and I am delighted that this House has sent a clear signal in this respect today; we cannot lend our approval to your Action Plan, which in reality is nothing but a plan of non-action.
After all, we agree that the protection of children must be an absolute priority for the European Union; I therefore find it incomprehensible that you can dare to submit a plan of non-action of this kind to this House, and not only that, but that you can dare to call it an action plan.
I believe that this not only insults the intelligence of Members of this House; it flies in the face of our expectations and indeed of the Commission’s previous proposals.
I should like to say to Mr Schnellhardt and the Group of the European People’s Party that I take a dim view of those who bow to pressure from the tobacco lobby and say that passive smoking does not cause cancer, as this is very far from being the truth.
