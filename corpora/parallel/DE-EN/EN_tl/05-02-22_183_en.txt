Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a proverb in my part of the world to the effect that the healthy have one hundred wishes, whereas the sick have only one – to become healthy.
There is a great deal of wisdom in this proverb, and we must therefore support every effort made to maintain the health of society and the individuals within it.
Yet without wishing to disparage the Commission’s efforts, this Action Plan is an investigation – and not only that, but an investigation for which the latest findings could unfortunately not be used – rather than an effective, detailed and far-reaching measure aimed at rectifying a situation that has been recognised as a problem.
Unlike many of the previous speakers, my aim is not to see the glass as half empty; I should like to see it as half full, and to congratulate you on your efforts.
At the same time, however, I should like to encourage you to do more and to be more courageous in the conclusions you draw.
By way of an illustration of the precautionary principle, I should like to cite the following example.
The Italian Government recently banned smoking in virtually all indoor spaces in Italy, and a wave of indignation swept through the country; yet there can be no doubt that the ban has had a positive impact.
If the EUR 1 billion spent today on growing tobacco were, gradually and in due course, to be reallocated to health, a courageous step could be taken towards improving it.
