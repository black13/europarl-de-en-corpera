Mr President, let me begin by saying that I am glad the Commissioner has answered the question so explicitly and intends to have a coordinator appointed.
This, I believe, is important, because this major link, which could subsequently be extended to Prague and other cities, would otherwise remain a mere pipe dream.
In my opinion, we must press for the speedy implementation of this project.
I also have two very specific supplementary questions for the Commissioner.
Firstly, what is the present position regarding the plans for the Rhine bridge between Strasbourg and Kehl?
As we all know, this is a single-track bridge, and its upgrading is a matter of the utmost priority â€“ a small but crucial part of the project.
Secondly, what can you tell us about the transverse axis from Brussels to Strasbourg via Luxembourg which is also under discussion?
