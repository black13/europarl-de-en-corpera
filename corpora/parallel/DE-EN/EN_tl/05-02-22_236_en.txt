Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to come back to the Commissionerâ€™s answer to the last question from Mr Purvis.
We all know that every death on the roads is one death too many.
Particularly because I come from a Member State where subsidiarity is writ large, I believe that, with regard to the uniform provisions that we need to govern road traffic, speed limits and the like, the question we really have to ask the Commission is this: are any discussions or studies being conducted with a view to assessing what action it would actually be wise to take?
