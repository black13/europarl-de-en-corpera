Mr President, I believe that the report before us is a further sign of the helplessness that has taken hold of the European Union.
There are signs that things are starting to fall apart because of a wide variety of counteracting trends.
Although the internal market is in place, we are lacking everything that we know is required for a reasonable economic policy, by which I mean the need for a minimum of common principles.
The result is the greatest redistribution of financial assets in peacetime history.
This does not only apply to this continent, although the situation here is particularly difficult, because we have a large middle class that is breaking up.
I am therefore sorry to see that this report does not suggest any real approach for counteracting this.
I believe that enlargement has come too soon, and that consequently we are promoting wages dumping, so that very many things we were warned about are now actually happening.
The first approach to adopt must be to create genuine transparency, so as to ensure that these discrepancies are at least clear for all to see.
