Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Karas said earlier that we are dealing here with decisions about our future direction, and he is quite right there.
However, you can only make decisions about your direction if you can see the horizon.
To be capable of making decisions about future direction, you have to be up to date in your analysis and your proposals, and I can tell most of the Members in the Conservative group that they, of all people, are not up to date with their proposals in these two reports, and not in a position to see the horizon.
You know very well that the Economic Policy Guidelines are the most tedious document to emerge from Brussels year after year.
So what are your proposals in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to modernise this instrument?
Where is your contribution to a meaningful debate?
Structural reforms, I hear you say!
Quite right!
Europe and its Member States need structural reforms.
But you know very well that structural reforms can only work, and can only lead to more growth and higher employment if they form part of an active industrial policy, part of an active policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and part of a budgetary policy appropriate to our economic situation.
I feel like weeping when I look at your proposals.
You should read your texts through once before you adopt them, that would be a great help!
You want a general reduction in the level of taxation.
It would be better if you were to discuss a decent policy for SMEs with us rather than putting this sort of nonsense in your reports.
You want everyone to work longer hours.
Why not help us to increase the employment rate, so that more people are in work?
Europe stands to gain more from that.
That is why you can only hope to get our agreement if you vote for some reasonable amendments.
Otherwise we cannot support this nonsense.
