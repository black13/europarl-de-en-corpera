Mr President, I would like to support the previous speakers and stress that the European Capitals of Culture programme has so far been a success story.
You can always find individual areas where things could be done still better, but all in all we have seen that for all these cities the process of self-understanding – with meetings across Europe opening their eyes to European horizons – has helped to strengthen not only the identity of those cities but also a new understanding within Europe.
Mrs Pack was quite right to say that we now recognise that it was a mistake not to include Eastern Europe in the decision adopted in 1999.
So we are right to be correcting that error here now and to provide for a new arrangement as from 2009, on the basis of which not just one country from the old Member States but also a city from one of the Eastern European Member States is also included.
I am firmly convinced that this tension between Western and Eastern Europe will lead to good cooperative projects.
We also need to bear in mind that something like a new collective cultural identity is created in the individual cities.
Europe has not just one soul, but many, and that is what the European cultural capitals should demonstrate in coming years.
For that reason I agree with the proposals brought forward by Mrs Prets, both as regards resources and as regards clarity about how these cities are to be identified and nominated.
