Mr President, I do not have a great deal to say about the content of this report; this fraud prevention agreement fulfils a request this House has been making for many years, and I hope we will approve this agreement by a large majority.
We are actually dealing here, for the first time, with part of the series of Bilateral Agreements with Switzerland, and I feel that the rapid way we have dealt with this in this House demonstrates that we want to see the positive results achieved finally transposed into legislation.
We have repeatedly supported the Commission in its efforts to achieve an outcome on the fraud prevention agreement.
We are therefore all the more surprised that when it comes to an amount that Switzerland wishes to transfer to the new Member States as a contribution to cohesion, the amount of CHF 1 billion, the Commission has suddenly come up with the pettifogging idea that this ought to be the subject of an international treaty, and that a memorandum of understanding is not sufficient.
I would like to point out to the Commission that we have not been negotiating with a banana republic, but with one of the oldest and most stable democracies in Europe.
So, to make no bones about this, what you have been doing here plays into the hands of those in Switzerland and in the EU who are opposed to closer relations between Switzerland and the European Communities.
I call for this House to adopt a position on this and for you, on behalf of the Commission, to take this message from Strasbourg back home with you.
