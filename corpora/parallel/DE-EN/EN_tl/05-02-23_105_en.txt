‘Our rapporteur has been at pains to consider the highly diverse views on this extremely controversial subject.
I endorse his report because his proposal will genuinely improve safety and free movement for road users and offer more opportunities for control in order to reduce the possibilities of fraud.
It is an outrage that some people in Europe have been driving on forged driving licences for ten, twenty, thirty and more years.
I am in favour of harmonised rules and driving examinations; I am also in favour of harmonised age requirements, both maximum and minimum, and I have no objection to a provision requiring older persons in the 70+ age group to renew their driving licences more often, which may entail eye and other medical tests.
However, this should remain a matter for each individual country.
I personally would endorse the introduction of a single European model of driving licence, that is to say, a plastic 'credit' card type with a microchip inserted, in five years’ rather than in twenty years' time.
It is undoubtedly the case, though, that road safety in Europe would also be improved if those EU countries which still drive on the left – which is the wrong side, from my perspective – could be induced to abolish this system.
Sweden proved years ago that switching is possible.
I would like to be able to drive my car in Ireland without feeling that I am a danger to myself and other road users.’
