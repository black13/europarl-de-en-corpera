Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we all agree that human rights are universal and indivisible and that they are also a measure of the quality of international relations.
That is why the European Union is committed to ensuring that respect for human rights is given the necessary priority, whether this is in the context of relations with China, Russia, Syria, Iran or North Korea, a list that is, of course, by no means exhaustive.
One of the problems in this debate is that definitions are sometimes blurred and can be manipulated for ideological reasons.
As regards the European Parliament's human rights resolution, it must not become a back door for a general liberalisation of abortion under the pretext of reproductive health; here, the protection of human life and dignity is at stake.
I would like to focus on just one case which is especially important as it concerns a country with which accession negotiations are scheduled to begin, namely Turkey.
However, this is not the main reason why I am raising this particular case.
Nor is it because it involves an Austrian citizen who was arrested and whose release may – thanks to the intervention of the Austrian authorities – be imminent.
The fact is that it could just as easily have been a citizen of another country.
What worries me, firstly, is that in Turkey, even today, the mere allegation of membership of a terrorist organisation is enough for an arrest warrant to be issued, even if the individual concerned has not committed any criminal act.
Secondly, I am also very concerned that arrest warrants issued by the State Security Court are still being executed, even though Turkey claims to fulfil the Copenhagen political criterion.
We all know that arrest warrants issued by this Court violate Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
If this case is symptomatic of legal practice in Turkey, neither the Commission nor the Council should proceed to the agenda.
