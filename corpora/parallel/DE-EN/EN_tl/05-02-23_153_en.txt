Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Republic of Moldova is a country which is often forgotten about in Europe.
It is a country rarely mentioned in lists of examples or in key speeches, yet its fate is closely bound up with the European Union.
Only when the Transnistria conflict is resolved and Moldova can genuinely protect its own borders once more will it have the chance to develop economically.
We know that Moldova is the poorest country in Europe and that its young people are leaving in droves.
That is why the resolution of this conflict is also important for us, and democratic elections are essential for this process.
Democracy-building and successful economic development in Moldova will increase the European Union's security as well.
I am pleased, therefore, that the Commission, the Council and Mr Solana have also finally understood – and I emphasise the word 'finally' – that a solution to the Transnistria conflict is a key security issue for Europe and that we must do all we can to move this process forward.
Nonetheless, and I emphasise this point again too, democratic development in Moldova is the responsibility of its parties, government and administration.
It is they who must now ensure that the elections are free and fair and take place without ballot-rigging, so that a government can be founded on trust and become a significant interlocutor for the EU.
That is the signal which will set the Republic of Moldova on course towards the European Union.
