Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schmit, the President of Ukraine has summed it up very aptly today.
The principle that his country associates with Europe is democracy – and the democrats in the Republic of Moldova are looking to us as well.
What they want from us is not only a commitment to them as Europeans, but also a clear signal over and above the neighbourhood strategy.
That is why I believe that – especially in the light of events in its neighbour, Ukraine – we must offer Moldova a clearer perspective.
With the Thessaloniki strategy, the EU mapped out a course for the countries of the Western Balkans.
What about the countries that are only now shrugging off the shackles of the past?
Ukraine has set a precedent.
It is to be hoped that the Republic of Moldova will follow suit on 6 March, and even Belarus will in future have no option but to embark on the path towards democracy.
What we need now is a Thessaloniki strategy for these three countries.
It is an anachronism that the Republic of Moldova is the only country in the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe to have no prospect of accession to the European Union.
It would be splendid if, very soon, this House could welcome a democratically elected President from the Republic of Moldova who is genuinely committed to democratic politics.
At the moment, that is not the case, as I saw for myself during my visit to Chisinau ten days ago.
If, though, there is to be a European Republic of Moldova, the election on 6 March must be democratic.
We appeal to our European friends in the Republic of Moldova to go and vote, to vote for democracy, and to make the Republic of Moldova freer, more democratic and more European so that this House can very soon bid their country welcome.
