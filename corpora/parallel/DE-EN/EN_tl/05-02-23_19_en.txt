Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Arab world and the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean are changing – and this change is long overdue.
Only a few years ago, this region was largely at a standstill as far as democracy-building and human rights were concerned.
We are pleased that Turkey, for example, has signalled its intention of playing a more prominent role in the dialogue with the Arab world, notably on the issue of women's rights and democratisation.
This shows that the European Union's policy of gradually bringing Turkey closer to Europe is the right one.
Furthermore, despite all the problems, the emergence of a younger generation of leaders – in Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain and indeed Syria, for example – has created the opportunity for a cautious opening towards democracy.
We expressly welcome the release of political prisoners and the increased scope for political opposition.
The issue of women's rights in Morocco and the debate about the introduction of a divorce law in Jordan are just two examples that I would like to highlight.
Let me conclude with the Middle East conflict.
A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will help to ensure that hopefully, the spurious excuse that this conflict makes democracy impossible can no longer be used in future.
