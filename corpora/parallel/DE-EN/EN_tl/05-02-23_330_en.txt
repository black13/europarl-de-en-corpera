Mr President, much as I understand our Italian Members’ concerns, entrepreneurial decisions at a particular location within the European internal market can be changed only by agreement and not by governments that have no responsibility for them.
The appeal for intervention on the part of the German Government does not carry much weight.
I was interested to hear Commissioner Špidla say that there are no indications that the agreements have been breached.
Documents sent to me by Thyssen-Krupp state that the company invested EUR 700 million in the last few years and received a total of EUR 17 million in subsidies.
With a global steel market totalling one billion tonnes, it follows that domestic production of 1.2 million tonnes amounts to rather more than one-thousandth of global steel production, along with the 70 000 tonnes of magnetic circuit band with which we are concerned, for it is here that there have been losses, the cause for which is to be found not only in Italy, but also in the laws enacted by the European Union, in the high cost of energy and in the legislation on the environment.
I think of the requirements we have imposed on emissions trading, requirements demanded by the steel industry in particular, in order that the technical minimum standards that it already has should apply throughout Europe – for coal is indispensable to the production of steel, and there are technical limits in this field; I recall how consideration is being given throughout the industry to investing in a way that involves firms relocating to places where the Kyoto Protocol is not binding; I consider how the ore-smelters, particularly those in the countries that are major producers of raw materials, have announced an imminent 90% rise in the price of these, and the massive demand for them that exists in China.
All these things are framework conditions, and, to my mind, they make it necessary that the Commission should address not only what is happening at Terni – enormously important though that of course is for the workers concerned – but also the steel sector as a whole.
Over and above what is happening at Terni, it is for that reason that we demand, in paragraph 8 of the resolution, a communication, an inventory, and the setting-up of a high-level group, for we must, in the long term, safeguard steel as a raw material in the European Union, and hence its productive base and locations, albeit also independently of the latter.
This is an objective we all share, and so we support our Italian fellow Members in their initiative.
