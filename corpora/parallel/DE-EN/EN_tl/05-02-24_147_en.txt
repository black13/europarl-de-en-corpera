â€“ The impassioned speech by the previous speaker and the motion for a resolution before us, along with its justifications, which has been endorsed by all political groups in this House, are proof that action is urgently needed.
Those of us who live in prosperous countries have no idea of what is happening in many African states.
Immediately upon achieving so-called freedom after centuries of exploitation as colonies, many countries suffered another tyranny of the worst kind, for example in the case of Liberia under Charles Taylor.
We cannot remain indifferent to the catalogue of crimes of which a Special Court in Sierra Leone found Charles Taylor guilty in 2003, and we must do everything in our power to ensure the handover to the courts of this criminal, who, whilst in exile, is persisting in his attempts to destabilise Liberia and its neighbouring countries.
I support all the initiatives that this House has called for, yet it is with concern that I note that neither the UN, the UN Security Council, nor any of us yet possess anywhere near the authority for which world peace cries out.
International law and human rights require that all people of good will overcome their indifference, and that all possible means be used to find fairer and more peaceful solutions.
I should like to thank everyone in this House who has worked on this motion for a resolution.
