– Mr President, I obviously have no objections to this decision.
I should like to state, however, that this morning we agreed with Commissioner Potočnik to request that a Conference of Presidents open to all Members be held at 2.30 p.m. on 6 April – and I would ask that this be entered in the Minutes – in order to present the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.
We would further ask that Commission President Barroso, Commissioner Reding and Commissioner Potočnik be present on this occasion to outline the Seventh Framework Programme to the House, and I would ask that the Conference of Presidents take a decision on this matter.
