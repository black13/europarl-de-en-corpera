â€“ Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his outstanding answers, and to apologise for the fact that a fellow Member asked extremely aggressive questions, while not thinking it worth his while to wait for your answers to them.
I should like to thank you for taking this initiative, which bids this House continue its cooperation on the issue.
