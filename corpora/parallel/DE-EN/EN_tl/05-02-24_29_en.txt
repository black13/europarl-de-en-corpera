. â€“ Mr President, the destruction of a huge number of boats has meant that an entire sector of the economy has been damaged.
Aid can come in many different guises, and one way in which emergency aid could be provided would be to transfer fishing boats that would in any case be taken out of commission in the European Union.
These boats could, then, be taken out of service in the European Union, but the victims of the tsunami in South-East Asia could reuse them if they wished and asked to do so; they would, indeed, be exactly what would meet their requirements.
In order to provide emergency aid in this way, however, amendments must be made to the legal framework currently in force.
Most of the members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcome this opportunity, which will remain open to us only for a short period of time, although we are obviously aware of the many problems it entails.
In our opinion helping people to help themselves is always the better option in the long term, and this should be apparent from our amendments.
Yet we view this proposal as a political sign of solidarity, and will support it accordingly.
