– Mr President, I merely wished to extend my sincere thanks to all Members, especially those on the Right, who voted in favour of our amendments.
Unfortunately those Members were too few in number, and not enough consideration has been given to the social concerns that are of such crucial importance to us and to the public.
This means that we cannot vote in favour of this resolution, and we will continue to fight for the public’s social rights.
