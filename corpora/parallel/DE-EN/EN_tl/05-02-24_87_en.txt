– Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to give the following explanation of vote with regard to the vote on the human rights report.
We have voted in favour of the report as a whole, although there are a number of key paragraphs in it that we have been unable to endorse, above all the one relating to reproductive health and the Brazilian initiative.
I should like to stress that our Group voted against these points because we do not wish the human rights report to be used as a pretext for the liberalisation of abortion through the back door.
