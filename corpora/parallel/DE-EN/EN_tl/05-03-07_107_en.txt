Mr President, I do think it is permissible to defend oneself when a Member of this House, for demagogic reasons, consistently lumps Social Democrats in with Communists.
I think you too would defend yourself if you found yourself mentioned in the same breath as the UK Independence Party orother parties even further to the Right.
Members of this House are perfectly entitled to defend themselves against slanders of that sort.
