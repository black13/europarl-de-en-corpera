Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur.
The directive on the air traffic controllers’ licence is a significant step towards the realisation of our great goal of a single European sky.
For a start, the creation of functional airspace blocks across borders is dependent on it.
Secondly, there is now a presumption of harmonised licensing and training at a high level in this area, which also makes air traffic controllers more mobile, something that is urgently needed in view of the fact that Europe is short of some 1 500 of them.
Thirdly, standardised rules and regulations at a high level help to improve safety to a marked degree.
Let me say at this point how glad I am that the rapporteur has taken on board my idea of implementing harmonised training in crisis management techniques.
This will make us better prepared for extreme and dangerous situations such as the hijacking of aircraft.
What we see as important as regards increased mobility is that we should be able to reduce excessively stringent requirements as regards local languages – and here I am not talking about English – to justifiable individual instances.
This is the only way in which we will be able to prevent market foreclosure through the back door.
We Social Democrats also take the trade unions’ concerns seriously, and that is why we want explicit mention in the directive of social dialogue.
Particularly in view of the heated debate on the services directive, we also see it as important that the host country principle should apply to air traffic controllers; firstly, as a means of preventing social dumping, and secondly, in order to enable the controllers to work together as a team without that being undermined.
Now more than ever, being an air traffic controller is an attractive career, and one that can take you all over Europe, and I hope that it will be one on which even more young people will decide than they have done in the past.
