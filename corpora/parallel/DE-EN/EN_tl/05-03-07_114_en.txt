Mr President, warm thanks particularly to the rapporteur, who has managed – in the committee, at any rate – to bring this topic to a conclusion with a high degree of consensus, in a very agreeable atmosphere, and with a great deal of concentration on the matter in hand.
There are a few more points, of great importance to me in this context, that I would like to mention.
One is the issue of how we prevent social dumping; it has been apparent from the dialogue as a whole that we agree that this is something we cannot afford in an area in which the safety requirements are so stringent.
Secondly, we all attach great importance to training and safety, and here there is a need for more training on how to deal with extraordinary situations, such as hijacks and the like, in a job where people can be under extreme pressure.
My third point is that I too thought it important that the follow-up to this directive must cover, step by step, the staff right down the safety chain with any involvement in the decision-making process, for this is where there must be harmonisation across the board and where mobility must be ensured.
Above all, I would like to say something else about languages, one of the most interesting and most vigorously debated issues, where the impression was sometimes created that what it was about was not so much the mastery of the host state’s language, but rather the establishment of obstacles by way of the back door.
To that I would say that creating obstacles of this sort in this area would be to set up the wrong benchmark.
We have to ensure excellence in the use of the English language, and that is what this directive ensures.
I thank all Members of the House for their good cooperation.
