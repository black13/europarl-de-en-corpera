Mr President, I beg leave to make a comment on the procedure.
I would ask you first to have a vote on the services directive, for which there may or may not be a majority.
We can then – still in a split vote – move on to the software business.
If you have them both voted on together, you may well end up with a result that this House does not want in the least, and so I ask that we vote item by item.
