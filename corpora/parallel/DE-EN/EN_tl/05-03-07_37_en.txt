Mr President, millions of people around the world are currently observing International Women’s Day, and that includes Turkey, where, as we have heard, their demonstration was brutally suppressed.
I thank you for responding so rapidly and for sending out the right message.
We have to see the women of Turkey given their democratic rights, or else the country’s accession will come to nothing.
Something else I would like to mention is that this House will, tomorrow, be discussing the outcomes of the UN’s ‘Beijing + 10’ Conference.
The debate will begin tomorrow morning with an oral question, and the vote will be held at midday.
President Barroso has now sent out invitations to an exchange of information with ten members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality to be held at that same time.
This I regard as an affront, and none of our Members should have any part in such a meeting, held here in this House but ignoring the vote.
I ask that it be made clear to Mr Barroso that we have to do our duty here in the plenary, and it is there that we will be debating women’s rights.
