Mr President, thank you; another incident has occurred in Turkey to which I should like to draw attention.
It has been reported in the press that the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Gül, has been critical of the European Commission’s representative, Mr Kretschmer, and has, in fact treated with contempt the criticisms he has made in recent days.
Speaking as one who voted in favour of the commencement of negotiations with Turkey and is still committed to them, I believe that it is quite improper for Mr Gül to heap contempt on someone such as Mr Kretschmer, who is very calm and level-headed.
Let it be known to the Commission that we are right behind Mr Kretschmer in the justified criticisms he has levelled at Turkey.
Notwithstanding our support for the commencement of negotiations with Turkey, Mr Gül’s recent actions are unacceptable.
