Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it comes as a surprise to hear Members speak in this debate – the previous speaker, who has missed the point, being one of them – while not having been present for the vote on the report in the committee of which they are members.
Let me make it quite plain that the reason why this House is debating the report on the EIB today is that it lives out democracy, transparency and parliamentary oversight, and our cooperation with the EIB shows how dialogue with us has led not only to improvements and changes in the dialogue itself, but also in the work that is done.
You are doing a good job, and I would like to thank not only you for that, but also departing Vice-Chairman of the EIB’s Management Committee, Professor Ewald Nowotny, who is also Vice-Rector of Vienna’s University of Economics and Business Administration, for the outstanding work he has done.
What is the EIB?
It is a public bank, created by the Treaty on the European Communities to be the most important financial institution for the purpose of realising the European Union’s objectives through its own investments and those promoted by it.
It is to be hoped, then, that it is no accident of fate that this week finds us debating, along with the EIB, the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the preparations for the Spring Summit.
I regard you as a channel of communication for the Lisbon Strategy, with the task of supporting these very objectives of growth, employment, competitiveness, social cohesion and sustainability, and so I ask you also, in future, to present your reports in line with the Commission’s new Lisbon Strategy and the Member States’ plans of action, taking, in particular, even greater account of our paragraphs 5, 8 and 10, relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are at the heart of the European economy and play a central role in job creation.
