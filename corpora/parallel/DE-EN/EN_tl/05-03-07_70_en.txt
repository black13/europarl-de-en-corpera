Mr President, this report spells out the important role that the European Investment Bank plays in the EU’s development policies.
I think it needs to play an even more active part in realising the Millennium Development Goals in particular, and to show evidence of greater commitment to them.
While I am thinking here of the war on poverty in particular, I might add that too little has been said, among the topics addressed by the report, about investments within the EU.
Something also has to be said about current capacity for giving aid in rebuilding the regions devastated by the tsunami and the disastrous floods.
Effective though it was in media terms for Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, to announce up to EUR 1 billion’s worth of aid, to be arranged through the EIB, I would like to take this opportunity to ram the point home that the money will not flow if conditions remain as they are.
The EIB itself has pointed out on several occasions that it does not possess the mandate it needs to apply these funds in the region in question, and the cost of borrowing would be too high in the absence of co-funding from the Commission.
To requests for such co-funding, then, I ask the House not to turn a deaf ear.
