Mr President, I refer to Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure as they stand.
A lady Member has addressed me directly, and I do not know whether she or I have been misinterpreted.
I wanted, in any case, to reiterate, for the sake of clarity, that what I said related specifically to Article 21 of this report, which expresses precisely these concerns.
If, then, representatives of the two main parties in this House – forming a sort of Great Coalition – tell us that everything is all right, it must consequently be all right for someone who does not belong to that Great Coalition to say that things are not all right, and that brings me to my second point.
An honourable Member made reference to my absence from the vote on this report.
This has to do with the fact that I sit on three committees, the meetings of which clash with regrettable frequency, and I can hardly be in three places at one and the same time.
On a point of information, and for the sake of what is termed objectivity, let me point out that Ewald Nowotny – to whom the honourable gentleman referred – was one of the main sources of information for this critical report, so it is an unfortunate fact that we will have to carry on grappling with all these problems if we are to achieve the clarity and transparency that we do not as yet have.
