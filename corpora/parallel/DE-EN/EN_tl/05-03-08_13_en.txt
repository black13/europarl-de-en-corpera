Mr President, the Beijing Platform for Action was a milestone, and the Commission’s past policies often a beacon, in terms of policy on women’s issues.
I hope that will continue to be the case, and that the equal opportunities policy for women will not come to a standstill.
Today, Commissioner Špidla, I have been very disappointed by what you have said; you had a lot to say about what had happened in the past, but I heard little about what you want to do in the future.
We have waited a long time for this Gender Institute, yet you had not one word to say about the topic of gender budgeting.
I heard nothing from you about how we are meant to do away with the wage gap, which really is a cause for concern to us, not to mention the day for the elimination of violence against women.
The President-in-Office of the Council said it would be next year; you said that Amnesty International had already held one.
If so, so what?
We heard nothing about it.
I hope that a policy of equal opportunities will not be something just for today, but for 365 days in the year.
I would have liked to hear more about the prospects for one; what is the Commission thinking of doing now?
What I heard was actually no more than empty phrases.
As Mrs Carlshamre said a minute or two ago, the EU, too, is the scene of genital mutilations, honour killings and forced marriages.
I call on its Member States and on the Commission to do real work to coordinate action against these things, for what I believe we have to do today is to send out a message.
