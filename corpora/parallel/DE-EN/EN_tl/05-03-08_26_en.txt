Mr President, this year, too, 8 March, which is International Women’s Day, gives us the opportunity to draw attention to the situation of women, which continues to be unjust and unworthy of them.
Women continue to be disadvantaged and discriminated against in every area of life.
We are still far from achieving equality of opportunity in such areas as education and careers.
Women are often denied higher education.
The lack of childcare opportunities often makes it impossible for women to reconcile work and family life.
Even though the work they involve is demanding, typical women’s jobs are badly paid.
Women are continually on the receiving end of violence and victims of sexual assaults, often committed by those close to them.
There has recently been a renewed rise in the number of reports of honour killings and stonings.
A State of the World Population Report study published by the UN indicates that around 5 000 girls and women, in at least fourteen countries – Pakistan and Turkey among them – are murdered in the name of honour, although the number of such killings that go unreported is much higher.
In areas hit by crisis and war, in refugee camps and everywhere where public order has broken down, conditions are often catastrophic.
Around the world, 150 million women and girls suffer genital mutilation; it is estimated that at least 24 000 of them live in Germany alone.
In South Africa, a woman is shot dead by her partner or ex-partner every six hours.
I protest against the violence meted out by the police to the women who demonstrated in Istanbul at the weekend.
We all have to do much more for women’s rights.
I call on the governments to implement women’s rights and make them a reality once and for all.
There is an urgent need for women’s quality of life to be improved.
Women must be accorded the same rights as men.
There must be no violence against them!
