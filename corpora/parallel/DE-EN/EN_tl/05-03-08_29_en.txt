Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on this World Women’s Day, take up the issue of violence against women, which, everywhere, is on the increase.
The rise in the incidence of crimes against women, particularly the trafficking of them and forced prostitution, has risen so much in recent years.
Let me say, while I am on this subject, how profoundly shocked I am by recent events in Turkey, with women being brutally beaten up for demonstrating peacefully to draw attention to their concerns.
Let us turn from Turkey to Germany.
A young Turkish woman in Berlin, who had left her husband, was executed by her brothers on the open street with a shot to the head.
Her brothers seek to justify this brutal murder by reference to their family’s honour.
This honour killing was the sixth in four months in Germany.
Where is the outrage against these murders?
Why is society not more up in arms about them?
Violence against women goes on everywhere, even in families.
It is estimated that one woman in five is the victim of violence at least once in her life.
Such a state of affairs is intolerable.
Violence against women must at last find its way onto the political agenda, and not just on World Women’s Day.
Women who have been mistreated must not be shamed out of going public and drawing attention to their situation.
It is because they are victims, and have not committed any crime, that I am in favour of 2006 being declared the Year against Violence against Women, which is what the joint resolution on World Women’s Day calls for.
