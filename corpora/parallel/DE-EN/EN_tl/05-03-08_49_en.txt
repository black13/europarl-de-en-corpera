My group wholeheartedly endorses this report.
In the European Union at present, 68 million people are living in poverty and excluded from society, a state into which the unemployed, lone parents, and migrants are at particularly high risk of falling.
It is therefore not surprising that children from such households are at particularly high risk of falling into poverty as well.
In Germany alone, which is considered a rich country by EU standards, the number of children living in poverty is said by Unicef to have risen to 1.5 million.
There are three key factors that determine the proportion of poor children in rich countries: social policy, social trends and the way in which the labour market develops.
So it is that falling wages for the bottom 10% of the income scale has reduced family incomes in Germany by 23%.
Let me then, again call for this report to be adopted, and for the Council meeting in March to devote all its energies to the social situation in Europe.
