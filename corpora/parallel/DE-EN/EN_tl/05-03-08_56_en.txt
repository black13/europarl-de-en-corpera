Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, social cohesion can be said to have been successfully achieved when there is no section of society left to be simply written off.
This applies in particular to older workers, particularly to the women among them.
No longer must it be tolerated that, as has happened in Germany, the head of the state employment service can get away with calling for jobcentres to stop providing services for older workers in East Germany.
No longer must it be tolerated that thousands of unemployed people aged over 55 are simply, and officially, kicked out of society and their experiences of life and work consigned to the rubbish dump.
Any successful economy must build on the knowledge, and particularly the experience, of older people, and is in fact dependent on them if we are not to fall into the demographic trap.
It so happens that, although this was the line endorsed by the Commission in its communication at the beginning of this year, now, at the time of the mid-term review of Lisbon, nothing more is being said about real support for older workers.
