I am glad to see that the Lisbon strategy also covers the use of all forms of alternative energy, which must therefore be promoted accordingly.
While we are all aware that their use protects the environment and helps with compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, the positive effects of their use include, among many others, increased competitiveness, added regional value and the creation of jobs in rural areas.
I am therefore glad that the European Parliament, as stated in its motion for a resolution, believes that a competitive and sustainable European economy is conditional upon the use of sustainable energy sources.
