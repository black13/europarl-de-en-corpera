Mr President, right now, it is not difficult to feel some sympathy with the Commission and the Council as they try to find a sensible solution to the problem of the Stability Pact.
They have become victims of the EU’s self-chastisement and self-imposed captivity.
This Stability Pact was brought into being for reasons that were very transparent, particularly in the case of Germany, which later turned out to be the country that had the greatest problems with it.
I think one of the lessons we ought to learn for the future is that rushing these things is not the way to get them done, for the damage is now greater than the former short-term benefit.
The whole thing is a virtual ruin and has precipitated another crisis of confidence in Europe.
For the sake of the young and of all those who still, with a certain euphoria, believe in Europe, I really do hope you will manage to cut this particular Gordian knot.
It will be very difficult, but a lot of trust has been lost – and it was that trust that the Stability Pact was originally intended to build.
So, quite seriously, I wish you every success at the forthcoming Council, and at it, may you succeed in getting this stumbling-block out of the European Union’s way.
