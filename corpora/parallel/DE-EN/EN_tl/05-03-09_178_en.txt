Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, UN Resolution 1244 has absolutely nothing to say about the future status of Kosovo.
This resolution is already five years old.
Now that the Americans have announced their intention of resolving the status issue this year, the question arises as to whether the EU wants to take an independent initiative on this or passively await what others will come up with.
Unemployment in Kosovo is running at 70%, and people will invest in the place only as and when its long-term future is sorted out.
I would therefore like to know whether the Council is planning some kind of active preparation for this decision, which is evidently due this year?
