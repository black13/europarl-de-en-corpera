Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should merely like to ask one additional question.
Is this not a further example of something we discussed before, namely that the complex problems Kosovo faces cannot be resolved by means of the old ‘standards before status’ policy, and that the issue of status must finally be settled?
Standards will not be achieved if no one knows what the status is ultimately meant to be.
I should also like to raise a point of order.
I indicated a short while ago that I wished to put a supplementary question, and even though I did so very early on, it would appear that no one noticed.
