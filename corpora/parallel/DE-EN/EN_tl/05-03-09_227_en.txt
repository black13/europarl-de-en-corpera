Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find it extremely frustrating that you have not answered a single one of my questions in any way, shape or form.
I am not asking you about documents, but I am specifically asking what penalties Council members face if they disclose details of what has been said at Council meetings.
What action is taken against them?
My two other questions do not relate to the legal position, of which I am well aware, but to the steps you intend to take in response to accusations that you are a secret society.
It is not the legal position I am interested in, but the specific measures you plan to take.
In the public interest – and a great many members of the public are in fact keen to know this – I would ask you again to give a proper answer to the question as to what action is taken against a Minister or Council member who discloses details of who said what during confidential talks in closed session.
