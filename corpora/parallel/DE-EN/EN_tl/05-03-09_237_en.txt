Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whenever disaster strikes we are faced with the same problem: although preparations are made in advance for aid programmes, no market research or opinion polls are carried out among those hit by disasters, even though these are key prerequisites.
Is any provision made in the Action Plan for future victims to be asked what their real needs are when a disaster strikes, to ensure that they are involved in any plans that are drawn up?
