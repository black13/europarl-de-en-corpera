Mr President, Mrs Locatelli, I should like to thank you for your excellent work, and I should also like to thank our shadow rapporteur, Mr Brunetta.
We are all aware that we face a huge challenge in achieving the Lisbon goals.
Our aim is to spend 3% of GDP on research, of which two thirds should come from the private sector.
Put quite simply, if we demand this of industry, we should be aware that 50% of gross national income is generated by small and medium-sized enterprises.
Even more importantly, two thirds of all employees work for small and medium-sized enterprises, or in other words for companies with fewer than 250 employees.
The Sixth Framework Programme set a goal of 15%, which figure the major horizontal projects did not, in the end, achieve, even though the energy programmes were heavily oversubscribed.
I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Potoƒçnik to consider ways in which research activities can be prioritised in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises.
I believe that it is also necessary to determine at long last where the responsibility lies for efficiency and evaluation in the field of academic research.
Research generates know-how and values, and this process must be measured and evaluated.
Greater transparency is needed, and I would specifically ask that an -Research Programme be established.
We must ask ourselves how the simplest possible methods can be made available on the Internet for submitting applications to research programmes and providing funding for these programmes, and how we can ensure that the Commission also complies with the Late Payment Directive, which is applied in all other fields, but which the Commission has so far refused to accept.
We need top-quality automated processes and better instruments to make research findings more widely available.
