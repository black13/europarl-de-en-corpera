Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report; it is now up to you, Commissioner Potočnik, and your fellow Commissioners to ensure that the research priorities are implemented.
I should like to focus on just one of these priorities, which in all probability will be absent from tomorrow’s report, namely defence research.
After consulting the rest of my group, I have withdrawn an amendment on this matter in view of the confusion it could have caused, in connection with the Council.
Why have I decided to speak out in favour of defence research?
Our future Constitution provides for the development of the common foreign and security policy, which means that we will need to carry out research in this field, some of which will be secret.
We must therefore be capable of copying the Americans by adopting a ‘black box’ approach to individual projects.
Yet we should step up transatlantic research cooperation in other fields where research lies in the interests of humanity as a whole.
This will give rise to a research dialogue between equals that would be appropriate in the case of a number of other countries, as well as the USA.
