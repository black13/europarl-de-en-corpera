Mr President, Commissioner, your response leaves a great many questions unanswered and raises new ones.
I can tell you that the European public is far from happy with this regulation, and that there are a great many people who say that they no longer wish to fly to the United States because they do not enjoy being treated like criminals.
Such views are now widespread among the public, and cannot therefore be ignored.
I should like to ask a number of questions following on from the answers you provided.
You said that a review is now to be carried out after one year, and that Parliament will be informed of its outcome.
Am I to assume that you cannot yet tell us what will happen in the meantime with data that is being retained this year?
Am I to assume that you cannot provide us with any information on the way in which this data is currently retained, used and filtered, or that you do not wish to do so?
I should like to inform the Commissioner that this presents us with a major problem in terms of communication with the public.
This leads me to ask what approach is being taken to the issue of data protection, as this is something by which the European public sets great store.
What people want is information, Commissioner, and you should therefore be more open in your dealings with this House.
