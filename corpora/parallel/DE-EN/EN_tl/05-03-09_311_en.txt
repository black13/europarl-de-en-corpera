Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one would argue with the fact that Natura 2000 is an extremely ambitious programme with demanding targets.
It does a great deal to protect nature and the environment, and is also highly regarded by the public.
The land we value so highly was developed and cultivated and is now maintained by European farmers, forestry workers and landowners, and safeguarding this land is also a key goal of Natura 2000.
Appropriate funding must be guaranteed if we are to achieve these ambitious goals.
Although Natura 2000 has been in existence for a number of years, and even though landowners have had to tolerate certain restrictions for a great many years, this is the first time that thought has been given to appropriate financing at European level.
The Commission is proposing that the Natura 2000 network be cofinanced under the Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds.
As rapporteur for rural development, I must stress the need for a guarantee that Natura 2000 really will be financed under both funds, which will mean that we will need a larger budget for rural development.
The property rights of our farmers and landowners must not be encroached upon without a guarantee of full financial compensation.
Unless we safeguard funding in the long term, levels of uncertainty will continue to rise.
Commissioner, as a result of the decisions taken at Brussels, which included a cap on the agriculture budget until 2013, and following CAP reform, which moved funding for modulation from the first to the second pillar – or in other words to cofinancing for rural development – the priority must be to ensure that landowners and farmers in particular get compensation for their efforts.
We farmers have declared our support for sustainable agriculture.
More Europe cannot be achieved with less money, especially not now there are 25 Member States.
