Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Council, in the year 2000, set itself the ambitious objective of Europe becoming, by 2010, the strongest – in economic terms – knowledge-based society.
It would be good if we were to manage to become, if not absolutely the strongest knowledge-based society in economic terms, but one that is strong and – for this is another objective that must be listed, has a social orientation.
The results from the mid-term review are, alas, something other than favourable, and so we must, as a matter of urgency, implement in a consistent manner the strategies that have already been devised.
At the heart of the Lisbon strategy, alongside social cohesion, growth, and employment, is education, which underpins everything else.
There is a need for more investment in education, science and research, although this needs to go hand in hand with reforms in response to the changes in technology and society.
What that means in practical terms is that we need, among other things, learning that accompanies life rather than learning that is lifelong – that has the ring of punishment about it – along with the promotion of mobility in employment, science and research, cross-border educational opportunities, the recognition of degrees – for many of them are not yet accepted everywhere – and access to education for all.
In other words, there must be no cutbacks in education, no tuition fees, no depriving universities of resources, and no reduction in teaching hours, particularly in the natural sciences, for it is they that foster creativity and are therefore necessary both for the development of the individual, whether personal or professional.
Any strong, and socially-responsible society must also take the gender dimension into account, and so, at its Spring Summit, the Council must devote its attention to such issues as equal pay for equal work, about which much was said on Women’s Day yesterday, and also equality of opportunity.
