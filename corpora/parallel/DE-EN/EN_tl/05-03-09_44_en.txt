Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, objectively speaking, the enlargement of the European Union brings us into a new era of new beginnings.
So it is that people in other regions of the world look at us and wonder whether we, in the European Union, really are capable of competing internationally in a new age and of remaining so while maintaining and further developing high social standards.
Are we able to take economic and technical leaps into the new age while ushering in a new generation of production with higher – the highest – environmental standards?
The President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have presented us with very bold visions.
Commissioner Verheugen has spoken of values – values in the way businesses are run, values in social standards, values of social participation both in enterprise and in the life of society, describing these as vehicles with which the process of modernisation travels forwards.
While that is something I would underline, I do believe that the reality of life for many people is somewhat different.
They fear insecurity; they fear that these objectives will not be achieved in their day-to-day lives.
If we want to bridge this gap, our instruments must be reformed first, and then the gap must be bridged in the broad outlines of economic policy and elsewhere, where I want to hear no more of stale ideologies, but more of how people really live in society.
If what we are working on together in this House is to become reality, it is our own instruments that must be reformed.
