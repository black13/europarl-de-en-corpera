Protection of our natural environment can be achieved only by a real partnership between nature protection agencies and farmers, and so the Commission’s financial proposal must not jeopardise cooperation between them.
It is farmers, across the length and breadth of Europe, who both ensure that nature is accessible to all and produce healthy food.
Our farmers are in no doubt about what is required of them; they farm in accordance with best practice.
It is for that reason that there must be certainty about the additional requirements prescribed for FFH areas by the European Union, also being adequately funded by it: ‘he who places the order pays the bill!’
It is not acceptable that the funding of Natura 2000 should be to the detriment of other agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes.
Many issues have yet to be resolved.
Precisely what actions are ultimately to be taken in the certified areas is to be decided at regional level in the first instance.
It is important that funding for these actions should be in place.
Those resources intended only for the management and organisation of the Natura 2000 areas must be kept to a minimum.
We have to take care that there is no build-up of additional bureaucracy.
Rather than putting money into management, bureaucracy and administration, the projects that are funded must be efficient, must help the environment and achieve tangible results.
