Mr President, thank you for the opportunity today to make the House once again aware of the issue of Tibet, of which, if there is eventually to be a solution, it must again and again be reminded, particularly at a time when the human rights situation there and in China is increasingly glossed over and ignored out of the desire for improved economic relations.
You mentioned, Commissioner, that the Commission will get involved as and when both parties approach you.
For that, I fear, we will have a very, very long time to wait, for it is not exactly in China’s interest that Tibet and the suppression of its culture be publicly debated and exposed.
It is for us in this European Parliament – and also for all European delegations that travel to China – to spell out the fact that it is Tibet that will – and must – determine whether there is to be more cooperation between Europe and China, both in terms of improved trading relations and of whether or not embargos are to be lifted.
Let the Chinese Government be aware that the latest attacks on Tibetan religion are counter-productive in this respect.
