Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that society has, over recent years, started to make quite different demands of agriculture, and when I say that, I am thinking not only of CAP reform and of the current WTO negotiations.
If these demands are to be met in every area, it is understandable that the common market organisation for sugar has to be reformed.
That having been said, Commissioner, the role of policy must be to create fair framework conditions under which our farmers can continue to produce sugar in the European Union, and do so sustainably, economically, and in a socially acceptable way.
The communication presented by the Commission in July 2004 on the reform of the sugar sector does, however, by its approach, involve profound effects on, and changes to, the existing market organisation for sugar.
Although this House’s Committee on Agriculture is not opposed to such a reform, our motion for a resolution does advocate a moderate approach.
We reject the quota transfers that the Commission originally envisaged, believing as we do that quotas should remain with the producers, that is, with the farmers.
We also take the view that the planned cuts in prices and quotas will add up to considerable losses in income, and that we cannot disregard alternative uses either, for which there is a great deal of potential, particularly where biofuels are concerned.
Our farmers can expect to lose income, and for that they must be compensated accordingly.
I am confident, Commissioner, that this House will, when it votes today, endorse the compromise that the Agriculture Committee, over and above all party boundaries, has made such a good job of hammering out, and I very much hope that the Commission will listen to its messages when the time comes for it to present its legislative proposals.
We say ‘yes’ to reform of the sugar sector, Commissioner, but it needs to be done with sensitivity.
