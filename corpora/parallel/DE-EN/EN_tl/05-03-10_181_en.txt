Mr President, in the Middle Ages, the Lithuanians, the Poles and the White Russians constituted a triple federation, a central European kingdom.
Today, the Poles and Lithuanians are with us, and people talk as if Belarus were on the moon.
I recently received an e-mail from a member of the public who strongly protested at what he saw as our neglect of that country.
Such is not the case; here in the European Parliament, we are giving human rights in Belarus massive backing, awarding the Sakharov Prize to its citizens, holding debates on a regular basis, and really getting stuck in.
That, though, is the impression that the public get as a result of the Council’s absolute passivity, and, in particular, of the policies adopted by our nation states, whose interest in this issue is – with a few laudable exceptions – quite inadequate.
For these reasons, it is important that we should make it clear that items 3 and 4 in this resolution must be addressed with all speed; I refer to the investigation of the cases where people have disappeared, and the release of political detainees.
I would ask the other groups to lend their support to our amendment, whereby we may be able to do something for young people from Belarus, where, we agree, democracy and the rule of law must be advanced, and the nation states must at last awake from their torpor.
