Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must surely be possible to take the multifarious statements that have been made today and make of some of them a legislative proposal for making sugar production sustainable both here and in what we call the developing world.
To those, however, who believe that a global market price must be imposed, I would like to say that nowhere in the world could anyone produce at such prices in a way that does not harm the environment, is socially just, and is also rational.
That is utterly out of the question.
As Brazil is on everyone’s lips, let me say that, until a few years ago, the overwhelming majority did not care what happened to the plantation workers and the landless there.
I would warn against shedding crocodile tears, as Mr Deß has done, and many others to a lesser extent.
We are dealing here with a good measure of protectionism.
The Brazilian Government is endeavouring to introduce social and ecological standards in this area, and we should be supporting it in that.
If it succeeds in doing so, prices will rise in response to that, but let me remind you that they will still be only half what they are in the European Union.
I do believe, though, that we will come up with proper solutions.
