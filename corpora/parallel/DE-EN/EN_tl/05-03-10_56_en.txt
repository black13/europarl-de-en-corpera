Mr President, this is an important topic for us to be dealing with, and consumers will be becoming ever more aware of it in the future.
Our group has examined the issue of organic farming in very great depth, and regards it as very important.
Indispensable though traditional agriculture is, we also have to consider its organic counterpart, and not only as a small sectoral niche with limited aims, but as something that will in future be a truly complementary source of supplies.
For this reason, and also speaking for my group, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her particular concern for this issue, which she has again underlined in her brief statement today.
We must redouble our efforts.
We have to stimulate demand, and we can do that only if we are able to iron out or resolve the problems in production, processing and operation.
Although I do not, right now, want to go into details, for which I lack both the time and the capacity for attention, I do believe that a great deal of effort and quite a bit of imagination has gone into the 21 actions and three priority areas; what we need, though, is a bit more courage, including when it comes to setting aside the financial means needed to acquire human resources.
That this must involve a timetable and the necessary controls is self-evident.
