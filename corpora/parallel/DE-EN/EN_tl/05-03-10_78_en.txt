Mr President, there is something I just wanted to ask Mr Rübig.
I apologise for intervening, but last night, we agreed, indirectly and informally, that, on the last part, the European People’s Party and the Liberals would not vote for the deletion of the whole paragraph, and that we, in return, would vote in favour of the Conservatives’ and Liberals’ amendment.
Perhaps Mr Rübig would say something about that?
