Mr President, if I had been given the chance to speak in the debate on International Women’s Day and Beijing + 10, I would have said that it was actually a shame that violence against women is a long-running issue in this House, although thankfully it is less prevalent than other important problems that affect far more women – untold millions of them, in fact, who have for years been waiting for solutions called for, I might add, by overwhelming majorities in this House.
Let me take as an example the splitting of pensions entitlements acquired during marriage, so that a woman who wholly or partly gave up work in order to devote herself to her family duties is not left without social security after divorce.
We therefore need a framework directive to put a stop to divorce tourism in the EU.
I also recall our 1996 report on the status of spouses who help out in small businesses and in agriculture.
Ten years ago, we were demanding the lifting of directive 86 on the equal treatment of self-employed men and women and the spouses who help them out.
Nothing has happened!
If I may now turn to the battered wives, let me add that men get beaten up too.
Since 2003, Luxembourg has had a law that has already helped a great deal; its law on domestic violence bars violent men from the home, so that, if the man turns violent, it is he who has to leave the shared home, rather than the woman and her children having to flee to a refuge for battered women or to her family.
It would be appropriate if the Commission were to recommend to all the Member States that they adopt a law along those lines if they have not already done so.
There would then be no need for Beijing + 10!
