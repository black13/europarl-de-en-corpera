On this World Women’s Day 2005, I would like to focus attention on all women who go about performing their duties in a perfectly normal way.
I would like to make their primary concerns – provision for families, for children, and also for older people – matters of political interest.
We talk a lot about gender mainstreaming; I would ask that we also give thought to family mainstreaming when taking policy decisions that affect society.
In future, when taking policy decisions, we have to examine the effect they will have on families; state programmes for encouraging women to return to work, in particular, must in future be guided by the principle of family mainstreaming.
Work and society must fit the family rather than the other way round.
Agricultural statistics, for example, still take insufficient account of the work done by farmers’ wives.
On commercial farms, women work for around 63 hours a week.
Agricultural statistics first deduct around 50% under the heading of provision for the family.
Farmers’ wives do unpaid work at home, on the farm and for the family in exactly the same way as all women work in addition to the time they spend doing a job, but statistics take no account of what they do; it is still not taken seriously by society, and is not recognised as an economic factor.
Generally speaking, the services performed by women must be fully taken into account in calculating the gross national product.
