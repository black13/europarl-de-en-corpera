Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of creating the European Police College as a European Union institution is a goal shared by all of us.
If we are to get serious about combating crime in Europe, and if we are to declare war on organised cross-border crime in particular, our police services and law enforcement authorities will need a facility in which they can be trained.
If the Police College is to be a European institution, it has to operate in accordance with the European Union’s administrative and budgetary rules, and it is on these latter that the Committee on Budgets has focussed in its opinion for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
For a start, the EUR 4.5 million per annum to be allocated from 2007 onwards is dependent on the new financial framework, which has yet to be adopted.
Secondly, we take the view that the Member State in which the College is situated must make a financial contribution to it.
Thirdly, its Governing Board can adopt only a provisional establishment plan and draft budget, in any case until such time as Parliament, in December, adopts the overall Budget for the coming year.
Fourthly, in the event of justified derogations to the general principles of the Budgetary Regulation, the budgetary authority – that being this House and the Council – must be informed.
With their usual fruitful cooperation the Committee – led by the rapporteur – incorporated our amendments into its report, and for that I warmly thank them.
