Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I too should like to make use of the short time available to me to thank the rapporteur for his professional and competent work.
I agree with the Commissioner when he says that this is an extremely important report.
If the proposals it contains are implemented, it is safe to assume that they will bring about a number of improvements, not only with regard to the situation on Europeâ€™s roads in terms of social policy and labour law, but also, and quite definitely, with regard to road safety.
In order for these two goals to be achieved, however, the following four key principles must be observed.
The working week must not be any longer than the proposed 56 hours, the rules must also cover express delivery and courier services, digital recording devices must be introduced without delay and wage dumping, which is often to blame for the dangerous situations we have seen, must be outlawed.
On Wednesday this House will make a choice between increased safety and higher social standards on the one hand, and greater profits for a select few on the other.
To my mind, it is clear enough which way we should vote.
