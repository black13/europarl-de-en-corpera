Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common foreign and security policy that the European Union is engaged in developing necessarily involves joint regulation of weapons exports, and so I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Venezuela is currently engaged in a process of rearmament and that this, in view of the conflicts on its borders, is particularly likely to prompt a crisis situation.
If I may give an example, Venezuela has bought 100 000 Kalashnikov rifles from Russia, and, as its army consists of only 35 000 troops, one cannot but wonder for whom they are intended.
Venezuela has also signed a contract with a Member State of the European Union for the purchase of four corvettes, four patrol vessels, ten transport aircraft and two sea reconnaissance aircraft.
I would ask you, Mr President, to ascertain whether these actions are in breach of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
