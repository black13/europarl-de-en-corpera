Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cavada was quite right to raise just now the issue of Parliament’s involvement, and I think we should give more thought to our approach in such a sensitive area as this one.
Particularly as we are discussing the area of freedom, security and justice, I would like to focus on the planned proposal on data retention.
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – and I, as its rapporteur – had doubts about the legal basis for this proposal, and in this the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Commission and the Council’s Legal Service agreed with us.
I would now just like to know whether we can assume that the Council will do likewise and involve Parliament in the decision on this matter, or whether we can take it as read that the Member States will stick with their proposal in the full knowledge that they are setting themselves against three institutions.
I would be very interested to learn that as a matter of extreme urgency.
