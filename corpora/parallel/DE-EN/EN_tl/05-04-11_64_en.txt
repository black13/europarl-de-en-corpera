– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just been given a tangible example of what this debate is about.
The example – that of the framework directive on data retention – is an important one in terms of determining two quite different issues, the first being that of how the institutions relate to each other.
There is no point in coming out with fine principles concerning issues of the law, freedom and the safeguarding of rights, but not doing anything about them in a real-life situation involving relations between the institutions.
The question that Mr Alvaro highlighted has not yet been answered, and the Council was meant to do so today.
If this House and the Commission have justifiable misgivings about whether Parliament should be involved and, if it is to be involved, to what extent, then – if we are to get anywhere – the Council must give us its final decision on the matter today.
For months, we have had the feeling that this is an issue on which Parliament is being strung along.
We can debate as much as we like, but no kind of concrete and final decision is possible.
Parliament is not being involved, and no final decision is being taken.
The second issue is that no answer has as yet been given to the question Mrs Buitenweg raised just now about whether doing this sort of thing with data is actually necessary – about whether it is productive, whether it is helpful, whether it really will succeed in helping keep people in the European Union safe, or whether it adds up to nothing more than shooting from the hip at a time when the European Union was also in a situation of grave crisis.
Firstly, what role will Parliament play, and, secondly, at which stage of the process can we expect to play it?
To both these questions we expect precise answers.
The third question that needs to be answered has to do with what the actual point of this measure is.
