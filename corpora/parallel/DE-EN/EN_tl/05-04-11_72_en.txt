Madam President, I was rather irritated by two remarks that the President-in-Office of the Council made.
The first was that the Council would make no attempt to anticipate the provisions of the future Constitution.
The second was that, if we are doing something for security, we should not argue about its basis in law.
The former reflects a trend that has been apparent in debates over recent months, whether on counter-terrorism or data collection; one cannot help thinking that the Council has for some time been wandering around the outermost limits of the existing Treaties, and has – ever more glaringly and with ever-increasing frequency – been going against the guarantees of fundamental rights.
I am thinking here of air passengers’ data and the debate on the collection of telecommunications data.
It is very evidently high time something was made clear, namely that the Constitution’s improvements in terms of what can be done for internal security, and the improved instruments it contains, are inseparable from the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and from Parliament’s involvement across the board.
The two cannot be put asunder.
For that reason, as regards adherence to fundamental rights and to the foundations underpinning our laws, we will fight it out with you.
