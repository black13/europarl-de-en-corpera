– Mr President, I would call for the vote on the accession of Romania to be adjourned in accordance with Rule 170(4).
The House has just voted in favour of the resolution by an overwhelming majority, yet if Members actually read this resolution, they will discover that, although the progress made by Romania on economic matters has been admirable, progress on political issues, such as freedom of the press and corruption, has been such that no one can claim that Romania could join the EU in its present state, at least not if we are to believe everything we have written in our own report.
It has frequently been said before – and we repeat it now – that we are in favour of accession and that we have faith in the new government.
The question we must ask, however, is why we should give the benefit of the doubt to a country experiencing such fundamental problems with democracy as corruption and a failure to protect the freedom of the press.
No country can overcome problems of this kind in a hurry.
We are therefore proposing that ...
It was suggested during our group meeting that Members will be required to vote either in favour or against during the vote, with abstentions not being allowed, as is the case in an assent procedure.
I would ask the President whether it is possible to abstain from voting in an assent procedure, as previously Parliament’s Rules of Procedure only allowed Members to vote in favour or against in such instances.
We would also like the Bureau to explain the electoral legislation to us.
