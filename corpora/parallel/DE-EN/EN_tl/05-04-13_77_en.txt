â€“ Mr President, we have heard a truly very important statement by the President of the European Council and I should like to thank the Luxembourg President-in-Office, Jean-Claude Juncker, and also Mr Schmit, for withdrawing the Council's previous reservations and for safeguarding the financial and other rights of the European Parliament.
That is a major success.
For those who do not know what has happened over the last few hours, we as a group decided yesterday evening that we would request that our assent to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania be postponed on the grounds that Parliament's rights, in other words our financial rights, had not been safeguarded.
As we now see that the Presidency has managed to remove this reservation, our Group will not request that the decision be postponed; on the contrary, everyone will vote according to their conscience.
I thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for the efforts that you have made in the last few hours.
