. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we could have had all this earlier on.
In these negotiations, Parliament’s delegation went to the pain threshold.
I am delighted that the Council has now been able, at the last minute, to agree to this Joint Declaration, which is meant to be a declaration by the Council and Parliament.
As far as the procedure itself is concerned, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and I agreed the following right at the end of the trilogue: the proposed oral amendment by the chairman of the Committee on Budgets – as you have just heard – is to replace our entire report.
This is the only plausible way forward.
We would ask you to vote on the oral amendment proposed by Mr Lewandowski instead of our report.
This will guarantee that Parliament, that plenary today also accepts the Joint Declaration by the Council and Parliament guaranteeing budgetary rights.
