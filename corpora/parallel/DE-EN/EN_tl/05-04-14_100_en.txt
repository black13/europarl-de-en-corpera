I fully endorse the motion for a resolution on ‘Doping in Sport’.
Over a decade ago, I was myself an active weightlifter, although I never, unfortunately, managed to achieve that bodybuilder’s dream figure that was so much in favour with women.
Today, I am glad that I took only lots of protein, and never clenbuterol or anabolic steroids.
Both amateurs and professionals who dope themselves in the hope of finding sponsors, or financial support, and thereby perhaps fame, pay a high price for it.
So often, what was then a star body is now not something you would want to look at.
The IOC’s World Anti-Doping-Agency, which organises intensive research and the monitoring and listing of prohibited substances has acted late in the day, but not too late.
Last year, Germany’s national anti-doping agency carried out 8 000 inspections of training camps and competitions.
In future, doping tests are going to be carried out at 20% of all UEFA competitions.
We need common international standards if monitored athletes are not to be put at a disadvantage in comparison to those who have not been adequately tested.
What is needed is for those who manipulate the winning of their medals and prizes for the sake of profit or fame to be socially stigmatised for it.
Only if sport is doping-free does it deserve recognition, and only if they are clean are sportsmen real examples to others.
