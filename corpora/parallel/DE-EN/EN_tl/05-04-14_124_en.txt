Mr President, Shah Kibria, a former finance minister of Bangladesh, had just finished a speech at an event of that countryâ€™s main opposition party, of which he was a member.
There, upon the spot, he was blown to bits by a grenade; three other people were killed and fifty wounded.
It is with attacks such as this that Islamic extremists have created a climate of fear.
There are parts of the country in which public offices appear to be collaborating with them.
This is an intolerable situation.
Amnesty International and the United States confirm that members of religious minorities are being systematically intimidated, persecuted and are subject to arbitrary arrest.
No satisfactory improvement has occurred either in response to the last resolution by this House, in November 2002, or to the last visit to the country by our SAARC delegation, in February 2003.
Recently, though, the government has had two leaders of Muslim criminal organisations imprisoned and their bank accounts frozen.
We call upon the government to be more vigorous in taking action against extremists.
Bangladesh must also meet its obligations under the internal conventions on human rights that it has ratified.
It must outlaw torture, guarantee press freedom and the free expression of opinion, and press on with the fight against corruption.
Only if it achieves perceptible progress in these areas should the conditions of the 2001 EU/Bangladesh cooperation agreement apply, for it was and is founded upon respect for human rights and the maintenance of democracy.
The differences that exist between the government and the opposition must not stand in the way of their at least agreeing to allow the parliament, currently suspended, to resume its functions.
Both sides must then work to create conditions that do not allow radicalism, paramilitary activity and religious extremism to operate.
