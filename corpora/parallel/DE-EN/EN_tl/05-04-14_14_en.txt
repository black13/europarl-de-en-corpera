Mr President, all those who have so far contributed to this so-called debate by reading out texts have expressed their vehement opposition to doping.
Nevertheless, there are probably two sorts of people in existence with an interest in sport.
There are those who – at least partly thinking of the success it can bring – are indeed in favour of doping and turn a blind eye to it; and there are those who do not.
It goes without saying that I count myself among the latter; I believe that every instance of doping strikes to the heart – so to speak – those who are interested in sport, and young people in particular.
Our friend on the Left argued that doping is inseparably associated with capitalism and is foreign to totalitarian states; I believe the opposite to be the case.
The purity of sport becomes all the more important as economic conditions become tougher and as the problems that small businesses and the self-employed face become greater; that is why we have a real chance to put a stop to doping.
Where the Seventh Research Programme is concerned, though, I would welcome it if you were to concentrate on football.
There are practical issues here: is it indeed the case that the G 14 – the association that monitors the Champions League in particular – is preventing checks on doping?
Is it the case that youth teams in particular avoid carrying out doping tests?
I can do no other than encourage you to ensure transparency in these areas.
