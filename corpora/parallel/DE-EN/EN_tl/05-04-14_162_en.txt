Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my group.
There has been a technical glitch.
We had asked for the final vote on the other groupâ€™s motion on Lampedusa to be by roll call.
That has gone astray for some reason.
On behalf of my group, I ask you to conduct the final vote on the Lampedusa resolution by roll call.
