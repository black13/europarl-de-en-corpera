Mr President, I too would like to highlight how crucial it is that this convention is, politically speaking, underpinned by the concept of art and culture possessing a dual character.
On the one hand, we are dealing with commodities, but art and culture are never merely commodities; they are always bearers of meaning, of identity and of aesthetic expression.
That is the crucial reason why they cannot simply be made subject to the operation of the market and the logic of liberalisation.
That is the case where pluralism in the mass media is concerned, and it is particularly true in the protection of public broadcasting, which guarantees a particular quality and makes the claim of providing as many people as possible with access to culture.
It is because pure market forces and doctrinaire liberalisation put such an approach at risk that it is so important that we should succeed in securing this convention on the protection of cultural diversity as a matter of policy.
I too would like to stress the absolute necessity of our remaining strong and united in these negotiations and of the Member States of the EU truly speaking with one voice.
Internally speaking, this House’s participation – including in the definition of an explicit mandate – must be guaranteed.
What is crucial in external terms is that – as has already been said – negotiations with UNESCO be concluded in good time, thus ensuring that we do not lag behind the WTO and GATS rounds.
If we, and our protective agreement, are not to be left standing by the logic of the market and made subject to it, what we need is an effective legal instrument.
What we demand for the world out there must also be protected within the European Union.
That is why the services directive must continue to guarantee the protection of cultural diversity, and that is why it must not apply to these goods.
