Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the maintenance and promotion of cultural diversity is an important task both within and outside the European Union, one to which this House has always given political priority.
This issue touches upon the most important democratic values – freedom of opinion, tolerance and dialogue between cultures among others – values deserving of protection.
The convention under discussion is an important instrument of international cooperation in safeguarding these cultural values.
In order to hold our own on the international stage, we need a mandate, and we need our position to be beyond any doubt.
Globalisation is a threat to cultural diversity and media pluralism.
To the national governments, too, this convention gives a legal framework for taking measures necessary to the protection – and, where necessary, also the promotion – of cultural diversity.
Contrary to what we are often told, it is not a protectionist instrument; nor is it a blank cheque.
It does, however, improve the international exchange of cultural goods, and fosters diversity.
This is not about us going on a crusade against the WTO or – to put it bluntly – against America.
We simply want the convention and the WTO and GATS negotiations to complement each other.
What we have at the moment is something like the battle between David and Goliath.
This is about strengthening David so that he may prevail in this battle, which is being fought in the interests of the cultural diversity that we have to protect, and it is for that reason that we need to agree on a common approach within UNESCO, so that we may prevail in the GATS and WTO negotiations.
I want to underline what Mrs Hieronymi and Mrs Trüpel said: within the European Union, too, we have to ensure that the services directive does not apply to audiovisual materials.
