Mr President, all Members have a copy of the update I have proposed, which involves the following substitution in paragraph 8:
‘… report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change presented to the UN Secretary-General on 1 December 2004’ with ‘… report presented by the Secretary-General of the UN entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all” on 21 March 2005.
This simply involves an update.
As Mr Samuelsen raised the problem of names in connection with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia I would point out that this problem does not occur in the text to be voted on.
If it were to occur at all, it would be in the justification, but that is not what we are dealing with.
