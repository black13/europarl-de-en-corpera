Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, to date, unfortunately, we have paid too little attention to the tragedy of Europe’s Roma, Sinti and other tribes.
It was at one time possible for people to move freely around Europe, with a lifestyle and culture of their own free choosing.
The 20th century, alas, was marked by the attempted wholesale extermination of certain peoples.
During the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia there were two concentration camps for Roma, one at Lety in Southern Bohemia, and the other at Hodonin, near Kunstat in Moravia.
Considered in terms of human rights, politics, morality and simple humanity, a pig farm strikes us as an absolutely unworthy occupant, for the past 40 years, of the site of the former concentration camp at Lety.
A place where many thousands of people, many of them children, suffered, and where hundreds of them died, must no longer be allowed to be the scene of such degradation.
Of the approximately 6 000 Roma and Sinti who lived in the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in 1942, only some 600 returned home in 1945 from the concentration and extermination camps.
That amounts to one tenth of them.
It is because this is now no longer merely a problem for the Czech authorities, but rather a problem for Europe, that we are calling for this piggery to be relocated and for a memorial worthy of the victims of Nazism to be erected on the site of the former concentration camp.
This was the theme of an exhibition we mounted last week in this House.
I have documentation on the subject with me now.
I would ask you to back this call, and thank all the groups in this House for their cooperation.
