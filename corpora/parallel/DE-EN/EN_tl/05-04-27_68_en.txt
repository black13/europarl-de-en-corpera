Mr President, 21 April saw an important vote held in the Committee on Budgets.
It had to do with the EUR 90 million calculated at the time to be available to Parliament from the EU Budget.
An oral amendment was moved to the effect that, from this amount, EUR 60 million should be tucked away in the reserves.
Being a member of the Committee, and entitled to vote in it, I spoke to oppose this oral amendment.
In line with Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure, it ought then not to have been voted on, but that was something that Mr Lewandowski, who was in the chair, chose to disregard.
I now call on you to use your powers as President to get this vote reversed and to stop the report on the subject reaching the plenary.
A similar written request has already been sent to the Bureau.
