. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise the need to consider this report in a wider context, in association with the following events and facts.
Firstly, it has to be considered in the context of the pressure that the Lisbon process puts on health care and on the social insurance systems in order to turn them into services capable of being marketed throughout Europe.
Secondly, when considering it, we have to bear in mind the fact that the services directive will make health care subject to European competition rules and to the country of origin principle.
Thirdly, as is emphasised at various points in the report, one consequence of population change is that, in many Member States, healthcare systems are regarded as an intolerable burden on the national budget, and this has had a markedly detrimental effect on the working conditions of healthcare personnel.
The Commission’s latest proposals give backing to this trend.
The report plays a crucial part in preparing for a fundamental choice between what has been proposed by the Commission and the Council on the one hand and by Parliament on the other.
The question at issue is whether health care and social protection systems should remain wholly within the sphere of services of general interest or whether they should be made subject to the competition rules of the internal market.
Parliament’s response, in no uncertain terms, to this is that health care must continue to be considered as a service of general interest, and universal access for all – regardless of their purchasing power – must be guaranteed.
In this report, moreover, this House makes it quite clear that systems of financial solidarity must be neither abandoned nor reduced to empty shells.
I hope that the Commission will, in its future proposals, take on board the detailed amendments in this report, which constitute a clear and alternative response to the challenge we face.
