– Mr President, let me start by making a brief comment on what Mr Mann said.
If he wants to highlight the need for costs to be cut in healthcare provision, he ought not to ignore the part played by the pharmaceutical industry.
I regard the failure to address this as a defect in the report we are discussing.
I want, though, to draw your attention to something else – the link between the lack of doctors in EU Member States, to which the report refers, and the Working Time Directive, which is currently under discussion.
Doctors in many German hospitals complain of poor working conditions and intolerable working hours, and the criticism levelled by the women among them is that deliberate mobbing makes it more difficult for them to balance work and family.
This often adds up to overworked and stressed-out doctors, who may move to other countries or even leave the profession altogether.
Those who bear responsibility for the misguided health and personnel policies of recent years are now trying to make the workers pay for their failures.
They do this by drawing a distinction between active and non-active on-call time, the latter of which they refuse to pay for, claiming that thousands of new healthcare posts would be needed if they were to do so.
The employers’ association of the German ,and individual ministers in the ,have given us examples of what they mean by non-active on-call time: time spent on general visits, changing dressings, time outside ordinary working time spent doing infusions, injections, and routine chores such as dealing with correspondence.
I see this as a whole new kind of exploitation, and I ask Members not only to support our amendments, but also, when considering the Working Time Directive, to see to it that what the Commission has drafted does not go unchanged.
