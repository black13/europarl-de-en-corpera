Mr President, I would like to put forward an oral amendment.
I ask that the words ‘and countries seeking accession’ be added in all the paragraphs in which action is demanded on the part of the Member States, the candidate countries, or the Council, as Recital H makes explicit reference to Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This would make no sense if these regions were themselves not called upon to take action.
I will want to bring in another oral amendment when we get to Recital H.
