Mr President, I have another oral amendment to move, and it has to do with Recital H. I simply do not think that the original version of this, as it stands, does justice to the facts of the situation by stating that the Roma in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to be victims of ethnic cleansing.
I propose that this recital be amended, for the sake of clarity, to read as follows, and will now read it out in English.
‘whereas a large number of Roma were victims of war and ethnic cleansing and continue to be victims of persecution in parts of regions of the former Republic of Yugoslavia’.
