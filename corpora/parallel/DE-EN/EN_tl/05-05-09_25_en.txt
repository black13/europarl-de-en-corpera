Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to tomorrowâ€™s vote in the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective for the 2007-2013 period.
As rapporteur for the funding and programming of rural development in this period, I ask you, Mr President, to lend your support to the justified expressions of concern in relation to, and demands for, adequate financial resources for the ongoing development of rural areas, so that their development in line with the requirements of Lisbon and Gothenburg may continue to be guaranteed in future.
