Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House something that can scarcely be called good news.
With effect from 1 January 2005, quotas on textiles and clothing became a thing of the past in Europe, and, since then, dramatic changes have occurred.
Within three months, textile imports from China have risen by a quite considerable extent â€“ by 700-800%, in fact.
A firm in my electoral district, having already sustained serious losses as a result of this flood of imports, has seen its order book reduced by 8%, and as many as 9% of its workforce have already been laid off.
This change puts millions of jobs throughout Europe at risk.
I therefore call on Members of this House not only to support the Commission in its action to deal with these developments, but also to use their influence on it in such a way that these measures may be made even tougher and even more effective.
