Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figure of four million victims just quoted by the President-in-Office of the Council shows how important this topic is.
We are all agreed that small arms have to be prevented from getting into the wrong hands.
Here in Europe, in the European Union, the state has a monopoly on the use of armed force, and that is of enormous benefit.
Circumstances here are different from those in the United States, where this is not understood in the same way.
What that means is that the use of small arms is reserved to soldiers and police officers, with special arrangements being made for those engaged in hunting and in shooting as a sport.
It is vitally important that every single weapon here in this European Union of ours is actually registered, or in other words that its origin is known.
A problem arises when these weapons find their way into countries outside the European Union, and this is what makes it so important that the code of conduct on the export of arms, as it stands at present, should be further tightened up and that we prevent, in so far as possible, at least the supply of weapons to the trouble spots where, in fact, this extraordinary number of people are killed.
To do so will involve developing a tracking system, in which every single purchase or sale of such weapons is recorded by being entered in an international register, thus making it possible to trace a specific weapon back to its origin and to its manufacturer, and to determine who was responsible for it being sold and who for it being passed on.
For this, international agreements are needed, and that is what makes it especially important that we, in this House, should play our part in actually taking these projects – set in motion by the United Nations – further and bringing them to a successful conclusion.
