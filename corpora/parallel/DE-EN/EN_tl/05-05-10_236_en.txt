Madam President, Commissioner, I think the Commission’s public information policy has two dangers to contend with: the first is that of excessive reliance on a few major languages, of which English is one, and the second is concentration on Brussels, or centralisation in it.
What is the Commission planning to do to make information less centralised, and to make Commissioners more readily and directly available to the press in the Member States?
There is, of course the ‘Europe Direct’ network of information centres; only this last weekend, I was present at the opening of one in Furth im Wald, and it is splendid.
There are, though, still too few of them, particularly in the new Member States.
I would like to ask whether the network will cover the whole of Europe this year?
