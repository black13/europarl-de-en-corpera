Madam Commissioner, the mechanism you have described has to do with the permanence of the investment rather than with any relocation that may already have taken place.
Decisions on where to base a business are always taken in response to market considerations â€“ infrastructure, the market to which the firm intends to sell, the tax position in different places and the state of the labour market, but subsidies do not enter into it.
This is something that European regional policy must take into account, as these subsidies are primarily windfall gains.
In terms of getting the European ideal accepted, they are absolute poison, particularly in the regions affected by site closures, and their end product is in fact nothing whatever; they produce neither additional jobs nor added economic potential.
Nevertheless, let me again ask the Commissioner: what additional mechanisms can we bolt on to exclude the possibility of subsidies being given to firms that have already relocated?
