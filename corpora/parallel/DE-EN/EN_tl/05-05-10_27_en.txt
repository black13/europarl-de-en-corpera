Madam President, I am glad that you, a lover of the coastline, are in charge of this sitting, and you know that.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done in tandem with the shadow rapporteurs.
I think we have here a sensible compromise ready for tomorrowâ€™s vote, one that all the groups can support, and that will bring this matter to a close.
The world is not, alas, the way we would like it to be.
There have been terrorist attacks, which endanger the transport of persons and goods.
Something must be done about them, and that is what this directive attempts to do; the upshot is that we have to take preventive action.
One point that has to be made in this context, though, is that responsibility for security cannot, ultimately, be passed on to the ports alone; this is, on the contrary, a task for all those involved in transport, and that is something we must not forget.
Security begins with the person loading on the goods, and it must, ultimately, involve both road and rail, or else we will end up with distortions of competition and with something else that we do not want, in the shape of more traffic on the roads rather than on water.
This, I think, has to be taken into account.
Unless I am mistaken, the Commission has already started giving consideration as to how this aspect may be included.
