– Thank you, Commissioner, for that exhaustive answer.
The phenomenon against which we have to contend is the discrepancy between what happens, and what is felt by those to whom it happens, and so I would like you to tell us what measures are going to be taken as part of the information campaign in order to get the projects you have just described across to small and medium-sized businesses as quickly as possible, enabling them to prepare themselves for these projects?
Secondly, what, in practical terms, is going to be done about a timetable and a plan for implementing what is described under the headings ‘Reducing bureaucracy’, ‘Impact assessment’ and ‘Getting rid of over-regulation’?
We have heard the promise that there will be a new framework for SMEs, and I believe that there will be one; the only thing is that we are constantly being asked what is now actually happening in practical terms over and above what was decided on in the past, what the new framework that Commissioner Verheugen wants to bring in will be like, and what its actual priorities will be.
