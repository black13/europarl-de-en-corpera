Thank you for creating such a friendly atmosphere, Madam President.
Since being elected, this House has set up an Intergroup on SMEs, and I would like to invite the Commission to appoint the representative with responsibility for SMEs as a permanent member of it, in order to keep them up to date with what is going on.
We meet in Strasbourg on a Wednesday every other month.
I ask you to pass on this invitation to Commissioner Verheugen and to ask him, at the July part-session, to give us more concrete examples of what you have been saying today.
He may then be able to put things rather more in context.
