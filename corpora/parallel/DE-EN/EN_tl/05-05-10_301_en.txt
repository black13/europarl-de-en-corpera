Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, that the directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications will, tomorrow, by a large majority, pass through its second reading.
The new directive replaces a hotch-potch of 15 old ones, thus ensuring greater transparency and legal security.
This directive will make it easier for EU citizens to seize the opportunities they have to work in other European countries, something that the problematic state of the labour market in many Member States is making ever more important.
Although it removes unjustified restrictions on mobility imposed by an excess of bureaucratic regulation in Member States, there is no reason to fear that there will be a rush to ‘dumb-down’ qualifications.
Those who settle in a Member State on a permanent basis may be required to have passed an aptitude test or to have completed further training.
They register in their new country, rather than – as originally planned – in the one that they left.
This directive also stipulates that the right to monitor them remains with the country in which they have settled, and establishes minimum standards applicable across Europe for professions with which certain risks are associated, such as doctors, pharmacists, midwives and architects; the level of qualification is guaranteed by five levels dependent upon the length and standard of training.
It also imposes the obligation on professionals of informing clients or consumers about their qualifications.
We believe that this directive does a good job of striking a balance between the freedom of movement and quality protection, and I hope that the planned services directive will do nothing to interfere with this.
