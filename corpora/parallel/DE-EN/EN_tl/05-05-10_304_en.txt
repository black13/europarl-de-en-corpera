Mr President, many thanks are due to Mr Zappalà for the good work he has done, but, in my capacity as the senior representative of the German Social Democrats in this House, I extend particular thanks to Mrs Weiler, who has made a decisive contribution to the debate and played her part in helping us to conclude this important piece of legislative work at second reading stage, without having to take things further, to the Conciliation Committee.
That is very important, and I am very glad of it.
I am also very glad that both this House and the Council have managed – and who would have thought this possible? – by means of this legislative document, and with such overwhelming consensus, to bring to nought the Commission’s original approach, which relied on the country-of-origin principle.
I have heard a lot of people today expressing approval of the way we did this, with this law making a very clear statement that it was not the country-of-origin principle that would apply, for it is un-European, but that we were working on the basis of mutual recognition and wanted to continue to do so.
If we are to legislate with any consistency – just as the Commission was consistent in twice proposing the country-of-origin principle – it is now time for this House to be consistent and do the same thing with the services directive too.
That would be a good job of work, and we should do it.
I also saw it as significant that the new Commission, this time, accepted the proposal I had put forward at first reading for the adoption of European professional identity cards.
That is the right way to really drive forward mobility, the opening-up of markets, the opening-up of the borders that still, alas, exist in the European Union and to ensure that this works.
I wish us every success in the vote, which is to be held tomorrow.
