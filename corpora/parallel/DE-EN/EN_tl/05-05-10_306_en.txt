Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are very many examples – to be found not least in my own country – of the ways in which complicated and long drawn-out procedures are used to hinder the recognition of professional qualifications and hence to keep out competing outsiders, to the benefit of one’s own people.
In Europe, it is often easier to get an American qualification recognised than one acquired in a neighbouring country.
The compromise we now have is well thought-out and a significant success, introducing as it does minimum standards for vocational and professional qualifications at five different levels, while, at the same time, preventing any devaluation of standards.
I will repeat what has already been said by previous speakers, that it is the host country principle rather than the country-of-origin principle that has been laid down as a minimum requirement for the various professions.
It is intended to be the basis for unambiguous rules intended to facilitate, if at all possible, the automatic recognition, in all Member States, of the professional qualifications of all EU citizens, whether they be employed or self-employed.
What has come out of the trialogue sessions is a comprehensive and good compromise, one that we Greens, too, are happy to recommend.
