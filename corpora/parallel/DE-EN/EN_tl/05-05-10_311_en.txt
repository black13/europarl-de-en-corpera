Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Zappalà, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is very clear evidence of the good work done by everyone concerned.
Achieving a result like this in such a problematic subject area is something to which one must draw attention.
Our task is to make the four freedoms a reality in the European Union; our objective, to build the internal market, making it a domestic market for all – employers, workers and consumers alike.
This is a directive in the service of the Lisbon strategy, in the service of the internal market and in the service of the Constitution, and it is a directive in the service of ‘unity in diversity’.
The directive also testifies to the European Union’s desire that quality standards should be maintained rather than downgraded, and to our recognition of specific professional criteria.
For the first time, this directive modernises the Community’s system for recognising professional qualifications.
It demonstrates the respect we have for what the liberal professions do for the common good; by it, we are visibly simplifying regulations and making them more transparent rather than adopting new ones, and demonstrably promoting the free movement of skilled workers, while affirming the bodies – such as professional associations – that represent their interests, rather than simply suffocating them in European red tape.
This directive is also, of course, evidence that, even now, the services directive’s country-of-origin principle applies to none of the provisions of the directive on professional qualifications that apply in the destination country.
This means that this directive complements the services directive.
As they complement each other, I believe that the work we have done on this directive should be a good example for future work on the services directive.
Let us hope that our success will be just as evident when this debate is over.
