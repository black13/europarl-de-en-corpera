Madam President, I would like to remind the House that we really do have to take responsibility for Europe’s social dimension, quite simply because many believe that the accession of the 10 new Member States will make it a utopia.
A social Europe requires minimum standards, and so we reject the Commission’s amendments to the Working Time Directive, which suspend these standards and turn the directive into nothing but an arbitrary abstraction.
These amendments involve, among other things, the new-found idea of dividing on-call time into active and inactive working time, with parts of it no longer recognised as working time.
As we see it, time spent on stand-by must continue to be regarded as working time.
Worker protection and the safety of the public must continue to be given priority over economic considerations.
Health workers working shifts of 30 hours or more put patients at risk; I do not think that there is any room for compromise here, and the ruling of the ECJ backs me up in this.
Although I wish to thank the rapporteur for including this crucial sentence in the report, we cannot support the compromises that follow it.
We see here a need for improvements, for we believe that on-call time must continue to be regarded as working time.
