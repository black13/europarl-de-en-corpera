Madam President, if we want to win the European public over to the European project, the EU must not become a self-service store where social and labour law are concerned.
It is because an welfare state is not an option that the opt-out clause must be done away with; this currently permits derogations from the maximum working week, and has already, in the United Kingdom, resulted in 700 000 employment contracts that disregard the 48-hour working week.
This is a good compromise, not least because, through the social partnership, it enables the trade unions to intervene.
Let me end by appealing to our friends in the Confederal Group of the European United Left.
In the last Parliament, we voted on the Tobin tax, and would have won the vote if you had voted alongside us.
Watch out, or else your votes this Wednesday might enable the hardline conservatives to get what they want!
