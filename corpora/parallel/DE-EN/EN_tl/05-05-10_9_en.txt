Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have, over the past few days, observed the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945, but we also recall 1 May 2004, when the division of Europe came to an end.
Now, in Europe, what belongs together can grow together, and the TEN projects help to bring this about, but we also know that the 30 TEN projects are a wish-list drawn up in a spirit of national ambition.
The bridge over the Straits of Messina has nothing to do with European integration, but it is on the list.
We know that funding all 30 projects, which are due to be completed by 2020, will call for some EUR 600 billion.
We also know, though, that, if we presuppose a 20% share, the EU, under the present financial plan, will take 120 years to do that.
We do not have that much time.
Yes, it is a good thing that the Council has agreed on a Euro-vignette, but we know that the amount levied will not be enough to fund, for example, the tunnel through the Brenner Pass between Austria and Italy.
On the basis of the tolls that Austria collects, it would take 300 years for Austria to be able to fund its share of the Brenner tunnel.
That is why we need priorities; what we need is the sort of transport projects that will unite Europe.
This has prompted us to start an initiative transcending party and national boundaries.
We want absolute priority to be given to the joining-up of the European rail links between Berlin, Warsaw, Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius, and we want a rail link between Vienna and Venice to Ljubljana, Bratislava, Prague and Budapest.
If we complete these two projects, we will have reached all eight capitals of the new Member States, and Europe will then be able to grow together.
In any case, we would rather see these two projects fully realised by 2010 than have 30, 50 or 48 projects half-finished in 2020.
European integration is dependent on our setting priorities in this area.
