Mr President, if I may, I should like to use the short time available to me to make a suggestion.
On 18 May, the Commission will turn its attention to the European Transparency Initiative.
A great variety of ideas are on the table, one of which is to redesign the EU’s websites.
Might it not be possible for the Council and the Commission, and by all means Parliament too, to take the very practical step of launching an improved website setting out in very clear terms what the World Bank actually does and what progress we Europeans have achieved so far within this institution, as well as the representatives we have within the Bank, the specific projects that are involved and the opportunities that are available to us to make our voice heard?
Why am I saying all this?
Having followed the debate on screen, I was forced to draw the regrettable conclusion that nearly everything that was said had already been said 20 years ago.
In my opinion, it will only be possible to bring about the necessary reforms – and the majority of Members believe that the World Bank urgently needs them – if transparent procedures are used to bring matters out into the open.
