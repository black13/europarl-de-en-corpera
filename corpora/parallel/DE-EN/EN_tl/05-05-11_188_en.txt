Mr President, I am asking very specific questions, so please answer them.
What is the objection to making the position paper public?
It is positions that I am asking about, after all, and you refer back to the introduction to my question.
I have to say to the Council that this makes Question Time meaningless.
What is wrong with the position paper of 26 April 2005?
Why can we not see it?
It is of quite fundamental relevance to us.
I would read out my questions to you were it not for the fact that my 30 seconds are up.
Please give us an answer!
