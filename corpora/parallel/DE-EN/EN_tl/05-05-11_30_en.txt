Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as I have only one minute in which to speak, I should like to focus on just one aspect of this issue.
I would endorse the comments made by the previous speakers, as I too believe that our primary concern should be to acknowledge the key role played by the OSCE in Central Asia.
This holds particularly true for conflict prevention, but it also applies in the case of crisis management and enforcement of the rule of law, human rights and democratic standards.
We should not forget that the OSCE also does a great deal in other fields, such as support for civil society or measures to protect minorities.
We should particularly welcome the OSCEâ€™s activities in this region, especially those relating to election observation and preparations for the forthcoming elections, due to be held in Kyrgyzstan in June 2005.
The aim of these activities is to ensure that the elections can be held in accordance with international and European standards.
The issue of police training also plays a key role in this connection, particularly in Kyrgyzstan.
In conclusion, I would ask the Council, and the Commission too, to ensure that we cooperate closely with the OSCE.
In particular, we should put to good use the experience gained in this field by Mr Peterle, who is the OSCE special envoy for the region.
