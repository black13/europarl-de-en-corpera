Mr President, the new millennium appears to have ushered in a wave of change, particularly in the successor states of the former Soviet Union.
Outside factors, such as the struggle for power and for control over oil pipelines, were not the main cause of the ‘coloured revolutions’ in Central Asia, even though covert attempts were undoubtedly made by the USA and Russia to exert influence; instead, it is much more likely that these revolutions were a result of the gradual modernisation of the former Soviet republics.
The peoples of Central Asia have grown frustrated with the old and rigid structures, and they want rapid change without bloodshed.
Of course, the public also hopes that such change will result in an economic upturn and bring prosperity.
In principle, reforms of this kind can bring about positive changes.
It would appear, however, that a partial power vacuum has now emerged in Kyrgyzstan, and this brings with it the risk that the mood will change and that the country will descend into chaos and civil war.
It is in the EU’s interests to lend a helping hand and to offer advice in order to stabilise the political situation, but excessive interference on our part could have the opposite effect, by upsetting the balance that is gradually being established in the country.
After all, Kyrgyzstan wants to prove that it is capable of pressing ahead with reconstruction measures under its own steam.
The fact that a wave of revolution of this kind could spill over at any time should also give us pause for thought, as it would come as no surprise if this trend were to continue in other countries with similar conditions, such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
The EU should start preparing immediately for such an eventuality.
I would also endorse the comment made by one of the previous speakers to the effect that this area must not be left to the sole care of the USA and Russia.
