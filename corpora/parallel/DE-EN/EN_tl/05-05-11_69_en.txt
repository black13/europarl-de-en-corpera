This directive does not, as yet, provide a satisfactory solution to a problem that exists with regard to German professional qualifications.
Following amendments to German legislation, the directive will mean that the German qualifications of journeyman (‘’) and master craftsman (‘’) will be placed in the same category, even though master craftsmen are required to complete a demanding additional training course that lasts many years.
It would still be possible to add the qualification of master craftsman to a higher-ranking category, however, by including it in Annex II of the directive.
We have voted in favour of the compromise in the hope that the ‘Committee on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications’, which will be responsible for such matters according to Article 58 of the directive, will comply with this request before the deadline for transposition.
