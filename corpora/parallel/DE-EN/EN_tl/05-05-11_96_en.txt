The solutions we applied successfully in the past are no longer enough to overcome the problems we are currently experiencing in the shape of rising unemployment and a shaky economy.
The ‘standard’ employment relationship is becoming less and less the norm, and the society in which we live is becoming ever more flexible.
This fact is reflected in new ways of organising working time, such as part-time work or working time accounts.
Anyone who wishes to progress up the career ladder has no choice but to be flexible.
At the same time, however, we are also faced with the problem of decreasing birth rates in Europe, and it would be a disastrous mistake to attempt to reverse this trend by means of immigration.
Work-family balance will play an ever more crucial role in this respect.
Parents are often pushed to their limits by the task of reconciling work and family duties.
Flexitime will only benefit businesses and families if we make the necessary changes to support structures such as childcare facilities, in order to ensure that allowance is made for such changes.
If it is the case that some fathers and mothers of young children have to stop working, then Europe may well already have missed the boat.
