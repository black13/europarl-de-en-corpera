I reject the resolution for the following reasons.
Firstly, it takes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Germany and Europe as an opportunity to advance revisionist views of history by treating Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union as equivalent.
Secondly, this assumption of equivalence minimises the crimes committed by German fascism, notably the extermination of Europe’s Jews; it is evident that the resolution’s object is to relativise this temporary abandonment of civilisation.
The resolution makes no reference to the decisive contribution of the Soviet Union to the victory over Fascism.
Sixty years ago, the world was liberated from Nazism, in the name of which, and with the support of business and industrial interests and a large proportion of the German people, the incomparably inhumane industrialised destruction of the Jews was decided upon, the whole of Europe plunged into war and millions of people killed.
The most brutal means, including torture and the murder of tens of thousands, was used to put down the anti-fascist resistance, which consisted largely of Communists and Social Democrats.
To take, today, the commemoration of the end of Nazi rule as an opportunity for depicting 1989 as the actual day of liberation, is to trivialise the Nazis’ regime of terror, to slander the Soviet Union and the immense sacrifices made by its people and the Red Army, and to encourage the resurgence of nationalism, right-wing extremism and the growing tendency to relativise the Nazis’ crimes in Europe.
It is quite another signal that is needed, in the shape of an unequivocal and explicit commitment never to allow fascism another chance in Europe.
