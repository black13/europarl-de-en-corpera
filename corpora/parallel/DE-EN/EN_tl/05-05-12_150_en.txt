Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens, I would like to make a brief statement on this motion for a resolution.
I am glad to see all parties making clear their unanimous and unequivocal position on this matter.
When fundamental democratic rights and issues of civil and minority rights are at stake, any appeal to reasons of state or economic interest is false and inadmissible.
I am from the South Tyrol, a region with ethnic minorities, and, in comparison with many others, it is now in a privileged position.
Particularly now, 60 years after our liberation from fascism and National Socialism, we still remember well how the state used the traditional forms of oppression to discriminate against minorities, including the banning of political opposition, attacks on the media through the intimidation of journalists, putting at a disadvantage all who did not speak the official language, outlawing mother-tongue education, the courts’ unwillingness to act against such injustices, and so on.
State power uses always the same means of oppression against minorities, for whom solidarity from outside is very important, and so I very much welcome this House’s outcry today against the Russification of the Republic of Mari El.
The Mari speakers are a small linguistic group, and need a great deal of solidarity from the international community.
