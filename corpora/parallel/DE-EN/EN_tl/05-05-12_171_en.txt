Mr President, I just wanted to ask you to bear in mind, in the next sittings here in Strasbourg, that we should have a quarter of an hour’s break before the vote, thus maintaining the House’s dignity through speeches and votes and visits by honoured guests.
A 15-minute break is good for concentration, and I would ask the Bureau to make provision for one in future.
