–MrPresident, in Europe is all our hope, but its prospects are not good, to judge by what is said in the debates in those Member States preparing to hold a referendum.
What is the cause of this?
It is not just about the work we do; rather, the cause is to be found in broad public opinion, and particularly the way in which it is reported in the media, for it is primarily they, rather than us alone, that influence the climate within which public opinion is formed, and so that is where we must start.
Much as I am in favour of the efforts to standardise school textbooks and of the adaptation of information to the groups for which it is intended, what matters is that our public relations work – that done here in the European Parliament and also by the other European institutions – should become more professional.
It is still the case, for example, that nothing dramatic happens in this House that might be of interest to journalists and would make the proceedings clearer.
Our votes are held quite separately from our debates.
What this means is that we have to get the fourth pillar of democracy, the fourth of the four powers, the media, more involved.
That is what we must aim for.
