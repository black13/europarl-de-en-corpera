Mr President, I have a brief point to make arising from Rule 126 and those following it in our Rules of Procedure.
Yesterday – in some cases as late as after 11 a.m – meetings that had been scheduled weeks ago to happen between 3 p.m and 5.30 p.m were cancelled at short notice.
This was done at the President’s behest in consequence of the plenary debate due to be held at 3 p.m.
While I very definitely do see why yesterday’s debate was so important, I do not understand why I, as chairman of an intergroup, was informed as late as 11.10 a.m that it was due to be held, while other Members were notified between 8.30 a.m and 11 a.m.
Nor am I sympathetic when cancellations occur at such short notice and the President, who had given this instruction, was seen, at 4.15 p.m. in the courtyard within the tower, toasting a number of visitors, at a time when we were required to be in the plenary and were not allowed to gather in the intergroups, working parties and other bodies.
I regard this as unacceptable.
