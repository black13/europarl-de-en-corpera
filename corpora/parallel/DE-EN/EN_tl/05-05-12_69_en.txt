Mr President, further to Rule 73 of our Rules of Procedure, I would again like to say that lawyers take the view – as indeed do I – that this report’s adoption by the committee was not lawful, and that we ought not to be permitted to vote on it now.
I have already made this point on several occasions.
Legal action will be taken.
While I take part in this vote, I do so under protest.
