Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the resolution.
As a German, I am grateful to all those who freed us from National Socialism when we, unfortunately, were unable to throw off its yoke ourselves.
It started by depriving the German people of their rights, blinding many of them, and then plunged nearly the whole of Europe into war and violence.
As a West German, I am grateful to those who liberated us, above all the Americans, without whose presence for decades democracy would not have been able to establish itself within our borders and elsewhere.
Along with the victims who suffered up to and including 8 May, there were, in Europe’s Eastern half, victims after 8 May: the innocent victims of a change of dictatorship from National Socialism to the Soviet tyranny that it took 45 years to bring down.
The Russia of today should acknowledge that people from Tallinn to Leipzig, from Warsaw to Varna, could not accept that what the Soviet Union imposed on them after Hitler’s demise was freedom.
Along with them, the Germans to the east of the three Western zones paid far more for Hitler’s crimes than we did, for we were fortunate enough to be able, very soon, to play a part in the project that was and still is the answer to all the challenges of totalitarianism: the European Union.
So let us, in future, make a better job of things in Europe!
