Mr President, this weekend there will be a vote on the European Constitution, and it is in our interests and in the interests of this House that even more information should be made available on the subject.
After all, we will all, on Monday, or very late on Sunday evening, be facing demands for statements on how we assess the Constitution.
With this in mind, perhaps it might be possible to have the Houseâ€™s Press Service prepare statements on the subject for our President and other interested parties.
This Constitution is of particular importance to the public, and we are very keen that the vote should be in its favour and, above all, that the subsequent debate should also present a consistently positive view of it.
