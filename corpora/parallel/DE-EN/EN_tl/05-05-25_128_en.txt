Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take this opportunity to express my particular thanks to Mr Nassauer for having drafted this report, and to congratulate him on it.
It was no mean feat to coordinate all these amendments and to conduct negotiations.
The reason why this report is so important is that money laundering is not a trivial offence, and this is a point I should like to make to a number of previous speakers; it is a criminal act, and in fact one of the most serious, as it is both economically damaging and associated with extortion, drug trafficking and suchlike.
These are all facts that must not be forgotten.
It goes without saying that there are certain things that could have been added or left out, and that people will always find something to quibble about.
My hope now is that our decisions will finally be put into practice, and that in two or three years’ time we will then be able to assess their real impact.
It is for this reason that I regard it as so important that a report be tabled in this House in two years’ time to explain how effective these measures have in fact been.
I will admit that I would be delighted if the Member States were to rigorously implement even half of the report’s proposals, as this would obviate the need for us to discuss a great many issues.
Many thanks, Mr Nassauer.
