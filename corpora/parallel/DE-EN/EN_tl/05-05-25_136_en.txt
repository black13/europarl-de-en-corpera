Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament strongly supports the new proposal to extend the framework programme on gender equality by one year and to secure funding for women’s organisations active at European level, as well as the moderate increase in funding of EUR 1.5 million.
The Commission has put forward proposals in the 20072013 Financial Perspective for a new programme for employment and social policy under the name of PROGRESS, however, and this is where our views diverge.
PROGRESS provides for substantial cuts to the budget for equal opportunities, which is the fifth pillar of this programme.
At the same time, however, the equality of men and women is given pride of place as one of the EU’s values and objectives in Articles 1 to 3 of the Constitutional Treaty that is currently being put to popular vote.
The Constitution also sets out the measures that we should take, and so it would be a serious mistake to consign women’s issues to the field of social policy.
Women account for 52% of the EU’s population, which means that this is not a question of minority rights, or of social or employment policy.
While gender mainstreaming must be implemented in all these fields, for example antidiscrimination and employment, equal opportunities must continue to be an issue in its own right, and one that is visible to women.
Our main priority is that we should work together towards this goal and use the time remaining until 2007 to present a separate programme.
We need to understand – and this is a point I should like to make to Commissioner Špidla and the House – that women are watching us.
We have always said that our strategy was twofold, namely gender mainstreaming in all policy areas and separate EUsponsored programmes to promote women’s interests, until such a time as equal opportunities become a reality.
I would urge you to take this factor into consideration, and to help ensure that a separate programme is drawn up.
