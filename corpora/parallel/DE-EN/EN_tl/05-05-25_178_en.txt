. – Madam President, tomorrow’s vote will be a litmus test of how seriously Parliament is going to take consumer protection in the future.
We all know that the number of people, especially children and young people, who are overweight or obese is increasing rapidly.
Scientists are sounding the alarm, because costs are exploding and will soon go off the chart.
In Germany alone, diabetes costs us EUR 20 billion a year.
We also know that voluntary agreements do not help.
That is why we need clear legislation.
Article 4 is key to protecting consumers from misleading advertising.
That is also why we must not dispense with Article 4, the nutrient profiles.
We must not rip the heart out of the bill.
We should also correct the public’s misconceptions.
This is not about banning products or advertising.
It is about transparency and clarity for consumers, and innovation and competitiveness for industry.
We have to be credible here.
We cannot lament the exploding costs on the one hand, and then on the other quite openly become the mouthpiece for, say, a confectionary manufacturer and forget about consumer protection.
We must not allow food with undesirable characteristics, food which is too sweet, too fat or too salty, to put on a cloak of good health.
I hope that you will not give way on consumer protection tomorrow, but that the European Parliament will again demonstrate that we want the nutrient profiles – the heart of the proposal – to be left in, and that we want them once again to blaze a trail for transparency and consumer protection.
