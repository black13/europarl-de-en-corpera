Mr President, I am obliged to the rapporteur.
My group will be voting in favour of this fourth framework agreement, which it sees as strengthening dialogue and reinforcing the legitimacy of both institutions.
This applies to the substance of the agreement rather than to its methodology, concerning which I should like to make a number of critical comments.
There is something special about interinstitutional agreements between constitutional institutions, and, in their totality – there are now several hundred of them – they take on something like a constitutional character.
Agreements of such a kind can hardly be entered into by secretariesgeneral without reference to the relevant committees, without a political mandate and without the agreements being published.
I believe, Mr President, that not least the group leaderships should give consideration to a change of method, and, since we want to give added force to the requirement for transparency among ourselves, we should also require the same transparency of the process whereby interinstitutional agreements come into being.
I also have a demand – or it might be a request – to make of the Commission.
Neither on our own nor on the Commission’s website is it at all possible to call up the interinstitutional agreements currently in force, for they are not published, and so none of them can be accessed or consulted.
This amounts to a serious lack of transparency, and I would ask you in strong terms to make all the existing interinstitutional agreements public.
