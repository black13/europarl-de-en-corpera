Mr President, there has been no shortage of historical references in this debate; for Germans, too, relations with Russia possess a specifically historical character.
I believe that all parties could unite in saying that German politicians are glad that, after many decades, good relations with Russia have been restored.
If one is to calculate quite coldly, on the basis of our own interests and of the security interests of the new Member States, I believe that their security interests benefit more from these good relations than they would do if the situation were reversed.
It follows, then, that it is negligent or worse to allow the EU to be used as a sort of trampoline, with the help of which one jumps up in the air in order to give the Russian bear a hefty thump on the nose.
I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Laschet’s earlier criticisms of didactic tendencies, and what Mr Brok had to say about keeping avenues of dialogue open.
I have to say, though, to Mr Laschet, that there are two things he should not do.
For a start, you should not share out the bearskin among the nations before the bear is dead.
Secondly, you should not make promises that you cannot keep, for I am quite certain that summits would take place between Germany and Russia even if Germany had a CDU government – and who knows, we may even see such a thing in 20 years’ time.
You should not try to imply that such summits would no longer happen.
