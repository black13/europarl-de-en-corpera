–Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say, before I say anything else, that the integration of economic and employment policy guidelines is a step in the right direction.
It is, however, mistaken to keep the guidelines for sustainable development separate from them.
It means that we can do no other than describe integration as having been hamstrung.
I would now like to discuss the substance of the employment policy guidelines and the report that Mrs Mato Adrover has shown such dedication in drafting.
In essence, the Commission proposal puts the labour market at the mercy of liberalisation.
The aim is no longer employment with a living wage and quality jobs, but rather the deregulation of working conditions and wages.
I cannot understand why there was no outcry when it became known that, in these guidelines, the highest political authority is calling for wages to be kept down.
I also see it as irresponsible to move towards the abolition of employers’ contributions to workers’ health insurance.
It is also, I think, a pity that the rapporteur has rejected our proposal for the reintroduction of the fourth pillar of employment policy, that being action to help women gain access to employment.
Gender mainstreaming is only an important addition to this, rather than a substitute for it.
In the absence of the fourth pillar, the Member States have abandoned active measures to help women into employment, and that we cannot accept.
Priority must continue to be given to promoting the employment of women, and I reiterate my urgent appeal to the Members of this House for the reintroduction of the fourth pillar, for it alone ensures that we can monitor how seriously the Member States are taking the advancement of women.
I ask them to support our Amendment 30.
