Mr President, I think it was wrong to assert that the integrated guidelines, which we are debating in this House today, would, once and for all, give a boost to business and employment within the European Union.
Yet again, the guidelines give priority to the governance of the markets, which has one thing above all others in mind, that being to ensure that workers, in whatever sector, meet market requirements.
In no way can this do anything to resolve the structural problems of society and the economy.
It is evident from political crises, such as that which Germany is undergoing, that these instruments do not work and have failed.
I do not see in the least why the combination of previously useless instruments should, suddenly and on its own, help to achieve a real breakthrough as regards job creation and economic growth within the European Union.
I therefore ask, as a matter of urgency, that thought be again given to the principles involved.
