Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unemployment in the EUâ€™s Member States has virtually quadrupled since the beginning of the 1970s, and temporary employment agencies are becoming the principal employers in many countries.
The onward march of globalisation is robbing us of jobs on a massive scale, and, after a downturn, the number of unemployed never falls back to the level it was at before recession struck.
Productive sectors such as agriculture, mining and heavy industry are being marginalised to an increasing degree.
What we are left with is the services sector, which is not likely to be enough in the long term, and in which almost 67% of the entire workforce now work.
If, though, purchasing power continues to fall, there will be a continuing downward spiral, and there is no doubt that the problems we already have with social protection will become even more acute.
This leads me to wonder to what extent the ongoing privatisation of public services, for example the railways and the postal service, which has not produced all the results that had been hoped for, will turn out to have been a grave mistake.
Infrastructure ranks, in any case, alongside qualified workers as a factor that makes Europe attractive as a business location.
The idea that low taxes and wage dumping will bring us closer to the virtually full employment we have set ourselves as a goal strikes me as highly questionable.
