.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission lies before you.
If you vote in favour of it, you will be helping to build up the cooperation between the two institutions, and also giving the right response to yesterday’s destructive debate, which was aimed at wrecking it.
I wish to thank all those who, over the past six months, have hammered out this agreement, for this stage itself reinforces Parliament’s rights, both as a legislative and a budgetary authority.
This stage – which has not been put on merely for show, but has been a transparent procedure – has also clarified the political responsibilities of the President and Members of the Commission.
I regard this agreement as a real leap forward, in that it ushers in a new culture of cooperation, one that works towards transparent work processes, embodies mutual respect for the functions of our institutions and wants the European Union’s policymaking to be characterised by constructive dialogue.
I ask you to vote in favour of its adoption.
