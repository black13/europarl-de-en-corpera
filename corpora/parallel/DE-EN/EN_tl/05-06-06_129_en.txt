Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by warmly thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber.
She has done a great piece of work with this report, which seeks to strike a balance between many different interests, all of which have something to be said for them.
Sixty per cent of the population and 90% of the territory of the EU.
These two figures really do bring home the importance of rural development as the second pillar of the European Union’s agricultural policy.
The EU population can be content only if the rural population is content.
In the light of recent political developments and the failed referendum, we must not only be more aware of the need for acceptance of European policy, it must quite definitely be to the fore everywhere.
In view of the empty coffers and the fighting over distribution, I must also point out that, historically, the EU budget was an agricultural budget.
The policy areas that were added later must not be allowed to overshadow this historic core of Europe.
That is why there are also calls for rural development funds, which are part of agricultural funding, to remain primarily with farmers in projects related to farming.
I therefore expressly support Mrs Schierhuber’s proposed financial appropriations for all three main axes.
It is very important that the support available for very small enterprises should also be extended to medium-sized undertakings in rural areas.
We must also join the rapporteur in calling for Natura 2000, financing for which has still not been settled, not to be funded out of second pillar resources but out of additional money.
At this point I would like once again to extend my sincere thanks to Mrs Schierhuber and to everyone else who has worked so hard on this important report.
In the light of the above points, this report has earned our support.
