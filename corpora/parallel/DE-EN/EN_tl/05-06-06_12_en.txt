Mr President, I wanted to speak earlier when we were discussing Question Time, but I did not catch your eye.
I just wanted to ask for clarification of the agenda.
The right to put questions is possessed by Members as individuals, and it is for that reason that it enjoys special protection.
I doubt whether it can be set aside by majority vote.
I would ask that we stick with the 90-minute Question Time in future, which the Rules of Procedure guarantee as an individual MEPâ€™s right.
