Mr President, Commissioner, I congratulate Mrs Schierhuber on her success in putting before us, with conviction and perseverance, indeed with stubbornness, a balanced compromise which the Council will be able to approve before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency.
Since it is a key part of the 2003 CAP reform that agricultural and forestry production should be preserved, especially in what were up until now less-favoured areas, I have argued for retaining the existing definition of less-favoured areas for the time being, with any changes made only on the basis of a comprehensive study.
We cannot simply drop compensation payments in those areas because the current definition no longer applies.
That would be an outright social, economic and ecological disaster for agriculture in my country in particular, because sadly 96% of the agricultural area is of course less-favoured.
I am therefore relieved that my amendments have been accepted.
That is not in farmers’ interests alone; without them, the rural area in which more than 50% of the EU’s total population still live and which makes up 90% of the territory would not exist.
The results of the vote in the French referendum in the rural areas should give pause for thought to all who believe the common agricultural policy is too expensive.
It will be even more expensive to combat poverty and crime in the large conurbations if we drive the rural population into them too.
Support for the countryside and preserving agriculture based on our family farms is money well invested in the European Union.
As my amendments on the subject were not accepted, I must not of course forget to make clear that beekeeping is also farming and that beekeeping, which is very much at risk, also deserves proper support in rural areas.
I hope this will also be borne in mind.
