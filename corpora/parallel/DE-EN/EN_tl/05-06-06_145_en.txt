Mr President, Commissioner, I would really like to thank you very much for what you have said.
I think it shows that we have moved very much closer in the essential things that are important to us all.
I think what you said about the less-favoured areas, small and medium-sized enterprises and young farmers in particular was very good.
If modulation must be applied to all axes, then we must also pay close attention to the level of their appropriations.
Again, Commissioner, my sincere thanks to you and your staff for your support.
