Mr President, since cheating his way to victory in the October 2004 elections, Belarus’ President Lukashenko has been even more zealous in repressing his opponents.
A few days ago, on 1 June, the chairman of the Belarus Social Democratic Party and founder of Belarus’ European Movement was sentenced to three years in jail for doing nothing more than joining with others in demonstrating against the rigged presidential elections.
Mr President, in this instance too, I would ask you to address vigorous protests to the Belarus authorities concerning these acts of repression.
