Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to seize this opportunity to draw your attention again to a problem that I regret to say is still present, that being subsidies for the export of live animals.
Ever since export subsidies for the transportation of live animals were introduced in 1989, this House has on many occasions voted in favour of their removal from the EU budget.
Although the animals’ torments, particularly on journeys over long distances, and the resulting disadvantages for consumers, are a matter of general knowledge, their transportation continues to be subsidised to the tune of EUR 41 million in 2001, EUR 57 million in 2002, EUR 67 million in 2003, and now the figure has reached EUR 77 million per annum.
Giving subsidies in this manner amounts to promoting extreme suffering for animals, and we should therefore surely reject it.
I wish therefore to call upon the Members of this House to endorse this statement, and would advise the ladies and gentlemen currently engaged in negotiating the EU’s budget that the abolition of these subsidies would remove several hundred million euros from the budget, and to do so would be surely to give it some justified relief.
