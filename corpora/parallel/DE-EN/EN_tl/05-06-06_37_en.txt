Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 25 Heads of State or Government signed the European Constitutional Treaty, as did 25 foreign ministers, and 10 Member States have ratified it.
This House adopted it by the two-thirds constitutional majority.
Most of Europe’s citizens have already said yes to this Constitution.
I would ask you, Mr President, to issue a press release making it clear that we will not allow ourselves to be taken hostage by opponents of the EU, disinformation merchants, those who play the blame game or rabble-rousers, and that this Constitution reinforces the public’s fundamental rights, strengthening Parliament, and, through Parliament, the citizens, democracy and transparency.
I would ask you, Mr President, to inform all the Heads of State or Government that it is because we do not want to interrupt the constitution-making process that the European Parliament is opposed to self-willed decisions appealing to popular national sentiment and premature statements by Heads of Government – such as the one made today by Tony Blair.
