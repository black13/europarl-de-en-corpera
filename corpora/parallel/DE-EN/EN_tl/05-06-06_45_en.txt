Mr President, I would like to correct what Mr Leichtfried has said.
I, too, am opposed to the transport of live animals for slaughter, but this statement makes no distinction between animals for slaughter and animals for breeding and production, the latter of which must be exported alive and really are economically significant to Europe’s farmers.
If we subscribe to the statement as it stands, something like half of Europe’s breeding cattle would be affected, and that would represent another major blow to Europe’s farmers, on top of the general economic stress.
