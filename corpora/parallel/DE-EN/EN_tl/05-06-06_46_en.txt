Mr President, I do not want to give the impression that I am anything other than an advocate of a peaceful and united Europe, but I do believe that, after the votes in France and the Netherlands, we cannot simply go on with business as usual.
Nor can it be said that over half Europeâ€™s citizens have already cast their votes in favour.
To do so is simply wrong; in Germany, it was fewer than 600 members of parliament who voted in favour, while over 80 million citizens were not asked their opinion.
Last week, a major German daily newspaper polled its readership.
Of the almost 380 000 readers who took part, 96% were opposed to the Constitution.
I do not believe that the blame lies with the French and Dutch voters who voted against the Constitution, but rather with the Members of this House who voted to start accession negotiations with Turkey and in favour of the early accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
That is what we need to be talking about.
