Madam President, let me make one thing clear: we are not, in this instance, talking in terms of publicly-owned infrastructure; on the contrary, the networks under discussion, which are to be further developed, are to a large degree owned by the private sector in the shape of big energy suppliers.
This is what makes this debate so very different from that on the transport networks.
We repudiate Mrs Laperrouze’s report, certain aspects of which we have not, despite our efforts, succeeded in improving.
It is our belief that this wish list of 300 projects of European interest will do no more than make the hearts of the energy supply companies – which, in Europe, amount to oligopolies – beat faster, and will be more likely to give additional power and influence to European energy suppliers, who are already too powerful in acting against the market, and we do not believe that benefiting such businesses’ interests alone will bring us any closer to security of supply.
