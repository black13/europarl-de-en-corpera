Mr President, the agenda for Wednesday includes two important debates – one on the reform of the UN and the other on trans-Atlantic relations.
We also want to discuss the Council and Commission statements on Uzbekistan and then deal with a question on Philip Morris.
Very little time has been made available for this.
By way of deviation from our written motion – and in order to accommodate those Members who want at least some Question Time and then the written replies – I would like to ask that the debate be allowed to encroach upon half an hour of Question Time, leaving half an hour for questions to the Council, so that we – by which I mean both the larger and smaller groups – can have a rather more in-depth debate.
