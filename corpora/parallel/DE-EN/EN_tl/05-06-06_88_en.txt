Mr President, in 1999 I was elected to this Parliament as a non-party frontrunner of the Austrian social democrats.
At the time, I had an equally high opinion of both OLAF and our rapporteur, Mr Bösch.
Since then, both the voters and I have had to learn that neither of them are that good.
OLAF is the private army of the powers in Brussels.
Someone denounced reporter Hans-Martin Tillack, claiming he had paid money for confidential documents from inside the Commission. used the documents to publish a report about fraud in Brussels.
Every word of the article was true.
That was not the point, however.
Tillack still has not got the confiscated documents back.
It is not unusual for journalists to work with confidential official information.
Such information was also used in this report.
Everyone who works on a newspaper knows that it is almost good form for people who are exposed to claim that money was paid for confidential documents.
OLAF also asked the public prosecutors in Hamburg, where is published, for help; they refused.
No judge was found who was prepared to do his duty.
These EU investigators have been gradually expanding their powers for years now.
No one can stand in OLAF chief Heinz-Hermann Brüner’s way.
That is what European law now says, and the thoroughness with which Brussels always sorts everything out means that the Council has always immediately adjusted criminal law accordingly.
Now even fewer people in Europe are safe from Franz-Hermann Brüner!
Uncovering Mr Bösch’s part in all this will have to wait for another time.
I have quoted everything I have said today from today’s issue of the news magazine .
