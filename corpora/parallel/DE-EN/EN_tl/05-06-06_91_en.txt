Mr President, I would like to continue quoting from : ‘There is no one who can stand in Franz-Hermann Brüner’s way.
As the Commission’s decision establishing OLAF puts it, his Office “shall exercise the powers of investigation ... in complete independence” and it may “neither seek nor take instructions from the Commission, any government or any other institution or body”’.
That must sound like heaven to a German public prosecutor, who is bound by instructions from the Ministry of Justice.
That is a tradition that is taken for granted in many European countries.
This brings us to quite a big problem.
No one who is for Europe can be in favour of OLAF as it is, no one who is for Europe can be in favour of the EU as it is, especially when it uses an instrument like OLAF, where the well-tried principles of the rule of law are disregarded on a massive scale, especially the right to be heard and the right to information, when such proceedings are under way.
I urge Commissioner Kallas to do something about this.
