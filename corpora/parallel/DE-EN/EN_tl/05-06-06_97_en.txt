Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for its proposal and the rapporteur for her constructive report, which has improved on this Commission proposal in a number of important respects.
The basic objective of compiling interoperable spatial data on a European scale is to be welcomed.
The environment in particular demonstrates to us every day that it knows no national boundaries and neither positive nor negative effects stop at the border post.
The collection and use of data must be practicable, however.
The rapporteur’s proposals have created clearer formulations and rules which greatly improve the proposal.
Moreover, everyone in the Community will have access to the environmental data they want free of charge – a great step forward in bringing Europe closer to its citizens.
By requiring the data to be coherent, it also makes this a practical possibility.
It must also be clear, however, that if the data is not merely to be consulted but is to be used commercially a fee must be payable; anything else would not be fair to the very people who will have to produce the data, in particular local and municipal authorities.
If the Member States decide differently about such payments, however, the subsidiarity principle makes that perfectly possible.
I also believe the rapporteur’s call for the proposal to be easy to understand and transparent is important.
The comitology procedure called for by the Commission should therefore only be used in exceptional cases.
The public has a right to know precisely how and where decisions have been taken and, above all, what the reasons for them were.
In conclusion, I can say that the rapporteur has with her proposal succeeded in bringing the Commission proposal closer to the citizen and introducing into it greater transparency, subsidiarity and practicability.
