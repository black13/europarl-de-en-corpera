Mr President, speaking on behalf of our group, I would like to ask for something that does not involve changing the agenda, but simply adding to the title.
On Wednesday morning, between 9 a.m. and noon, the Council and the Commission are due to make statements on the preparations for the European Council.
Having had the referenda, I think it would be appropriate for them to be mentioned, and so we ask that they should feature in the title, thus: ‘The future of the European Union following the referenda on the Constitution’.
This would make it clear that this is not ‘business as usual’, but that we are focussing our attention on this major issue.
It would be appropriate if we were to do this.
