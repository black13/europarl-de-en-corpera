The Oreja report – A6-0166/2005 – on a proposal for a recommendation from the European Parliament to the Council on terrorist attacks: prevention, preparation and response(2005/2043(INI)), as part of the anti-terrorism package adopted in the European Parliament today, also pursues the aim of creating a legal area where the weapons with which war on terrorism is waged include mutual recognition of court judgments, police measures and exchanges of information between police forces and between intelligence services.
As a result, fundamental rights are liable to fall by the wayside.
This approach, in fact, has come under increasingly heavy criticism in the Member States since the establishment of the European arrest warrant, because the fairly harmless-sounding formula ‘mutual recognition’ turns out, on closer inspection, to be a very potent instrument.
A person’s extradition to another Member State of the EU, for example, closes the door on the possibility of judicial review.
The most critical points of the Oreja report are:
- the aim of an ‘exchange of information between police forces and between intelligence services’,
- the aim of an ‘exchange of information regarding suspected terrorists and their organisations with third countries and international organisations’, and
- the aim of encouraging ‘the increasing specialisation of Europol and Eurojust in the fight against [...] terrorism’.
Democratic control of prosecuting authorities, effective protection of personal data and the horizontal division of powers do not feature at all in this regime.
