Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, in the context of this debate, I should be very interested to learn how sharply the European Union in general and the Council in particular are focusing on the issue of bioterrorism.
I have no doubt that a good foreign policy which functions properly is the best preventive mechanism.
This, unfortunately, has not been fully understood by part of the European electorate in recent weeks, and some of the responsibility for that surely lies with us.
Be that as it may, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that we are liable to be confronted with the problem of bioterrorism.
We hope it will not come to that, but I should like to know from the Commission and the Council how they are preparing for such an eventuality.
I should also like to know how these preparations have progressed over the past year and over the last few months since the appointment of a common European coordinator.
If the rumours are true – and I hope they are not – that cooperation has been dreadful in the entire area around my country, I should like to know what steps the Commission and the Council are taking to tackle this issue resolutely.
There is no doubt that this is a European mission and that the European dimension brings added value.
I keenly await the Commission’s comments.
