Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our environment and our natural resources are scarce assets, and we want to pass them on to our children, if at all possible enlarging them in the process.
Our budgetary resources are also a scarce asset, and so we must make strenuous efforts to achieve our environmental goals as effectively and efficiently is possible.
This is the spirit in which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety drafted its opinion, and the rapporteur, in his usual courteous and cooperative manner, has incorporated our thoughts.
For that I am grateful to him.
These thoughts include not only the observation that European environmental policy has proved to be an effective means of preserving or even improving the environment, public health and peopleâ€™s quality of life.
That is the conservationist side of our approach.
Our thoughts also comprise the realisation and recognition that our environmental policy is also making a significant contribution to the achievement of the Lisbon goals, to job creation.
That is the innovative side of our approach, and its importance should not be underestimated.
For this reason, I very much hope that all Members of this House will join us in our present and future pursuit of this strategic path.
