Mr President, the Committee on Regional Development has, by a large majority, endorsed the Commission’s financial estimates.
In my opinion, the European regional and cohesion policy is the European Union’s most successful policy by far and the one with the most immediate public visibility.
In view of the manifest public detachment from European politics at this present time, we should focus on the continued pursuit of this successful policy through the seven-year multiannual programmes and support it with appropriate funding.
I warmly welcome the proposal made by the rapporteur, Mr Böge, that 0.41% of gross national income be guaranteed for the cohesion policy, and also that the 4% cap should remain in force.
We also support measures to deal with the special problem of regions subject to the statistical effect and border regions.
The entire House, of course, is well aware that we are operating with tax revenue.
This is why the Committee on Regional Development firmly supports the strict application of the N+2 rule and advocates its extension to the Cohesion Fund.
European tax revenue must be spent efficiently and not poured down black holes somewhere or other.
I might add that the Council should take note of the benefits that application of the N+2 rule brings.
At the same time, though, I should like to say to all those Members who are calling for more money, that the financial pressure on some Member States is extremely heavy.
This is another area where we need to set reasonable limits.
This is why the great majority of our committee supports the rapporteur’s view that in some areas the allocation of resources should be cut back or new scope be created for negotiation.
