Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which is responsible for the Constitution, has highlighted something that is by now no doubt obvious to everyone, namely that the European Union’s direct communications with, and provision of information to, its citizens is a disaster – not only a disaster but also a communications black hole now threatening to swallow up the European Constitution.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has pointed out that the development in Europe of an area of language and cross-border public participation in political life is necessary and indispensable to European democracy.
We have noted with regret the fact that one of the Commission’s first actions was to cut back the funds for information about the Constitution, something that would make one weep if it were not so farcical.
The Temporary Committee and its rapporteur have taken on board the Committee’s concern, albeit without allocating funds to deal with it.
There is no point in presenting the public with priorities if you do not set aside money for them.
