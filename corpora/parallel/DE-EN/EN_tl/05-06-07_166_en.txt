Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Böge for his high-quality work in the Committee.
Although we have already heard praise from many quarters for the balance of the work he has done, we – and I – take the view that the failure to put sufficient emphasis on some areas is precisely the problem.
I want to pick up right now on what Mr Geremek said.
Is the policy that we are now engaged in devising really sufficiently focussed on the future?
What are we in fact doing for the European public, and what can they then do for Europe?
I feel at a deep level that, after the two failed referenda, we have to consider how, as a matter of policy, we can communicate better with the people of Europe.
I believe that our educational programmes, despite the boost that they have already given us, have not taken us as far as we have to go in terms of the Lisbon strategy; over the coming years, by means of the Financial Perspective, we must do everything possible to ensure that every schoolboy, every schoolgirl and every student can gain an education and study in another European country.
They will relate emotionally to Europe, to its diversity and to its opportunities, in a quite different way, and it is thus that we develop convinced Europeans from the ground upwards.
Those are the sort of networks we need.
The situation is exactly the same as regards cultural policy.
We are so proud of the fact that the Wall is no longer there and that we are a continent of diverse cultures.
The Budget estimate still falls short of what we spend on subsidising tobacco.
We need to be visibly proactive here, enabling town-twinning schemes to flourish, enabling artists to meet each other and enabling people to have a real experience of Europe’s cultural riches.
That is why the estimates contained in Mr Böge’s proposal do not go far enough.
Let us, together, be bold in trying to get the message across to people, not only to their minds, but also to their hearts.
