Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶ge, has done a good job.
When introducing this report, he pointed out that the Budget leaves certain areas of policy and the economy chronically underfunded.
Rural development is threatening to become one of them.
In consequence of a Council decision, funding is tied up until 2013 in the first pillar, where, however, resources are inadequate for funding Romania and Bulgaria.
It is for this reason that the report proposes the introduction of cofinancing in the first pillar.
While our group wishes to support this cofinancing, our aim in doing so is to achieve better funding for matters covered by the second pillar.
The funds from Natura 2000 must be mobilised.
In the second pillar, rural development must be funded on an equal basis, that is to say with 75% from the European Union, and the proper economic development of rural areas must be guaranteed.
Far from this being a financial act of mercy, the overall health of our economic development is dependent on rural areas not being left behind.
