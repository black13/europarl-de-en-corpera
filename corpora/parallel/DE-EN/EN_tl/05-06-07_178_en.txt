Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what do our discussions about the next financial framework boil down to?
They are in essence about the tasks that we have to perform at European level.
When the Commission’s proposal is along the lines of doing what it does already, and then some new things on top, then it is making matters too easy for itself.
What our rapporteur deserves a great deal of credit for is the way he has gone into the details, taking a look at the tasks – including those connected with the Budget – that we in the EU will have to get to grips with in the 21st century, at where more resources are needed – in foreign and security policy – and at where the Commission’s proposals are excessive and we can make cutbacks.
What we have here, as a result, is an excellent proposal, and one that will serve as a basis for very serious negotiations with the Council.
A European Union that defines itself solely in terms of the redistribution of as much money as possible is not the European Union I want to see; there are other tasks that we have to perform together.
If we require the Member States to consolidate their budgets in order to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact, we cannot at the same time go around dispensing largesse the length and breadth of Europe.
This is a task we have to face up to together.
If you say – as Mrs Trüpel, being a Green, does – that 70 cents for culture cannot be excessive if you set it against the expenditure on the Millennium Goals and all the other goals, then your payments end up amounting to 1.19%.
What the Greens are proposing, then, is to commit 1.29%.
If that is what you want, then I suggest that you tell the people that there is no money left at the national level, but Europe is spending more, and see where that gets you.
Our credibility depends on our concentrating not only on the political tasks in hand – and that is how we respond to the referenda – but also on the Budget.
