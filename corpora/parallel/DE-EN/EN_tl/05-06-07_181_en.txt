Mr President, I want to concentrate on regional policy, which is a particular concern of mine.
I would like to reiterate that one of the great advances achieved by this report consists in the 0.41% allocation to something that is visible in even the smallest European village and makes Europe visible to those who live there.
The European Union’s instrument of solidarity is economic and social cohesion.
As we know, the Council is at present proposing a mere 0.37% as a basis for negotiation.
I, for one, am prepared to go along with a 4% per Member State limit and with the retention – contrary to what was contained in the original draft – of the N+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund.
I wish again to stress that I do not endorse our group’s proposal, as I do not believe that we need to impose an five-year limit, which is, in terms of regional policy, unacceptable under the present difficult conditions.
