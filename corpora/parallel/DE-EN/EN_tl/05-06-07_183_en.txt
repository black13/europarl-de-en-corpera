Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I will put aside the thoughts I had gathered for today in order to consider a number of interventions and again explore what they are about.
The Commission has come up with a proposal, and Parliament – by means of the Böge report and of tomorrow’s decision – has shown itself capable of acting and negotiating.
At present, the Council – lacking any agreement whatever on a basis for negotiation – is capable of doing neither of those things.
Our proposal is a compromise.
I call upon the Heads of State or Government, along with their ministers of finance, to read it through for themselves and to see whether it might make it possible to broker an agreement in the Council without our weakening the European Union.
I am addressing the Members of the Council when I say that the proposal they have already put on the table amounts to 40% less for the EU’s competitiveness, 10% less for cohesion and growth and employment, 6% less for rural development and agriculture, 50% less for internal policies and 40% less for the European Union’s role as a global partner.
You may thereby get agreement in the Council, but you will not get any agreement from us, not least for the second reason, which is that you are making cuts across the board.
If we stick to the status quo, without setting any new priorities, we will need EUR 890 billion.
Your proposal envisages EUR 871 billion.
If we do not come to an agreement, we will have EUR 931 billion.
Your Budget is tighter than the one we have already and more limited than a lack of agreement would make it, and that is why you have to understand that our offer is made with negotiations in mind.
If the figure goes below EUR 931 billion, there will not be any!
