Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the second-largest entry in the Financial Perspective is for expenditure on economic and social cohesion.
Being concerned with regional policy, I am at one with the rapporteur – whom I congratulate on this excellent report – in believing that the EU’s ability to cope with the past and forthcoming enlargements and to reduce regional disparities is absolutely dependent on a strong and well-funded European regional policy being in place.
On the other hand, though, EU structural policy must be equipped with sufficient resources to make it possible, in future, for adequate support to be offered to less developed regions and to those with particular socio-economic problems, including those in the old EU Member States.
While it is of course the Commission proposal that best complies with the guidelines for the EU’s regional policy in the forthcoming planning period, which aim at the reduction of disparities between one region and another, we regard Mr Böge’s proposal as an acceptable compromise in comparison with both it and the quite unacceptable demand made by the six net contributors.
Under no circumstances must cuts in the Budget fall hardest upon regional policy.
The allocation proposed in the Commission’s draft regulations for cohesion funds for the individual targets is acceptable only if there is an increase of 1.14% in total resources.
If cuts are made along the lines envisaged by the Böge report or, indeed, the Council regulation, resources must be more concentrated on resolving the grave problems in the regions most deserving of support.
There must be no across-the-board cuts, that is to say cuts made without affecting the relative allocations, for these would unilaterally impose burdens on the convergence regions in the EU’s old Member States.
