.
Madam President, I would like to close this debate with two short remarks.
There is one point on which I am in complete agreement with the Council Presidency, and that is that no headway will be made, either in the Council or in Parliament, if there are those who see their role as being to speak up for special interests, while others see themselves as responsible for brokering compromises.
It is for that reason that what this House needs to do tomorrow is to set out a quite definite negotiating position, and to do so by as large a majority as possible.
One thing, though – and this I have to say to Mr Schmit – that one thing I too do not accept is the celebrated chaos theory, according to which all is lost if there is no mutual understanding.
Following the vote in plenary tomorrow, we will need to employ the time left to us before the European Council meets in talks and negotiations.
Whilst I recognise that the problem lies perhaps in the Council itself rather than in the Presidency, the Council must not get the idea that everything will be sorted out once it reaches a compromise.
It is far more important that we should first define our negotiating position, that the Council should set out its position in relation to that, and that Parliament should eventually have to agree.
What matters, then, is that we use the next 10 days in working very hard to hammer out a workable compromise.
