Madam President, Commissioner, it strikes me that the problematic thing about the advertisements for jobs with the Commission is that they often specify a mother tongue.
Surely, if we are to have equality of opportunity in Europe, the least we can do is to require a certain standard of competence in a language rather than use of it from the cradle.
Consideration should be given to whether the present practice might be changed in future.
