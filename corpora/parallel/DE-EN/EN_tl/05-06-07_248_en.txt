Mr President, there are two things I would like to mention, one of them being the reference to historic urban centres.
That was very interesting, and I also wish to thank the Commissioner for the excellent reply.
There is in the Czech Republic a castle, now wholly dilapidated, which was the childhood home of the originator of the European ideal, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, and in it a European centre for meetings and activities is to be set up.
This could be an important project.
Secondly, it is my belief that a great congress or conference should be mounted to serve as a sort of fair or contacts forum for all those engaged in cross-border work.
A very large number of initiatives are underway in this field, all of them unaware of each otherâ€™s existence.
One possible venue for this might be the capital of your own country, Commissioner, the only capital city to be situated on a border.
I therefore propose that a meeting of these cross-border initiatives be organised in Bratislava, the former Pressburg.
