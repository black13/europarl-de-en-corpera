Mr President, allow me to remind the House of the wise words of Benjamin Franklin, one of the fathers of the American Constitution, who said that ’Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety’.
Since the criminal atrocities in Madrid, we have known that Europe is now a direct target area for international terrorism.
There can be no doubt that this fact must be taken into account in the formulation of public policy.
Every form of terrorism is a crime that threatens the very foundations of our democracy, and these crimes must be combated and must have consequences that befit their gravity.
They must, however, be combated with appropriate instruments and not at the cost of freedom.
It goes without saying that our national investigating authorities must cooperate more closely.
At the same time, we must not create a situation in which data and information are collected, linked and exchanged ever more indiscriminately until the transparent citizen emerges at some time in the near future.
We must not go down the path towards an Orwellian Big Brother state.
People’s fundamental rights must not be put on the line.
We need a targeted policy involving, on the one hand, zero tolerance of terrorism in any shape or form and, on the other hand, a sharp focus on the aim of eradicating the various causes of terrorism.
This is the only way of ultimately cutting off its supply line.
