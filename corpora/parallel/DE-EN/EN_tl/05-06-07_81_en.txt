Increasing energy efficiency is an important aim for many reasons.
This is why we support all reasonable efforts to ensure that energy is used efficiently.
The present Rothe report, however, only partly satisfies this requirement.
It proposes too much bureaucracy, too much centralism and questionable methods of increasing energy efficiency in Europe.
Despite all these misgivings, we shall approve the report at the first reading, because the benchmarking approach, which we favour, is included as an option.
We call on the Council and the Commission to embrace the benchmarking system in place of the uniform percentage targets and to proceed quickly to make the necessary preparations for the implementation of such a system so that there will be no need to apply uniform percentage targets, even for an introductory period.
If this line is not followed, we shall vote against these binding percentage targets at the second reading.
