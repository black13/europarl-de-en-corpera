Mr President, according to a study, governments have spent more than 191 billion dollars on the war on terrorism in 2005.
This expenditure is set to snowball over the next ten years.
Forty-four per cent of this amount has been spent by the United States on military and police operations, for example.
It remains somewhat questionable, however, whether the anti-terrorism strategy has been succeeding.
A prime example of this spurious success is Iraq, which has become a breeding ground for terrorism in the wake of the war.
We have hitherto confined ourselves to treating the symptoms instead of trying to root out this evil.
As a result, extremists have benefited from ignorance and misjudgement of Islam to recruit ever-increasing numbers of militants, many of whom are drawn from the lower strata of the Muslim population.
This is where we have to focus our efforts; we must adopt new ways of thinking and follow new paths.
