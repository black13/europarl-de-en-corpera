It is because there is more to agriculture than the production of food that its maintenance in all the Member States is an important task for the European Union.
Economic and rural development benefit from it, and a healthy natural and cultural landscape is guaranteed.
Farmers must continue to be guaranteed financial support through the common agricultural policy, and the EU’s long-term financial planning must reflect this.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is scheduled for 2007, will make the financial situation more acute.
No provision is as yet being made for more funding to be allocated to the CAP in order to take account of this enlargement; on the contrary, the draft envisages a reduction in, or capping of, resources.
The accession would further reduce the funds set aside for farmers in the existing Member States, and so, should the CAP’s financial resources prove insufficient to meet the need, contributions would have to be sought from the individual Member States, which would be obliged to find the shortfall for their own farmers.
Far from adding up to the renationalisation of agricultural policy, this would mean that its funding would be secure in the long term.
If the benefits of the common agricultural policy are to be retained, it may in future be necessary to ask the Member States to bear their share of the costs, for it is not acceptable that farmers should foot the bill for the European Union’s enlargement, and that funds for other policies should be quarried from the agricultural budget.
