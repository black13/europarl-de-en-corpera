Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are, primarily, two things at issue here.
One is the need for the United States of America, and Europe, to use the wealth they have created to help those less well-off to achieve similar prosperity.
I believe that the British Presidency is planning to do something about this shortly, and we can play our part in it, even though we may disagree about one thing or another.
We also need, not only to take pride in the democracy and freedom that we have established in our own countries, but also to offer them to others as instruments of development.
I quite deliberately say ‘offer’ rather than ‘impose’, for offering is what we have done in Europe itself, in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans – which I mention because I have just been told that a large party of visitors from Macedonia is present – and it is surely what we intend to do in the Middle East as well.
We regard the Middle East as a very unstable region and a very important one.
We, Americans and Europeans alike, agree that everyone who lives in these countries needs democracy and development – free development in particular – as a means towards peace.
This makes it particularly important that Europe and the USA should cooperate with one another.
Let me reiterate, though, that the approach to be adopted must be that of enabling people to establish freedom and democracy in their own countries, without feeling that these have been imposed upon them.
It is also important – and here I would cite Iran as an example – that we join together in preventing new dangers and new risks from rearing their heads.
Here, too, though, I would strongly advocate doing this, not by way of threats, but through negotiations, thereby, I hope, arriving at something we can all regard as a success.
