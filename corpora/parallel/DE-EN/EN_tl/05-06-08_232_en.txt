Madam President, I would like to start by asking whether the Luxembourg Presidency is going to put Croatia on the agenda for next week’s summit.
I would then like to ask what the thinking is behind it being possible – as I have now heard – for the negotiations with Croatia scheduled for 17 March to be put off the day before, while we are told that the principle of applies to the commencement of negotiations with Turkey on 3 October.
Why is unanimity required in order to begin negotiations with Croatia but in order to refrain from beginning them with Turkey?
There is no logic to this whatsoever!
