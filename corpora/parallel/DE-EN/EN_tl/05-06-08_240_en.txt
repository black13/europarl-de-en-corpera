Thank you, Madam President, for the opportunity to put a supplementary question.
I have one for the Council, and it is this.
Are there any alcoholic drinks that are – as Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges has said – demonstrably targeted at children and young people?
Secondly, is the Council aware that there are mature adults who like the taste of these drinks and who are penalised by the special duty that is already imposed on them in Germany, to give one example?
Thirdly, does the Council agree with me that, rather than seeking centralised solutions through tax systems that treat people as less than adult, it would be better for us to educate children, young people, adults and senior citizens about the dangers of alcohol in general?
