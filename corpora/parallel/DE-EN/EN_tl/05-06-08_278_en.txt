– Mr President, I should first like to offer the rapporteur, Othmar Karas, my warmest thanks.
He has managed to formulate a contentious issue in a relatively short space of time in such a way that Parliament can support it with a large majority.
This was not an ideological debate, Mr Bullmann; it was an acknowledgment that the political will to keep to the 1996 Stability and Growth Pact was missing.
At the first serious general test, the two large states, France and Germany, failed totally, assisted at the time by Luxembourg and Greece.
This start prevented the Stability and Growth Pact from playing its proper part as originally planned.
In this respect, the current reform is, in all events, a second best solution, which uses the argument of flexibility in order to exclude future infringements of the rules.
In saying this, I am also voicing criticism of my own government in Germany.
Introducing the costs of European unification as a new criterion has thrown the door wide open to arbitrariness and means, in principle, that sanctions will no longer be possible in future, even with a 4% or 5% excess.
I consider this to be a definite mistake.
Given the powerful role of the Council and the inadequate role of Parliament in this matter, the Commission could only react defensively.
We have debated this often here in this Chamber.
That is why I think it is a good thing that Mr Karas addresses precisely this point in his reports.
More competence for the Commission, a stop to the sinners standing in judgment and greater participation by the European Parliament – these are things we can agree on.
However, nobody will be able to say that this version of the Stability and Growth Pact is forward looking and will contribute towards the future stability of the euro.
