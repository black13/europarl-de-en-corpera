– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, basically everything has been said, but not by everyone and, more to the point, not by me.
Firstly, I should like to offer the rapporteur, Othmar Karas, my warmest thanks.
He has made the best of a bad job, and on that, I might perhaps be permitted to comment.
Today is the third time I have stood on this podium in order to speak on the Stability Pact.
In 1997, Parliament had to give its opinion on the introduction of the euro and the Stability Pact associated with it at the time.
We did so gladly, because we were convinced that the Stability Pact offered a basis of trust for the citizens.
This time, as the rapporteur rightly said, the European Parliament has only a minor role in the whole procedure.
Consultation means something different in my view.
Monetary questions are questions of trust and this trust is shaken by the watering down of the Pact.
The two so-called big countries – in what the rapporteur calls 'peer complicity' – set the entire watering down process in motion, as we have already heard here today.
Big gestures, big overtures obviously no longer convince the citizens of Europe.
The shattered remains of the Schröder and Eichel policy in Germany and the Chirac policy in France have drawn the euro into this completely negative discussion.
The report formulated by the rapporteur is a desperate attempt to rescue some of the philosophy behind stability.
We must stop exacerbating the crisis of confidence still further.
The best solution would be if Mr Barroso, and Mr Juncker on behalf of ECOFIN, were to withdraw all changes to the Stability Pact in the light of recent developments.
