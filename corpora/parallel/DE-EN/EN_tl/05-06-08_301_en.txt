– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to welcome this refreshing acknowledgment in competition policy and in the debate on industrial policy of the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises to jobs and the competitiveness of the European Union.
This acknowledgment in today's debate also shows that every attempt to play industrial policy off against SME policy is wrong, harmful and contradicts reality.
We need industrial flagships if we are to be competitive in the world and we need clusters of SMEs and industrial flagships in order that SMEs may derive competitive impetus from the competitiveness of industry.
While I agree with you when you say ‘no’ to more regulation, we must at the same time say ‘no’ to the tendency towards more nationalisation, ‘no’ to the tendency towards anti-efficiency, ‘no’ to the tendency towards despondency, ‘no’ to populism, ‘no’ to amending legislation, ‘no’ to anti-industrialism and ‘yes’ to more efficiency, ‘yes’ to the internal market, ‘yes’ to the four freedoms, which Werner Langen touched on.
Enlargement strengthens the internal market.
The internal market strengthens competitiveness.
That also means yes to the Services Directive.
But that also means a stronger commitment to tax policy.
That means a stronger commitment in the financial perspectives to research, education, growth and employment and to new companies.
For me, this naturally means that we must encourage the best so that we can be there for the weak.
Mediocrity must be driven out of Europe.
The new type of nationalisation in mind must be driven out of our policy.
The apportioning of blame between state and Europe must be driven out in order to allow this competitiveness, this innovation, this research, this will to achieve more through efficiency.
I trust here that deeds will follow today's debate and the announcements made, because that is the only way to achieve new dynamism in the European Union.
