Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for having turned your attention to this important but also highly technical issue and for proposing constructive amendments.
We must in fact make every reasonable effort to reduce emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in order to protect health and the environment.
These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances.
According to the UNECE protocol, they are also classified as persistent organic pollutants.
However, these particular hydrocarbons are ingredients in extender oils used in the production of tyres and therefore cause health and environmental problems.
That is why the Commission has proposed introducing harmonised restrictions on the marketing and use of oils containing these PAKs, and on tyres containing these oils.
The Commission proposal will ensure that the internal market in tyres is maintained and that national measures which create trade barriers to the free movement of goods are avoided.
Alternatives to the substances to be restricted are being developed by industry.
In order to give industry the time needed to adjust to the new standards laid down in this directive, the Commission has proposed a reasonable transition period for the transposition of the directive.
Parliament and the Council have tabled a workable compromise package, with amendments on the later introduction of measures and testing requirements and deleting unnecessary exemptions for certain sectors.
The Commission supports these amendments.
I would like to encourage Parliament to accept the proposal at first reading, together with the amendments forming part of this compromise package.
This will demonstrate that the European institutions are willing and able to address such problems without delay.
