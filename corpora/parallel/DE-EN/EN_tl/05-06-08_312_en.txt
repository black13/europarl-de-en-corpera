Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to give my views on the questions raised by Mr Blokland and Mr Krahmer, both of whom address the same problem, that being whether there is any guarantee that the requirements applicable to aircraft tyres will be met by the year 2010.
The reply to Mr Blokland's question is in the negative; no tyre manufacturers have contacted me, nor would I have advised any of them to do so, for they would have received the same reply that I am giving you now.
The Commission has examined the problem carefully.
We have received a formal statement from European tyre manufacturers to the effect that the technical requirements of this directive will also be met by the year 2010 for aircraft tyres.
That is therefore also my reply to Mr Krahmer, whose concerns about the safety of aircraft I fully and completely share.
I also think that, as far as the composition of tyres is concerned, tyre manufacturers are rather more qualified than pilots.
