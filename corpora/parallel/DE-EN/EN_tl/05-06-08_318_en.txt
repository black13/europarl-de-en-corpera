. – Mr President, without doubt, the debate on the Community patent is of no small significance in terms of the European economy.
In any case, there is one effect which must not be underestimated: as long as patents continue to be as expensive as they are now, much of their protective function is lost; patents can even block rather than foster innovation.
However, when we see, from the other side, that the need for diversity and the fostering of diversity are entrenched both in decision-making processes and in the minds of Europeans, then it will be hard for us to simply leap this hurdle.
I therefore think that we here in Parliament must pay special attention first and foremost to the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are inseparable from the competitiveness that we urgently need to support, and on which subject, Commissioner, I have heard little from you.
At present the situation is untenable.
Naturally, this also applies to the question of copyright.
I would point out here that the approach so far, compared with intellectual property rights, is no longer adequate, especially in the field of art – the performing arts, music, and so on – on the Internet and in view of all the changes here.
People are saying that we cannot make criminals out of a whole generation who simply download whatever they can from the Internet with no sense of wrongdoing.
Besides, it is our duty to make a strict distinction between this and software patenting, because the blurred relationship between the European Patent Convention and national case law has created a problematic situation, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
