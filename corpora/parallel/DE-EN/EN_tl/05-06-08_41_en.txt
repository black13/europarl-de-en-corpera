– Mr President, far from being dead, as some are saying, the constitution is alive and must be kept alive, for there is, as far as I am aware, no plausible alternative to it.
There is no plan B that is at all likely to succeed.
That has also become clear in this debate.
We may need more time.
That is why each country should decide for itself when to proceed to ratification.
However, I think it is completely wrong to call a collective halt to the ratification process and suspend it across the board.
That is surely wrong!
Each country must decide this for itself, bearing in mind that we may need more time.
The ‘no’ votes in France and the Netherlands have severely damaged those countries’ status as founders.
There is also a positive side to this, because now perhaps all of the countries are on an equal footing.
Above all, I hope that the new countries will say a hearty ‘yes’, because they have to understand that part of the ‘no’ was also directed at them.
I hope that the people of Poland and the Czech Republic will say a clear ‘yes’ to the European constitution, because this is their future and also their project for the future in Europe.
Obviously, we also need to respond to the public’s concerns.
The people are saying: we want more information; we want more participation; we want more clarity about the European project, and we want more information about its future direction.
Let us actually give people these opportunities!
I believe that project D, to which Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, referred, is a possible way forward.
Let us together organise a grand European debate about the future of European unification, not 25 separate national debates, but one joint debate.
We need an instrument.
Some people are saying another convention, perhaps ‘European assizes’, or some kind of instrument.
It is next week, at the summit, that the signal for this new start ought to be given.
