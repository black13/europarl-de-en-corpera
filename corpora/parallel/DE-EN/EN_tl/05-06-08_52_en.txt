– Mr President, the question is actually always: national populism or European, social, shared responsibility?
That is why I would like the Council to take as its motto, ‘recollection, not reversal’.
I would ask you to produce a code of conduct for all of those who sit on national executives or European legislatures, so as to put an end to the culture of blame and double moral standards.
They should say the same in Brussels as they do at home.
They should be prepared to shoulder their share of responsibility rather than allocating blame.
They should provide information, rather than ignoring the public’s questions and fears.
As well as drafting this code of conduct, I hope that you will open the door for a limited period of reflection, and that you will produce an information and communication strategy that will open a democratic debate with the public, so that the ratification process can continue successfully thereafter.
