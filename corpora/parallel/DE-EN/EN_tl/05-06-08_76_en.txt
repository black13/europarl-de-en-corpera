– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the vote in the temporary committee on 10 May, we had around 620 amendments to deal with and vote on.
On the basis of the 620 amendments in the temporary committee, I had tabled 44 compromise amendments to the committee, of which 41 were adopted.
I should like to ask you to take account of the following when you vote: because of the vote, there are three technical corrections that need to be made to ensure that the text and the table of figures are consistent.
Technical corrections need to be made to the figures in paragraph 50, indents seven and nine.
In the seventh indent, the figure of EUR 4.5 billion should be replaced by the figure EUR 4.7 billion.
The figure of EUR 2.5 billion in the seventh indent should be replaced by the figure of EUR 2.7 billion.
In the ninth indent – and this is a further technical correction that is required – the figure of EUR 1.5 billion should be replaced by the figure of EUR 1.2 billion.
These are the technical corrections required to ensure that the text and table are consistent.
Then I should like to draw your attention to Amendment 6 to paragraph 31.
If the second part of Amendment 6 is adopted, I would ask you to accept it as an addition to paragraph 31.
This is the part of the amendment that reads, ‘considers that allocation of funding should fall under the ‘normal’ EU budget and thus under the discharge authority of the EP’.
That is all on this amendment.
Thirdly, having held further talks just now, I should like to ask my group, contrary to the voting list, to support Amendment 19 to paragraph 50, second indent, tabled by the Socialist Group.
This is after all only a slight nuance, which does not change my intention as rapporteur.
