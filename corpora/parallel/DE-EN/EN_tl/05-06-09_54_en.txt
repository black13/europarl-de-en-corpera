– Mr President, Mr Laschet is quite right.
Our group joined with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in voting for this paragraph to be deleted.
You said that the amendment failed; it was in fact adopted, and the paragraph was deleted.
You have come to the wrong conclusion.
The motion was carried, and this paragraph has therefore been deleted.
