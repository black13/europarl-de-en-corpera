– Mr President, if broad swathes of the European public have problems with mass immigration, what this indicates is not that they are xenophobic, but that the immigrants in question are poorly integrated.
Consideration of the facts makes it clear why this is so.
Let us take note of the fact that Germany has at least 3.5 million Muslims living in it, some of them for 40 years, who can still scarcely speak any German.
Let us also take note of the estimates according to which, in a few decades’ time, half the inhabitants of France and, quite possibly, one third of the population of German cities such as Stuttgart, will be of the Islamic faith.
Let us perhaps give some thought to the regions of Italy in which illegal immigrants are responsible for one third or even one half of all criminal offences.
Let us consider how, in Spain, home to over a million Muslims, calls are even now being made to allow Cordoba Cathedral to be used as a mosque again.
All this is evidence that these immigrants are very poorly integrated.
It is essential that they should not only learn the languages of the countries to which they come to live, but also assume as their own the culture and history of their new homelands.
If they fail to do so, the European states will, in a few decades’ time, have no idea whatever of their own identity.
