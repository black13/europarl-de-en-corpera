Today’s resolution of this House on reform of the UN (B6 0328/2005, moved by Mr Laschet) advocates disturbing and aberrant developments within the United Nations by calling, , for the introduction into international law of what are termed military ‘humanitarian interventions’.
Most seriously, though, the resolution opens the door to the possibility of pre-emptive warfare being mandated by the UN Security Council.
Those who would like to see the UN mandating pre-emptive warfare tread international law underfoot.
Reforming the UN in such a way would amount to the UN hallowing the principle of ‘might is right’.
Such a ‘reform’ of the UN would endorse the dangerous concept of pre-emptive warfare; it would be no more and no less than a programme in support of war.
This is one reason why I am very glad that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has repudiated this resolution.
