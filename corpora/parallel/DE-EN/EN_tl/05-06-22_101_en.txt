One of the Luxembourg Presidency’s successes was its achievement of agreement on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
It is because the Members’ Statute makes it possible to do away with many grey areas and inadequate rules and regulations that I see continued opposition to this compromise as making no sense whatever.
European regulations enable the public to get a better insight than do 25 or 27 sets of national rules and any number of compensation arrangements, some permitted and some not.
I am aware that there are unmistakeable defects in even this compromise.
One fundamental problem that remains is the rule on pensions in Article 14; what is needed is that Members pay their own share of contributions to the pension funds.
Although our amendment – No 1 – on this has now been lost, I am convinced that an opening still exists to find a solution at a lower level than that of the Statute and will continue to press the case for a solution of this kind, which must be supplementary to the Statute.
The Members’ Statute also, at last, paves the way for an Assistants’ Statute.
The House must now make all possible haste to complete the work on one successfully.
