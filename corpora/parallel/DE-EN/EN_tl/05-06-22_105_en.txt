Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from my last speech before the House in Strasbourg, I should like to reiterate my views on the transport of live cattle.
Subsidies for live cattle exports are and always will be nothing short of scandalous, particularly since, in the majority of cases, they benefit either agribusiness or distributors and wholesale distributors, and do very little to help small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises.
It is up to us to do something, however, as we too can bring about certain changes in this respect.
I should like to point out that it is often enough to change cost structures in certain sectors to minimise various practices or to put a stop to them altogether.
I would ask the House to take this into account during the debate on the infrastructure pricing directive, as this would be one opportunity for us to take legislative action.
I should like, once again, to ask the Commission and the Council to initiate a reform of this system, on the one hand in order to put an end to the suffering of animals and on the other in order to support small and medium-sized farms.
