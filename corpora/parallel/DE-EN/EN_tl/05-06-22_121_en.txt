Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for my group, I should like to extend sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, to all of my counterparts from the other groups and, of course, to the Luxembourg presidency for the work we have done together.
The various groups within this House have amply demonstrated their ability to cooperate jointly and effectively, both among themselves and with the Council.
Let me give an example of the sort of case that could occur, the sort of case with which we were faced when we began work on this dossier.
A citizen of a third country wishing to enter the EU, and holding a visa to do so, could be refused entry if he was unable to produce all the required documents at a border crossing point.
This would have resulted in a stamp being placed in his passport showing that he had been refused entry to the EU.
It is hardly likely that the person in question would then have been able to travel to the USA, Canada or Australia with a stamp of this kind in his passport.
The point I should particularly like to emphasise is therefore that we have succeeded in enshrining the right to appeal in the regulation, following lengthy negotiations.
The most important consequence of this is that all stamps indicating refusal of entry into the EU will be corrected in cases where entry has been refused for no good reason.
We have also achieved other, equally significant improvements for third–country nationals.
Human dignity must be respected during border controls, and discrimination on any grounds is prohibited.
In a nutshell, our joint efforts have resulted in a solution which means that checks on those crossing the EU’s external borders will become a great deal more welcoming.
