Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Paasilinna, today we are discussing the future not only of Europe, but also of the international information society.
Europe has every chance of setting an example to the rest of the world in this field, particularly since the information society plays a leading role in the Lisbon Strategy, the main objectives of which are growth and employment.
Our task must be to show people that what growth really means is how much they have in the bank at the end of each month.
We must also show them that increases in employment, or in other words in the number of people in work, mean that we can spend more on welfare benefits, whether in the case of pensions, students or universities.
The digital divide plays a key role in this respect; to take but one example, family businesses in developing countries lack the basics not only in terms of hardware and software, but above all in terms of training.
The focus of our efforts must be on promoting the role of Internet-based professional training.
The Internet is also home to a wealth of cultural and linguistic diversity – another example of which can be seen in this House, with its 20 languages – and so it opens up a wide range of possibilities for achieving what must be our main goal, namely encouraging growth and employment throughout the world.
Health is another factor that must not be neglected, as it will be a key determinant of future welfare spending.
The provision of Internet-based information on health, prevention and awareness of the causes of disease will have a major impact on such spending, and will be most useful in the case of diseases of old age.
It is for this reason that research, development and trade are of absolutely vital importance, as are family businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises.
I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that such issues take centre stage in Tunis.
