Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is perhaps symbolic that what may be the last debate before the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is taking place at this late hour.
The Pact is being quietly laid to rest, well away from the public eye.
Be that as it may, I should like to thank Mr Karas for his report, and for his attempt to formulate a position for Parliament that reconciles the views of the Council and the Commission.
In my opinion, it says a lot that the Council can reach agreement on a further weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact at a time like this, when it cannot agree on a single important issue.
This is all taking place at a time when the euro needs a stable framework and when our key objective should be to avoid running up debts and thereby increasing inflation.
Above all, it is a time when the Commission’s position must be strengthened.
I therefore find it equally regrettable that the Commission has given its consent, as this means that nothing has been done about the Pact’s underlying problem, which is that those who violate it sit in judgment on themselves.
The Council should have given its backing to attempts to flesh out somewhat the details of how its own decisions are to be monitored and interpreted, and the Commission should have supported such attempts accordingly.
The first infringement proceedings against Italy will now make clear what approach the Commission services favour.
All we can do is encourage them to continue the fight to achieve a solid framework for the euro and for the Pact governing the euro, which is our common currency, even if this means coming out in opposition to the Member States.
Members of the previous Commission were prepared to do just that, and I would encourage you to continue fighting for the Pact and for the spirit that it formerly embodied.
