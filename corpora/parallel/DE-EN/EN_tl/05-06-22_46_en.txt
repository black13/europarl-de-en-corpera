Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council said that Europe ought to have shown some maturity.
If anyone or anything has shown itself lacking in maturity, it is not Europe, but the Council, which has brought discredit upon itself as a legislative institution, and it is high time that we compel it to meet in public, which might perhaps be some help.
Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, is now calling for a radical reform of agricultural policy.
We are ready for it.
His demand, though, is a hypocritical one, for he was among those who put the brakes on the last time there was a reform, when he prevented direct payments from being capped or staggered.
He blocked the social cohesion that the coupling of premiums to each worker would have achieved.
He prevented, and voted against, the reallocation of funds to the second pillar for innovation, work and the environment and for the economic development of rural areas.
What that boils down to is that his flagging up of agricultural policy is retribution for the demand – which most of us do in any case support – that the rebate be brought back onto the agenda.
