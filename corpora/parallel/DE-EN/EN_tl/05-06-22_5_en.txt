Mr President, I rise, as announced, pursuant to Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure, in order to call upon you to remove from the agenda the debate on the Members’ Statute, or to stop it going ahead.
The vote on it is not even announced in tomorrow’s agenda.
There has already been one irregular vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and, at a time when the EU is in the midst of its direst crisis, it would send completely the wrong message if we were to adopt a Members’ Statute while accumulating privileges on the quiet.
That is no way to treat a democratic people’s Chamber.
I therefore call upon you to avail yourself of Rule 132(2) and take appropriate precautions, so that Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister, can talk about a programme of savings without being compromised by this House adopting a new package of privileges at the same time.
