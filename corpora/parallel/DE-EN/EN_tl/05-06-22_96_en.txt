Mr President, this is without a doubt an epoch-making moment in the history of this House, for this debate and vote are, strictly speaking, illicit, and the content of this Statute now amounts to a package of privileges that undermines democracy.
I predict that what the overwhelming majority of this House’s Members have accomplished today, and will no doubt finalise tomorrow, will go down in history as the final nail in the European Union’s coffin.
Its end result is that a people’s Chamber becomes so detached from reality that many view from a great height the real problems that afflict Europe – be they privileged eating arrangements or something else.
It was six years ago that I came to this House, a convinced supporter of the EU and lead candidate of the same party that provides with our President, who is currently in the chair and enabling this to happen.
I believed that we would be able to escape the trap of globalisation and make the European dream a reality; instead I have had to spend those six years watching the European trap being set – step by step, in a succession of misguided decisions, by one package of privileges after another.
It is tragic.
Nevertheless, I am still persuaded that it is possible to achieve real, serious democracy at European level, albeit not, of course, in such a manner as this.
At the same time, to accuse most of this House of blindness, as happens over and over again, is to insult the blind.
My grandfather was blind, and yet he was very sensitive, having a feel for, and noticing, many things.
The same cannot be said of most of those in this House.
I wish long life to any real, democratic parliament that is close to the people and binds peoples together.
It has to be said that this is not one; it is far more a colony of the privileged.
