I am in favour of the Membersâ€™ Statute being adopted without delay.
All Members of the European Parliament should, as soon as possible, be subject to uniform terms and conditions.
I will not, however, be participating in the vote, as I shall not be availing myself of the new arrangements.
I took my seat subject to the former conditions and will continue to regard myself as bound by them.
