We live in an age of headlong technological change, and, at the same time, criminal activity is developing with equal speed.
One example of this is the latest theft of credit card data, which may well affect some 800 000 Europeans.
The electronic health cards that we intend introducing may well end up being the next thing that the criminal gangs will have their eyes on.
Cybercrime – in the shape of illegal downloads, spamming, spyware and child pornography – is flourishing, and only some 1 or 2% of the offences committed on the Internet ever come to light.
What makes this particularly disturbing is the widespread ignorance of such crime.
Far too many users are still falling prey to e-mailshots that trick them into disclosing their bank details, thus credulously giving fraudsters access not only to sensitive data, but also to their own bank accounts.
The latest Eurobarometer survey showed that 40% of Austrian parents had no idea where to get information on safe use of the Internet and where to report prohibited material.
In that, though, they are not alone, for investigations have revealed that the US authorities are equally ignorant of when and to whom they should report cases of cybercrime.
Tracking down cyber-crooks is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
This makes it all the more important that we should mount an information campaign that would enable users not only to avoid the traps in the Internet, but also to play their part in combating the crime that goes on there.
