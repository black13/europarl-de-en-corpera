Mr President, I have voted against this Statute, and have done so for five reasons.
The first is that I think this is not the right time for it; while Europe as a whole is grappling with its future, we are concerning ourselves with the future of our financial arrangements.
The second is that I am opposed to tax privileges.
The third is that I see our having our pensions paid by the taxpayer as sending the wrong message.
The fourth is that I do not think we should be getting a percentage of what judges are paid; rather, things should be the other way around, with judges being paid a percentage of what the freely-elected representatives of a sovereign people earn.
After all, it would also sound much better if judges were to be paid 250% of an MEP’s salary.
Finally, all this involves us looking into the future; we are taking decisions on behalf of future Members, and I do not find that exactly proper either.
As I do not regard this as a particularly favourable result, I have voted ‘no’.
I am sure that many of my colleagues who have voted ‘yes’ today have done so not out of conviction, but in response to pressure from the media, and that, too, is a pity.
