Mr President, having taken note of the result of negotiations between Parliament and the Council, we in the Austrian People’s Party delegation voted to adopt this Members’ Statute.
We find it regrettable that the Council should have dictated to Parliament conditions in respect of the Rothley report, one of which was that the cut in salary should be compensated for by the pension scheme being made non-contributory.
Every amendment that we have tabled here today would, from the Council’s point of view, have caused the Members’ Statute to fall.
It was high time, following 10 years of negotiations, that this House should endow itself with a Members’ Statute, and for there to be equal pay for equal work.
To this compromise we have agreed, even though there is without doubt room for improvement in many areas.
