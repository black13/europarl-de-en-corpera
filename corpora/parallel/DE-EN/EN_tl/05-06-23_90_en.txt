I am in favour of enacting a single statute for all Members of the European Parliament.
A functioning European Parliament depends to a large degree on a good uniform statute being in place.
Any such statute must, however, have at its heart modern, EU-wide rules on MEPs’ immunity from prosecution.
In Parliament’s present motion for a resolution, the Member States are requested to revise the provisions laid down in a protocol in 1965.
No such rule is to be found in the draft Statute itself.
Regarding this as a fundamental defect, I have – as I did in December 2003 – voted against the draft Statute.
In the event of the Statute entering into force in 2009, I very much hope that this defect will have been, by that date, remedied by means of a rule on the immunity of MEPs that shall be binding, equal and uniform across the EU.
It was not only in this respect that Mr Rothley’s original draft was markedly superior to the present text, for it embodied a parliamentary law that was, in a whole range of other areas, more modern and more comprehensible to the public than national rules, including those obtaining in Germany, not least in such matters as the requirement that Members make a contribution to their own pensions, for which no provision is made in the regulations of many national legislatures.
