This House has for many years been calling for a single Statute for its Members.
We have, on innumerable occasions, been critical of the extreme divergences in the remuneration of those who represent Europe’s people.
The process of making the EU more democratic must be of equal value to all its Member States.
Now, for the second time, the Council has presented us with a compromise proposal, which we, the elected Members of this House, are supposed to agree to.
It envisages basing MEPs’ income on a good third of the income of a European judge.
Absent from this proposal, in my view, is any clear statement about what value Europeans themselves attach to the financial independence of their MEPs, and these same MEPs are instead exposed to an unworthy media campaign.
At a time when all pro-European forces are concentrating on overcoming the problems involved in modernising the new, enlarged Europe, I do not intend expending any energy on ‘Project Statute’ if it means that we are reproached for feathering our own nests.
I will be abstaining from the final vote.
