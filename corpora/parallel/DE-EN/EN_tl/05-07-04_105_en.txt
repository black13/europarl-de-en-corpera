Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that tomorrow will see the beginning of the end for soft PVC in toys.
The existence of safe alternatives means that this start on abandoning softeners is long overdue.
There were worrying results from tests in Germany on scoubidou cords and plastic dolls, and these precipitated widespread alarm by demonstrating a high concentration of softeners, although it does have to be said that they made it clear that the legislation already in place, which provided for checks during production, was inadequate.
The European Toys Directive does not cover the softeners that are suspected of damaging the liver, kidneys and reproductive organs.
Reference has already been made to the fact that the toxic cocktail is unleashed not only by spittle but also by fat in the skin and by sweat.
Poisoning children in this fashion is no way to start them out on life.
The ban on softeners that damage the reproductive system is a milestone in terms of the protection of consumers and particularly of children.
I would like to see us venture a quantum leap in the second category too, for we could then demonstrate that the internal market is not just in the interests of industry, but also exists to benefit and protect children.
Such hazardous substances as phthalates have to be taken out of circulation and replaced by safe ones.
Phthalates in soft PVC, though, are no more than the tip of the iceberg.
I hope that the Commission will produce, as soon as possible, a proposal covering medical materials such as infusion tubes and blood bags, for alternatives are available to these too, and here too we cannot jeopardise the health of children and the newborn in particular.
