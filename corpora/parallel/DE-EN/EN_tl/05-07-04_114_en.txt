Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Myller, my group has, in the course of discussions, made it clear that we endorse one hundred per cent the opinion expressed by the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, and, with the debate – since this morning – revived in the pages of European newspapers, I would like to again encourage the environment Commissioner, Mr Dimas, to keep a continued firm grasp on the positions enunciated in the Commission communication.
Reading these documents, one finds no evidence of any renewed discussion within the Commission about the point, or lack of it, of an ambitious environmental policy.
I think you really should take the figures in your own report for the Commission on environmental technologies and put them in front of Commissioner Verheugen.
As long ago as 2003, the global market in environmental goods was worth EUR 500 billion – more than the markets for air and space travel, and growing since then at the rate of 5% per annum, which is more than the rate at which the gross domestic product is growing.
What more, then, do we want?
This successful development is the success of a very ambitious environmental policy, and I can do no other than encourage you, Mr Dimas, not to allow yourself to be led astray and to be every bit as ambitious as your predecessor in office.
