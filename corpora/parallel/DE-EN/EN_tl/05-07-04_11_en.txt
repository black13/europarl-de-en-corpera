Mr President, let me first of all express my group’s condolences to the late Mr Adwent’s family, and also wish Mr Laschet all the best in his new role.
We will miss him as an adversary in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I wish to move – and it is not a pleasant task to do so – that Questions to the Commission be again adjourned to another day, as we have a lot of things in mind for the Structural Funds, and so we are very keen to take part in the debate on them.
Even though this debate will probably make few changes of any substance, a lot of Members would like to speak in it.
We will be in a similar situation on several occasions over the coming months – the services directive and REACH are two examples that spring to mind – and so I would ask you, Mr President, and the services, to give some thought to what arrangements we should be making for them.
I have no desire to make the same request every time and deprive Members of something they are entitled to.
We need to join together in considering how we can retain Question Time and still allow more time for important debates.
Today, though, I wish, on behalf of my group, to move that Question Time be dispensed with, and, as I have said, that the services give some thought to these matters.
