Mr President, while taking the Commissioner’s goodwill as read, I cannot refrain from quoting to him a few figures on air pollution: 370 000 premature deaths per annum in Europe, which is many times the number killed on the roads.
In over 60% of all Europe’s ecosystems, biodiversity is under threat.
If nothing is done by 2020, we will see 292 000 premature deaths and over 90 000 admitted to hospital with breathing problems.
Moreover, 650 000 square kilometres – an area twenty times the size of Belgium – of Europe’s ecosystem are under threat of azotic pollution.
You yourself announced to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we could look forward in July to the thematic strategy on air.
Your Director-General, Katherine Day, joined us a fortnight ago and told us the same thing, that this thematic strategy would be in place in July.
It now appears that industry has gained the upper hand and is trying – I think, blindly – to delay the air strategy.
As I see it, we need together to strive towards this particular Lisbon goal in order to make ourselves more competitive.
While stressing, as one must, the need to remain competitive, we cannot forget the need for sustainability, for it is sustainable growth for which Europe is known.
In the long term, or so I believe, this is our only chance on the world stage to ensure our ability to compete in the long term with India and China, and so I ask you, as a matter of urgency, to get your fellow-Commissioners round to your point of view and to produce this thematic strategy by autumn at the latest, which we enable you to do as you have promised.
