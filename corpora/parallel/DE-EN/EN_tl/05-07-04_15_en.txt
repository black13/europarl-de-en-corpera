Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the avoidance of doubt, I would like to start with three prefatory remarks.
The first is that most members of my group voted in favour of Bulgarian and Romanian accession on 1 January 2007.
Secondly, there has been a debate in the Conference of Presidents as to when observers from these countries can be invited to join in the work of this House.
I regard this as an issue for debate in the plenary and believe that no date can as yet be set.
Thirdly, as the states that joined us in 2004 were allowed to send observers to the European Parliament a year prior to their accession, we believe that the same rule should apply, with exactly the same timeframe, and that an accession date cannot yet be named, quite simply because the ratification of the accession treaties has not yet been completed.
Nor has the Commission yet produced its progress report.
The consequences of this are not yet known; it would still be possible to delay accession until 1 January 2008, and we have not made financial and organisational preparations for observation to begin earlier.
We therefore want the Commission to make a statement on the state of play as regards its planned progress report, enabling us to come to our own conclusions, rather than put the next new Member States, as regards observation and cooperation, in a more advantageous position than that formerly enjoyed by the last ten Member States to join us.
