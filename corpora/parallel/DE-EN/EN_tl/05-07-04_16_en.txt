Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House is not in any doubt about the fact that Bulgaria and Romania will join the European Union.
What is still an open question is at what point in time they will do so.
The Conference of Presidents has decided to invite observers in September, and, although we all, of course, accept its ruling with the utmost submissiveness and reverence, the plenary might perhaps be allowed to decide these things for itself from time to time.
There are three reasons why the date set for the sending of observers was too early.
For a start, never before have observers been invited so early on; secondly, the treaties explicitly provide for the accession date to be delayed, and, if that were to happen, the observers would be here for rather more than two years; and thirdly they would be with us when the Commission presents its next progress report, in which we can expect an answer as to whether accession is to take place at the beginning of 2007 or of 2008, and debating with observers present is not a good idea.
We therefore ask that this item be put on the agenda, thus enabling us, on the basis of the plenaryâ€™s decision, to consider the matter carefully.
