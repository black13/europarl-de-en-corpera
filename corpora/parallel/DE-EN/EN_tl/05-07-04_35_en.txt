Mr President, Mr Hans-Peter Martin, a non-attached Member of this House, is now, in the Austrian media, delivering himself of sweeping, foul, unqualified insinuations and slurs, aimed no longer only at this House and the European Union’s institutions, but also at those who assist us in our work as Members and the officials of the European Parliament.
Among other things he has written in a daily newspaper, I will quote the following: ‘The assistants, mainly young graduates, quickly get used to a three-day week, enticed, seduced and spoiled by Brussels.’
He goes on in similar vein, as follows: ‘In this place, heaven help any MEP who expects hard work; practically all of them find it far beyond them.
Performance and responsibility are not in their vocabulary; sloppiness comes as standard.
Most of all, the staff can neither concentrate nor see things through.’
I firmly repudiate these sweeping denigrations of our staff and of the staff of this House.
I wish to thank all our staff, without whom we would not be able to make such a good job of serving the people, and without whom we would be unable to cope with so many parties of visitors and so much legislative work.
