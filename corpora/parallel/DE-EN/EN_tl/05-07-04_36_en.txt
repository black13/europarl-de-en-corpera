Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week, the Council adjourned the vote on the directive introducing a uniform drivers’ licence across the EU, and this decision I regard as extremely irresponsible, short-sighted, and, indeed, incomprehensible.
One reason why many members of the public reject the EU is that they believe that it lays down rules and regulations on everything, conceivable and inconceivable, but to put on ice, for fear of prompting even more Euro-scepticism, a directive that makes the roads safer, strikes me as utterly, excessively rash as a course of action.
I also see it as betraying a communications failure on the part of the ministers responsible for the delay, who did not attempt to communicate the directive’s significance and purpose to the public, and perhaps did not have the nerve to do so.
This directive could do a great deal to put a stop to ‘driving licence tourism’ and make the roads a good deal safer.
An Austrian government minister – the transport minister, in fact – recently gave it as his opinion in an Austrian newspaper, that the European people should not be treated in such a condescending manner.
That, though, is precisely what the Council is doing with this decision and the minister in question was one of those responsible for it doing so.
