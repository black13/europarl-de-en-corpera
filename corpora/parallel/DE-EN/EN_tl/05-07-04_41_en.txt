Mr President, a written declaration on rheumatic diseases has been put out today for Members of this House to sign.
It is one that I urge you and all Members of this House to support.
The reason why I am doing this is that rheumatic diseases affect 50% of the European Unionâ€™s population, and 50% of those treated for them will become unemployed within ten years, accounting also for 450 million days of paid sick leave in Europe every year.
This adds up to a heavy burden on our social security and health systems and is also an obstacle to our achieving the essential Lisbon goals.
I therefore urge you to support this declaration, which calls for the Commission to acknowledge once and for all that rheumatic diseases are among the major diseases and should therefore be included in a special category in the Seventh Research Programme.
