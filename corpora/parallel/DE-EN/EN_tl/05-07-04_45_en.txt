Mr President, the way Members of this House are treated at European summits has for years been a cause of annoyance, and this last summit in Brussels was no exception.
The simple fact is that the bunker mentality in the Justus Lipsius building is so pronounced that nobody – not even the media – can make contact with the representatives of the people.
A number of passes were issued to us.
I heard that three chauffeurs got passes, whilst three Committee chairmen – of the Committees on the Budget, Citizens’ Freedoms and Constitutional Affairs – could not get in at all.
I would ask you to devise a system for future summits enabling representatives from this House to get access to these events.
