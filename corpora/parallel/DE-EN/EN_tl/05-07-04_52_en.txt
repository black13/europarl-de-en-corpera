.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say, first of all, how very grateful I am to Mrs Wallis for her report.
Having said that, though, please permit me to say something quite fundamental.
The Committee on Legal Affairs discusses immunity issues .
As a rule, these are highly sensitive matters concerning individual Members personally.
As I think it would be wise for this House to dispense with public debates on these immunity issues, I shall say nothing about the substance of this case, but will limit myself to stating that my group endorses the position taken by the rapporteur in her report.
At the same time, I will point out that the same applies in the case of Mr Marchiani, on which Mr Speroni is the rapporteur, which we will be dealing with next; I am aware that, by doing so, I am contravening this House’s Rules of Procedure and so you are welcome to strike my intervention from the record.
I would also ask that this debate be conducted briskly and with dispatch, as Mr Trichet has already been waiting here for over an hour, and we do, I think, have more important things to do than going on in public about Members’ private affairs.
