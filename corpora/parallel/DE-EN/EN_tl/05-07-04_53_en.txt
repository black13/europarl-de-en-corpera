Mr President, I, too, would like to say how surprised I am that we are actually debating these immunity cases.
My recollection is that we have always, in the past, had a different way of doing these things.
I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for considering these cases with such care.
If you are going to read these documents and find out to what depths some Italian politicians sink, you will need a pretty strong stomach.
I share her view, which we, in Committee, also endorsed in Case 3, which is due to be heard by a court in Milan.
I believe that the cases to be heard in Brescia and in Bergamo are on the borderline, and involve a Member of this House using his immunity to the utmost, even to the detriment of others.
Although I regard that as being as far as one can go, I would say that this case is an example of the rule that the accused enjoys the benefit of the doubt.
Turning to Case 4, which the Committee on Legal Affairs found particularly problematic, I would be particularly appreciative if we could again review our opinion and our recommendation.
I believe this to be a case in which the machinery of protection that this House has at its disposal is being improperly used.
As a whole, not only this case but also the next, show the urgent need for revision of the laws on immunity.
My saying that absolves me of the need to say anything about the next case.
We do indeed hope that the Statute will bring this about, for I do believe that the current regulations are too vague, in that they fail to protect those Members who need protection, while allowing others to exploit the system.
