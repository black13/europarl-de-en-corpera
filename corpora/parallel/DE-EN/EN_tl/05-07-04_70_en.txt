Mr President, those who want power, who want to shape the way things are, must envy you, for you, right now, are guiding a vitally important vessel through heavy seas, and I am sure you are aware of the responsibility involved in that.
I would like to join those who are briefly reminding you of a couple of mirages by which you should not allow yourself to be led astray.
Particularly under the present political conditions, I think it would be mistaken to make too great haste in enlarging the eurozone.
I think that the transparency of your own institution would be of great value particularly when difficult decisions have to be taken and it would be useful to know who had been on what side.
I ultimately believe that it is the credibility of your own House that is at stake; I suggest that you look at its structure, its superfluous positions and privileges, before they become the subject of public debate and your House ends up going the same way as so many others.
