Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the Court of Justice, Mr Trichet, yours is the least controversial institution in the European Union.
It has a clear mandate, and you and your team do what is expected of you.
For that we are grateful.
You are predictable, consistent, reliable, and foster trust and confidence.
Your policy is characterised by calmness and a steady hand, and all I ask of you is that you keep it that way.
At the same time, of course, I also bid you step in when public statements, statistics or actions go against your convictions and the facts.
As a global player, you need to do more to explain to the public the events that occur on the global stage, the ways in which we are dependent on them and their consequences for us, and I urge you to help policy-makers convey the objective necessity of structural reforms and the balancing of budgets, and the fact that sustainable growth and rising numbers of people in work are dependent on them.
You, Mr Trichet, should have more input into information on what is happening in economic and monetary affairs, for awareness is dependent upon information.
I urge you to keep on stressing the preventive dimension of the Stability and Growth Pact, to keep on denouncing every infringement of it, and to defend the flanks of the Commission and of the countries that remain stable as they go about their work.
I would also urge you, though, to deter countries from running up deficits – if need be, by means of higher interest rates and poorer internal ratings.
People need to know about the value the euro adds in terms of growth and employment, in terms of lower credit interest, about the ways in which it benefits the EU’s stability and the good it does in the wallets and purses of ordinary members of the public.
There is a great deal for us to do, for public sentiment does not reflect the facts.
