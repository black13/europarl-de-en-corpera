Mr President, it is sometimes hard to identify with the European Union, and the same is true in the case of the euro.
The past and present products of our minds must be better communicated and discussed, and that goes for the euro too.
Before it was introduced, there was a need for people to be persuaded; now that it is there, people have come to a positive view of it, and that needs to be reinforced and confirmed if it is to be sustainable and people are to identify with it, and that is what we want communications management to do.
It also has to be said that, both before and after the event, prices in both currencies were, and are, among the most important measures to help with the introduction of the euro.
Consumersâ€™ organisations and the economic and social partners have a crucial part to play in this.
At the end of the day, though, confidence in money and the currency will not be fostered merely by rattling off the reasons why price stability must take priority.
It is when people find work and enjoy social protection that confidence is built up.
I wish to thank Mr Maaten for the even-handedness of his report.
