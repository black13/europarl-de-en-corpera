Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to my colleague from Baden-Württemberg, Mr Lauk, for his report, in which he has rightly drawn attention to the good work done over the past year by the European Central Bank and by you, Mr Trichet.
Despite the apparent inflation, many members of the public see the euro as a success story, and, while I am on that subject, I would like to say how much I agree with Mr Ettl that it is certainly not price stability alone that brings Europe economic growth, but rather – as Mr Trichet pointed out – economic policy that responds to the present need for reform, and that is what we need to see at the national level.
There is one point that the rapporteur addressed and which continues to be seen as a major problem by many members of the public, by which I mean the high costs involved in transferring funds across borders.
I hope – indeed, I am sure – that the Commission will continue its efforts to implement a single payment area in Europe once and for all.
Like Mr Radwan, I do not believe that we need a single economic government in Europe to witness the European Central Bank – whose independence is, as it must be, guaranteed – rendering an account of its policy to the ministers of the economy and of finance.
It is my belief that the European Central Bank, by commenting on the relaxing of the Stability and Growth Pact, assumed a political role, which it is of course entitled to do.
The younger generation in particular find it absolutely unacceptable that the Member States should, year in and year out, spend several hundred billions of euros more than they collect in tax, and that it should be a matter of European policy – through the alteration of the Stability Pact – that this practice should in some sense be defended.
It follows that I am very grateful indeed to you, Mr Trichet, for not mincing your words when speaking about such changes to the Pact, and, with the interests of the younger generation in mind, I ask you to continue, in future, to keep a close eye on everything done in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact, constantly bearing in mind the needs of monetary policy.
