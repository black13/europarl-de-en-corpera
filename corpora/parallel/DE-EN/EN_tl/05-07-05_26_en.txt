Mr President, I have to tell you that the whole debate in this House about software patents largely gives the lie to the constantly-repeated mantra disseminated by the European institutions throughout the continent, not least by means of Commission and Council initiatives, to the effect that we want to do all we can to protect the vital interests of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The software industry has grown well and prospered in Europe, and it has done so on the basis of perfectly adequate rules on copyright andreverse engineering, those in some areas derived from patent.
Why, then, do we need these new rules in the first place, when over-regulation is so much in the air?
If what is now proposed for software patents actually goes through, it will benefit only two or three big firms, mainly Microsoft and SAP, one American and the other a major German firm, and perhaps also Siemens and firms of that kind.
It will, however, damage the vital interests of many small and medium-sized enterprises that have been very successful over recent years.
The rules on software patents that we are debating here today could well turn out to be a job-creating measure â€“ the jobs in question being created for lawyers, who will have a lot to do if we do not reject the demand made of us today.
