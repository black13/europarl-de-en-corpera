Mr President, I wish, today, to address those who are not here â€“ not all the 450 million Europeans, but those who are waiting outside this Chamber, and those who pestered us with -mails, faxes and telephone calls.
I think it is wonderful that they did so.
What we are seeing happening today and will see happening tomorrow is important in terms of what democracy will be like in the Europe of the future.
People are getting worked up about things that will affect them.
We have seen for ourselves how the multifarious arguments put forward in this House are often far more astute, far more detailed, and far more precise than what we ourselves are capable of coming up with amidst the deluge of other decisions that we have to take.
After five years in which Members moved 5 500 amendments and voted on 50 000 additional items, none of us can claim to have really got to the bottom of it all.
The input we received was good; it won me over.
I am persuaded that we will be doing democracy, small and medium-sized enterprises, even, indeed, economic prosperity a favour if we vote against these software patents.
As for those standing outside with their whistles and T-shirts, I would like to encourage them to stick at it, to publish the results of the vote, to show how each one of us actually voted.
That way we will see whose bidding the Members of this House have done: that of the parties with their resolutions, that of the lobbyists, or that of their own consciences.
