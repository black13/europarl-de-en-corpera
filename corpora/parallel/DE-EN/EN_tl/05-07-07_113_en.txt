Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say on the subject of the vote on Bulgaria and Romania I say on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and it is that it was our group that was the motivating force behind yesterday’s debate.
We wish to stress that the previous enlargement of the European Union was a great success, and that is what we want the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to be.
In no group in this House were there as many votes in favour of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania as from our group, the PPE-DE.
We want it to succeed; we also want the accession treaties to apply as a whole and to their fullest extent.
We have taken a different view as regards the observers.
The Conference of Presidents, meeting on 9 June, decided that the observers should come on 26 September.
Let me make it quite clear that the idea of inviting observers – that is, from the ten countries that are now Member States – originally came from our group.
We are firm advocates of the idea that countries due to join us should send observers.
We would, however, have preferred it if the observers were to join us in this House one year prior to accession, as once did the observers from the ten new Member States.
There would have been an opportunity, when we moved the debate on Monday, to inform the House that its President had already, and without our knowledge, extended the invitations.
This was something of which we needed to be informed.
This state of affairs has prompted us to withdraw our motion and both the changes to the vote for which we had asked.
We would have been glad if the House had been able to arrive at a common position.
As most members of our group were in favour of abstaining from the vote, we did not vote in favour of the joint motion.
As democrats, we will of course respect the majority that has resulted from it; we will welcome the observers and look forward to working with them.
