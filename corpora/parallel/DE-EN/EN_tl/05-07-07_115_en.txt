Mr President, further to what has been said by our group chairman, I would like to say that I abstained from voting on the resolutions on Romania and Bulgaria, as the fact that the President of this House had already, on Friday, sent a written invitation to the observers meant that neither resolution actually has a procedural basis any more.
We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have responded to this change in the procedural basis by withdrawing the resolution, and that was the right thing to do.
As the other side had not done likewise, and the resolutions – to the substance of which we were not opposed – had already been taken, and the deeds had been done, it was not necessary to draft a new resolution.
I always work on the principle that, if you have sent someone an invitation, you cannot withdraw it if circumstances have not changed.
While we extend a warm welcome to those to whom the invitations have been sent, and look forward to their working with us, we do believe that what is more important than any date is that equal treatment should be given to all acceding countries, that rules should be obeyed and that their substance should be taken seriously, for, if that were not the case, the public would get the idea that we did not treat everyone equally.
I have to reiterate that it was incumbent on the President of this House to inform us during Monday’s debate of precisely what he had done.
Had he done so, we would have saved ourselves a great deal of recrimination, upset and misunderstanding both before and during this debate.
