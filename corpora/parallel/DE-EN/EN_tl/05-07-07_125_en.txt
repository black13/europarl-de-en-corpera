Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the calamitous effects of the latest round of liberalisation in the textile sector on 1 January 2005 made action urgently necessary, and I am very glad that the Commission has done something.
Although it deserves a great deal of praise for the speed with which it initiated negotiations and took steps to deal with the situation, these steps could have been more far-reaching and could have been taken sooner.
I would like to highlight the important role this House has played in this respect.
It was what we did that compelled the Commission, even more than it would have been, to have recourse to these measures.
Left to themselves, they might well have done rather less.
It is, though, to challenges such as these that European policy must respond.
Here in Europe, we enjoy the great advantage – and it is one of which I am glad – that our consumers are surely among the most mature in the world, and so they should be given the chance to decide what and how to buy, on the basis of far more information and with greater ease.
We should give thought to the possibility of introducing a ‘made in Europe’ label, which would be able to be carried only subject to certain very stringent criteria being complied with, first among them, of course, compliance with international labour standards, along with social and environmental standards and a ban on the use of child labour.
If we succeed in this, we will also be able to find another way to respond to this development and make the world rather more socially responsible and cleaner.
