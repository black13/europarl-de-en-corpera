Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for his work.
There is a need for special measures to be taken in all the European Union’s policy areas, particularly, of course in agriculture, and especially in its outermost regions.
I myself am from a region, Lower Austria’s , which was for decades on the fringes of Western Europe and of the free world, and it too had to contend with some similar problems, such as problematic topography and climate, inadequate resources, a small and regional market and a scarcity of jobs.
The Member State in question has been helped by support programmes from the European Union to build up innovative and self-supporting agriculture and to create jobs.
Solidarity in real life is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union.
It is unfortunate that several Heads of State do not see that so clearly, particularly as regards the common agricultural policy.
Following on from what the Council resolved at its summits in Brussels and Luxembourg, productive agriculture must be possible throughout the EU, in every region and location.
At the end of the day, it is the disadvantaged regions that need agriculture to help bring people employment and prosperity.
More than that, the support measures we are discussing today enable our model of multifunctional and sustainable agriculture to function as an example to those in all the parts of the EU that are far from the continent.
In many states adjoining the regions in question – and here I am particularly thinking of South America – an agricultural industry comparable to that in the USA is in the process of being developed.
We are now being presented with an opportunity to create a sustainable economy by other means – the right ones in economic, environmental and social terms.
