Mr President, let me, too, join in congratulating the rapporteur, whose report demonstrates the commitment that is called for and who, as we have seen from the debate so far, has the overwhelming majority of this House behind her.
This report makes good the immense deficiencies in the Commission proposal, and so it is vital that it be adopted by a large majority.
As I see it, the proposal’s most glaring defect is the failure to provide financially for the management of the Natura 2000 network during the period from 2007 to 2013, even though the Sixth Environment Action Programme gave high priority to, among other things, species diversity and the protection of species.
Within the Commission’s plan for Natura 2000 networks to be funded by the Structural Funds lurks the immense danger that, in practice, not enough money will be made available for them.
Mrs Haug has already referred to the result of yesterday’s vote.
It is also clear from the Commission’s approach that it is unwilling to take responsibility for the way in which the Community’s common environmental policies are implemented.
The Commission has also failed outright to put in place the clause ensuring proper management of the Natura 2000 networks, which is an essential condition for funding by the Structural Funds, and so we in this House need, by a convincing majority, to endorse the rapporteur’s approach, which entails integrating into the LIFE + programme the costs of implementing Natura 2000.
