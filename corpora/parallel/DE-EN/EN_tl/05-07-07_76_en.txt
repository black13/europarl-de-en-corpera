Mr President, I think Mr Wurtz has got it absolutely right; what matters is not that we have not yet brought the debate to a conclusion, for that is in order.
What matters is that, instead of holding the vote today, we should wait until the next part-session, which will be in September, and vote then.
I strongly support the motion.
