Mr President, I had asked to speak even before the declarations of vote on the order of business.
I would like to put to you the straight question as to whether it really is legitimate to move the adjournment of a vote before the end of a debate.
I do not believe that it is.
I believe that this should have been moved only once the debate was over, or, alternatively, that we could have voted this evening, and I would ask you to check this before then.
In that case, we would have to include in the closing vote another vote on the motion for adjournment, for it was, or so I believe, irregular to vote on that in the middle of a debate.
