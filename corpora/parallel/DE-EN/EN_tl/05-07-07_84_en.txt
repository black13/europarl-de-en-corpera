Mr President, having voted against the Isler Béguin report, I wish to make clear that I am in favour of protecting the environment and also of the financial settlement, which is absolutely necessary.
I also favour keeping to the position we arrived at on the financial perspectives, as laid down in the Böge Report.
I am, however, opposed to the institutions giving support to environmental associations or non-governmental organisations, and against the European Union taking upon itself any more functions.
Even in protecting the environment, subsidiarity must be the order of the day.
Primary responsibility for it lies with the Member States.
That applies to forestry policy, and also to the buying-up of land for nature conservation.
When money is tight, we have to concentrate on what is essential, that being support for the environmentally-responsible management of land.
