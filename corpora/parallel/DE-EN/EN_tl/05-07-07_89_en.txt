There is much scepticism about the European Union among the Swiss public, who fear the loss of their political rights and do not want to allow anything to be imposed on them.
To date, the Alpine state has taken the wise course of entering only into bilateral treaties, as a result of which it enjoys a privileged partnership with the EU, something that is also to be recommended to many other states who want to retain their sovereignty and characteristics.
The EU, racked by crises, slides on one banana skin after another, thrown into disarray by the German visa scandal, with the double ‘no’ to the Constitution and unresolved budget issues following close behind.
It has to be said that this very rejection of the constitution may have made it easier from some of the Swiss to vote in favour of Schengen and Dublin, as it is more probable that they will come to like a loose federation of states than a centrally directed single state.
Against the background of prevailing suspicion, the veiled threat of Schengen/Dublin is not exactly likely to foster trust, the result being that everyone knows that they will have to vote in September on the extension of the agreement to the new Member States of the EU.
It is precisely this ignorance, and the all too obvious steamrollering of sovereign decision-making that causes the European public such concern.
It is not acceptable that support grants worth millions and deceptive promises should be employed to entice new Members or bind countries closer to the EU, thereby robbing them of the option of going their own way outside it.
