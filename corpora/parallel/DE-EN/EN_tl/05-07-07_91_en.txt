Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish to welcome the agreement between Europe and Canada on the processing and forwarding of Advance Passenger Information and Passenger Name Records data, which we regard as thoroughly well-balanced.
It represents a decisive step in addressing the sensitive issues of global security and the fight against international terrorism, of which we have seen another lamentable example today.
The PPE-DE Group has abstained from voting today, this being our chosen way of protesting to the Council at the short deadlines, which are scarcely credible and leave no time for the debate that needs to be held.
Our protest is directed solely at the procedure.
We want this agreement, for on it depends the security of the citizens whom we in this House represent, and the way we have voted is intended to reflect that.
I would like to express our congratulations to the Commission on the agreement and on the proposal, as also to the rapporteur.
