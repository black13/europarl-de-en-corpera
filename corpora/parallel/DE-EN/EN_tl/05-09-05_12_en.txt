Mr President, the vote has been held, the result is clear, and we do of course respect it, but I would like to pick up on what Mrs Napoletano had to say.
Belarus is still an important issue, and we should discuss it at one of the forthcoming part-sessions – I would suggest the second September one.
We have just had a meeting of our group’s bureau that was attended by guests from Belarus.
The situation there is very threatening, and so I ask Members now to agree to this debate being held during the second September part-session.
This request is one that I make from the bottom of my heart and I make it to you all.
