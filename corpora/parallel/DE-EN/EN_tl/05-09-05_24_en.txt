Mr President, I would like to give my unreserved support to those who argue that we have to help Romania to overcome a grave natural calamity at a difficult time, one in which it also has to prepare itself for membership of the European Union.
This latter consideration, though, makes it seem to me all the more objectionable that the government is attempting, by way of a change in the law, to remove from office the presidents of the two houses of the parliament and those of the various regional parliaments, even though the current legislative period is not yet over.
I think Romania has more important things to do, such as ensuring internal consensus.
Perhaps you, Mr President, might make inquiries of your opposite numbers in Romania?
Above all, I would ask the representatives of the other political parties to bring influence to bear in an attempt to get these matters resolved consensually and without internal disruption, rather than by taking this sort of action against opposition parties.
Romania needs political consensus if it is to make a good job of preparing itself for the European Union and for life as one of its Member States.
