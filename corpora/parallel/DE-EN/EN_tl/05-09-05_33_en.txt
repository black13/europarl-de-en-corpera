Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of the opportunity presented today to bring to the House’s attention a remarkable initiative by some of Europe’s young people.
Over 50 of them, from six European countries, took part in a workshop at a college of higher education in my electoral district in which they acted out their own ‘European Parliament’, the object being to make the EU more attractive to the public.
What emerged from this was a resolution on the creation of a citizens’ Europe, a number of points from which I would like to quote.
The young people’s ‘European Parliament’ calls on the Commission to provide the citizens of Europe with comprehensive information about the Member States, European policymaking, and cultural events in all their diversity.
They call for a deceleration of the enlargement process and, in order that there should be more in-depth information about the EU, propose closer cooperation between it and the national broadcasters.
They articulate the view that EU information material must come across to the public in their day-to-day lives and the environments in which they live, and they believe it necessary that the EU should cooperate across the board with institutions involved in school education at national level in fostering cultural, historical and political awareness.
