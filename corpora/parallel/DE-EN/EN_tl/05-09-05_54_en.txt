Mr President, Commissioner, I am myself from the Vorarlberg, one of the places affected, but am every bit as deeply affected by what is going on in Portugal and in the Southern States of the USA.
A committed European ought, after all, to look much further afield and go beyond what Members have already – and rightly – said.
We ought, actually, to be looking as far ahead as 2050.
Climate change is happening now.
That is not just what Klaus Töpfer, the head of the UN Environment Programme, says; it is also a matter of scientific observation.
Is it not high time for a master plan to be drawn up with all speed – one rather like the one that NASA drew up to address the anticipated climate change as long ago as the 1980s – which would list what we can expect to have to cope with in great detail and without taboos, not even the taboo against the evacuation of certain currently inhabited areas?
Here in Europe, we will not be able to afford to rebuild – every year or every three years – the places we are still protecting.
It is high time that we really did look further ahead.
