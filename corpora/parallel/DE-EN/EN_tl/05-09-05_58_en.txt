Mr President, although we have already, today, expressed our solidarity with the victims of this environmental disaster, it is at least as important that we should continue to make solidarity with the persons affected within the European Union our concern even after the television cameras have been switched off.
When people are starting again from scratch for the third time in six years, as some are having to do in my part of the world, it is not surprising that there is a lot of despair in evidence.
I believe that our definition of the Solidarity Fund is too narrow if it is not possible for Europe to intervene financially to deal with this, despite losses of the kind seen in the region from which I come, where one third of the provincial budget has – in the truest sense of the word – been washed away.
Apart from reformulating the criteria for the Solidarity Fund, what can the EU do?
Above all, I think, it can remind the Member States of their own responsibilities.
As has already been said, climate change is already happening here.
It has to be reiterated that Austria – and this I say as an Austrian – still has much to do when it comes to achieving the Kyoto target.
You, Commissioner, cannot simply stand by and say that you will see to it that there are as many aircraft as possible in place in the event of a fire; we have to take action before things get that far.
In working across borders too – as we have seen from the floods, when different Member States were affected by the same adverse weather conditions – in the INTERREG programmes, and in research projects, priority needs to be given to cross-border measures and prevention.
We have discussions on this subject to look forward to, and I see it as an area in which a rethink is called for.
It is now open to us, in the next research framework programme and in the trans-European networks, to take appropriate medium-term action in this area.
