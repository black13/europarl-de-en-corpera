Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking all those who, in highly sacrificial ways, gave help in the various disasters that are the regrettable topic of today’s debate, getting stuck in and helping, as quickly as possible, to limit the damage by giving speedy aid wherever it was needed.
With many speakers, I can do no other than agree.
We must of course prepare ourselves for the disasters that seem to come our way with ever-increasing frequency.
I want to make it very clear, Commissioner Dimas, that the programmes that the Commission put forward resulted in preventive measures being taken.
I can tell you that that was the case in my own home region, upon which the flooding has now had an appalling impact, and where the various measures we took to deal with flooding resulted in markedly less damage being done than in the past, even though the quantity of water was greater than when the area was last flooded.
What that means is that aid is having an effect and is also being used to prepare preventive infrastructures.
It is of course very regrettable that, in my electoral district and elsewhere, the flood occurred while these were being built, with the consequence that a number of things that were under construction were also destroyed and the floodwater took another course than it would have done had the infrastructure been completed.
I would like to appeal to the Commission to make extensive use of the Solidarity Fund.
Funds for this purpose are still available for 2005.
I hope that the Member States affected will soon be in a position to give Brussels a report on what the damage amounts to and enable the Commission to make funds promptly available for the speedy rebuilding of public facilities – for that is the major problem where I come from – and to help build up protective infrastructure.
That will be the right response and will put us on the right track.
