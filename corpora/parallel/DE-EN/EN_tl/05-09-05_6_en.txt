Mr President, last Thursday, in the Conference of Presidents, we had the opportunity to discuss this issue.
I know that we in the Socialist Group, like most of the other groups in this House as well, do not think it appropriate to hold this vote this week.
One reason for this is the ongoing discussion in the General Affairs Council, with particular reference to the outstanding issues in relation to Cyprus, which – along with a number of others – indicates that we should debate the whole package – that is to say, the adoption of the association agreement and all the other associated issues to do with our policy on Turkey – at the second part-session in September, along with the Commission’s negotiating mandate for 3 October.
We therefore take the view that Mrs Frassoni’s motion should be rejected.
