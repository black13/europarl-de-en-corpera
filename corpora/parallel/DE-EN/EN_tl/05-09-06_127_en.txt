Mr President, I rise to say something about the Saïfi report.
In principle, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on it, as it is, in substance, a very good report, but there are certain concerns that need to be mentioned.
It could be said that the report has already been overtaken by events in the shape of the problems – with which we are all familiar – currently arising with regard to imported textiles from China.
I do, however, think it important that what we have been demanding to date should again be set down in a report such as this one.
There is a need for further action to address the problem that has arisen in this respect.
I take the view that Europe has a great opportunity to make its consumers the most emancipated in the world.
It would, after all, be very interesting to demand, at any rate for the future, the creation of a standard ‘made in Europe’ label, to which stringent criteria would apply, as a means of ensuring that what our consumers buy has been manufactured under the proper conditions, without causing massive damage to the environment and without the use of such things as child labour.
The creation of such a label might also enable European policy to find another way of responding to these challenges.
