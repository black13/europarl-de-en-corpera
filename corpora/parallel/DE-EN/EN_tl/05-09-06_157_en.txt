Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Development, I have to say that I regard the budget with which the Council has presented us as unsatisfactory.
I say that with particular reference to the EUR 150 million cut – for that is what I call it – in payments.
Over recent years, we have endeavoured, by introducing the N+2 rules, to tie expenditure very closely to commitments and to ensure that the money is actually spent.
We are, basically, being penalised for our efforts by seeing how there is EUR 150 million less available for payments.
We are, though, also punishing ourselves, the European Union as a whole, for, at some point in time, we will be called on to stand by the commitments we have made.
We have always, as a matter of policy, kept the gap between payments and commitments from getting too large.
In the preliminary draft budget, the Commission really has made only the absolute minimum necessary available in terms of funding for structural policy.
We want to get them restored, and I urge the Council to follow our lead in this.
