Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission presented its preliminary draft budget in June, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was less than enthusiastic about it.
As we see it, the funds provided are simply not adequate to facilitate the proper implementation of European environmental and health policy and our policy on the safety of food.
We now have 25 Member States, yet there is to be only less than a 1% increase for environmental matters, and, in public health, no increase whatever beyond the 2005 level.
That alone is ridiculous enough in the eyes of some Members, but now the Council has excelled itself by cutting the estimates, which were low enough in any case.
In their speeches on television and in public, all the members of the Council talk endlessly about their desire to build a citizens’ Europe.
Here in this plenary, we have just heard that there is to be another rise in people’s standard of living in Europe, even though the funding for such a policy is being withheld.
Now that really is what I call confidence-building!
