Madam President, if Europe wants to be accepted by its citizens, we have to be perceived to be working for them.
This is most evident in Category III, and it is there that the Council has made the most swingeing cuts.
If we want to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-led and dynamic region in the world, we have to put aside more money in the budget for this.
Mr Böge’s report serves to show Parliament the way to go about this, with investment in education, research and youth, and consistent application of gender budgeting – from which, however, we are light-years away!
Plans, the Lisbon Strategy, the Youth Pact, ambitious action programmes in research, culture and the media – all these things you adopt and then slash the funding needed for their implementation.
If we want people to approve of our policies, we have to act in accordance with them.
I am grateful to Mr Pittella for laying bare the contradiction in what the Council is doing, and I call on the Commission to join this House in taking an approach that will equip us with a good budget that will come across clearly to the public.
