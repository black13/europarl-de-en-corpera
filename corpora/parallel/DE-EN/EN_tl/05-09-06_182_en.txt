Madam President, the laying down of a sustainable common fisheries policy will do nothing to make our tasks in this area less daunting.
Let me give just a few examples to illustrate why it is so extraordinarily difficult to enforce the Community’s requirements without the funding to do so: the restructuring of the fisheries sector in the new Member States, improved controls in fisheries, international fisheries agreements such as the forthcoming one with Morocco, fisheries research to provide better data on the basis of which to manage stocks.
It is for this reason that we endorse the Commission’s preliminary draft budget and reject the Council’s.
