Madam President, Commissioner, I want to ask what is actually being done about the disinformation being disseminated about Europe and the European institutions.
Is this disinformation being put about by European citizens, or does it originate from outside Europe?
Above all else, who is paying for it?
Would the best response to it not be to train journalists to counter it?
Let us then endeavour, every year, to get a hundred young journalists to come to Brussels, with the best among them to receive an internationally recognised award.
I see it as a matter of absolute priority that Europe be communicated, and we MEPs in particular, being a House of over 700 specialists, are ready and willing to do it.
