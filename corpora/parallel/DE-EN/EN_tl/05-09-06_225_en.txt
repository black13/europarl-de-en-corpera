Is it not the case, Commissioner, that both Parliament and the Commission are going about their information work in the wrong way by often concentrating on four-colour printed matter that nobody reads and which just lies around in information offices?
It is clear that misunderstandings about Europe arise when national governments say what suits them rather than giving the full facts.
There has been debate in Germany about our being the paymaster of Europe.
Different arguments are going on in other countries.
Would it not be helpful if, even on the same day on which a falsehood or half-truth is put into circulation in any one country, an association or a member of the government or a Commissioner were to speak out and give the national press the real facts of the matter?
It would cost nothing and would engender in the national capitals a certain fear of giving voice to falsehoods or half-truths.
Communication with the press is the name of the game, and, so far, nothing has been done in this area, perhaps because the Commission does not have the nerve to speak out against certain national governments.
