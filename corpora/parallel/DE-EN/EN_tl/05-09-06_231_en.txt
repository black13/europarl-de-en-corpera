Madam President, this is a point on which I would like to express my agreement with the Commissioner.
Of the 13 countries that have ratified, two have done so by means of referenda.
Those votes are of no less value than those of the countries that have withheld ratification.
The European Parliament is legitimated by reason of being directly and democratically elected.
The Commission derives its legitimacy from the European Parliament and from the governments elected by the national parliaments, and this entitles it to argue politically the case for objectives held by a majority of its own number.
I therefore want to ask you again whether it does not make sense for it to get involved in day-to-day political debate.
If, for example, a manifestly false assertion is made in a given country, should a contrary position or correction on the part of the Commission not be communicated on the same day via national press conferences or by other means, so that such views cannot take root?
