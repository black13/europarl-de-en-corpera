Madam President, the delegation for relations with the United States visited America a few weeks ago.
The question now arises of whether it might be possible to draw up a common catalogue of persons who present a risk to security.
I believe it to be important that there should be a transparent catalogue of criteria on both sides of the Atlantic.
Does the Commission already have any ideas about this?
