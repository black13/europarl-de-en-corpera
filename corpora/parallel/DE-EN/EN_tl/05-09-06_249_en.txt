Madam President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for that outstanding and welcome answer.
Can I just ask a supplementary question?
I would like to know the present state of thinking about the idea that the Police College should be made even more of an institution, particularly by being made subject to Community control and being funded from the Community budget.
What is the position on this issue?
As regards the external borders, I would like to ask whether thought is already being given to the possibility of joint units on them, or whether this is not yet being done at present.
