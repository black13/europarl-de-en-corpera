I am much obliged to the Commissioner for the detailed written reply to the question which has now been provided.
As the Commissioner has just said, the German visa decree of 26 October 2004 warrants further clarification, especially on the subjects of false statements by visa applicants and false documents.
Since the Commissioner has also stated very clearly that there is no scope for national provisions in the Common Consular Instructions on Visas, I should like to know whether the 2006 revised version will put an end to this once and for all.
