– I am very much obliged to the Commissioner for his clear statements on the ‘Volmer decree’, which simply was not in conformity with the law.
I should like to emphasise once more that this is not a matter for Germany alone, because many people entered the EU on a German visa and then moved on to other Member States.
Therefore, I wish to ask the minister to reiterate his assessment of the magnitude of this ‘incident’ and the extent of its adverse effect on Europe.
