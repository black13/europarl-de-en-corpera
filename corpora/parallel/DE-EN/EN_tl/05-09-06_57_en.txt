Mr President, the television directive is indeed one that gives the public a direct experience of the benefits of Europe and the European Union.
Protection of young people, protection of consumers’ interests, cultural diversity, European content and European productions – all these things are of value and the ‘television without frontiers’ directive guarantees them to viewers in all the European Union’s Member States.
I am very grateful to Mr Weber for highlighting the success of this and demanding those things that we need if it is to be continued.
As we are all aware, people not only have a television at home, but are also, and increasingly, able to receive programmes over the Internet or via their computers and mobile phones.
It is not acceptable that the same transmissions should be subject to different regulations depending on where they are broadcast from, and so it is indeed the case that this directive urgently needs to be revised.
In a couple of weeks’ time, the Commission and the British Presidency will be holding a major conference on this subject in Liverpool.
I strongly urge not only the Commission and the Member States, but also businesses and broadcasters, to be ready and willing to really carry forward this directive.
In particular, I urge, firstly, that the digital divide be reduced, for we need access to all media.
Secondly, the television directive’s objectives – ensuring cultural diversity, the dual system, protection of young people and consumers – need to be guaranteed appropriately in the new media.
It is for that reason that this report enjoys broad support from this House.
