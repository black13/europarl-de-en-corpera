Mr President, scarcely any other sector of the economy is as complex as tourism.
I now want to concentrate on just one aspect of it, namely sustainability – to which the title of this report refers – and particularly to the dependence of successful and long-term foreign tourism on sustainable transport.
No other sector of the economy is as dependent on the environment as tourism.
Beautiful landscapes, well-kept villages, clean air, peace and quiet, good and healthy food, among other things, are the tourist industry’s real capital.
Tourism and transport are closely connected, but, in many tourist areas, the means of transport are so inappropriate that we are slowly but surely wrecking the foundation of a sustainable economy.
For example, the perversity of the way in which mass tourism has developed is apparent in many places from the gridlock that occurs on Saturdays in high season as tourists all arrive and depart at the same time.
This report endorses the idea of further development of air travel, which is the worst form of transport from the point of view of energy consumption and damage to the climate.
The second worst is the use of private motor vehicles.
Railways, once much-loved, which played a substantial part in the first flourishing of tourism in the Alps some 100 years ago, are now generally forgotten, neglected and put at a disadvantage.
If you are a tourist and want to go on holiday using public transport, it is an unfortunate fact that you will often find that, in many of the regions you want to visit, it is quite impossible to be properly mobile without a motor car.
The main causes of this are the inadequacy of the public local transport on offer and the failure of many railway operators to make sufficient information and booking facilities available.
If we really do want to promote sustainable tourism the length and breadth of Europe, we should give far greater prominence to these ecological considerations.
