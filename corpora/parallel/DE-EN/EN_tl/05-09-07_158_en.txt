Mr President, the touristic landscape has undergone massive change over recent years, and Europe has been no exception.
Competitors have bargains to offer, traditional holiday periods and habits are changing, and, not least, new trends are becoming evident.
It follows that our own countries, far from being able to rest upon the laurels they won in the past, must go down roads that are new and innovative for Europe.
Tourism is still, in many places, highly dependent on the general climate and day-to-day weather conditions.
Although many sectors will therefore have suffered from the present continual rain, it may well be that the wellness sector, spas, and urban tourism have benefited from the bad weather.
If Europe is to remain attractive as a holiday destination, there is a need for both high-quality products such as the wellness sector can generally offer, and also more alternatives for the periods of bad weather that are occurring more frequently.
Developing such new schemes as conservation holidays in areas of outstanding natural beauty, all-in deals for cyclists or cultural tourists would certainly be worthwhile.
What matters overall, though, where tourism is concerned, is that it should make good use of Europeâ€™s natural landscapes and their cultural identity while at the same time protecting them.
