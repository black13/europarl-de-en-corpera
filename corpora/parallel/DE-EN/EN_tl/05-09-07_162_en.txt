Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Queiró for including the ‘Iron Curtain Trail’ in his report.
The Iron Curtain divided Europe for decades, and the trail will remind future generations of how this continent was divided and of how that division was brought to an end.
The project already involves twelve EU Member States.
The German Parliament has already voted unanimously in favour of preserving the border that ran along 1 400 km through Germany and of opening it up to environmentally-friendly tourism.
This stretch of green runs from the Arctic in the north to the Black Sea in the south, numbers Mikhail Gorbachev among its patrons, and is a suitable means of promoting a European sense of identity.
I rejoice at the widespread support for it in this House and hope that the Member States will now waste no time in joining with the Commission to complete it.
It will be, in the truest sense of the word, an experience of European history, politics and culture.
