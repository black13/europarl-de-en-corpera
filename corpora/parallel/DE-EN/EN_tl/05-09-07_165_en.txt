Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague and friend Mr Leichtfried has unexpectedly had to go back to Austria, I will take this opportunity of airing a number of his ideas in this Chamber.
It is heartening that this excellent report shows the European Union concerning itself with the issue of tourism and stressing its enormous importance in terms of growth and employment.
Europe is the most important tourist destination in the world.
The tourist sector in Europe can take the credit for creating over 7 million jobs and is among the sectors offering the greatest potential for the creation of new jobs in the future.
The tourist industry is one sector of the economy in which services are generally rendered directly by workers themselves, and this makes it less entrepreneurial in character.
It is for precisely this reason that it is necessary to focus more on the promotion of training for workers in this sector, while also paying attention to the conditions under which services are provided.
It is now the case that there are regions in Europe where workers are recruited from far away because local people no longer feel themselves able to provide these services under the conditions offered to them.
Here, too, there is a task for the European Union.
As Mr Leichtfried himself has repeatedly said, it is encouraging that the issue of coordination in matters of holiday arrangements and of European monitoring of it has been taken up in this report.
National and regional holidays need to be properly coordinated by the European Union.
We know what that would mean in terms of the strain placed on our infrastructure and in terms of the services that could be offered.
The rapporteur did very well to incorporate this idea, which merits our wholehearted support.
