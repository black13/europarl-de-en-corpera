– Mr President, sustainability concerns every one of us.
It is of course not only an ecological, but also an economic matter.
We must seek to enable enterprises to survive, and taxation is only one aspect of this; it is also important that enterprises be enabled to invest for the future, so as to create a sustainable supply of investment that is also reflected in global competitiveness.
For this reason, I welcome the initiative in the Committee on Budgets by Mr Mulder – a specialist in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises – together with the European Investment Fund, aimed in particular at the provision, in future, of equity loans and other guarantees, the intention being to make sure that the risk and investment capital in tourism enterprises is secure in the long term, too, with a view to their sustainability.
The fact is that negative equity is one of the main problems facing the tourism sector; a great many enterprises are going bankrupt, with the loss of large numbers of jobs.
The debate on Basel II is imminent, and that debate, in particular, is a matter of life and death for tourism.
After all, liquidity is a matter of life and death for every enterprise.
I would therefore urge the Commissioner to keep up his commitment, particularly as regards the relevant programme for small and medium-sized enterprises.
He has already done an exemplary job in this regard and, if we keep up the good work, we can succeed in doing what is best for tourism.
