â€“ I agree with Mr Newton Dunn.
I, too, am disappointed with the non-answer the President-in-Office has just given us.
The British Presidency is very well aware of the difficulty of combating organised crime.
That is why we are anxiously waiting to see something done about it once and for all: after all, crime has become globalised, and so that is what the fight against international terrorism and international crime needs to be too.
