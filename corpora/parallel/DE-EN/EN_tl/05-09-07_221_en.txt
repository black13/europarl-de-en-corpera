– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I, too, would like to ask a question about this.
Over the last year, we have all seen serious abuses of human rights – and of women’s rights, in particular – continuing to occur in Turkey.
That is why I insist that the President-in-Office answer the question as to whether the Presidency is prepared, in future, to discuss not only full membership, but also a different form of accession or association: a privileged partnership, for example.
