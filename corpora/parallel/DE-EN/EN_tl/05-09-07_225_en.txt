â€“ Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I did not ask you what happened in May or June; I know that already.
I asked you what the Council Presidency was planning for the coming weeks.
Specifically, will there be another General Council before 3 October to deal with the commencement of accession negotiations with Croatia?
Secondly, how does the Council propose to keep the democratically-elected European Parliament informed about the work of the task force?
Is this task force actually working at all, or is it only being used to block the accession negotiations?
