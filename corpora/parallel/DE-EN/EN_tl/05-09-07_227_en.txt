– When comparing the conditions for Turkey’s accession with those imposed on Croatia, do you not see any difference in the treatment of these two States?
It is totally unfair to impose an individual condition on Croatia and thereby postpone the negotiations.
In the light of the kind of problems currently being experienced with Turkey as regards its human rights situation and its past, what is being demanded here is a monstrous injustice.
I really would ask you to keep to the rules of the European Union and apply the same standard to both of them.
