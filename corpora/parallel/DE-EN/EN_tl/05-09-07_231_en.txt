– Mr President, in this House’s Rules of Procedure, Rule 166(2) states that ‘a request to raise a point of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak’.
My request to speak is therefore perfectly justified.
I should like to make a request to speak regarding Rule 109 ‘Question Time’, paragraph 4 of which makes reference to Annex II.
Point 4 under ‘Supplementary questions’ in Annex II reads as follows: ‘Each Member may follow up the reply with a supplementary question to any question.
He may put in all two supplementary questions.’
I have the Italian version, too, which says the same.
If the official who has been constantly gesturing to me that I am not entitled to put a second supplementary question has this point checked by the competent authorities, he will find that I am indeed entitled to do so under the current Rules of Procedure, subject to your consent pursuant to point 6(a) of Annex II.
