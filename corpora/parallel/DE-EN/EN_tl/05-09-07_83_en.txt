Mr President, I should like to say something about the Őry Report, starting by saying that I utterly fail to comprehend how a monstrous piece of legislation such as this can spend twelve years being tinkered with in the Commission, the end result being the insight that a piece of legislation on optical radiation is, as it relates to the rays of the sun, perhaps not exactly what the European man and woman in the street expect of Europe.
We, in Europe, should pay less attention to things like sunlight, which many people – who also know how to protect themselves against it in their leisure time – regard as perfectly normal, and concern ourselves instead with the things that people really do expect Europe to do something about.
By that I mean, not solar radiation, but the problems of the world such as the war in Iraq and the increasing problem of terrorism – quite different issues, indeed, and I can do no other than ask not only the Members of this House, but also the Commission, to learn from what has happened, which this vote has prevented from doing too much damage, and to concentrate their attention in future on matters that are of relevance to Europe and cause the members of the public to feel that we concern ourselves with the things that concern them.
