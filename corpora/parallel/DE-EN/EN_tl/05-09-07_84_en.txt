Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to make a statement in relation to Mr Őry’s report, which I voted against, since I find it almost ridiculous that we want to regulate every detail of the public’s lives from the European level downwards.
I see the treatment of Europe’s citizens as children in every area of their lives as a profoundly Socialist approach.
I would rather that, instead of adopting a directive, we had mounted an information campaign, pointing out to the public the hazards presented by artificial and natural radiation.
People must continue to take responsibility for whether or not they expose themselves to natural radiation.
I regard it as positively cynical to waste this House’s valuable time on a debate on a sunshine directive, while leaving unnumbered thousands of people, many of them children, to die of hunger and thirst under the African sun.
It is to that that we need to find answers.
