The right-wingers’ rejection of the directive to protect workers from optical radiation testifies to a high degree of cheap opportunism on their part and represents a stab in the back for those affected by it.
Serious consideration of the dramatic increase in the incidence of skin cancers among workers – over 90 000 cases according to German trade associations and a figure that has increased tenfold since the 1970s – cannot but result in action!
To radiation, national borders present no obstacles.
That is why I vote for European regulation to protect workers and against the Christian Democrat motion for the rejection of the Common Position.
I cast my vote in favour of a European solution that lays down the maximum level of protection for workers who are exposed to optical radiation.
Dramatic changes in climate make it necessary that more attention be given even to natural radiation.
The rapid rise in the incidence of skin cancer in Australia should be a warning to us in Europe.
