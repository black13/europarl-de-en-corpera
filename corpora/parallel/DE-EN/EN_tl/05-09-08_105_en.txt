Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Rübig said, people want to live longer and healthily.
The people in the developing countries, who are the subject of this debate, want to be allowed to live, and to live in a manner worthy of human beings.
As one might put it: ‘poor, sick, unemployed, hopeless’ – in these countries the one state often leads to the other.
I regard this report as an eye-opener; it raises awareness, cries out and brings us face to face with diseases that we cannot even pronounce properly even if we have any idea how many millions of people suffer from them.
No sooner did avian flu pop up than we in Europe declared ourselves prepared for it.
Have we, in Europe, made preparations against infection with these diseases?
We have not.
Are we prepared and willing to help people fight these diseases in their own countries?
Not to any adequate extent.
I want, then, to put forward three proposals.
Here comes the first; under the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council, we resolved to raise Europe’s development aid payments to 0.7%.
We must, I think, as a matter of urgency, join together with the Member States in planning how much of that can be spent on combating disease and on the health sector, with due regard for poverty, work and health.
Secondly, we should increase the funding for research into them in Europe.
Thirdly, I ask that all organisations, such as the one I chair, that receive EU funds in connection with development policy, should be invited to a conference at which we could consider how, together, we might be more effectively active in these fields in the developing countries.
