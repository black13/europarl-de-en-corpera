Mr President, I would like to follow on from Mr Tannock’s conclusion.
When President Bashir Assad succeeded his father in office, he was the focus of a great deal of hope.
Syrian Christians who know him well tell me that he, as a member of the Alawi minority himself, has a very tolerant attitude towards other faith communities, not least the Christians.
It is all the more disappointing that the Baath regime’s brutal machinery of oppression is still operational, with the secret services at work in Lebanon, and the police in Syria itself.
I would like to emphasise that, as we have ties with Syria through the Mediterranean dialogue and the Mediterranean community, we have to apply particularly rigorous standards to it.
While we ought to support it in its desire to draw closer to the European Union, we cannot do so unless it upholds fundamental human rights and moves towards pluralism and democracy.
That such a thing can happen only step by step is obvious, but the process must be begun without delay, and we must send a clear message to that effect.
