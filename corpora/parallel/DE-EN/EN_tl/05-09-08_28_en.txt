Mr President, this report by Mr Cornillet contains a plethora of valuable suggestions and justified demands.
Most of the recitals are illuminating and critically enumerate a large number of problems, including child labour, the sexual exploitation of children and speculation in property.
The Verts/ALE Group is glad to see this subject being discussed in this House at all and consideration being given to such aspects as the investment of profits from tourism in the developing country in question, the avoidance of mass tourism, the promotion of human rights and the maintenance of bio-diversity.
We find it regrettable – and it is on this point that I largely agree with Mrs McAvan – that this document shows Europeans largely adopting an arrogant attitude towards third countries and regarding themselves as the measure of all things.
We believe that the report attaches far too little weight, in this area, to the protection of the environment and to the need for a truly sustainable economy.
Discussion of the ecological and social consequences of mass tourism, such as water pollution, the alienation of the local population, or exploitation on the part of multinational hotel chains is absent or too diffuse.
As a first attempt, this report is important, but there are many things that it considers only half-heartedly or too vaguely.
We hope that the Commission will go into the matters it has highlighted in greater depth, and that greater emphasis will be placed on international solidarity as a means of promoting peace.
