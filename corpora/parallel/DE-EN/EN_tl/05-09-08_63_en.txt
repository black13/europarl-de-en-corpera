It is a good thing that the European Parliament has at last realised the need for something to be done about natural disasters.
As a matter of urgency, and not least in view of the large-scale fires in southern Europe and the major flooding in central Europe, the EU needs to develop its existing public-sector capacities.
The wholesale failure of the US Administration in the face of the disastrous floods in New Orleans is another reason why it is time to put a stop to the neoliberal compulsion to cut costs and break up institutions one by one that save lives.
We must prevent the merger of civilian and military structures advocated by such spokespersons on EU military policy as Javier Solana, the EU’s representative for foreign and security policy, and the Green MEP Angelika Beer, for this would result not only in the militarisation of civilian structures, but would also expose civilian aid workers to the very considerable risk of being regarded as part of the armed forces and thus – as has happened in Afghanistan – as another party to the conflict.
In order to make more funding available for disaster aid, such EU projects as the Galileo satellite guidance system, which is also capable of being – and is intended to be – used for military purposes, should be stopped.
Not only does Galileo subsidise the aerospace and armaments firm EADS, but the system is also being introduced too late in the day to be a success.
Galileo is also intended to play a crucial role in future European security and defence policy, which is to be oriented towards armed intervention.
