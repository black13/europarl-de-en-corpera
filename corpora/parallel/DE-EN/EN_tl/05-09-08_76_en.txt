The fact that members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have rejected paragraph 10 of the Svensson report or abstained from voting has to do with differing interpretations of the UN Resolution to which it refers and to the unfortunate fact that it was not possible, in the course of preparatory deliberations, to deal with the differences between versions of the report in different languages.
In my capacity as the PSE Group’s shadow rapporteur, and in order to prevent misunderstandings, I would therefore like to make this clarificatory statement:
It goes without saying that, if any person in my group rejects paragraph 10 or abstains from voting on it, it does not mean that he or she is in favour of human cloning.
We unreservedly endorse UN Resolution A/59/516/Add 1 (‘Declaration on Human Cloning’), which states that practices contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning, must not be permitted.
As we do not want to tolerate such things under any circumstances, it is more specifically demanded in the German version that ‘human cloning shall be excluded from support and funding under European Union programmes’.
This demand is made explicitly in the future tense, as the intention is that such practices should never be permissible in the EU and that it should of course never be possible to fund them surreptitiously.
It is regrettable that versions in many languages – English, French and Swedish among them – give the impression that we are today allowing EU programmes to promote the cloning of humans.
That is self-evidently not the case, and for that reason, we have not agreed to paragraph 10 of the report.
