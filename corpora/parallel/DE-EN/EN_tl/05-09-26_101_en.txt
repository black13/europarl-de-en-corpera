Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of this matterâ€™s relevance to the competitiveness of European industry, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has devoted a great deal of attention to it.
It is important particularly to those companies quoted on stock exchanges that ownership rights should be given the highest priority when the auditors are appointed.
It is here, in particular, that national sensitivities come into play.
There is also, of course, the question of costs to be considered.
These can be enormous, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses that seek a stock exchange quotation, take the necessary steps and endeavour to be as transparent as they are required to be, and so I urge that limited liability be discussed with the insurers, so that the auditors can act with the necessary responsibility.
