The Kreissl-Dörfler Report, which this House has today adopted by a narrow majority, reflects the EU’s asylum and immigration policy in all its wretchedness.
By way of a response to the Council’s proposal for a directive, which was characterised by nothing more than the desire to keep refugees out, the report enshrines in law a number of glaring deficiencies.
It incorporates the concept of the ‘safe country of origin’, so that asylum seekers are denied the right to have their applications examined in the first place.
As regards the treatment of asylum seekers and ‘illegals’, the text makes no distinction between them, not even in relation to their being dumped in ‘deportation centres’.
It gives legal standing to the concept of ‘safe third countries’, along with the criteria for them and a list of them, with the consequence that such things as the deportation of refugees from one country after another cannot be prevented.
I shall be abstaining from voting on it, for, even though the report does institutionalise the denial of rights to refugees, it does at least include a number of improvements to their lot over against the Council document.
The EU’s political dilemma has not gone away.
Its ‘Fortress Europe’ policy puts the lives of more and more people at risk, while also depriving people of their rights.
An EU asylum policy that treated people as having dignity would be rather different.
