Mr President, I have something to add to today’s Minutes, that being the fact that the written statement on rheumatic diseases has, today, already surpassed the two-thirds majority.
Three hundred and sixty-seven signatures had already been collected, and the figure reached 378 by noon today.
This written statement, of which I am the joint originator, calls on the Commission and the Council to include rheumatic diseases among the priorities for the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
I ask that this sensational achievement be recorded in today’s minutes.
