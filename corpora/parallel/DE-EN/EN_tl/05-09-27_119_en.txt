Mr President, Commissioner, although I propose to devote my remarks primarily to Mr Guellec’s report, Mr Marques can take note of the fact that I regard ‘territorial cohesion’ as applying also to the outermost regions.
I am much obliged to Mr Guellec for what is a really good report, and I believe that its being an own-initiative report makes it a good means whereby we in this Committee of the European Parliament can develop our own approach.
Good teamwork has made it possible to produce this balanced but forward-looking report.
If we all agree that we want – and let me say, Commissioner, that I hope you will succeed in your efforts to get the Member States to join in this – to communicate Europe to people where they are and in their day-to-day lives, then territorial, along with social and economic, cohesion is of enormous importance.
It will help to secure the acceptance of the principle that all EU citizens should be valued equally and treated fairly irrespective of the region in which they live; it will also help to get this incorporated in all our important documents, for example those relating to the Structural and Cohesion Funds, but also in the implementation of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies.
We do well to make partnership a primary principle – partnership between cities, their and rural areas, but also partnership between all political levels.
As I see it, the coherent, harmonious development of all the EU countries, the regions and the cities, largely depends on this, and I want to express my strong support for the idea that a region’s state of development should be assessed by reference to more than just its GDP; other territorial indicators – educational, scientific, cultural and sporting provision, for example, as well as the incidence of unemployment or the state of the infrastructure – need to be included, for viewing the region as a whole gives a much clearer picture of what it is like.
That is a significant step towards fairer assessment, and will eventually enable the people who live there to have a better understanding of Europe and of the regulations that we enact, and I get the impression that there is still a desperate need for far better communication between us and the citizens of Europe.
