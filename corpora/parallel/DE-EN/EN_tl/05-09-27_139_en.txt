Mr President, that the outermost regions need our support is self-evident.
The Marques report offers many good proposals for strengthening the infrastructure of, for example, isolated islands or mountainous regions.
Structural policy of this sort is yet another expression of European solidarity and equality of opportunity.
What I particularly like about this report is the balance that it has acquired now that the unreasonable demands are gone from it.
What makes the rapporteur’s concept credible is that it takes Parliament’s existing structural policy conception as its foundation.
Its consistency and the reasonable demands for the coming period notwithstanding, I do see danger ahead in the likelihood that, in future, far less money will be available for structural policy, and this leads me to believe that structural policy on the present models will, in a few years’ time, be obsolete, and we will need to look for new ideas as to how, with less money, to carry on supporting Europe’s regions – whether that means a policy of subsidised loans, of guarantees, or one with a greater emphasis on key infrastructures and core projects.
In future, we will have to give more attention to the question of how and where subsidised investment actually does attract more investment, and whether our use of investment subsidies in isolated areas might not in fact result in an ever-increasing need for support.
Our eventual goal must be a policy with an overall greater emphasis on Europe’s ability to compete.
Much as I welcome the Marques Report as a first step towards a realistic outlook, we need to move even further away from indiscriminate ongoing subsidies and towards economic growth that maintains its own momentum.
If we are to do that, the EU needs more encouragement to move in that direction, not least from those who make regional policy.
