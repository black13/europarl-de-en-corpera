Mr President, Commissioner, before the starter, there is often an .
Although this particular little culinary offering, having been brought to us courtesy of the media, was not to our taste, we still find a juicy preferable to a dry piece of paper.
As for what you have served up to us today, we will have to look at the details.
The philosophy you have described is, I think, one of which we can all approve.
We are concerned not only that there should be no erosion of social and economic standards, but also that bureaucracy should be kept to a minimum, that regulations should be as simple as possible and be readable â€“ not, perhaps, so much by the general public as by the experts, which these days they are not.
We will also be discussing this with representatives of the national parliaments.
I have just heard that there is to be a meeting of COSAC at the beginning of October, and this will certainly be on the agenda for that.
I do have a specific question for you, Commissioner, and it is this: are you willing to make available to this House all the documentation on the basis of which you have drawn up this list, so that we may gain an insight into your motivation and your reasoning, and may then consider them when we give our own opinion?
