Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise for having to go to the next meeting straightaway, but there are two things I would like to mention that I believe are important where better lawmaking is concerned.
I do not intend to discuss what should be done about the involvement of the press.
This is the first step in the right direction; it is courageous and it is the right thing to do.
We must give it our backing and encourage the Commission to move on to the ‘main course’, for that we regard as crucial.
I have two suggestions to make.
The first has to do with the small business sector, to which the Commissioner referred.
Where better lawmaking is concerned, I can only hope that representatives of the small and medium-sized business sector will be included among the external groups of experts whose advice is to be sought.
The fact is that industry can certainly cope with and accept certain aspects of regulation, but local small businesses and local craftsmen may well not be able to, and will go bust.
So I ask, I appeal, as a matter of urgency, that these external groups give small and medium-sized enterprises the representation they deserve.
The second point I want to make is that complaints from the national level about over-regulation are a regular occurrence, and it often turns out that, rather than the over-regulation originating from Europe, its cause is in fact to be found in the complicated way in which the Member States transpose it.
What is needed is the boldness to highlight the perverse ways in which European rules are sometimes applied and bring in a benchmark to indicate who is acting in such a way as to benefit the public and who is doing it in such a way as to inconvenience them.
