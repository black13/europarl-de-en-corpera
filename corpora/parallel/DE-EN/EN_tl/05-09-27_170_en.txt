Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen can take it from me that bureaucracy is, of course a slogan guaranteed to get you applause, but a look at his list reveals that it conceals the real object of the exercise, which is the demolition of the welfare state.
If it is indeed the case that the Temporary Workers Directive is to be withdrawn, then that is a slap in the face for social Europe, then we will see ‘the working poor’ in Europe, for that means that this aspect will be covered by the Bolkestein Directive, and that Europe’s minimum standards are being eroded.
What I want to know is this: how do you propose to build a social Europe by dismantling minimum social standards in Europe?
