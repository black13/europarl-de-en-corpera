Madam President, I will answer the first question by saying that we have initiated a public consultation, and you will of course be able to have access to what emerges from it.
I really must say that Mrs Schroedter is wrong in making what is in fact an insinuation.
The withdrawal of proposals that have not even yet been adopted cannot be said to dismantle anything.
It cannot do anything to change what is actually law.
I am talking here about proposals that the European Parliament has not even yet adopted, and the Commission will, in every single instance, be giving a precise explanation of why it is withdrawing them.
I made a point of adding that this does not mean that we will not be bringing these matters back to your House.
As regards temporary workers, we suggest that Parliament should not wind up its deliberations before the Commission has presented more comprehensive economic analyses and an extensive impact assessment.
The proposal has not been withdrawn, and I have no idea whence you have that information.
You must not believe everything you read in the newspapers; I would appreciate it if our deliberations were to relate only to what the Commission has officially communicated to you in its proposal.
What matters is not what the newspapers print, but what the Commission has decided this afternoon.
To Mr Maaten, I want to say I had no intention of making a ceremony of my statement; I mentioned the hour of the day only because I wanted to demonstrate to you that, as soon as the Commission had agreed on its resolution, the European Parliament – and nobody else – was informed about it.
