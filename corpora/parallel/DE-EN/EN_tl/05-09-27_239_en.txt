Commissioner, I do think that the Commission should also consider information from Parliament.
Karlsbad Wafers were produced and sold in Karlsbad and Marienbad.
They were invented at the Tepl monastery.
They were being produced and sold worldwide back in the 19th and 20th centuries, and nowadays the best Karlsbad Wafers in the world are produced in Dillingen an der Donau by a company called Wetzel.
Take a look at me; you can tell that I know a thing or two about food, and I can confirm that they are the best Karlsbad Wafers.
I would therefore implore you to examine whether it is really possible to narrow down geographically a designation that is so international and European in nature.
Our European culture would be poorer as a result.
