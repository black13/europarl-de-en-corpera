Madam President, the Commissioner herself has said that the application by the Czech Republic concerns ‘genuine Olmützer Quargel’.
In my opinion, this is accurate.
This would also make it clear – particularly as ‘Olmützer Quargel’ is produced in other Member States, too, of course – that this is simply a generic designation.
This would not pose any problems from the point of view of Austria or Germany, the countries in which these producers from the former Czechoslovakia have settled, as the relevant distinction would be rendered by the term ‘genuine’ Olmützer Quargel.
