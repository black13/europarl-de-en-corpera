Madam President, Commissioner, does it not more closely reflect reality to say that there are both large and small farms, which developed by tradition?
Is it not the case that these large farms are the same rural businesses that employ a very large workforce?
I should just like to point out that agriculture in my home Member State is structured on a small scale, yet, back in 1999, Austria was in favour of this modulation, this phasing-in schedule.
Unfortunately, it did not win through, however, as first Germany and then the United Kingdom opposed it.
