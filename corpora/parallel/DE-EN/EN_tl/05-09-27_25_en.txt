Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly thanking the rapporteur for his report, which I am sure we can support unreservedly.
Where human rights are concerned, it is important that the European Union should function as a role model for other states outside it, yet resolutions such as these all too readily jeopardise them.
How, in future, are we to compel other states to comply with international law on asylum if we no longer take it seriously within the European Union?
I find it a matter of concern that the President-in-Office of the Council, the British Home Secretary, Mr Clarke, at the meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Newcastle on 9 September, argued that the European Convention on Human Rights might need to be reinterpreted.
He would like to be able to deport preachers of hatred and terrorists – who are, admittedly, frightening presences on the contemporary scene – even if they face torture or the death penalty in their country of origin.
This I regard as no more and no less than a flagrant disregard of international asylum law.
It is quite clear to me, and to my group, that the ‘super-safe third countries’ rule is unacceptable.
Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has already referred to this, and I endorse his criticism of it.
It is obvious that the Council needs to make improvements here.
