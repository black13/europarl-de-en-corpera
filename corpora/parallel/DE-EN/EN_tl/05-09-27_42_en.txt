Ladies and gentlemen, although our esteemed visitors in the galleries are most welcome and ought of course to share in the liveliness of the debate, I would ask them to bear in mind that – following the practice of parliaments all over the world – we ask the listeners in the galleries not to applaud.
Only the Members may do that.
You may, however, nod energetically, provided this is not audible.
I thank the visitors in the galleries for their understanding and warmly welcome them.
