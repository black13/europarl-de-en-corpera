Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to explain what Mr Geremek has said.
The very simple reason behind it is that the Cypriot constitution includes a provision on the suspension of the immunity of members of the national parliament that is not to be found in the constitutions of other Member States.
In Cyprus, it is not the parliament that rules on suspension, but the Supreme Court.
As Mr Matsakis is a Member of the European Parliament, though, it is clear that, in accordance with the protocol on privileges and immunities, it is of course not the Supreme Court of Cyprus that is competent to rule on his suspension, but this plenary, that is to say, those who are assembled here today.
It was for this reason that the Committee on Legal Affairs, saving only one vote to the contrary, took the view that the proposal should be put to the House in its present form.
I ask you to endorse it.
