Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of a common European right of asylum – as resolved by the Tampere European Council in October 1999 – is very much to be welcomed, although the Council proposal, as amended, is so singularly inadequate that, if the directive were to be implemented unamended in the Member States, protection for refugees in Europe would be reduced to almost nothing.
One danger arising from the planned introduction of a minimum common list of what are termed ‘safe third countries’ is the major one that the Member States will return asylum-seekers to countries of origin that are regarded as ‘safe third countries’ without either the reasons for these individuals having become refugees being heard or their entitlement to asylum being examined.
It is for that reason that I, in the opinion I drafted on the report for the Committee on Development, attach particular importance to the European Parliament being fully involved in all future decisions affecting the common list.
The inclusion or deletion from a minimum common list of states that can be – or cannot be – regarded as safe third countries must not be a matter for the Council or the Commission alone.
This is demanded in the report on which we are to vote, as are improved protection for children and minors and the rules relating to the Member States’ obligation to inform refugees of their rights and obligations in a language that they understand.
The report includes a number of very important amendments aimed at ensuring that no Member State can deport asylum seekers or return them to areas where their life or freedom would be at risk by reason of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or their holding particular political views.
I ask my fellow-Members of this House to give the report their backing.
If we are to secure the protection of refugees in Europe, this report will make a great difference, as it will also to the position of the people concerned in the Member States.
