I very much welcome the result of the vote on the correction of Directive 2004/18/EC of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.
In order to adjust threshold values in the award of public works contracts, the correction of this clerical error was necessary.
I would however like to observe that there is still, in my view, a need for improvement in the substance of some of the Directiveâ€™s provisions, particularly in those relating to cooperation between municipalities and to the establishment of associations for a particular purpose by boroughs.
Mandatory tendering for such forms of cooperation is not practical, goes against the objectives of the directive and prevents boroughs from providing public-friendly services at a reasonable price.
I therefore regard it as urgently necessary that the directive be revised on the basis of practical experience at the beginning of 2006 in order to give attention to this matter.
I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already decided to consult interested parties about this.
