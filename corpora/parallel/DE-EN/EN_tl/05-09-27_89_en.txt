The practical usefulness of the proposal for the EU-wide storage of communications data is very much a matter of doubt.
The blanket monitoring of all telephone calls, -mails and text messages without any well-founded suspicion cannot be justified on the grounds that it might, under certain circumstances, with a little bit of luck, or at some unspecified point in time, perhaps, help with the investigation of a terrorist attack.
To do so would be to accumulate an unimaginable mass of data, which, if the worst came to the worst, hard-pressed investigators would have to work through with a fine-tooth comb.
What is lacking is a well thought-out definition of which items of information are actually of use for the purpose of efficient and successful cooperation, resulting in an excessively comprehensive list which leaves too much room for interpretation.
Nor has sufficient attention been given to how this would be implemented in practice.
It is small and medium-sized enterprises that will be particularly hard hit by this initiative, for they lack the organisation and funding to cope with such mandatory storage.
What is particularly questionable is why there is no explanation of how industry is to be reimbursed its costs – which are expected to run to several hundred million euros – by the individual Member States.
The draft is legally dubious, may well be contrary to various constitutions, and runs counter to the EU’s declared goal of becoming an area of freedom.
It is also objectionable when, for the sake of preventing young people from being radicalised, there is control and censorship of the electronic media, while, at the same time, people are assured, in all seriousness, that the freedom of the press and the media are not being compromised – that is reminiscent of George Orwell.
