Mr President, although I would certainly like Amendments 32 and 138 both to be put to the vote, I would welcome it if the vote on Amendment 138 were to take precedence over that on Amendment 32, so that the amendment is amended to read as follows:
... 'they shall transport the bicycle of the passenger in all trains, including cross-border and high-speed trains, possibly on payment of a charge'.
