Mr President, Turkey is an extremely important country from a European perspective, too.
Nevertheless, we should be aware that even countries as large as Turkey, which on top of this is a candidate country, must comply with certain criteria.
We should be aware that the fundamental values of the Union are at stake here.
I believe that last weekâ€™s judgment by the Supreme Court, which ruled against the conference in Istanbul on the reappraisal of the past relating to the genocide of Armenians, gives ample food for thought and shows us that fundamental rights are probably not being respected in Turkey.
For this reason, I rejected this resolution, and I believe that we would all be well advised to insist on respect for the fundamental values of the Union and to apply the same conditions to Turkey.
