– Mr President, today’s vote was a colossal shot across the bows of the Council on the issue of Turkey.
Opening negotiations with Turkey but not Croatia next Monday would give the EU public the impression that all 25 Members of the Council had collectively taken leave of their senses.
This not being a desirable scenario, there are certain things I would urge tomorrow’s meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives to do.
Firstly, to give the green light to Croatia, a European country that meets all the conditions.
Secondly, if you negotiate with Turkey, to do so only if the negotiating framework makes clear that the objective is a privileged partnership.
If this proves unattainable, I must appeal to the Member States to make use of unanimity and postpone negotiations with Turkey, as was done – unjustly – in the case of Croatia on 16 March – one day before negotiations were due to begin.
