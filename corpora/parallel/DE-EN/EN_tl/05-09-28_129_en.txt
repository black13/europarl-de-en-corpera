Mr President, I voted against the motion for a resolution on the opening of negotiations with Turkey, because I consider it irresponsible to start negotiations on its accession.
Turkey in no way meets the preconditions for the opening of accession negotiations.
It is rumoured that torture is still practised there, violations of human rights persist and Christians continue to be substantially hindered in the practice of their religion, to name but a few reasons.
It is incomprehensible how the Commission is going against its better judgment on this.
The Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Rehn, should step down before he does any more damage.
He is offending against the concept of European integration on a massive scale.
We should not be surprised when increasing numbers of citizens lose confidence in European institutions such as Parliament, the Commission and the Council and the majority therefore votes against the Constitution, as it did in the referenda in France and the Netherlands.
In rejecting the resolution on Turkey, I, like my friend Mr Posselt, have most certainly acted in the interests of the great majority of the Bavarian electorate, which wants a privileged partnership with Turkey, not full membership.
Incidentally, many of my Turkish friends share this opinion.
