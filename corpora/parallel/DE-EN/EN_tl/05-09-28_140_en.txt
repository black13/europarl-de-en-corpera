This compromise resolution deals with the Turkey–Cyprus issue satisfactorily and reasonably clearly.
I should have liked to see clearer statements regarding democracy und human rights in Turkey.
According to Amnesty International, torture in Turkey continues to assume proportions similarly serious to before; it just takes a different form.
The case of Mehmet Tarhan was a recent example of how conscientious objectors are punished with years of imprisonment.
There are renewed conflicts in the Kurdish regions, police and military forces are omnipresent, and state and non-state actors commit human-rights violations.
Freedom of the press is continually violated: for example, anyone publishing material that takes a critical line on the genocide of Armenians or the continuing Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus still faces imprisonment.
As far as the EU Heads of State or Government are concerned, a key motivation for this accession is geopolitics.
A Commission working document drawn up to render Turkey’s accession to the EU plausible states: ‘Turkey is a strategically important country (...)
Turkey’s accession would help to secure better energy supply routes for the EU.’
It continues: ‘With its large military expenditure and manpower, Turkey has the capacity to contribute significantly to EU security and defence’.
I, too, wish to see Turkey’s accession to the EU; just not like this.
The EU Heads of State or Government and the European Commission evidently care little about the real-life situation of the people.
