Mr President, I would like to say, for Mr Brokâ€™s benefit, that not all the arguments against Turkey are racist, but that those who can ride the wave of racism in their campaign against Turkey must, for that reason, give some thought to what arguments they use.
I stand by that.
If that touches a sore point for you, then that is your problem, and if it does not, then good for you.
