Mr President, I believe that it was right for us to liberalise freight transport by means of the second railway package.
Yet it would now be an additional burden on, and indeed an intervention in, free-market regulatory mechanisms if we were to introduce provisions such as those the Commission has just proposed.
Either we release the railway undertakings onto the free market or we regulate them: we have to decide.
For this reason, it would also be sensible to refer the whole report back to the Committee.
