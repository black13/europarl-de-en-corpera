Mr President, I seem to have a monopoly today.
I should like to emphasise with regard to this report, however, that the territorial component must increase the European added value, otherwise there is no justification for pumping so much money into the regions.
At the same time, however, we must take care to retain and even promote the variety of regional development.
In this regard, I should like to make a particular plea for support for the role of the regional authorities, so that they can respond to peopleâ€™s needs on the spot.
