Not even rural areas are spared globalisation, enlargement and demographic development; on the contrary, they tend to be particularly susceptible to the challenges of the 21st century.
Many issues cannot be resolved by local authorities alone, which is why cooperation with other municipalities and the participation and involvement of the public rank among the basic principles of rural development.
Maintaining quality of life in rural areas and fostering peopleâ€™s attachment to their homeland are essential to bringing migration from the land under control.
Economic attractiveness and lasting economic opportunities are as important in this regard as economical land use, conservation, awareness-raising at local level and adequate infrastructure.
Various village contests and town-twinning partnerships have proven their worth in giving impetus to this living space, which is home to two-thirds of all Austrians, for example.
Rural areas cannot, therefore, be sustained by agricultural subsidies alone, especially as the EU policy under which they are granted has so far done little to foster employment, instead, to some extent, further accelerating this migration: despite large subsidies, many farms are closing and not all members of future generations can make a living on the farm.
Ensuring vibrant rural areas requires, in particular, that we boost organic enterprises and give smaller businesses a better chance of survival.
Under no circumstances must there be a cut in subsidies for less-favoured areas: areas which make up 71% of the agricultural land area in Austria, for example.
This would result in the enforced destruction of whole regions.
