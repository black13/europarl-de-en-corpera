Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to emphasise that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, is in favour of alternative energy, and of such energy not only being promoted, but also made competitive.
It is unacceptable that it should remain subsidised indefinitely.
We must put alternative energy on the path towards competitiveness.
Listening to the debate in this House, I note that here, too, many Members place great trust in the state.
Members are urging state intervention, basically forgetting that, after all, the oil price in a competitive economy still follows the market.
It is first and foremost a market price; we have to accept this.
Yet we are all aware that, ultimately, part of the problem is refinery capacity.
This is insufficient at the moment, but the situation will change again somewhat.
When, though, over 70% of fuel prices at the pump in EU Member States such as Germany is accounted for by tax, we Members of the European Parliament must appeal to the national governments to take ad hoc action on this, in order to give the public in high-tax countries, in particular, something back and thus ensure continued mobility in these work-oriented societies.
This is another demand that is primarily of a political nature.
One cannot rail against the markets whilst being responsible for 70% of the price oneself; this would be attributing responsibility in the wrong quarters.
We would therefore be well advised to make it clear that the state should support alternative energy – in moderation – but that we should also invest in new technologies.
There is a wide range of such options to choose from, for example hybrid-drive systems, amongst others.
The emphasis here should be on moderation and good sense, however, rather than ideology.
