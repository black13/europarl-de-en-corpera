Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of important responses to the current oil crisis.
I am deeply convinced, however, that the only correct response in the long term is to overcome our dependence on oil, a source of energy that will last for perhaps a further 40 to 60 years, is prone to crises and is increasing in price the scarcer it becomes.
We can see, therefore, that the alternatives are an obvious choice.
Energy conservation must come first.
Studies have shown that savings of 14% in the transport sector and 20% in the building sector are possible, and this without any sacrifices in terms of comfort.
I am addressing the President-in-Office of the Council when I express my fervent hope that, particularly in this difficult situation, we shall succeed in arriving at a sensible, workable compromise regarding the Directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services.
A great deal has been achieved in the European Union in the field of renewable energy, but shortcomings remain.
Nearly half of all energy produced is used for generating heat, a large proportion of this from oil.
Here, in particular, we see that penetration is not reaching its potential.
I would urge the Commissioner, therefore, to really present an appropriate directive on this, which sets out clear objectives and produces the relevant measures in the Member States.
