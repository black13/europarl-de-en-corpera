. – Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, it must be said without equivocation that the United Nations has just missed a historic opportunity for systematic reform.
The result is disappointing, and the good groundwork by Kofi Annan has not been transformed into real success.
The reform has failed in four key areas.
There will not be any reform of the Security Council that produces genuine regional representation.
There is no plan for disarmament or non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Plans to create a UN Environment Organisation were unsuccessful.
I should like to add that, particularly in the face of the challenges of international climate policy, that is a very serious omission.
We do not have any real instrument for United Nations policy in this field.
Attempts to further develop the Economic and Social Council – particularly in the face of the great challenges that we face with regard to development policy – were also unsuccessful.
The phrase ‘the end of one reform is the start of the next’ is therefore true today.
Nevertheless, there has of course been some progress that we can use as a starting point.
The establishment of a UN Human Rights Council is a good thing, even if its composition is not yet clear.
The doubling of the resources of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is also good.
Another positive development is that there will be a Peacebuilding Commission.
It is good that the Millennium Development Goals have been reaffirmed and that various action programmes and solidarity funds are being set up.
What emerges from this is a specific challenge for the European Union, and so I wish to call on the Council and the Commission to present a precise action plan for the specific financial and organisational contribution of the European Union to the implementation of these measures.
The aim now, in the wake of the Summit, is to back up the rhetoric of the United Nations with specific, material support.
