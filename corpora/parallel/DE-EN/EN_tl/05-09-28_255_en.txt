– Mr President, we are now debating how full the glass is.
I must be frank and say that the glass is almost empty; there is nothing to drink – and this should be a commonly accepted fact.
This United Nations Summit was an all-round failure.
What was planned was not achieved.
A very good illustration of this is the change in this outcome resolution, when one compares its original appearance with the way it has ended up – only a thin paper now remains.
I am pleased on one count, however: that it was not adopted.
The reason is that it concerns the proposals of the High-Level Panel that presented a report to Kofi Annan.
This Panel wanted to anchor a concept of pre-emptive war in the United Nations, and would have destroyed the basic idea of the United Nations in so doing.
There is no longer any specific reference to the concept of pre-emptive war; only an allusion to it remains, in paragraph 92.
I am very glad that this change was made.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner says that this was, in a way, triggered by the Kosovo war, but that is exactly where the problem lies.
That war constituted a violation of international law, and that is exactly what we want to avoid.
International law should not be violated.
