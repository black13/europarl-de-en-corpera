Mr President, Mr Lambsdorff, you know as well as I do that the Constitution has not yet progressed and has not been ratified.
The Council Secretariat now has an office in New York; the Commission has observer status at the United Nations, and we work extremely closely together.
Even so, there are at present no plans to amalgamate the two.
