Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said in this House about last weekendâ€™s conference of historians in Istanbul, in which I was a participant.
Contrary to what Mrs De Sarnez has just said, it did actually take place, and it did so because the Turkish prime minister and foreign minister stated plainly that it had to go ahead and expressed their solidarity with the academics and critical minds in Turkey.
It would do credit to the European Parliament if all groups in it were to take this opportunity to thank the prime minister of Turkey for this demonstration of his courage in allowing this critical meeting to be held.
That testified to his awareness of what it means to be European.
I have returned, though, from Turkey, with a twofold mission.
The first thing I have been asked to do is to thank all those in this House who, over a period of many years, have campaigned for human rights and democracy in Turkey, and that at a time when Turkey, like the rest of the world, was waging the Cold War, and when some of those talking about human rights today saw everything in Turkey except the problems with human rights.
Secondly, I bring with me a plea for us to press on with the process of bringing the country closer to the European Union, for that is the only way in which democracy and reforms will be put on any kind of sustainable footing in Turkey.
