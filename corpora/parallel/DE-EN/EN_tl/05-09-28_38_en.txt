Mr President, those who are listening to this debate are already asking themselves how it is possible for people to act in such an irresponsible way.
What was it, they ask themselves, that the decision-makers in the place promised over and over again?
No enlargement beyond the Ten without Nice and no further enlargement without a constitution for the EU, and what are we doing now?
We are making the way straight for Turkey!
If that is what actually happens, then I am convinced that history will bury the EU.
We will have no chance to carry on with what was originally thought of as the European Union in any meaningful form.
If we go on with this process, then that is something I regard as a great failure, and, indeed, particularly in view of its responsibility towards young people â€“ as an act of betrayal by the political elite.
So let us have some symbolism today as well, with another coffin in the plenary.
You are ruining the European project!
I have time for a last appeal, made in my new capacity as a member of the delegation to the EU/Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, and so I say: pull the ripcord and stop the negotiations!
