Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is in a crisis; we have no constitution, and how the EU is to fund itself in future is anyoneâ€™s guess.
The institutions of the Community have too much to cope with even with 25 Member States, and the democratic deficit is becoming plain to see.
If the EU itself were to seek accession to the European Union, its application would be rejected on the grounds that it was not a democracy.
It is under these circumstances that negotiations with Turkey are now to be embarked upon, and, as there is no likelihood of the two sides achieving union in the foreseeable future, they must be judged by the same standards, as of course required by the Copenhagen criteria.
The possibility of the negotiations being open-ended as regards outcome and duration must, in the interests of both sides, be guaranteed.
Reform is needed on both sides, and the negotiations will present both Turkey and the European Union with a great opportunity to implement it.
Thank you, and the Minister for Europe in particular, for your attention.
