Mr President, why is there such great indignation about the Turkish stance on Cyprus?
It is because we are diverting attention from ourselves; it is because the way the Turks are putting us on the spot hurts.
The European Union was meant to take over peacekeeping operations on the island on 1 May 2004 – but we did not.
We kept none of our promises.
We have neither put an end to Northern Cyprus’ isolation, nor have we injected the EUR 259 million we promised for the reconstruction of the economy.
It is not just the case that Turkey has to recognise the Republic of Cyprus; we must, once and for all, acknowledge that the Turkish Cypriots who live on the island are people with equal rights.
Young North Cypriots are not even allowed to participate in international sporting events – still less are North Cypriots welcome as Members of the European Parliament, or as observers in it.
When we say, in the Ankara Agreement, that we want to open up all the ports and airports, then the port at Famagusta and Ercan airport must be among them, in accordance with the principle of equal rights for all – unless, that is, Turks are second-class human beings.
