Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement.
The Chairman of the Socialist Group in this House asserted during the debate that I had formerly advocated Turkey’s full membership of the European Union.
I would like to make it clear that I do not do so and never have.
I have obtained the minutes of the debate on 13 December 1995.
It is quite clear that the only subject of this debate was whether to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to customs union.
At that time, Mr Schulz and I were on opposing sides; I was campaigning for a ‘yes’ to the customs union, while he was against it.
What has been said today is a manifest distortion of the truth.
