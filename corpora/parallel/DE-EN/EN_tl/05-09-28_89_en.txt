Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot offer you any declarations of love; I think it is enough for us to be able to have mutual respect for each other.
Pursuant to Rule 170(4) of the Rules of Procedure, I would like, on behalf of my group, to move that we defer our agreement to the additional protocol on customs union.
The reasoning behind this motion is that the Turkish Government, although it has accepted the additional protocol, has, at the same time, whilst wishing to negotiate with the Republic of Cyprus, refused to recognise it, declaring furthermore that the ships and aircraft of a Member State of the European Union, that being Cyprus, are barred from using Turkish harbours and airspace.
We take the view – logically enough – that this is inherently contradictory and politically utterly unacceptable.
If we were now to give our approval to the additional protocol, then it would no longer be open to us – the statement by the chairman of the Socialist Group this morning notwithstanding – to exert influence on the Turkish Government.
I therefore, and on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, move that the vote on the additional protocol be deferred.
