Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I disagree with Mr Poettering.
Contrary to what he says, the resolution, which we are tabling jointly, makes clear that we are demanding the full implementation of all the agreements entered into, and, as the Commissioner reiterated in his speech this morning, it also states that, if they are not, the negotiations will be suspended or even broken off.
We should, I think, for our part, stand by the contractual agreements into which we have entered, for that will make it easier for us to retain a high degree of credibility if, in the event of the other side reneging on its undertaking, we have to declare that the negotiations are closed and are not being taken any further.
We are therefore in favour of putting this to the vote today.
