Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China is an important partner for Europe, the EU’s second largest trading partner after the United States.
Chinese statistics show that the EU is China’s number one trading partner, ahead of the United States.
I believe the mutual opening of markets should be an absolute priority for us.
We cannot have a situation where we open our markets while our firms are faced with problems over there.
I believe the future opportunities for growth on the Chinese market are of the utmost importance for our manufacturing industry in particular and that much of the plant that has been supplied there came from Europe.
European firms must of course also position themselves on that market in good time in order to safeguard jobs here at home.
Imports to Europe also increase our purchasing power.
Many of our families save hundreds of euros a month because they can buy goods of very acceptable quality at a very reasonable price.
The money they save can then be spent on other services or products, so the Chinese are actually increasing our purchasing power disproportionately.
It has already been mentioned that intellectual property is a tremendous problem and that our European firms need more protection.
The Commission needs to enforce patent and trade mark rights.
I call on it to use its influence, especially in the talks in Hong Kong and in the TRIPS too, to ensure that these international obligations are scrupulously observed.
I believe this will strengthen our relations in future.
I believe a communist country is on the way to becoming a market economy, which will also underpin democracy and human rights.
We all ought to give this our backing.
