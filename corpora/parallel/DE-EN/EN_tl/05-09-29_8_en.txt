. â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are now seeing in the textile sector is the beginning of a trend or the emergence of a trend that has been going on for some time and is going to accelerate and become more acute.
We are faced with the fact that world trade is no longer what we used to imagine it would be in the future.
We always assumed that we here in Europe would do high-tech, while everyone else would supply us with cheap raw materials and cover our basic needs, as it were.
That strategy is not working because development has proceeded much quicker, as with textiles in China, for example.
If we are now saying that the agreement, the memorandum of understanding, has given us a breathing space, then it really is nothing more than that and will at best only slow the trend down somewhat, but it will not solve the underlying problems.
Europe is not adapting quickly enough.
I also note that European interests are divided in this matter, between consumers, traders and politicians.
Consumers want cheap T-shirts.
At the same time, a growing number of people in Europe are supporting campaigns like the Clean Clothes Campaign, promoting products that have been made under fairer conditions.
People want ethical standards in production; they also want ecological standards in production.
At the same time, however, everyone wants to have these low-cost products.
The traders are the same.
I would like to ask you a question, Commissioner.
If you say you believe the Commission acted diligently, how could the fact that any amount of Chinese-made products have piled up in the ports within a very short space of time be overlooked?
I fail to understand how European Heads of Government can attend the opening of firms that have relocated to China and then come home and complain about competition from China.
