Mr President, now that we have a Grand Coalition, we want to make a bit of a crack in it.
We Greens endorse the Social Democratsâ€™ demand that not only Commissioner McCreevy, but also Mr Barroso, should appear before this House.
This is not a circus, and, if Commissioner McCreevy can make that sort of statement at a time when the European Social Model is in place, then it is incumbent to the President of the Commission to say, on its behalf, what is acceptable and what is not.
