Mr President, politics is a trial, and we want to remain credible.
Our group has just decided that, if the Social Democrats move that Commissioner McCreevy be invited to appear before the House, we will vote in favour of that.
Now, though, another motion is before the House, to the effect that the invitation be extended to both Commissioner McCreevy and the President of the Commission.
We will not be voting in favour of that; we will, that is to say, be voting against it.
Although we did not table the motion that Commissioner McCreevy should appear, we do want to be seen to be credible, and so, if this motion, that the President of the Commission should also come, is voted down, you can have a second vote to decide whether Commissioner McCreevy should come on his own.
As matters stand, we owe it to our own credibility to take this decision.
