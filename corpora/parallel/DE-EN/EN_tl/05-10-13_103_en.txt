Mr President, the main thing to be said in response to the Portas Report is that it is only those who speak the language of their new host country who stand a chance of getting an education, protecting their own interests and being integrated into its society.
It is for precisely this reason that those children belonging to the second or third generation of immigrants who do not have a command of the host countryâ€™s language continue to be denied opportunities, with the consequence that we increasingly face the creation of so-called parallel societies, in which they resort to violence and crime.
We must not, however, tolerate the creation of such parallel societies, and so integration is dependent upon the learning of the national language of the state in question, and on that we must insist.
