Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur has already – and rightly – said, even though there is no provision in the Treaties for the EU to have any direct power over or responsibility for the conduct of an urban policy, the European Parliament has always argued the case for one at European level.
I would just like to remind the House that it was this Parliament that campaigned for URBAN as a Community initiative and, in due course, made a successful job of implementing it.
For the sake of simplification, the existing URBAN dimension is now to be integrated into the mainstream programmes for the coming planning period for 2007 to 2013.
That can definitely be advantageous provided that the URBAN dimension’s successful continuity is ensured.
There is no doubt that urban areas are – as the rapporteur has highlighted – economic motors and key elements in regional development created within the EU.
The fact that over 80% of economic activity goes on in towns and cities is as indispensable justification for the principle of partnership as one of the key elements in cohesion policy.
Urban and rural policy are dependent on each other; it is for that reason that they may not, in any one territory, be considered in isolation, even though there are extreme differences between rural and urban zones in the ten new Member States.
What is remarkable about the cities of the central and eastern European states is the decline in their population, the phenomenon of emigration brought about by the decline of industry, and this is a process that the Eastern European states will have to master in exactly the same way as did the towns and cities of the former East Germany: as a consequence of the socialist era.
This is where the Urban Dimension’s city policy, among others, could – indeed, must – have an effect.
That is why the rapporteur’s balanced report deserves to be endorsed and its conclusions need to be followed up.
