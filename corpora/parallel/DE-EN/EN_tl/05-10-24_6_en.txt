Mr President, it is indeed the case that our group had made a request to the Conference of Presidents that the debate on the Commission statement on patents for biotechnological inventions should go ahead, but that there should be no resolution.
If we include today in the reckoning, there will be 48 hours between the debate and the adoption, and we do not believe that it is possible, in so short a time, to hammer out a common position on one of the most important and controversial issues in European political debate.
I do not think we can be seriously expected to do that.
We do believe that it makes sense to debate this now, but, when dealing with an area as problematic as this one, Parliament should be allowed more time to make a statement.
We therefore ask that the debate should be allowed to go ahead, but without motions for resolutions being tabled, and that the order of business be amended accordingly.
Debate without resolution!
