Mr President, I would like to oppose the motion from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and argue in favour of a resolution.
The problem is that there are deadlines to be met in considering this issue.
If we do not come up with a position on this matter in October, the decision will be taken elsewhere; the European Patent Office is, for example, considering a controversial patent, and there are contradictory interpretations of the directive that this House adopted on the patenting of human genes or of human body parts.
If the House does not express its mind, the political message we will be sending is that we are not capable of making a contribution to the debate on this issue, even though it was this House that adopted the directive.
I therefore ask that Mr Schulzâ€™s motion be rejected.
