– Mr President, with all due respect to Commissioner McCreevy, I have to say that his claims that Swedish collective bargaining practice was contrary to the European Treaty and the freedom to provide services show that he has been led astray.
Not only has he pre-empted a court ruling, but he has also, and above all, put a question mark against the protection of workers as an element in the European internal market.
In the past, the freedom to provide services has always – not least in the Posting of Workers Directive – been seen as compatible with workers’ protection.
The freedom to provide services must continue, in future, to include protection for workers if ‘social Europe’ is to be something we actually want to establish rather than a mere form of words.
The reason why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has stated that the Services Directive, which Commissioner McCreevy defends, is compatible neither with the Treaty nor with the Charter of Fundamental Rights is that it calls into question the protection of workers.
It was for that reason that we, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, struck out those very parts of the Services Directive by which the protection of workers was eroded.
If Europe is to be competitive, it needs a social dimension.
Competitiveness also demands that working conditions be fair and that workers should enjoy equal rights.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market, Mr McCreevy is bound to pursue a policy of worker protection and not just one that defends one party’s interests.
