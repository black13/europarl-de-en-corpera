– Mr President, Commissioner, if we in Europe want to protect ourselves, we should have acted years ago to provide aid to Asia, and by that I mean technical aid to address the problem that much of our meat is already produced there from animals kept in breeding establishments.
The problem is that these animals, which have been intensively bred with the aid of technology, come into contact with regional breeds or wild animals, which carry the virus without becoming ill in clinical terms.
If the virus is then passed on to animals kept in breeding establishments, there is the potential for mutations and variations that can present a danger to human beings.
This is where the provision of technical aid would certainly make sense.
What is, of course, nonsensical about this whole debate is the idea that we might be able to gain technical mastery over nature by doing away with it and resorting to banning the entry of geese or the keeping of animals under extensive farming conditions in an attempt to get on top of all this.
This strikes me as reflecting the interests of the cage industry more than anyone else’s.
