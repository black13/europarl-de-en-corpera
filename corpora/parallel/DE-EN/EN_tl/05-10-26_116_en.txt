Mr President, I would like to call on the Commission to provide the House with an explanation, but the Commission is unfortunately absent.
Perhaps, though, your services might be so kind as to convey this to the Commission, which I would ask to do so in the course of this week.
The reason for this demand is Commissioner McCreevy’s statement in the course of yesterday evening’s debate on the patentability of human cloning, a statement that finds no support in law.
The Commission’s interpretation of this point is quite simply wrong and contradicts the protocol note of the Council of Ministers handed down by the Council when the directive was adopted.
In Article 35 of that protocol note, it is stated quite clearly that it is not only reproductive cloning that is barred from being patented.
The Commission, which is the guardian of the Treaties, cannot, in a speech by one of its members, give an interpretation that does not concur with the directive, that is false and that contradicts the Council’s protocol note.
It is, therefore, as a matter of real urgency that I ask your services to demand that the Commission rectify this, for if it does not there are sure to be consequences.
Knowing that many other Members present in the Chamber take a similar view, I really do ask that this be clarified, that the clarification be forwarded to Commissioner McCreevy’s office, and that he himself, this week, should correct this error.
