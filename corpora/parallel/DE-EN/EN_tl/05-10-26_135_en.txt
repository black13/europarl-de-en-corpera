Mr President, in June, Tony Blair shared with this House his ideas about the EU budget of the future, which would have fewer agricultural subsidies and spend more on research and education.
I am obliged to him for saying this.
Even though this reflected both reality and the way the public feel, it was a bold thing to say, and the reactions of the other Heads of Government are evidence of that.
I do ask you, though, to keep to your priorities; they are vital to our future, and when people like Gerhard Schröder criticise, remember that he has been voted out of office and no longer has a mandate to speak for Germany.
Today, the MEPs belonging to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomed Tony Blair with placards bidding him ‘make EU laws in public’.
In so doing, we are responding to another of his announcements, which was that he intended to make the Council’s sessions open to the public.
We ask him to make that announcement, too, reality.
Just do it!
We are waiting for you.
