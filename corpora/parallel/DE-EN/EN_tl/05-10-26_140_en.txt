Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, having, a few days ago, posted the President of the Council as missing, I wanted to say ‘Welcome back!’, but there he is, gone again.
I hope we will not have to wait until December for him to return to the European stage.
The reason why I announced that he had gone astray was that I think he is too reticent, too self-effacing, in his approach to public European debate, to the seeking of answers to the questions the public ask and to the problems that we face.
There is, I think, a lack of active presidency at Council level.
Although I think the one he gave on 23 June was better, we have, today, heard him deliver his second good speech, with the right analyses, vague suggestions and plenty of announcements.
I have to tell you, Mr President, that you are now well over half way through your presidency, and your record to date is not one of success; you still have much to do to make your presidency of the Council a successful one.
To do that, fine rhetoric and polished speeches will not be enough.
I urge you to give the European Union the power to do what you demand of it; to give just two examples, we are not responsible for the universities, nor for national energy policies, yet these are things that you demand that we deal with.
Give the European Union the funding to do what you demand of it, and to implement those things that you have had a share in adopting.
Take it from us: the Böge Report is evidence of the lack of agreement with Parliament on the Financial Perspective, because we want to be able to do the things we are obliged to do.
As we see it, the social market economy is the European social model, and the period of reflection on the Constitution begins now rather than on 30 June.
Get back to meeting the people where they are, get Europe afloat, take action!
