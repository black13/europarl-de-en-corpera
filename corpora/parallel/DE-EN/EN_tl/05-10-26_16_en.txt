Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee for Regional Development has, in its opinion on the budget, agreed to the Commission’s proposals and reinstated the preliminary draft, with particular reference to the payments.
The rapporteur took the needs of the Member States into account by again increasing the payments by 40%, and so there are two things I ask of them.
One is that they should actually spend this money properly and in accordance with up-to-date knowledge, and the other is that, in the debate on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, they take that into account and budget accordingly for cohesion policy in future.
I would like to ask the House to endorse two more proposals from the Regional Committee, one being for a project on the European networking of SMEs, and the other for a study on the particular needs of the new Member States as regards the reconstruction of panel-built housing estates – a problem we have frequently discussed in this House without any exact knowledge of the challenges with which these present the Member States in question.
