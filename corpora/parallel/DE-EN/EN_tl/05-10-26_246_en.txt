Mr President, these problems mainly affect the Christian minority groups in Turkey, where Christians face the threat of their disappearance from the scene.
Their numbers are dwindling, and the Ecumenical Patriarch fears that there may well be no Christians left in Turkey by the time the accession negotiations come to an end.
It is for that reason that I have a very specific question to put to you.
The Law on Religion was submitted to the Commission, which had some trenchant criticisms to make of it.
The Turks said that their parliament would make improvements to it.
Do you have any definite indications that such improvements have been made, particularly where the property law and the training of priests is concerned?
Have you received any definite indications, and will you insist on them being reflected in action over the course of the coming weeks, or do you intend to wait until the Turkish Christians have died out before dealing with this?
