Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by warmly thanking Mrs Bonino and Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra for having done such a good job of leading us in Kabul.
I would also like to express my gratitude to all the Members of this House who were with us there.
Perhaps I might be permitted to return to one subject that has cropped up a number of times this evening, namely the criticisms that are levelled at Afghanistan, a country that I think has made a gigantic leap forward and is in the process of making more of them.
We should be very, very judicious in our criticisms; we Europeans have no good cause to point the finger at this country, which has suffered so much, and say who should be punished and what has gone wrong.
To be sure, many things have gone wrong, and many more have yet to do so, but let us consider the history of Europe over the past century, that of my own country for example: even in the old Federal Republic, after the Second World War, many people with links to the old regime were accepted into the civil service and spent their careers in it.
Recently, too, the West – to which we belong – has cosied up to the former Soviet ; being on friendly terms with former KGB bosses has become something to be boasted about, and so on and so forth.
I would warn against our constantly telling the Afghans, from a position such as our own, what they have to do.
A lot of very good things are happening; I was most especially impressed by the high degree of open-mindedness and commitment shown by the young people.
There were very many young people helping out in the polling stations, and, when we asked them what they wanted, they said, ‘We want education, education, education’.
I shall conclude by saying that I would very much like to see this House set up a delegation for relations with Afghanistan, for I believe that to be the best way for us to help the parliamentarians there.
