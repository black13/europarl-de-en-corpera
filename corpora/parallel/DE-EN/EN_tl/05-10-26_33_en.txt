Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is by money that we show what things are worth to us.
A look at the EU Budget, though, gives us the impression – astonishingly enough – that agriculture is some seven times more valuable to us than research and education.
Such an outlook is false on two counts, for, if there is something that the EU regards as politically desirable, it should use the budget to provide the groundwork for it, and Europe should be investing in the future rather than subsidising outdated structures.
It does make a difference whether, for example, one invests in nanotechnology or guarantees a farmer his income – yes, I know, the CSU is living in another era.
That is why it is a good thing that Parliament has increased expenditure on the Lisbon agenda and slashed the tobacco subsidies.
We need to carry on further down this road.
