Mr President, in order to fund EU military operations, the Council and the Commission set up shadow budgets that are not capable of being officially scrutinised.
Using what is termed the ‘ATHENA Mechanism’, the EU Member States pay the money for the EU’s military operations into a separate fund that is specifically not defined as a heading in the EU’s budget.
In so doing, they leave Parliament on the outside looking in and make scrutiny almost impossible.
I have asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Security and Defence Sub-Committee how much money there is in this fund, but have been given no answers.
Now, therefore, I put that same question directly to the Council and the Commission.
This procedure is currently being used for EUFOR Althea in Bosnia, and it is intended that it should in future be used specifically to finance what the EU calls its crisis management operations, which amount to waging war.
It is evident that the development aid budget was used to fund the EU’s questionable military and policing operations in the Congo and in the Sudan – or so, at any rate, it would appear from what the representatives of the Commission told the Foreign Affairs Committee.
It was also stated at this meeting that the Treaty of Nice as it stands at present proscribes any independent military budget for the EU.
Quite right too!
Stop using financial trickery to fund military operations by the EU!
