Mr President, one gets the feeling, when listening to Mr Ferber, that it is very unfortunate that he has not yet been summoned to Berlin to take charge of the Germans’ financial arrangements in Brussels, for then a few things would change.
It is also regrettable, Mr Ferber, that you are in a minority in your own group, and what is even worse is if, as a former lead candidate for the Social Democrats – which is what I am – you have to listen to this gentleman with his unending ‘more, more, more’ and nothing else, with no sign of comprehension that times have changed and that less might often mean more.
As long as its current financial arrangements are as they are, this House is a living example of how to waste money.
The fact is that, taken as a whole, the 2006 budget is yet another example of greed, incomprehension and missed opportunities: greed because of the emphasis on ‘more’; incomprehension because nobody has worked out how to do anything useful with the 90 million we had already, and as for the missed opportunity, well, that is it.
It is becoming ever more clear to us that this Europe of ours needs real alternatives.
We need alliances – alliances that cross Europe, alliances that are democratic, alliances that have transparency as their objective and will at last bring pressure to bear to get what is currently being done badly changed right across Europe and for the good of its citizens.
