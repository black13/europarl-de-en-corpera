Mr President, I would like to point out that it is, in principle, the Member States that are responsible for taking the action needed to forestall the flu pandemic that is being prophesied.
That having been said, it is also important that the Commission should coordinate them in doing this.
It is evident from the warnings they have issued that both the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are taking the prospect of a pandemic breaking out extremely seriously.
Now is the time to draw up emergency plans, take the necessary coordinating action and, most of all, act to prevent panic among the public at large.
In conclusion, I would also like to thank the interpreters for having sacrificed some of their lunch hour.
