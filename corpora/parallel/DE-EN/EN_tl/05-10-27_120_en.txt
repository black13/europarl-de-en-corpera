Mr President, today’s resolution condemns the Uzbek Government’s denial of any transparency in connection with the investigation into the events of May 2005, and it stresses how important it is that there should be an independent international commission of inquiry, one that is in a position to bring the details to light without delay and to observe ongoing processes without interference.
Precisely how many people lost their lives on those May days in Andijan is something that the global public has until now been unable to find out.
Human rights organisations’ figures vary between 500 and 1 000, while the Uzbek Government gives the number of victims as 176.
Over and over again, President Karimov uses Islamism as a blunt instrument with which to put his political opponents – of whatever stripe – out of action.
That is why it is vital that we should press home our demands for the setting at liberty of those human rights activists, journalists and members of the political opposition who are still in prison.
