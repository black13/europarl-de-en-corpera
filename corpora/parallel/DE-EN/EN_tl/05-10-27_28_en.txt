Mr President, I wish to say something pursuant to Rules 142 and 143 of the Rules of Procedure.
Many Members of this House were surprised to note that yesterday’s budget debate was over just after 11 a.m., although it had been allotted time up until midday.
Now it may well be that the time had not been properly worked out, and it is the case that a number of Members did not turn up, and that there were those – the Commission and the Council, for example – who spoke with unexpected brevity.
I would ask the House’s Bureau, however, to give some thought to whether it might not be possible to respond more flexibly under such circumstances, particularly by giving the floor to those Members who were present in the Chamber right up to the very end of the debate – if they so desire it, that is – or by letting them speak for longer.
Instead, Members were given only a minute each in which to speak, and we wasted almost an hour in which no business was transacted.
Could the Bureau perhaps introduce a rule on this, so that this debate may be conducted flexibly, and the time available used to the full?
