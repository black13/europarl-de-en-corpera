Mr President, I would in fact like to put the case for a vote on the resolution.
In the Conference of Presidents, I saw fit to argue that there should be no resolution, my justification for this being that we should wait to see what comes back from the delegation before drafting one.
As its Chairman, I am of course dependent on my Group’s support, and so I reported this to them this morning.
The Group was unanimous in its view that we should in fact frame a resolution today.
What that means – and I am not ashamed to admit it – is that the Group’s opinion differed from my own.
I am under an obligation to act in accordance with the Group’s vote, and so, good democrat that I am, I am in favour ...
... yes, and I wish others would do likewise and say that they accept what the group bids its chairman do.
Our group’s opinion is that we should not await the outcome of the delegation, but should instead make our views on the subject known now.
It is for that reason that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of us coming to a decision on a resolution today.
