Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I dare say you have taken note of yesterday’s statement by President Ahmadinejad of Iran, who has expressed a desire to wipe the State of Israel off the map, claiming that this is what Ayatollah Khomeini would want.
That is a monstrous thing to say, and in saying it, the President of Iran is aligning himself with terrorists.
We see Israel’s integrity and security as being of great value, and we defend them.
Speaking on behalf of my group, I wish to announce our intention to make an issue of this.
We will be proposing it at the next part-session of this House, and I would welcome support from the other groups.
I see that Mrs Koch-Mehrin and Mr Swoboda are here, along with others who might well give their support.
