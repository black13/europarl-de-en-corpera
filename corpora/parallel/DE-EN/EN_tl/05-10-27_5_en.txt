Mr President, if these statements have indeed been made, we too find them unacceptable, scandalous and dangerous.
It is in itself staggering enough for a president to address a conference with the theme of ‘a world without Zionism’ and to express himself in such terms.
Such a thing is absolutely unacceptable, and we endorse the motion that it be made the subject of a debate in this House.
