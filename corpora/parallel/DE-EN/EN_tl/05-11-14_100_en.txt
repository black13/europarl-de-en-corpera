Mr President, contrary to our Polish friend’s opinion, there are not, in Europe, two legal doctrines as to whether the end justifies the means.
The law is unambiguous and binding.
Terror may not be fought with terror.
There is nothing problematic or uncertain about this issue.
Deprivation of freedom, abduction, enforced transportation, torture, abusive treatment, solitary confinement, and disregard of the presumption of innocence are crimes and themselves constitute acts of terrorism.
That is not Europe’s way.
You refer to comments in magazines, and say you have no evidence.
I can assure, you, Commissioner, that this is but the first of very many debates until such time as this matter has been settled, and settled beyond doubt.
There you have them: the numbers of the flights, the airports involved, the flight times, the companies and firms that operated the flights, the destinations to which they flew; you have statements from detainees, evidence from a dozen international organisations, investigations by the CIA itself, albeit into the breach of secrecy rather than into the crimes themselves.
The Austrian military authorities are conducting investigations into CIA aircraft’s flights through Austrian airspace, and enquiries by the justice authorities in Spain, Italy and Germany are also underway.
I call on you to wake up, perform the duties of your office and take responsibility.
