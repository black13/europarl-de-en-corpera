Madam President, I am grateful to my friend Mr Mann for demonstrating that we are back in step once again.
The WTO’s sixth Ministerial Conference is due to be held in Hong Kong this December, and it will be yet another of the kind at which there will be no discussion of a ban on child labour, or of the abolition of forced labour, not to mention freedom of association or the right to set up trade unions.
The examples I have just given are core labour standards, and there can be no fair trade without them.
The Commission communication that we are discussing today sets out the things that the Community can do to make the globalisation process fairer for everyone, and, with that in mind, I would like to draw the House’s attention to a negotiating mandate for the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle, which expressed the EU’s desire for a conference at ministerial level on the subjects of trade, employment and core labour standards.
At that time, the Commission – and it is the Members of the Commission that I would like to remind of this – undertook to hold such a conference in 2001.
If you, Members of the Commission, want to take action, then I suggest that you make a start by doing what you undertook to do years ago.
I expect of you no other than this, that you hold this conference at long last, for fair trade is more live an issue than ever, if – as you now should – you take the social dimension of globalisation seriously.
