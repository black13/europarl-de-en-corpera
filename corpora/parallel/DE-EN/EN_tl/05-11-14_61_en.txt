Madam President, Commissioner, while I do agree with many of the views expressed in the report by our Slovene Member Mr Brejc, I am not with him every step of the way.
You say that the Lisbon agenda will, in bringing together the social components, enable us to meet the challenges of globalisation.
It will do no such thing!
The year is 2005; the period is halfway through.
We have conducted a mid-term review, and expressed the criticism that these methods will not work on their own.
To a large degree, globalisation has helped to create wealth, but – and this I say to Mr Hökmark – it has, equally, contributed to greater poverty, more exclusion, and to more social division, which does not, indeed, add up to equality and justice for all.
Secondly, we should have more to say about the Gothenbourg Summit, for that is where the economic, social and ecological triad – to which I would like to see the protection of consumers added – was set in stone, for that, in fact, is our fundamental concern.
Trade must, by definition, be free, but liberalisation alone will not move us forward, for we need environmental, labour and social standards, and it is only if we include these and take them on board that we really do have a chance of making trade fair across the globe.
That is a world away from your approach, and it is for that reason that Hong Kong will, unfortunately, be a repeat of what we have seen before.
If we get fixated on trade and take no account of the other social components, we will get nowhere.
I think we would stand a chance if we were to enforce the global standards that already exist and limit imports into the European Union to those goods manufactured in accordance with them.
To do so would help us and reverse the trend.
