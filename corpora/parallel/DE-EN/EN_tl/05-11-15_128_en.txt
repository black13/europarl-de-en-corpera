Mr President, I have just a small point of order to raise.
It has previously been the custom of this House that rapporteurs present the positions of their committees.
As Mr Sacconi is in fact the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would have been glad if what he said had reflected that committeeâ€™s attitude.
I would ask you in future to indicate from the Chair whether speeches are made in a personal capacity or in the capacity of rapporteur.
