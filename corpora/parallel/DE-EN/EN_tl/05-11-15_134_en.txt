Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the environment and the protection of the consumer stand to gain if this REACH law is adopted is not a matter of doubt.
If it is, then we will, within eleven years, be in possession of knowledge and information that we have not been able to collect before on some 30 000 substances used by European businesses.
That is what makes this such a crucial leap forward.
What brings it about is the fact that we will, in future, be transferring to businesses the responsibility for obtaining information and carrying out tests, along with the costs incurred in doing so.
Businesses will be responsible for the safe handling of the substances that they produce and with which they have dealings.
That is the crucial change over against the law as it was before, and I think it has to be mentioned that it involves considerable costs, for these tests cost money â€“ up to EUR 200 000!
Businesses would in future be required to bear these costs themselves in the interests of the environment and consumer protection, and that means that we have to give some thought to what effect this would have on competitiveness.
Reference has already been made to the compromise that Mr Sacconi and I have been able to hammer out, and to which our respective groups have been good enough to give their approval.
It makes the requirement for data in the range between one and one hundred tonnes, which is of particular importance for small and medium-sized enterprises, more dependent on the potential risk from a substance, rather than only on the quantity in which it is produced.
That is a vitally important development for small and medium-sized producers and users; I am very pleased indeed that we have been able to achieve it, and it does of course have our unconditional backing.
We have tabled old amendments only against the possible eventuality of our not getting a majority for it.
It has to be said, though, that this compromise relates only to registration, which is the most important part of REACH, and certainly not to the whole thing.
Matters relating to authorisation and scope are still outstanding, and I hope we will manage to come to an agreement on them too.
