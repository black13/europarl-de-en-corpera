Mr President, I do indeed intend to put forward the position of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality rather than do as some Members have done and misuse my speaking time to express my personal views.
The Women’s Committee endorses, by a large majority, the Commission’s proposal on REACH.
Women are particularly affected by chemical pollution, because the fat in their bodies more readily absorbs dangerous substances.
Chemicals build up in the body and can cause cancer.
The incidence of breast cancer has doubled in Europe over the last twenty years; one woman out of every nine in Europe suffers from cancer, and this is in many cases attributable to chemicals.
Chemicals can also harm embryos and impair fertility; 15% of all couples want children but cannot have them.
Men’s sperm quality has halved over recent years; genes can be altered and allergies triggered.
Chemicals have an effect on children’s health, too.
The incidence of cancer in children is increasing by 1% per annum, and it has become the second most common cause of death in childhood.
Women, without wanting to do so, pass on the whole chemical cocktail to their children during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
The Women’s Committee therefore regards REACH as a unique opportunity to better protect people and their environment from hazardous chemicals.
Not only has it endorsed the idea that REACH should be clear, but it has made a particular point of calling for rigorous registration, going on, indeed, to propose that chemicals should be registered from a lower limit of 10 kilograms right up to one tonne.
The Women’s Committee wants substitution to be made mandatory, and imported products to be registered as well.
It is in no doubt about its desire for limited registration and demands a clear substitution ...
