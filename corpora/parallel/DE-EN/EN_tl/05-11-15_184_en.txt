Mr President, I should like to extend my warmest thanks to Mr Sacconi for his excellent work.
Unfortunately, however, I have to say that I take a rather less optimistic view than him of the compromise on registration we have before us.
I should also like to congratulate a large number of Members of this House on their clairvoyant powers, since they have voiced their wholehearted support for a priority list of chemical substances even though there is no way of knowing which chemical substances are hazardous and which are not.
I also find it hard to believe those Members who claim that what matters is the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises.
If that is the case, it is hard to understand why some of the amendments and wordings in the compromise work to the disadvantage of these small and medium-sized enterprises.
In my opinion, this is a clear-cut case of Members protecting the interests of big business.
I should like to conclude by drawing the Houseâ€™s attention to a study carried out by the European Trade Union Confederation, which found that 50% of cases of occupational asthma and skin disorders would be prevented by a hard-hitting version of REACH.
A Member pointed out earlier that millions of workers were employed in this sector.
The same Members should be able to work out for themselves what savings would in that case be made by the state and by all of us.
