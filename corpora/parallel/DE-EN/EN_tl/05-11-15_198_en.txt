Mr President, I should like to thank the House for the serious debate that has taken place.
I find it intolerable that an exhibition being held on Parliamentâ€™s premises should include an image of Mr Verheugen poisoning a child while Mr Barroso looks on, and I would call on the Conference of Presidents to remove this poster from Parliament without delay.
