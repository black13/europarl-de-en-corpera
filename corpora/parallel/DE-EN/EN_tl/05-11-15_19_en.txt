Mr President, I very much want to congratulate the Court of Auditors on this report.
In the short time in which it has been available to us, it has become evident to me that it contains much data that provides us with outstanding criteria for what is, in the final analysis, our task â€“ that of giving or withholding discharge.
So often has it been said that the finance ministers have to sign their accounts, but let us consider the areas where it is the Commission alone that has responsibility for what is spent: it is there that we will see terrible things.
In the internal policy sphere, six out of eleven Directors-General are unable to give an unconditional guarantee.
Show me a minister of finance who would do so in their position!
I have never come across one yet.
This outstanding report leads me to press on the Court of Auditors the urgency of our focusing on the directly-managed expenditure and trying to get that absolutely right.
If we do that, we will be much more successful in our dealings with the Member States than we are at present.
