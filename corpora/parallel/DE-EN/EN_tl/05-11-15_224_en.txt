Madam President, Commissioner, we are all aware that developing countries are particularly worthy of our attention and concern.
Yet the question that always occurs to me is why we are not prepared to impose a tax on aviation fuel in the same way that we do on other energy sources, in particular fossil fuels.
Turning to the matter of environmental pollution, I should like to draw the Houseâ€™s attention to the major problems that are sometimes experienced under airport flight paths.
