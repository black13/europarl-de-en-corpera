Madam President, I should like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for his comments, and for his assurance that the report will be balanced.
I should like to put the following supplementary question.
Why is it that the public statements made by yourself and your officials have intimated that a decision has already been taken, and why is there such a rush to grant freedom of movement?
We all agree that freedom of movement is our goal, and we too uphold this fundamental principle of the European Union.
The key issue, however, is ensuring that the concerns of all parties affected are taken seriously.
To repeat my question, therefore, why have you already taken your decision on this matter?
