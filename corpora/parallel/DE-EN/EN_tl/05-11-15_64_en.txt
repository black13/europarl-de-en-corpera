Mr President, having just come through, I find myself momentarily rather beside myself because there is, in the passageway from the Winston Churchill building – through which I have just come – an exhibition that lumps together the termination of pregnancy and concentration camps.
I am outraged that such a thing is again being allowed in the European Parliament.
Even if this exhibition has been authorised, I ask that a stop be put to it at once.
There are pictures there that dishonour all women, and I ask that they be removed right now.
