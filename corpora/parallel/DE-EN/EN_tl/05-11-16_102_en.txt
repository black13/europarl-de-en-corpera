No more must the EU promote nuclear power, as the Euratom Treaty specifies that it must.
When the EU, exceptionally, calls for the decommissioning of nuclear power station in order to protect human life and the environment, as it did in the case of the Slovak Bohunice V1 reactor, such demands are deserving of support, even if the distinction drawn by the Commission between the ‘good’ reactors in the West and the ‘dangerous’ ones in Eastern Europe is an untenable one.
The initially high level of support is appropriate to a purposeful start to the decommissioning process, as the Slovak Republic has accumulated funds amounting to only EUR 320 million.
The support is in line with undertakings given at the time of Slovakia’s accession to the EU.
Were it not for support from the EU, there would be cause for concern that the reactors at Bohunice V1 would continue in operation, which would entail serious security risks.
Without EU funding, it might well also not be possible to ensure that decommissioning measures would be taken promptly in order to protect human life and the environment.
The use of EU funds should, however, be limited to the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 reactors and to the measures accompanying it.
An addition should be made to this effect to Article 2 of the Commission proposal, which should also specify the EU’s priorities for the use of such funds, including, , the maintenance of safety standards in the course of decommissioning and the achievement of the climate change goals through the promotion of renewable energies.
