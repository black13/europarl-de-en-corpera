Mr President, I would like to make a statement of vote in respect of the Wijkman report, which, in essence, I very much welcome.
It is unfortunate that the adoption of Mr Vidal-Quadras Rocaâ€™s amendment means that the derogation for nuclear energy is now deleted.
That I regard as false, since I do not regard nuclear energy as a realistic alternative for the future and believe that the risks associated with it are not yet manageable.
It is for that reason that I, along with my colleagues as a whole, have voted against the report.
We have nothing against it as such, but it could have been more clear in coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is no alternative.
