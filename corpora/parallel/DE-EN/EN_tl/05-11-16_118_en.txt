Mr President, the minutes record a dispute between Mrs Gröner and myself about Mr Giertych’s anti-abortion exhibition.
The acting President stated that there would be no censorship.
Since then, though, the exhibition has been removed, and so there has been.
I would like to point out that there is also, in the building, an anti-REACH exhibition, in which the President of the Commission is depicted poisoning a child.
I regard that as controversial in a way in which Mr Giertych’s exhibition is not.
If you are going to use ‘controversial’ as a justification for removing displays, then both of them ought to go.
I do believe, though, that nothing should be taken down, and that discussion, rather than censorship, should be the order of the day.
