Mr President, if I may say so, Mr President-in-Office, the Hampton Court Summit was the biggest embarrassment that any Presidency has ever come up with.
Far from making progress with the pressing problems of the Financial Perspective and the debate on the Constitution, these items were removed from the agenda.
Even its chosen theme of ‘Social Europe’ was one to which the Summit found itself unable to do justice.
There was no discussion of any of the policy instruments for a social Europe, whether minimum standards, labour legislation or the means whereby unemployment and social exclusion may be done away with.
What you have proposed, Mr Straw, is particularism, and does nothing to advance the cause of social Europe.
Instead of action, you offer only ideas; instead of pro-active measures to address globalisation, you have come up with knee-jerk responses like this idea for an anti-shock fund.
Our aim, though, must not be the creation of a backward-looking Europe, but rather of a Europe that can face the future with confidence.
