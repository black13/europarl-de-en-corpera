Mr President, the report on Iraq, on which we are currently engaged in voting, is perhaps one that would otherwise appear among the also-rans, but it is important in that in it, Parliament, the Council and the Commission together are demonstrating that the European institutions are capable of responding quickly and in the public interest.
It was late last night – just before midnight – that this report was debated.
While every moment in this House is an important one, I do believe that we – that is, the services and we Members – should all ensure that such important legislative reports, the adoption of which is in the public interest, are debated at better hours of the day, so as to send a clear message to the outside world.
