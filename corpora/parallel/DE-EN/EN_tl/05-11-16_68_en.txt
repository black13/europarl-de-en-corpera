.
Mr President, I would like to make a statement on this vote.
Now that this House has voted by a large majority to make out, without any money behind it, a cheque for EUR 400 million, which may well, without reliable calculations, find its way into the coffers of the Italian energy conglomerates, I now urge you to vote against my report.
I regard that decision that this House has taken today as utterly irresponsible.
In the belief it would be more right to follow the Commissionâ€™s line, I ask you to vote against my own report, from which I will, in any event, be withdrawing my signature, believing as I do that cheques with nothing to back them up are of no use in gaining acceptance for European policy or in buying safety for atomic energy.
I am sorry to have to say this, but I do believe that the House is extremely ill-advised if a majority in it can vote to accept these false promises.
