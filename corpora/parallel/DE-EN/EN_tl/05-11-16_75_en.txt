Mr President, I find there are problems with the versions in different languages.
In the German version, there is reference to ‘’ – two seats or bases, but that is nonsense, as, according to the Treaty, Parliament is based only in Strasbourg.
That was decided long ago.
The English version makes reference to ‘double location’, with Brussels as the second ‘location’; it is one we can happily do away with, but then the translation has to be right.
I therefore ask you to compare the two language versions with one another.
