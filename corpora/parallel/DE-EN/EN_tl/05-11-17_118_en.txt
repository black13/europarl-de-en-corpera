. – Mr President, the fact that we are holding this debate at this hour and with so few of us present does indeed seem to indicate what value we attach to policy on Africa.
Some of the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on its opinion on this report was very lively, but it did eventually adopt it unanimously.
It is unfortunate that there was later majority support for a Conservative motion that there be no demand for a debate on the role of colonialism, which I believe would be important in the African context.
Among other things, our opinion states that fundamental human rights should be respected when dealing with refugees and illegal immigrants on the EU’s African borders, which I recently visited with a delegation.
There one sees concrete evidence of the means currently adopted by the EU to combat poverty, in the shape of fences and walls, and that is highly problematic.
In our opinion, we call for a debate on the social responsibilities of governments and businesses as an integral part of the new Africa strategy, to which the Commission certainly needs to make some improvements.
Our opinion also addresses the need for the proposed cuts in measures to combat HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis to be reversed, and stresses the importance of promoting peace and conflict resolution in Africa, with consequent specific reference to the control of weapons exports, which we debated yesterday.
This prompts me to mention that I have taken note of the speech made by Commissioner Michel to the Parliamentary Assembly of the WEU on 21 September, in which he said that EUR 250 million for African troops was to be taken from the development budget.
That I regard as the wrong way to go about it, and I warn the EU against conflating its security or military policies with its policy on development.
