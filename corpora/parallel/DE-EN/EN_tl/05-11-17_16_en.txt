Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot join with the majority that has endorsed the system of approval, and it is for this reason that we have voted against it.
What can be adduced in the report’s defence is what it has to say about registration, which was accepted by a broad qualified majority – the only important block and the most important issue to be adopted by qualified majority here in this House.
This is a decision that will carry weight both in the Council and in the Commission.
It is only with that in mind, and explicitly rejecting the approval, which we know will be corrected by the Council, that I vote in favour of the report.
