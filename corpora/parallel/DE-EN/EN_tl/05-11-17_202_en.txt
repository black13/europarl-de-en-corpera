â€“ Mr President, I am very definitely opposed to the vote being adjourned.
I would also like to make it clear that Mr Wijkman was not speaking on behalf of this group, and have now done so.
Mrs Martens is herself in favour of her report being voted on.
What is scandalous, then, is not that 79 votes are enough to adopt it, but that the others are not present.
It is those who are present who will vote, and that is in order.
