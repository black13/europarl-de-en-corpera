â€“ Mr President, I believe that the REACH compromise is a text that will serve as a good basis for negotiations with the Council.
My group and I have voted in favour of the part on authorisation being adopted, and we did so, even though we are opposed to temporary authorisation for substances being restricted to five years.
We wish to state in this regard that we are, in principle, in favour of this block, but would have welcomed it if these five years had been deleted, since decision-making on a case-by-case basis is vastly preferable and would be much easier for the industry to manage.
On the whole, though, we have achieved something unprecedented up to now, namely a degree of environmental protection that is unique in the world.
