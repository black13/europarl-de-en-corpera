I should like to clarify, at the end of this vote, that I have voted in favour of Mr Sacconiâ€™s report solely in order to express my endorsement of the compromise on registration worked out by the rapporteur and myself.
I certainly do not wish to express my approval of its other aspects, most especially not of the approach adopted towards authorisation, since I firmly repudiate the idea that the authorisation of substances should be limited.
