Mr President, there are certain matters to which I beg you, or the President of this House, to give your attention, and they are as follows.
There are major problems in this Parliament’s delegation in the EU/FYROM – that is to say, Macedonia – Joint Parliamentary Committee, and, while I do not wish to criticise the personal qualities of its chairman, Mr Georgios Papastamkos, it has to be said that it is he – particularly on the occasion of the committee’s meeting on 29 November – who has often been the cause of them.
On that occasion, he not only criticised and interrupted the ambassador of FYROM – a man with whom we are on good terms – but even, and in the course of the meeting, shouted at him.
It is quite impossible for us to instruct an ambassador as to how to describe his own country.
He calls it Macedonia, as indeed do many Members of this House, and that is something that even the chairman of this delegation must accept.
The members of my group will find it quite utterly impossible to work with the delegation’s present chairman unless he mends his ways and affirms his willingness to abide by the customs of this House and maintain a respectful and courteous attitude.
I ask you, Mr President, to ensure that he does so, failing which we will have to ask the representatives of the European People’s Party to find another chairman, and, as a matter of urgency, that we may be enabled to uphold diplomacy and the customs of this House, and continue to show to a country with which we are on friendly terms the respect that is its rightful due.
