Mr President, caution is the right approach; there is no room either in rational politics or in the taking of appropriate precautions for the kind of panic mongering and hysteria we have heard many times today.
The attribution of guilt to one party is just as wrong-headed as, for example, making wild birds responsible for the spread of this disease, for which science has shown and demonstrated other causes.
This has, so far, been more of a media event than a medical one in the true sense of the word, if one compares it with many other developments and worse diseases.
It does nevertheless need to be prevented, and the Commission cannot be often enough praised for its rational and balanced response.
We do indeed need to carry on keeping a watchful eye on how things develop, and I hope that all those affected will be involved in the monitoring process.
It is a matter of absolute necessity that this should include those who live and work on the ground, including, for example, those engaged in hunting, who have the requisite knowledge and are the first to come into contact with wild birds.
With this in mind, I hope that the report by Mr Parish, who has done a good job, will be adopted tomorrow, and would like once again to congratulate the Commission on its level-headed attitude.
