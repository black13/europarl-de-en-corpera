Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Van Hecke’s amendment makes a tangible improvement to the Commission’s draft regulation to the benefit of developing countries, and for that he is of course to be thanked.
My group does, nevertheless, have a problem with the regulation.
While it is intended to incorporate and implement the 30 August resolution of the WTO General Council, it has, today, already become evident that the agreed system for the handling of patented medicines will not be workable in practice.
This has been confirmed by respected international organisations with experience of diseases – ‘Médecins sans Frontières’ and ‘Act Up’ for example – and proven by practical experience in such countries as Canada.
The compulsory licensing system is cumbersome – so much so as to make the provision of development aid and effective help in the fight against Aids epidemics impossible.
Even if the 30 August resolution softens the impact of the TRIPS Agreement on the health field, we still do not see the fundamental human right to health as being given priority.
It is for that reason that my group will find it difficult to vote in favour even of an improved development draft.
