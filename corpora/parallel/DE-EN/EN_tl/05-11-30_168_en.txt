Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for this regulation is intended to facilitate compulsory licences for the manufacture of medicines destined for countries with public health problems.
What is regrettable about this debate is that some Members – particularly in the lead committee – keep trying to point the finger of suspicion at the medical research industry, and hence also at those who deal with patents, with unwarranted insinuations that they are indifferent to people in poorer parts of the world.
Patents do not stand in the way of humanitarian action – the contrary is the case, for without them, innovative companies are unable to take on high levels of financial risk and invest billions in research and development.
It is only by means of such investments that medicines can be developed that can, for example, keep pace with the constant changes in certain pathogens.
That benefits not only us in Europe, but also people in every country throughout the world.
Were there no patents, medicines and vaccinations against many fatal diseases would never have been developed – medicines and vaccinations now within the reach of everyone, including of course people in the developing world.
Compulsory licensing is no solution to the problem of how to combat diseases in developing countries.
More effective control and better setting of priorities would make it possible for billions given for development and humanitarian purposes, but then misdirected, to be used to buy adequate supplies of medicines.
If we want to take the Lisbon Strategy seriously, that is to say, if we want to move research and development forward, we need an effective protection for patents that cannot be weakened or set aside at will.
TRIPS may well make compulsory licences possible, but they are not a necessity, for there are alternatives to them.
