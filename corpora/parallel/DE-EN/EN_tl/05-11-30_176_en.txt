Mr President, I particularly want to thank the rapporteur for the great deal of work he has put in and also to say that my group endorses his report.
It was, of course, in 1994 that this House began the practice of hearings for those nominated to the Commission, and it was in 2004 at the latest that the public became aware of just how important the thorough examination of candidates for the office of Commissioner is, and above all of the fact that this House is not a governmental rubber-stamp.
The report provides Parliament with an important array of instruments for the future, and spells out in more precise terms what its rights are when it comes to the choice of the Commission.
I particularly want to stress the fact that we will in future have clear criteria for the assessment of candidates, those being indubitable independence, knowledge of the relevant portfolio and, in particular, complete disclosure of all information on their financial interests.
If, in future, Parliament acts in accordance with these guidelines, it will certainly benefit the credibility of both institutions in the eyes of the public.
