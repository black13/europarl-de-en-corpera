Mr President, I rise to speak with reference to Rule 134 of the Rules of Procedure, or, should that not prove appropriate, to Rule 167, while also relying on Rule 171.
I ask that an addition be made to the agenda in the shape of a statement by the Commission on the decision by the Slovak Government to again place the police, in certain areas of their duties, under military jurisdiction, or of a statement following an inquiry into whether this decision by the Slovak Government is compatible with Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, which makes explicit provision for all citizens of the European Union to enjoy the freedom to organise themselves in trade unions and guarantees them the full exercise of their rights as members of one.
The consequence of this decision by the Slovak Government is that the police in Slovakia are to a large degree unable to exercise these rights.
For example, a Slovak police officer taking part in a demonstration aimed, by way of his trade union rights, at improving his working hours or his income can be made subject to martial law, and this we regard as a violation of his essential and fundamental right as a citizen of the EU on the part of the government of a Member State.
That is not acceptable.
We ask that the Commission should deliver to this House a statement on this state of affairs.
