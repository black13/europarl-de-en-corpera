Mr President, I am much obliged to you for again allowing me to take the floor, since this House does not exist to listen to the Commissionâ€™s estimation of our thinking.
What we wanted to do in the first place was to resolve a point of order.
I refer to Rule 134, which deals with additions to the agenda, and I ask that one such be made in the shape of a statement by the Commission on the matter referred to earlier.
