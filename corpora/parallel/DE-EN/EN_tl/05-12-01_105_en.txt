I reject the resolution, in the version jointly agreed and submitted, on the preparations for the 6th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Hong Kong.
The demands and arguments contained therein are too narrow and I would like to see its demands in respect of the social dimension in the WTO go much further.
The Doha round should include consideration of such non-trade-related issues as society, the environment and culture.
Internationally recognised social minimum standards should not be regarded as a form of trade protectionism; on the contrary, they make ‘fairer’ trade possible, given that there is an interaction between trade and social affairs.
In my view, fair and just economic and social development are dependent upon the incorporation, as binding provisions, of minimum labour norms in the WTO Agreements.
The prohibition of child labour, the right of men and women to receive equal pay, the abolition of forced labour, the legitimacy of trade unions and what is termed the freedom to conclude collective agreements are among the most fundamental minimum labour standards, and the ILO requires most countries to implement them already.
If a fair system of world trade is to be developed, binding minimum labour norms such as these, along with compliance with international environmental standards, must be given parity alongside the prevailing WTO trade law.
Laying down stipulated labour norms can have nothing but a positive effect on a country’s economy, and they must not be regarded as a hindrance.
