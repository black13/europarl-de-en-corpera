Mr President, most of the previous speakers have demonstrated that the way this matter is being handled is unprofessional, betrays an irresponsible attitude towards market participants – both businesses and their customers – and makes for more uncertainty than clarity.
There does not appear, to my mind, to be any security to plan ahead, nor do either the Council or the Commission appear to have done enough of their homework.
Had they done so, there would not be in the timetable such a mishmash of reports, deferments and extensions of provisional arrangements, without any real solution being found.
In German, the word has a dual meaning: it is associated not only with taxation but also with steering.
Taxes steer.
Taxation policy is a political instrument for steering the economy, and if there is not greater clarity about it at European level, if we are not given more powers to deal with it, if there is no wide-ranging debate about it, if we are not given a uniform basis of assessment for the taxation of businesses, if we do not close the tax loopholes, if there are no uniform tax arrangements for occupational pension schemes – then we will be unable to achieve many of our policy objectives for growth and employment, for we will not be in possession of the wherewithal to do so.
I therefore call for a comprehensive debate on taxation – one, moreover, that is not limited to individual aspects of the subject.
What I advocate is a long-term approach to taxation, something that is agreed between the Member States rather than put together at three minutes to twelve, is eventually extended and therefore fails to achieve any solution.
Both examples show us that the outcome of what we are debating now will be no more than a provisional arrangement that will get us no further forward.
