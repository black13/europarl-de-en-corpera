Mr President, this is a two-spheres issue.
It appears that, in Slovakia, the police were returned to military jurisdiction, which amounts to remilitarisation and is not acceptable.
The police and the armed forces are, to put it quite simply, two different pairs of boots.
It has to be said, though, that it is precisely this sort of confusion between the civilian and military spheres that is characteristic of the European Union when it deploys the military or the police abroad.
The forthcoming Austrian presidency has gone so far as to define this as one of its priorities.
Secondly, there is also, in this context, the issue of the limitation of police officersâ€™ trade union rights, which is not acceptable either.
This House always makes a big thing of the violation of human rights in countries outside the European Union, but it also needs to call by their proper name manifest infringements of human rights within the European Union, and this is where your statement, Commissioner, did not go far enough: there is room for improvements here, and it is in this area that you need to make them; it is about this that you need to provide more information.
Nor should we be reticent about highlighting human rights abuses in other countries; I will give you one example from Germany, for there, too, people are currently being excluded from certain jobs and there is excessive police violence and this needs to be said openly in this House.
