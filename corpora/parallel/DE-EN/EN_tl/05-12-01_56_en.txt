Mr President, item 4f has to do with the composition of the boards of directors of the European agencies.
The text reads as follows:
‘Parliament, for its part, should two representatives to the board of directors’.
I propose that it should read as follows:
‘Parliament, for its part, should two representatives to the board of directors’.
What is the justification for this?
Although Parliament, being part of the legislative power, should not claim the right to have two official representatives in all executive agencies subordinate to it, it should retain the right to delegate trusted experts to agencies of its choice, as it does with the European Environmental Agency in Copenhagen or the Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna.
My amendment enjoys the support of the draftsman of this paragraph, Mr Florenz of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and also of the rapporteur on the regulatory agencies, Mr Papastamkos.
I ask for the House’s backing for it.
