Mr President, one consequence of the lack of a single strategy for tax is that the standard of the state’s welfare provision at the heart of Europe can no longer be maintained, and this is becoming more and more the prime cause for jobs being moved elsewhere and lost to us.
Harmonising the regulations in trade and tax law relating to the calculation of profits must now be given high priority.
Nowadays, even tax experts can get no overview of what businesses that operate across national borders are actually doing.
The tax bases must be harmonised; the business tax systems must not only be harmonised but must also become transparent and comparable, and fiscal giveaways and special enterprise zones, which have lost any connection with fiscal competition, must become things of the past.
The Council can no longer look on from the political grandstand while we cope with the unhealthy distortions of competition that result, to an ever-increasing extent, from its fiscal policies.
One could just about cope with what Ireland is doing, but Ireland multiplied ten- or twelve-fold would be too much; who, Commissioner, is to foot the bill for this – the workers?
