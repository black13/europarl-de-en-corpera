Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to take this opportunity today to say something about the debate that the Commission has instigated – a term that I use deliberately – on the Austrian ban on the use of wild animals in circuses.
Paragraph 27 of the Austrian federal law on the protection of animals stipulates that no wild animal species may be kept by circuses, variety shows and similar forms of entertainment or used by them in performances.
Far from congratulating Austria on doing something positive and taking the lead in this area, the Commission’s response was to send the Austrian Government an admonitory letter, in which it threatened to overturn the ban on circuses keeping wild animals – imposed not only by Austria but also applying to some degree in other EU Member States – on the grounds that the ban on performances by wild animals went against the free movement of services.
One would have thought that the protection of animals was meant to be a value that was in the general interest and that this would be an argument justifying a restriction on the free movement of services.
Traditional circuses are not meant to be founded upon the use of animals; there are highly celebrated circuses that manage to draw the crowds without performances by wild animals.
Priority must be given to the protection and well-being of animals, whether we are talking in terms of the keeping of wild animals by circuses or the conditions under which animals are transported, which defy description.
