Mr President, let me start by expressing profuse thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Wallis.
There are various members of the Legal Affairs Committee who deal with immunity cases, but I believe that this case was a particularly difficult and delicate one, which demanded very careful consideration on the Committee’s part; nor do I believe, if I read the signs rightly, that this was particularly easy for her personally.
We, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, supported the rapporteur’s conclusions.
We too believe that the immunity conferred by membership of this House should not apply in this case.
I would also like to add a personal observation.
What was once the Mauthausen concentration camp is situated on my home patch, which is also my electoral district.
If you still have any doubts about whether these concentration camps actually existed, I am more than willing to invite you to join me on a visit to it.
You will find people who survived it still living in the area; where I come from is also home to people who helped the few who managed to escape from it; one woman who did so is being honoured here today.
I would like these remarks to be taken as honouring her memory.
