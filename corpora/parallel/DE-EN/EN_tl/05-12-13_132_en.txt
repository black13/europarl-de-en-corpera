Mr President, our concern, in the Fourtou report, was with events in Spain, and specifically in the region of Valencia, where many European citizens have felt themselves very unfairly treated in consequence of poorly-framed regional legislation and its faulty interpretation on the part of the regional, local and state authorities.
It is to be welcomed that the Valencian regional authorities have taken a very cooperative attitude towards and are even now amending the law.
The new law is in the process of being drafted.
We should make it plain that the European Parliament is not competent to deal with the annulment of poorly-drafted local legislation.
We must, of course, intervene in those cases in which European law is affected, but this House is not responsible for everything.
