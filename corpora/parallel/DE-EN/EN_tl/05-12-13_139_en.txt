Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just voted on the Bersani report, which I, as shadow rapporteur, had a part in guiding through this House.
The report represents a good compromise between those who want the European Union to have more powers in fiscal affairs, and those who do not, be it in relation to the tax base for businesses or to the rate at which businesses are taxed.
Even while we were voting, though, I was informed that the European Court of Justice has handed down a ruling in the case of Marks [amp] Spencer.
The situation now is that this company, in the United Kingdom, can, by way of consolidation, consolidate gains and losses from Europe, and the United Kingdom will have to pay the firm tens of millions.
I do not wish to discuss the caseâ€™s merits, but only to make it plain that what we want is a single system of law, with laws made, as they are now, by this Parliament and by us as its members.
Here we have, yet again, a case of law made by judges, the fundamentals of which need to be debated.
I do not believe that this is what the future of the European Union should be like.
