Mr President, I wish to ask for clarification.
You stated that Amendments 1 and 2, which we voted on by roll call, had been rejected, but you also said that we needed a qualified majority.
I have counted the votes against, and 328 votes do not add up to a qualified majority.
I ask you to clarify which procedure we are now using.
