Mr President, this is not actually an intervention in favour, but just an expression of the opinion of my committee, which is in favour.
I would just ask, further to what Mr Ford said, that the Commission and the Council be urged, when moving urgency debates, not only to explain why they are matters of urgency, but also why the motion for an urgency debate is being tabled only now.
The situation really does need to be avoided in which a considerable period of time goes by before a motion for an urgency debate is tabled, without, perhaps, it being necessary.
Perhaps you or the Bureau might ask the Commission and the Council to justify this practice.
