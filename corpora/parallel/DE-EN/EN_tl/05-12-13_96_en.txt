Mr President, one of the important objectives of European environmental policy is the prompt introduction into the EU of systems for collecting batteries.
It is unfortunate that Amendment 26 was not accepted, and the target we are now setting ourselves is a certainly less ambitious one.
The fact is, though, that the introduction of recycling quotas will enable us to achieve very high environmental standards, and we will be able to reuse raw materials.
The bans on nickel, cadmium and lead are also means towards this end, enabling us to exert pressure in favour of the replacement of hazardous substances, while nonetheless allowing a small number of exceptions.
