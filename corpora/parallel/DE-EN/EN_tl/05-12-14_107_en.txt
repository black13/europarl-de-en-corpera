Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was in response to the terrible images from Abu Ghraib, if not before, that a debate was unleashed in the USA too as to what was or was not permissible in legitimate war on terrorism.
I would like, on behalf of my group, to reiterate what has been said by the others.
We welcome the efforts made by Senator McCain and others like him in the US Congress towards the outlawing of torture.
Torture is an un-American activity; at the same time, though, it has no place in Europe either, and so it is legitimate to ask why a country such as Switzerland, on seven occasions, refused to allow military aircraft to overfly its territory, evidently suspecting that they were carrying prisoners illegally.
What is it about these other countries?
What information have they had from their secret service?
Why is it that, so far, only the Danish Foreign Ministry has acted consistently in stating that actions contrary to international conventions will not be permitted in Danish airspace?
What are all the other European countries doing?
We serve as a role model for other countries around the world in which there is no democracy and in which human rights are under threat.
We have to be an example to them, and at all times!
