Mr President, yesterday, the Council of Europe’s investigator Dick Marty stated that the suspicion had been confirmed that the CIA had, on many occasions, used European states’ airspace and territory to transport prisoners to interrogation at secret locations.
This reinforces my conviction that our Parliament must, without delay, appoint a committee to investigate all such accusations.
The very gravest of charges, relating to the abduction and torture of human beings, have been laid against the United States and Member States of the European Union; that much is in the public domain.
As the Commissioner has called for evidence, I will ask him whether the case of Khaled El Masri, a German citizen, does not itself speak volumes.
Neither the US administration nor the European governments concerned have, to date, come up with an appropriate response.
For the sake of the public at large, for the sake of the EU’s credibility as an international advocate for respect for human rights, it is vital that these things be cleared up once and for all.
There must be no no-go areas in the European Union!
As representatives of the citizens of the European Union, we are under an obligation to shed light where there is darkness.
The fact is that what is at stake here is nothing more or less than the defence of the most fundamental values upon which the European Union rests.
The prohibition of torture is among those minimum human rights standards that every state must observe most stringently; it is part of binding international law, and it is one of the core values of the European Union.
If the government of a Member State gave active assistance to, or even merely abetted, the USA’s abduction of people, as part of the so-called war on terror, in order that they might be tortured in secret locations, then that government has abandoned the fundamental consensus on which the European Union rests and on which membership of it depends, and that is what must be examined in minute detail.
