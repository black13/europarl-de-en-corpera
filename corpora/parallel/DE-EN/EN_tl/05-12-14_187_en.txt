Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, can you confirm that, according to the Treaties, the European Parliament has one single seat?
The fact is that it is wrong to describe it as having two.
That single seat is Strasbourg.
We could well, without further ado, do away with the mini-plenaries in Brussels and would thereby save an enormous amount of energy, since we could, in the weeks left to us, stay at home and get the work out of the way on Fridays here in Strasbourg.
