Mr President, there can be no doubt that Decision 2004/465/EC, on a Community financial contribution towards Member States’ fisheries control programmes, has helped to improve both control structures and the provision of funding for controls in the individual Member States, and to make the flow of information more efficient.
It has also made it possible to confer greater powers on EU inspectors in the field of monitoring and control.
Control programmes are always and everywhere regarded as a nuisance, and often as discrimination, by those who have to undergo the controls.
It is an unfortunate fact, however, that controls on fishing activities under the common fisheries policy are indispensable, as we have learnt from experience.
The success of any legal framework depends on the effectiveness and ease of controls on compliance with the rules it lays down.
It goes without saying that the measures carried out in the framework of these control programmes cost money, and that the necessary funding should accordingly be provided for them.
We therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal to extend the period of validity of Decision 2004/465/EC by one year.
This would safeguard the Community financial contribution towards the fisheries control programmes at least until the end of 2006, even if the budgetary environment changes.
We concur with the rapporteur’s assessment of the amendments outlined by the Commission in the proposal for a decision, and we should also like to thank him.
