Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, many aspects of our cooperation with the British Presidency have gone well; the problem is that you risk giving this sort of cooperation a bad name if you fail to put together a proper and realistic Budget.
It was you who spoke of a realistic Budget.
There are just two points I would like to touch on, and briefly.
You yourself come from a region that has managed – not least with the help of European support grants – to move away from agriculture to being a leader in research and development.
Why do you now want to deny that to other regions by making massive cuts in this modern funding for research and development, or by not creating the conditions for them in an enlarged Union?
That leads me on to the issue of enlargement.
I share your view that we should negotiate with Turkey, and that the creation of a greater Europe, one that included Turkey, would be a good thing.
Do you think it realistic to pursue an enlargement strategy, as the British Presidency is doing, with a Budget like this one and this sort of financial perspective?
Do you think it realistic that this enlargement should include the countries of the Balkans?
Such a thing is not credible, and the public will not accept it.
That is why I find your proposal incomprehensible.
After all, you cannot achieve your own objectives, which both you and Mr Blair have defended, and so the only thing I can do is urge you to change your mind, and come back with a Budget proposal that is realistic in the truest sense of the word, while also taking some sort of account of Europeans’ hopes and aspirations.
What you have put before us so far is unacceptable either to this House or to the people of Europe!
