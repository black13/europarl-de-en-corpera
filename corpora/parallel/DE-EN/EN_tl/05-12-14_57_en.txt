Mr President, this is probably the wrong time to discuss the content of this proposal in detail, but I would like to say that I have received hundreds of e-mails – not sent in bulk, but individually written messages – and 58 000 verified signatures from members of the public right across Europe, giving vent to their grave concerns.
So much for the alleged great public longing for data retention!
The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has taken these objections seriously and, by means of its amendments, balanced freedom and security against one another.
The accumulated pressure of time does not, however, justify the ways in which some elements are attempting to proceed.
If this project matters to the European public and is not meant to be just a favour done for the British Presidency of the Council, then we should proceed with caution, for if we do not, we will be fostering the prejudicial belief that the Council only has to call on Parliament to jump for this House to ask in reply ‘how high?’
Under high-pressure conditions, that is the sort of thing that can happen.
It is high pressure that enables nature, over the course of millions of years, to produce the most marvellous diamonds.
Put a lemon under high pressure, though, and in no time at all, all that will be left is juice and pulp.
Whether this House is to be a diamond or a lemon depends on us, so, in order that it may remain a diamond, I ask you to join with me in endorsing the amendments tabled by your committee.
