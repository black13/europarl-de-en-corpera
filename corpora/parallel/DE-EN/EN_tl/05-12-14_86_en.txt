After carefully examining my conscience, I have voted in favour of the report,
- in the hope that the authorities will use the data only in accordance with our stipulations,
- in the knowledge that the concept of a ‘court order’ is not to be found in all Member States,
- in the knowledge that this House has largely removed the teeth from what was put before it by the Council and the Commission, and
- out of the conviction that civil rights will be adequately protected by Parliament.
After two years, I shall be demanding to see statistics on the authorities’ access to data.
