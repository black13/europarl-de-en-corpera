Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude to the House for the endorsement given to this written statement by some 400 Members.
There has been support across all party and national boundaries for the idea that there should be one telephone number in Europe that children can call in order to express their worries and needs.
In so doing, we are giving hundreds and thousands of disadvantaged children a great big Christmas present, and I hope that the Commission is listening very carefully to this appeal.
I hope that we will not leave it at that, but that the worries and needs of the weakest members of our society will continue to spur us into action.
My warm thanks to all those who have made this commitment and will continue to do so in future.
