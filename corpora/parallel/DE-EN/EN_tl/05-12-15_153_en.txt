Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is unfortunate that we have to keep on drawing the attention of this House to the human rights situation in China, and, much though Europeans would like to see that situation improve so as to enable us to maintain intact and fruitful relations with China, it would appear to have been getting much, much worse recently.
Again and again, we come up against the problem that the Dalai Lama is treated as a separatist, even though he has always explicitly supported the ‘one China’ policy, does not support any secessionist movements, and even though his own requests for negotiations on autonomy are couched in the most pacific terms.
The second point I would like to make is that monasteries are now being used as places where pressure is exerted not only on monks, but also on the general population, in an attempt to re-educate them, and it is because this sort of thing is unacceptable under any circumstances that I ask you to vote in favour of this resolution.
