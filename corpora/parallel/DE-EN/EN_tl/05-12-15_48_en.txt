Mr President, I have no desire to hold up proceedings, but, as this is the last vote at which Members will be present in large numbers, I would like, on behalf of my group – and, I take it, also on behalf of all Members of the House – to thank the services most warmly for preparing the difficult votes that we have had over the past year.
They have done a splendid job and made our work easier.
We want to wish them a happy festive season and ask them to be just as helpful next year too.
