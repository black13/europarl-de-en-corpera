Mr President, the Commissioner and the young team that he put together before the Hong Kong negotiations have failed to balance market access for agricultural products here in Europe against that for industrial products in the countries of the developing world.
The countries of the developing world had good reason to reject your liberalising tendencies, and you were perhaps little more than ridiculous in the eyes of the global public when you then failed to put a long-overdue stop to export subsidies.
We are offering the countries of the developing world a very great deal of market access; the only point at issue is what conditions we impose.
What comes into play here is qualification, participation at our price level and to our standards, so that these countries’ economies can develop.
Where the developing world’s access to the market in industrial products and services from our part of the world is concerned, it is vital that these countries’ development – in commerce, in infrastructure and services should not be wrecked or made impossible; instead that they should be enabled to qualify, in this area too, as service providers who will benefit these countries’ development.
Then perhaps we can talk in terms of a development round.
I hope that you will think these things through again and give priority to qualification when working through the next round.
