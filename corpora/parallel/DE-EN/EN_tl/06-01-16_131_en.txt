Mr President, I would like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for what he has said, and also to start with a critical observation on our negotiating position as Europeans, for I do believe that we were too honest, in that our position fundamentally repudiated deviousness as part of the negotiating mandate.
I think we need to reconsider this, since all the others used subterfuges.
We did not, instead preferring to put our outcomes on the table very early on.
On the credit side, I would like to point out that your negotiating style and the way in which you communicated information to this House helped reinforce our determination, and for that you have our warm thanks.
That has of course enabled us to influence the budget deliberations in Brussels, and that I regarded as a very good thing.
Where geographical designations of origin were concerned, we got nowhere.
That is something you mentioned, and many speakers have also made it clear how important an issue this is for us.
I have to tell the Commissioner that our geographical designations of origin and the intellectual property that is tied in with them are things for which we have to fight.
In doing that, we will have to be cunning and maintain a united front.
