Mr President, Commissioner, the Hong Kong round is over, and where does the WTO go now?
While it is indeed the case that nothing concrete has been achieved, it has to be said that the lines of communication are not down, and that, under these circumstances, I regard as psychologically very important.
The points I would like to make today have more to do with the general situation.
For a start, Commissioner, you have made very good use of the negotiating mandate that you were given.
There was general praise for the way in which the EU, for once, achieved something by acting absolutely as one, even though we were to some extent forced into a corner.
More is, however, expected of us than of the other industrial states.
Secondly, you collaborated extremely well with this House, seeing it almost as a matter of obligation to inform us, whether in person or through others.
There is always room for improvement in anything, but we really did get very extensive information and involving us in the work going on was done very well.
The question is, though, whether that is enough, and how things can be done in the future.
I believe that Parliament’s rights in foreign trade matters need to be reinforced as a matter of urgency, and that this is a quite separate matter from the constitutional treaty.
As globalisation goes further and deeper, the policy areas associated with external trade become ever more important.
When a policy area becomes important to the public, the public’s elected representatives need to be able to have their say about it, and that is why we need to be able to have more influence over the Commission and be able to monitor it more closely.
In saying this, I am looking into the future rather than criticising the work they are doing now.
