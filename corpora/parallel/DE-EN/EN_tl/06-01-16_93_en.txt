Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mrs Prets for her report and would like to take it as an opportunity to highlight an issue that will be of particular concern to us this year.
Major sporting events also offer an opportunity to engage in the people-trafficking business, in which women are forced into prostitution.
In sport, there is a constant emphasis on fairness and consideration for others, but if, on the occasion of the football world cup, the football supporters are offered brothels like the ones in Berlin, that is when I shall waste no time in spoiling the game.
The trafficking in women and children, along with forced prostitution, must be banned, prosecuted and impeded, both nationally and at the European level.
Let all those who are unwilling to take action against it be shown the red card!
