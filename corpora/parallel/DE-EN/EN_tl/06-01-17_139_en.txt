Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that the way the talks are going between Ukraine and Russia makes it unmistakeably plain that Europe – which is more than just the European Union – needs a new and modern all-embracing energy policy.
While one can debate the point to one’s heart’s content, the dispute between Russia and Ukraine was, at the end of the day, one between a supplier who wanted more money, and a customer who was unwilling to pay up.
Both sides in the dispute had known that for ages.
If, so to speak, a political course is set that makes this sort of crisis inevitable, without the attempt being made to find a solution in good time, then both governments have been negligent.
Although I do indeed welcome the Commissioner’s announcement that a Green Paper will be appearing, I do of course hope that it will not contain such old ideas as the negotiation of codes of conduct for the countries by which energy is produced and those through which it passes, new pipelines or even nuclear power.
Rather, I believe that we have to rely, as is already being done in many countries, on other sources, such as biomass, the sun, wind, water, geothermal energy and cogeneration, while also, at the same time, saving energy, making more efficient use of it, and reducing subsidies for long-established fossil fuels.
That is something we have to bring about.
The supply of energy is a service of public general interest, and we ought perhaps to consider whether responsible policies ought not to be regarded as a higher priority than attempts at liberalisation or the use of liberalisation measures as a solution to this problem.
