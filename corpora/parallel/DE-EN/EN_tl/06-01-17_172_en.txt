Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to express my particular thanks to the rapporteur for his work.
I can support this compromise, which was reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development following intensive discussions and negotiations; but at the same time we have to be aware of the impact these three reports have on European agriculture in general and beet farmers in particular, and on the sugar industry.
The sugar sector is an example of the extent of the WTO’s influence on the economies of individual States, and also on that of the EU as a whole.
The Agriculture Committee has succeeded in moderating quite a few of the Commission’s proposals, and I think that the result is most acceptable.
I hope that the final negotiations between the Council and the Commission will see a good deal more of the Agriculture Committee’s demands taken on board.
The cultivation of energy crops offers farmers at least some opportunity to find alternatives to sugar-beet growing and to promote non-food production – which is vital and also forward looking.
Following the reform of the CAP, European agriculture has to undergo its next major reform very soon.
We must nevertheless accept that we live in an interconnected world, and that stubborn insistence on the status quo is certainly not a viable alternative.
The Agriculture Committee is of the opinion that, in future, there must be the possibility of obliging the Council to wait for Parliament to take its decisions before taking its own decision.
This was an exceptional situation, in view of which I support the procedure.
I hope that, in the final reckoning, we shall continue to have beet farmers and an active, attractive sugar industry, in the future.
