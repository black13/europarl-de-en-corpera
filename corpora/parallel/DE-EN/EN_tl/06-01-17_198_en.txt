â€“ Mr President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his clear statements.
Am I right in assuming that he does not consider the setting of quotas for third-country workers to be the right course of action for the European internal market; and that, when he works on the proposals for the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive, he will actively take into account the French study that concludes that the existing system provided for in the directive is not working in the Member States?
