– Mr President, on the one hand, I regret the absence of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner – I do not think that that is right, as her name appears on the agenda – but, on the other, I am glad that the Austro-Hungarian cooperation in the Commission is working so well.
I have two brief questions for the Commissioner.
Firstly, what aid, in the form of staff and funding, does he regard as conceivable for the coming year to prevent the reform process in Ukraine failing or toppling once more – as, indeed, certain neighbouring states obviously believe it will?
Secondly, what specific action is the Commission taking to improve the transport links between the European Union and Ukraine, and to develop common infrastructure concepts to strengthen Ukraine’s energy and transport links to the west?
