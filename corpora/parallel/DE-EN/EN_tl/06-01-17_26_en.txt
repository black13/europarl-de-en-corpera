Mr President, I would like to know if the Commissioner has heard a single speech – other than the one by Mr Jarzembowski, who seemed unsure whether he should say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – in which someone has taken a favourable view of this port services directive?
There is a wide variety of reasons for repudiating it, ranging from the social aspect to the bureaucracy involved, not to mention our sense that there is something undemocratic about a Commissioner past her sell-by date reintroducing a proposal that has already been rejected.
This House is very definitely united, and I do believe that you could do yourself and the Commission a favour by taking the opportunity of your closing speech to announce that you are withdrawing this proposal, thereby pre-empting Parliament’s call on you to do just that.
You accept that the interested parties do not want this directive and that your idea of what is good democratic practice is not the only one, and so you stand a chance of bringing in a new directive, one dealing exclusively with transparency and with the aid that ports need.
That would be a sensible way of going about things, and by conducting yourself in that way you would be doing democracy in the European Union a great service.
