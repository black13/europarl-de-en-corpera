– Mr President, I would ask the Commissioner to conclude this debate with a few explanations.
I believe that there is a fundamental flaw in this evening’s debate.
The common position that is the subject of Mrs Korhola’s report contains no rules whatsoever on access to justice.
The Commissioner has presented rules for access to the first part of the Århus Convention: access to information, but, as things stand, there is no treatment whatsoever of the third pillar of this Convention.
I believe that there is some confusion in this regard.
In my view, the opportunity to request an internal review, for which provision is made in the common position, should not be confused with access to justice.
I would ask the Commissioner to clarify this point.
I should like to add, however, that I consider it absolutely indispensable that non-governmental organisations be given access to justice in the environmental field at European level, so that, if necessary, the practical transposition of European legislation can be examined on site.
Experience with the right of collective action in Germany has been very positive: there has not been an abundance of actions, and actions have been purposeful, with most of those brought by associations there ending in success.
