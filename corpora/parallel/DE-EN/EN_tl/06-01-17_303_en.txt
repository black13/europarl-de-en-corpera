– Mr President, Commissioner, I am obliged to Mr Sjöstedt, who negotiated very prudently on behalf of Parliament, and also to the Commission, which lent us its support in our endeavours to reach a compromise in the Council.
Let me echo my colleague Mr Olajos, who rightly emphasised that, with this legislative proposal, we have really hit upon an issue that directly affects the safety of the public and of the environment, and thus we are by no means creating superfluous European regulations that, as it were, only serve to burden the economy.
In this case, too, of course, a compromise does mean that the regulation gives rise to certain costs, but I believe that these costs are justified and can certainly be borne by industry, since assets as important as human health are at stake.
A particularly important achievement of the compromise is that financial guarantees are now required to cover the potential cost arising from land affected by a waste facility.
Arrangements such as these have to be made in advance, of course, as accidents very often result in mine operators declaring bankruptcy.
This means that the funds necessary to at least institute countervailing measures are lacking, and the general public is left to bear the consequences again.
Various aspects of waste management have also been specified much more precisely, particularly for the eventuality that the operator puts extractive waste into excavation voids during rehabilitation of the site.
This kind of rehabilitation requires strict compliance with the legal provisions so as to preclude any soil or water pollution.
In addition, operators have to take monitoring, maintenance and remedial measures: for example, they are obliged to collect or treat contaminated water or leachate.
It is important that the acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, too, make statements pledging to respect the new provisions – let us not forget Baia Mare.
