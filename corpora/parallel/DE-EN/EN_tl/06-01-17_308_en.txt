. – Mr President, I am obliged to the rapporteur for the very good work he has done, and to the Commission for this proposal for a directive, in particular.
To be frank, I was a little disappointed in the Commission when it gave its opinion on the Council common position.
I should really have liked to see more support for a tougher, more sharply defined line on bathing water quality as, after all, we have considerably watered down the standards to which the Commissioner referred.
With the support of the Commission, we could have put together a tougher directive, one that obliged Member States to introduce higher standards without the States being faced with the heavy spending that is so often talked about.
Let us not forget that the main problem today as regards the pollution of bathing water is not localised pollution, but diffuse sources of pollution – agricultural sources in particular, of course.
We could have achieved a substantial improvement on this issue with a relatively small amount of money.
Yet we have reached a compromise, and one should stand by compromises; which is why I would appeal for the adoption of the proposal for a directive in Parliament tomorrow.
We have, however, taken a step in the right direction.
I am now pinning my hopes on 2008, when the Commission is due to review the directive and assess the situation prevailing by then.
May I, then, anticipate this by asking the Commissioner, who is of course a keen swimmer, to make sure that his services carry out this assessment accordingly and perhaps after all raise the health standards to OECD levels, on which all States have in fact agreed, so that we do not find ourselves attempting to level down the health standards in this field.
Bathing water undoubtedly has a strong ally in the Commissioner.
