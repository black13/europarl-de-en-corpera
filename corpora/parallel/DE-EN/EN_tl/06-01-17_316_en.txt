– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to follow on seamlessly from where Mr Ulmer left off.
For my electoral district, which directly adjoins Lake Constance, the Bathing Water Directive represents a difficult balancing act between protection of consumers – bathers – on the one hand, and nature conservation and tourism on the other.
The compromise we have reached on pollution requirements and quality standards in the ‘sufficient’ category, as Mr Ulmer put it, is a fair compromise between all the three interests that meet there.
For this reason, I have found that this compromise has met with a great deal of acceptance back home, for which I am much obliged to all the MEPs concerned, the rapporteur included.
It is also important to point out, however, that, by reducing the number of categories of polluter from 19 to just 2, we have found a solution that also serves the objectives of better lawmaking and less-bureaucratic regulation.
This is a good example to demonstrate that we are all at pains to cut down the excessively numerous regulations that were commonplace in the past to the really important aspects, and for this, too, I am very much obliged to everyone involved.
In the view of my group, the scope of the directive as a whole is very satisfactory.
It is also to be welcomed that Parliament did not keep to its original intention of extending the scope of the Bathing Water Directive to other water-related leisure activities, too, and for this I am obliged to all the MEPs concerned.
