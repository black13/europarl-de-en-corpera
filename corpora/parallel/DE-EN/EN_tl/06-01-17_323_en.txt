– Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work, as it shows clearly how many different issues we are actually talking about when we use the expression ‘sustainable development strategy’.
Sustainable development concerns all Union policies, including, in particular, cooperation with the rest of the world.
The Commission communication makes good reading, with many well-meant, kind words, but I am disappointed that the chapter entitled ‘Setting objectives, targets and milestones’ has turned out very short and also very superficial.
One has the impression that the authors are well acquainted with the problems and have analysed them well but that, as soon as it comes to combating them, they fail to penetrate beneath the surface.
I hope that the strategy announced under the Austrian Presidency is more ambitious and gives more specific answers on the subject.
We must not confine ourselves to this single strategy, however.
How seriously we take the concerns of sustainable development will also become clear from the development of Union finances in future.
If environmental and species protection are important Community objectives, that must also be reflected in the budget.
We must do our utmost to ensure that instruments, such as LIFE, that work well and are so important for the environment in Europe are allocated sufficient funds.
The Commission communication lists a number of unsustainable trends, predominantly climate change.
The Commission is therefore called upon to take those measures that represent important instruments for combating climate change.
The Eco-design Directive adopted last year provides it with ample opportunities for this.
I hope that the Commission’s first implementing measures to this directive will soon be in place, namely for those products with high potential for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases at low cost.
