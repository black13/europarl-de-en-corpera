– Mr President, I am much obliged to you for giving me the floor at so late an hour, on what is indeed a very important and interesting report.
I should like to start by agreeing with Mrs Scheele: it is true that all the policies dealt with by the Union are, and must be, subject to the principles of sustainability.
The financial situation undoubtedly forms part of this, too, and so not only should we be deliberating where we could be spending still more money, but we must also ask ourselves how we can spare the young generation excessive debt within our financial programming, whilst setting – possibly different – priorities; because debts left behind by Member States for the young generation surely cannot be considered sustainable either.
I should like to examine one point that seems to me to be very important in connection with this directive.
Firstly, I believe that strengthening ownership by improving cooperation with the actors in this field is an important tool for actually reinforcing the understanding at grass-roots level that sustainability is not a hollow principle that we only uphold when we get up on our soapboxes – to quote my fellow Members here – but that it affects each one of us quite specifically.
I should now like to discuss a specific point, namely the financing of Natura 2000 sites.
As we are of course aware, we in Western Europe, in particular, have a very high level of prosperity, and this is not god-given.
If farmers suddenly see large sections of their land marked out as Natura 2000 sites with stock protection in force, it will be very difficult to convince them that sustainability is something tangible.
We have to show these farmers that sustainability has benefits for them, too, by paying them compensation or offering them other ways of earning a living.
For this reason, we must stipulate in this directive that an effective financing system is necessary for the Natura 2000 network.
I therefore support this directive.
