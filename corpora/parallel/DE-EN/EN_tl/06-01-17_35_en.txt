Mr President, Commissioner, I am convinced that you will get a majority in this House to back a ports directive for Europe if the directive you put before us is well thought-out and really does promote transparency and competitiveness in Europe in this area.
This directive, though, is not suited to that task and so I suggest that you withdraw it.
You must have realised, in the course of this debate, what agreement, across the party boundaries, you have prompted in this House on this subject.
You must surely realise that this draft directive, lacking as it does sufficient underpinning, is ill-prepared for debate.
Even though Mr Jarzembowski has done a splendid job, there is little chance of this House improving a bad directive when one is put before it.
The Commission also needs to get used to the idea that this House cannot be used as a repair workshop for bad directives.
What makes this draft directive scarcely fit for consideration is the fact that important aspects of it are unclear; its definition of markets certainly is.
Is it meant to mean competition within ports, among the ports themselves or something that involves both the ports and the traffic that they share in their hinterland?
No impact assessment has been carried out, nor is it at all clear what benefit the consumer is supposed to derive from all this.
More competition ought, by rights, to reduce handling costs, yet, from what we know, handling costs in Europe are less than half what they are in Singapore or Dubai anyway, which adds up to a good deal lower.
The intention is that they should stay that way, yet this proposal opens the door to the possibility of their being increased.
Will this directive really get more service providers into ports?
I ask you to reconsider it, to withdraw it and put a better one before us.
If it is thought through properly, you will get a majority for transparency and competition in Europe.
