Mr President, whenever there are demonstrations in front of our buildings, whether here in Strasbourg or in Brussels, we know that they have to do with the defence of existing interests, and if these demonstrations become violent, we know that the balance of these interests is very definitely the number one issue.
It is, though, an unfortunate fact that the slogans and truncheons conceal the real alternatives.
What this is all about, in essence, is not fundamental issues such as liberalisation, transparency and the like, but rather, as always, the details of the practical arrangements.
That is why, in this debate on how to take this directive further, I am right alongside Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur, in his desire to improve the Commission proposal, which, it has to be admitted, was not a good one.
Nor am I greatly heartened by the slogan, ‘Back to the Start’; if we were to do that, we would simply be wasting a lot of time.
The fact that people are calling for White Papers or even Green Papers is evidence of a desire in this House for five years’ rest from being Europe’s legislator.
I see this debate as running parallel not only to the debate on the services directive that we are going to be having next month, but also to the debate on the constitution.
There, too, the issue is not about whether Europe should or should not be ‘social’, but, in essence, about hundreds of details that go to make up a workable, better, shared Europe.
The only thing is that there is no willingness to talk through these hundreds of details, no willingness to make the effort to seek and find consensus; instead, people would rather resort to slogans.
They may attract the attention of the media, but they help nobody in this Europe in which we share to find their way to better and workable solutions.
