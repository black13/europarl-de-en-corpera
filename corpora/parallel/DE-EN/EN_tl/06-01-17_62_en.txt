That air transport is one of the major sectors that has an impact on growth is not a matter of dispute, and it is something of which we have all been made aware during the debate on these two reports.
Particularly intensive consideration has been given to two issues, namely flight safety and, of course, the protection of the environment.
Where flight safety is concerned, there is an urgent need for reciprocal rights of inspection, not least within the SAFA (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft Programme), along with something that is an important step into the future, and one that we in this House have already discussed, that being the training of inspection staff and the exchange of information with third countries.
It has to be said, though, that air transport has played just as significant a part in frustrating the achievement of the Kyoto target.
If no action is taken, air transport will claim for itself all the room for manoeuvre in emissions accorded by the Kyoto Protocol in which the other sectors have made reductions.
What that means is that industry has reduced emissions; private households have reduced emissions, and air transport will use them up unless we take action.
That is why the debate on possible courses of action – whether these be fiscal in nature or involve emissions trading – must remain open-ended.
That is a question to which we will have to address ourselves if we want to take Kyoto seriously.
At the same time, we have to raise – not least at the international level – the issues of noise pollution and regionally-adapted bans on night flights, and make social dumping impossible.
Within the ‘open sky’, though – where important actions have already been taken – Europe needs to speak with confidence and a single voice if balance is to be maintained and no one nation or group of nations is to enjoy advantages in global competition that are denied to others.
