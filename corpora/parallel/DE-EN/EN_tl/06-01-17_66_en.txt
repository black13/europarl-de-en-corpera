Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to seize the opportunity to sincerely congratulate the rapporteurs on the work they have done.
Reform of international air transport must also, I think, make it possible to establish a common aviation area with uniform standards.
Considerations such as the efficiency and safety of flights are not just a contribution to the EUâ€™s neighbourhood policy, but are also very emphatically in our own interests.
It is, therefore, of enormous importance in the interests of our own safety that uniform air safety standards be incorporated in any new air traffic agreements with third countries, for this is the only way in which future air disasters can be prevented and a uniformly high safety standard guaranteed.
We have to consider, though, the possibility of support being made available to those states that are unable to meet these technical standards.
What matters is not just compliance with common rules in the field of aviation safety, but also, and above all, with those relating to social and environmental policy.
There are few, if any, references to such rules in the bilateral agreements currently in force.
Under no circumstances must the opening up of the aviation area be accomplished to the detriment of workers who may, in third countries, be employed under less stringent social security regulations.
Were that to be the case, it would mean not least a considerable risk to safety if these workers were to perform their duties under intolerable conditions.
If all those who become active in the market do so subject to the same rules, then there is no likelihood, in future, of safety in the air losing out as a result of social dumping.
