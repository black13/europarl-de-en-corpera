Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I can, of course, do no other than agree with those members of my own group who have already spoken, whilst extending my thanks to both rapporteurs.
There is one point I would particularly like to highlight.
It is a very good thing that there should be such agreement on this issue within this House and with the Commission, and I am very happy about that.
I would like to point out, though, that not all the Member States take the same positive view as we do of this idea of a single aviation policy to the benefit of our airlines, those who work for them and those who travel with them, and there are airlines that are often happier to be represented in their dealings with third countries by their national governments rather than by the Commission.
That is why we must take care that the Commissionâ€™s negotiations with such third countries as, for example, the USA, provide the Member States with evidence that a single European aviation policy is preferable to 25 different policies on aviation with reference to third countries.
This is a dimension of which we must never lose sight.
We are convinced that it is right and in the interests of the industry, workers in it and of airline passengers, to pursue a single policy with regard to third countries.
Several governments, though, remain to be persuaded that this is indeed the case.
