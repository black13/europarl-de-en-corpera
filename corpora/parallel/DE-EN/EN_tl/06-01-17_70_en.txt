Mr President, I have three comments to make.
The first is that, while we welcome the Commissionâ€™s move towards the progressive extension of Community agreements with third countries, the far-reaching effects on the transport sector as a whole, on the environment and on competition and the internal market prompt me to urge you to again consider whether foreign policy as it relates to air transport ought not really to be dealt with via the codecision procedure.
Secondly, what we expect of the Commission is not only that it should set out its strategic approach, but also that it should draw up a list of countries with which an agreement is a priority and seek to conclude one with them.
The Commissioner briefly sketched out what this might be like earlier on.
Thirdly, all agreements must be guided by the principle that the first priority is the mutual opening up of markets on an equal basis, it should be borne in mind in the current negotiations with Russia and China that, if the problem with Russia relating to the overflight charges is not sorted out first, an agreement with China would go against the requirement for reciprocity, for the overflight conditions Russia imposes on China are not the same as those imposed on the European airlines, and that is something we cannot accept.
