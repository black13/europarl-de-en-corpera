Mr President, I have a declaration of vote to make on behalf of the delegation of the Austrian People’s Party.
We believe that the Catania report on the Commission’s fourth report on citizenship of the Union completely missed the point.
At a time when the vast mass of the population take a sceptical view of much of what goes on in the EU, the issue of citizenship of it needs to be addressed with some seriousness.
It is lamentable that this report does no more than discuss the situation of immigrants and has nothing to say about the needs of Europe’s citizens.
Let me make it quite plain that those who want to enter the European Union from third countries, namely as immigrants or asylum seekers, deserve to be taken far more seriously and treated with much more respect than they are by this report, and it is for that reason that we have voted against it.
