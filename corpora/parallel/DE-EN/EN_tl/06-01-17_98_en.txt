We have, of course, wholeheartedly endorsed this report by Mrs Prets, and we are also very glad of the considerable improvements that the amendments have made to it.
It was a matter of particular concern to us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that it should be made clear that prostitutesâ€™ clients should also have cause to fear punishment if they are aware of forced prostitution.
Our intention in this is that it should be spelled out that forced prostitution must not only be fought against by means of the law, but must also be treated as repugnant by society at large, and we are particularly pleased that this House has taken note of our 8 March initiative against forced prostitution during the football World Cup, which is being played in Germany this year.
Our intention is to make it clear that forced prostitution must be shown the red card, and fair play must mean our making every effort to get rid of it.
I hope that this House will thereby send out a clear message about sporting events, for we can combat forced prostitution only by sending out such clear messages to every stratum of society, and not only by means of legal initiatives, and the boom in forced prostitution really must prompt us to get stuck into fighting it.
