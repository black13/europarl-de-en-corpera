There are some 20 000 bathing sites in the European Union, and people have no idea of what dangerous bacteria lurk in their waters.
Swimmers swallow on average some 50 millilitres of water, and children sometimes swallow ten times that amount while splashing around, so the absence of any risk of contracting an illness must be guaranteed.
There are various agents that can cause illnesses ranging from nausea to skin eruptions, but also others that are potentially fatal.
It is all the more encouraging, then, that the European directive has been able to improve the quality of bathing water over recent years, but it has made drastic incursions into the capacity of smaller lakes, such as those in the Austrian Alps, to regulate themselves.
It follows that we can no longer rely solely on the provisions of the law, on prohibitions and investments, but must instead try to demand of the public that they cooperate actively and be aware of environmental issues.
