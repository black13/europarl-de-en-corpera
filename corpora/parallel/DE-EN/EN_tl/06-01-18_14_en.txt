Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, may I bid the President of the Council a warm welcome to the European Parliament.
We Austrians are not the only ones who are pleased to see Wolfgang Schüssel taking over the presidency of the Council.
Your priorities and political principles, Chancellor, are ours too.
In the European Parliament, unlike national parliaments, we sit in a semicircle, because we need each other.
Thank you for urging the institutions to enter into a new spirit of cooperation in place of instinctive confrontation and dis-coordination and day-to-day political posturing.
Your speech made a refreshing change from what we have been hearing over the past few months.
This new approach, however, also demands mutual respect and willingness to engage in dialogue, trust each other and make compromises.
The book , in which you yourself wrote about the strategy of cooperation, contains the following quote from Kofi Annan: ‘We don’t need any more promises.
We need to start keeping the promises we already made’.
I see this as the essence of your speech.
That is why we say yes to efforts to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises but no to a 70% reduction in the funding of the competitiveness and innovation programme for SMEs.
We say yes to education and must therefore say no to a 40% cut in that part of the budget.
We say yes to a transparent, accessible, democratic, parliamentary, socially responsible, stronger Europe, but this means that we must launch the debate on the political future of the Union and make our citizens stakeholders in Europe.
We say yes to the Services Directive.
Let us develop it into a showpiece of social market economics.
We say yes to an EU based on the Community principle.
Let us continue the development of the EU and bolster the common foreign and security policy.
We must be prepared to talk and listen, because there are many tasks to accomplish.
Let us get to work!
