I find it utterly incomprehensible how the European Commission, scarcely a year after the failure of its first proposal for a directive on market access for port services just before the end of its term of office on 13 October 2004, can put forward a new proposal for a directive that not only contains drastically more stringent provisions but also retains the same core rules that were the downfall of its predecessor.
I believe that the proposed directive represents a departure from the hitherto accepted model for European competition policy, which was about ensuring workable competition, and according to which regulatory interventions in a market or in individual market segments can be justified only if structural market conditions or attempts by participants in the market to restrict competition are interfering with economic efficiency.
I am relieved at the outcome that has resulted from this debate, as also at the evident effect of the extensive protests (although I do of course condemn most forcefully the outrages perpetrated in Strasbourg), for the proposed directive constitutes an intervention in competition for loading services in ports, although no action is required on the basis of the marketâ€™s structure, the way it operates or the results obtained from it.
