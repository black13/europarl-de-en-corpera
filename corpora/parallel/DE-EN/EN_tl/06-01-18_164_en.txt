Mr President, I was with the delegation that went to the Afghan elections in September, and even then we were saying that the large amounts of money that the European Union, among others, was investing in development cooperation in Afghanistan meant that a special parliamentary delegation would be necessary, and I think it extremely important that we have, by our resolution today, provided for one.
One of the tasks that I believe this group of Members will have will be to monitor the European Union’s political objectives in Afghanistan, above all else developments in the field of human rights and women’s rights.
