Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I trust you will forgive me, Mr Schüssel, if I compare you here with Zeus, but in fact most heads of government treat Europe as the supreme deity of ancient Greece treated Europa, namely as a lover whom one woos here but who, back home in the company of one’s wife, is either not mentioned or played down, lest suspicion be aroused.
And the people of our countries react in exactly the same way as children in a family when this lack of clarity prevails.
They are extremely unsettled and distrustful; they become rebellious, as we clearly observed in the ‘no’ votes in the French and Dutch referenda.
So you want to impart new impetus to Europe, Mr President-in-Office?
You can only do that by setting a good example and creating that long-overdue clarity.
The members of the Council must go home and confess to their relationship with Europe, stand up for her more boldly, see to it that she is given a carefully assessed financial allowance to meet her needs and tell the people back home that the prospects of every single Member State in the global competition for prosperity depend entirely on the existence of a strong, self-confident Europe and that it is the task of Europe to cultivate globalisation.
