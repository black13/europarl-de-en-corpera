The fact is that we are slowly but surely turning our backs on the Gulf Stream, our natural source of heating, and, every day, as we do so, ocean currents altered by global warming are robbing us of some 86 million tonnes of arable soil, some 225 000 more human beings are being born, and desertification proceeds at a headlong and ever-faster rate.
