Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber on the even-handedness of their report, and that I am very glad to be able, today, to present to you the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on it.
This House has had a long fight where codecision in agricultural matters is concerned, and the draft constitution’s incorporation of codecision – which goes back to the Treaties of Amsterdam – in the fields of environmental protection, food safety and the protection of consumers is something to be welcomed.
Where agricultural policy is concerned, however, the Council of Agriculture Ministers can still disregard the opinions of the European Parliament, since the codecision procedure is not, under the current Treaty, applicable to the common agricultural policy.
Although the draft constitution, when considered in the light of the above, held out the prospect of increased democratic legitimacy, in that all decisions on agricultural policy were to be subject to codecision, the Agriculture Committee does believe that the existing text is still in need of some improvements.
The objectives of the common agricultural policy, as set out in Article III-227, contradict the goals of the European Union described in Article I-3, and no longer serve any readily explainable purpose.
They must, as a matter of urgency, be updated to take account of the multifunctional nature of our present agriculture, which provides work for 10 million people in the EU, is the sole guarantor of the sustainable development of rural areas and cannot be considered in isolation from them.
This draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large, and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy, and, in particular, to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 (2) and III-231 (2) of the text as it stands at present.
Since the CAP is so very important and occupies a predominant position in the EU’s Budget, the European public have every right to the highest possible degree of transparency and, above all in this sensitive area, codecision – which, as I see it, can mean nothing other than full codecision for the European Parliament on all matters relating to agricultural policy, consumer protection and the safety of food.
