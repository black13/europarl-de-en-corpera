Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, if the Austrian presidency wants to combat the catastrophic rejection of the EU by broad sections of the European population, it needs to ask the right questions.
In so doing, it would be wrong to avoid the key question, which is what the end result of this European integration process is supposed to be: a federal superstate with centralist tendencies, to which the abortive constitutional treaty would inevitably have led, or a confederation of states, a Europe of the nations.
It would also be wrong to avoid considering how far Europe stretches and why some place like Islamic Anatolia should ever belong to Europe, or how far eastward enlargement should go and whether the process should not be more thoroughly prepared.
The last unavoidable question is why the Union cannot function unless an even heavier burden is imposed on the top net contributors, to which Austria now also belongs.
I very much hope that you do not continue to circumvent – elegantly, I admit, but embarrassingly – these questions that are central to the very future of Europe.
If you do, people’s scepticism towards the EU will continue to grow under the Austrian presidency.
