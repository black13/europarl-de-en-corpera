Mr President, there is one sentence in the report that cannot be given enough emphasis, and it is this one: ‘the Treaty of Nice is not a viable basis for the continuation of the European integration process’.
To it I would add that this Treaty represents the beginning of the end for an enlarged Union of citizens.
What, after all, is Nice all about?
It is about there being no fundamental rights binding in law, no citizens’ initiatives, no clear demarcation of powers, no full budgetary rights for the European Parliament, right of national parliaments to intervene in response to proposals from the Commission, no parliamentary control of Europol, no foreign minister and no European diplomatic service.
The list of all the things that Europe stands to lose without a constitution is a very long one; there must be no march back to the past.
Are we then to say, in all seriousness, that Nice must be cast in concrete?
I do not want the European Union to degenerate into a free trade zone with limited social liability; a core Europe that draws new dividing lines across Europe is unacceptable, and so the constitutional process must go on.
Europe needs a new Treaty.
The one thing that is blindingly clear is that ‘as you were’ will get us nowhere.
People’s worries and problems must, at last, be taken seriously – that is the message that comes over, loud and clear, from the French and Dutch referenda on the Constitution.
What we need is a political shift in the European Union, in the shape of a move towards a social Europe.
It is only then that there will be active public support for the enlarged Union and for a Europe united in peace.
