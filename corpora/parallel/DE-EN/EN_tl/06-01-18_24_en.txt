Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you have many important tasks ahead of you in the next six months.
You enumerated these tasks, and most of them relate to our everyday work here.
I believe, however, that you have a far more basic task to undertake, namely to rediscover the European identity.
If that common identity is not visible, it immediately raises a question: from where does the European Union draw its legitimacy?
You must look for answers to the question whether Europe is worthwhile for me or any other individual.
Is it politically worthwhile?
Is it financially worthwhile?
How is Europe actually visible in my everyday life?
What shows me that I am a European?
This is why you must conduct a public debate.
Allow controversial contributions, for I am convinced that those who shut out criticism do more harm to Europe than its critics.
At the same time, have the courage to launch unusual initiatives.
I must say that I am very impressed by your activities in the arts.
You are, after all, in charge of .
You are a team player.
You are used to playing a tough game.
Half of your ministers are women.
So make Europe come alive in peopleâ€™s minds!
That would be a success.
