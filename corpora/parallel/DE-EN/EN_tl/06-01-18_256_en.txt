Mr President, Commissioner, the law on NGOs was signed in secret by President Putin.
The first three aid organisations in Ingushetia have already been banned, including one that provided humanitarian aid to refugees.
The attitude of authoritarian regimes towards civil society reflects the undesirability, in their eyes, of independent, accurate information on such subjects as the tragic war in Chechnya.
NGOs such as Memorial provide us with information on infringements and violations of human rights in Chechnya, where free elections are impossible.
In the same way that Chancellor Merkel had brought up the subject of Guantanamo in Washington, she brought up the sore point of Chechnya on her visit to Russia, and the Russian President's response to her was to say that there were deficiencies in democracy and human rights in the West, in other words in the EU, too.
All I can say to that is: in the EU we do not have such massive restrictions on freedom of opinion, as terrible a war as in Chechnya, a judiciary that disregards the rule of law as completely as in the Yukos case, or prison conditions as inhumane as those experienced by Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev.
Human rights are universal and indivisible and must not be disregarded.
