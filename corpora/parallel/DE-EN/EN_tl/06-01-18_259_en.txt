Mr President, honourable Members, we take the concerns and worries expressed during this debate regarding the situation in Chechnya and human rights in Russia very seriously.
This morning, the President of the European Council, Chancellor Schüssel, said something that I would like to reiterate here: for us, human rights and basic freedoms are indivisible.
They are European values, and I would stress that that obviously also applies to Russia.
The European Union – and I am particularly referring here to the activities of the Council – repeatedly discusses these human rights violations in Chechnya with Russia at all levels.
Whether or not the language of those discussions is too diplomatic for your taste, it is the language we use with our Russian partners.
It is particularly important to maintain dialogue, because it is the only way that we can raise our concerns about these violations of human rights.
That is why the human rights consultations that have been initiated, and which we will be holding on a regular basis, are particularly important.
They will be taking place again in March, and the Council is preparing for these consultations very conscientiously.
We also share, of course, the concerns raised here regarding the law on non-governmental organisations.
We find it regrettable that this law has been signed.
Rest assured, the Council will raise those concerns and we will be monitoring the position of non-governmental organisations in Russia very closely.
I also agree, naturally, with the honourable Member who said that we must strengthen those forces in Russia that are committed to democracy and human rights.
I can assure you that we are doing exactly that.
