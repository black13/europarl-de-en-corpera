.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have my first opportunity today to be here to take your questions.
I would like to take this opportunity to talk about something that you have already mentioned.
We in the Presidency are well aware that Question Time is an important democratic tool, because it enables MEPs to get answers from the Council to questions that are important for their political work.
We have therefore been reflecting, together with your Houseâ€™s Bureau, on how we can make best and most effective use of Question Time as a tool.
As Mrs Kaufmann has already said, this has resulted in some ideas for reforms that we would like to try out together for the first time today.
This new type of Question Time aims to deal first with current topics of general interest and then to spend the rest of the time discussing a particular specialist field, in other words to raise questions to be answered in person by the President-in-Office responsible for that field.
This, I believe, will help us to deal with the issues that interest you in a more targeted manner.
We hope that this new procedure will provide your House with a better service and also contribute to more successful and better founded interinstitutional dialogue, to which the Austrian Presidency is particularly committed.
We are doing this even though Austria is a country with a relatively small government and therefore with relatively few ministers who are available for this new style of dialogue, but we want to make this effort in the common interest.
It was also not particularly easy to convince the other members of the Council to agree to these changes, but we managed it.
I hope, Madam President, that as many Members as possible will take us up on this offer, and that their presence will in future make Question Time a more lively occasion.
