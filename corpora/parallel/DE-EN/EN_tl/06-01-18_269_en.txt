Madam President, it is clear – and has also been demonstrated by the negotiations in Montreal – that the biggest producers of greenhouse gases are now getting more involved in the dialogue regarding a future climate protection mechanism, and it is important that nobody goes it alone.
The future mechanism may well entail structural changes, which should make it considerably easier for Europe to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the efforts made so far.
There have also been some significant developments outside the international climate process, and various regions have established a number of initiatives.
The Gleneagles Action Plan, if I may bring that up on this occasion, places the emphasis of the EU's most important trading partners on technology transfer and on managing the effects of climate change, and involves a commitment to dialogue and technological cooperation with India, China and Russia.
It is in the interests of the European Union to work with all countries within and outside the international climate dialogue to ensure that our common goals of reducing emissions are not undermined by the actions of groups or States.
