Mr President, Federal Chancellor, there are three quite specific concerns that I should like to commend particularly to the current presidency of the Council.
The first relates to the protection of minorities.
We ethnic Austrians living in the Southern Tyrol/Alto Adige region have always received a great deal of understanding and support from Vienna.
Let Austria be equally magnanimous towards the minorities within its own boundaries, such as the Carinthian Slovenes.
What is happening at the present time in the dispute over place-name signs in Carinthia is grotesque.
The second relates to ratification of the Transport Protocol to the Alpine Convention.
If Austria does not settle this matter, which has long been a concern of the Alpine countries, who will?
The third relates to the need to prevent the construction of the Brenner base tunnel.
Building a high-speed railway through the Alps is very hazardous for many reasons: mixed traffic on the old line and on the projected new line, high-speed passenger trains travelling through so many and such long tunnels, goods traffic on the Alpine railway, which would cause unreasonable nuisance to those who live nearby, and the premature construction of the tunnel complex itself without the simultaneous construction of the feeder lines.
This new megaproject would be even more unprofitable than the Eurotunnel under the English Channel.
