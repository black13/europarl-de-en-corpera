Madam President, the EU's emissions trading system is one of the cornerstones of the fight against climate change.
It is the first international CO2 emissions trading system in the world, and covers around 12 000 plants, or getting on for half of all Europe's CO2 emissions.
It helps the Member States to reach their emissions targets.
No other system allows emissions to be reduced so cost-effectively.
The Council is well aware of the problems to which you alluded in implementing the EU emissions trading system during the pilot phase.
This initial period provided some valuable experience, which should help us with the future development of the system.
Building on these initial experiences, the directive already provides for a full review in 2006.
This review will enable us to examine all the possible improvements and to implement them for the period post-2012.
