Madam President, Mr Winkler, I would like to thank you for your very detailed comments on this subject.
We are aware that this climate change agreement also entails costs for industry.
Despite that, what do you see as our options for improving the competitiveness of European industry so that it can continue to be successful on the international market?
Do we have any options?
If so, what are they?
