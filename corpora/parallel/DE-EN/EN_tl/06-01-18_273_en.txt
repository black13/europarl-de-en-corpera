Madam President, the European Union has always endeavoured to achieve global cooperation on climate protection.
The European Union and its representatives have also made this clear in every international forum as well as in the Council's conclusions.
Our implementation of the Kyoto Protocol provides credible proof of our commitment and shows that climate protection is feasible and compatible with economic growth.
In our opinion, economic interests and climate protection are not contradictory.
For example, the EU's chosen option of an emissions trading system is the most cost-efficient way to reduce emissions.
Furthermore, international studies have repeatedly shown that failure to act would result in much higher costs than funding climate protection measures right now.
The sooner measures are taken to protect the climate, the lower the consequent costs will be for the economy.
It therefore makes economic sense for the European Union to take climate protection measures on the grounds of energy efficiency – and your House frequently debates energy issues – that also create new jobs.
