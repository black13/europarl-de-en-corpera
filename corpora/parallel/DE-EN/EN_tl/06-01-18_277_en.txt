Madam President, the Austrian Presidency supports – as Chancellor Schüssel made very clear in his comments today – the efforts undertaken by the Parliamentary Assembly and Secretary-General of the Council of Europe to shed light on this matter and to put the facts clearly on the table.

With the same end in view, we will also support the European Parliament’s investigations into this matter.
