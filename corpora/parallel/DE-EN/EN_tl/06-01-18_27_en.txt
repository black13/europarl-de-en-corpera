Mr President, let me begin by welcoming the changeover to the Austrian presidency.
Perhaps we shall now have hard and fast policies in place of all the air bubbles we had during the British presidency.
Yet even so, Mr Schüssel, the programme for your presidency of the EU is alarming, especially in the field of foreign and military policy.
On the one hand, we are told that the next steps with regard to the Treaty on a Constitution for Europe must be openly discussed.
That is all very well, but the present constitutional treaty is dead.
All we need now, essentially, is a date for the burial.
On the other hand, some parts of the constitutional treaty which are needed for the pursuit of the Union’s military policy are simply being applied without ratification.
This programme for the domain of military policy poses particular problems for a neutral country.
Let me cite two examples: firstly, efforts are to be made to have the battle groups combat-ready by 1 January 2007; secondly, special priority is to be given to the so-called European Defence Agency.
Do not give the EU a military face, Mr Schüssel; let it have a civilian and civilised one.
