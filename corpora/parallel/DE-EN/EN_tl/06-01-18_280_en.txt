Madam President, Mr Winkler, I would like to raise a more general point, as it has become clear during today's debate that the issue of strengthening human rights in the framework of the EU as a whole is one of the Austrian Presidency's top priorities.
The EU intends to develop the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, currently based in Vienna, into a Human Rights Agency.
Do you consider there to be opportunities for coordination and useful services in the context of the problem being discussed here?
