Madam President, we regard the establishment of a European Human Rights Agency as a major contribution to strengthening the hand of all the EU institutions.
We are endeavouring, in dialogue with the European Parliament and also with the Council of Europe and other institutions, to make this Human Rights Agency an effective instrument with the ability of making a real contribution to discussions on the matters you have raised, namely the issue of defending human rights in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
This agency, which we hope will come into being during the Austrian Presidency, and which we envisage being able to start work on 1 January 2007, is not intended to compete with any other existing institutions.
We have no desire to compete with the valuable and important institutions of the Council of Europe, the Court of Justice or the Commission Against Discrimination, or with other institutions.
We want an efficient agency that will have the Monitoring Centre on Racism in Vienna as its core and foundation, but will have broader competencies and will thus increase the credibility of the European Union in the domain of human rights.
