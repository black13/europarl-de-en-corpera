Madam President, on Mrs Manolakou's question on the abduction and arrest of Pakistanis living in Greece, I would like to say the following: the Council has always emphasised that the war against terrorism must be fought in complete compliance with the general principles of international law and with the provisions on human rights laid down in national and international legislation.
The Council would stress once again that it categorically condemns torture and other illegal practices, and it would underline the necessity of complying with the general legal principles at all times.
However, the Council cannot and will not comment on the details mentioned by the honourable Member.
These specific cases of what the question describes as abduction are currently being investigated by several international bodies, in particular by the Council of Europe.
Until we have the results of these investigations, it would be premature to take a position.
