Madam President, in response to Mr Medina Ortega's question regarding the Barcelona Conference, I would like to say that, at the Euro-Mediterranean summit marking the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Process, agreement was reached on a joint five-year work programme to reinforce the partnership and on a code of conduct for countering terrorism, which clearly shows our shared commitment to fighting all forms of terrorism.
The five-year work programme sets medium-term goals with regard to the political and security partnership, sustainable socio-economic development and reform, and education and socio-cultural exchanges.
It also deals with issues related to migration, social integration, justice and security.
The Presidency thinks it is important for every Presidency to submit a report to the Council, setting out in detail its plans for implementing this work programme, and it calls on the Commission to keep the Council regularly informed on the progress with implementation.
The agreements reached in Barcelona will enable us to make progress in our regional cooperation with our partners in the Mediterranean region and at the same time to push the European neighbourhood policy forward by negotiating additional bilateral action plans.
A number of important results were achieved at the summit: a governance facility to support and strengthen political reform was approved, the liberalisation of trade in services and agricultural products was confirmed as a common goal, and there was a willingness to combat illegal immigration – including through the conclusion of readmission agreements – while the EU has agreed to make legal migration easier; in this connection a future ministerial meeting is expected to deal with all immigration-related issues.
Other results included an increase in funds for education via a university scholarship programme and the promotion of gender equality.
Finally, the conclusion of a code of conduct on countering terrorism is a major political success and proves that, despite the sensitivities in the region, the partners in the process are willing to act together to combat this scourge that affects us all.
