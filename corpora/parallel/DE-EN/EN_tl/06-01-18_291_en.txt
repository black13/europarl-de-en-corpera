Madam President, I would first of all like to confirm that the Council agrees that, in parallel with the measures we are taking to counter terrorism and illegal immigration, it is also important that we develop programmes – as the European Union has been doing for some time – to improve conditions in the countries of origin.
We are committed to that, and it is also part of the agreement that the governments have reached on the financial perspectives.
We think that the funding is adequate.
It is now up to the Commission to put forward concrete proposals on how to fund the individual programmes from these overall figures that have been agreed.
Then the negotiations with the European Parliament must result in agreement on the financial perspectives.
