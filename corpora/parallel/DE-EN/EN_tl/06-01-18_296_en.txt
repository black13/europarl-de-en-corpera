Madam President, Mr Winkler, many thanks for your excellent response – I would not have expected anything else.
This January, it is 100 years since the Moravian Compromise came into force, which was quite exemplary; the only problem was that it only applied in Moravia.
We are now making the same mistake: we are seeking specific settlements and setting varying standards.
While provisions regarding minorities are being carefully drawn up in Kosovo, there is nothing similar in the Preševo valley or in Vojvodina.
I would just like to ask you to develop uniform or comparable standards for the region objectively: it is the only way we will be able to reach a peace agreement.
