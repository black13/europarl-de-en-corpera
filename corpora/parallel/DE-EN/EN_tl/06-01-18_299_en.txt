Madam President, I can confirm that the Council continues and will continue to take the view that implementation of the eight criteria laid down by the UN in respect of Kosovo must precede the final settlement of status.
The resolution is binding, it is applicable, and it is the axis on which the solution will be based.
Discussions have now commenced on the status of Kosovo, and we will follow them attentively.
According to the Thessaloniki Declaration, to which I have already referred, the future of Kosovo – and I would like to emphasise this again, because you mentioned the European Union's principles and values – is within the European Union, and that of course means that the EU's values must be accepted.
With regard to your question about the camp, that is a question that cannot be answered by Kosovo.
