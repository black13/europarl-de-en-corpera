Madam President, regarding Mr Bowis's question on the persecution and harassment of Christians, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion is enshrined in international legislation on the protection of human rights.
I would refer you in particular to Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which applies worldwide and in which freedom of thought, conscience and religion is laid down as an individual right.
This right, according to that article, includes freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of one's choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one's religion or belief in worship, observance, practice or teaching.
This human right is extremely important to the European Union, and it therefore regularly holds discussions with third countries on this subject, most recently in New York, where the EU Member States successfully proposed, in the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief.
The Council has repeatedly condemned all forms of intolerance based on religion and also pays close attention to developments in the field of human rights.
The Council uses the opportunities offered by its dialogue with third countries to make clear its concerns regarding intolerance towards religious and other minorities.
