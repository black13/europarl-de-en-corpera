Madam President, the European Union is monitoring the situation of the non-Muslim minorities extremely closely.
According to the EU-Turkey Accession Partnership, it is vital to the success of the accession negotiations that the Turkish Government undertake further reforms with respect to freedom of religion, particularly regarding the training of clerics and granting legal personality to non-Muslim minorities, in order to come more into line with the standards within the European Union in these areas too.
We will monitor this very closely in the process of the accession negotiations, but we will also support Turkey in implementing the necessary reforms.
