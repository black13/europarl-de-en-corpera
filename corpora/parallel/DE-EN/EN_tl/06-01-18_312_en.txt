Madam President, Mr Posselt, I do not really think it took any courage to talk to China.
Our dialogue with China – in which I have taken part myself – is very open and direct.
The issue you raised is, of course, being pursued not only in relation to China, but also to Turkey.
We have raised our concerns on the matter in our discussions with Turkey and will obviously continue to insist in future that the legal and administrative measures being established by Turkey in this respect are in line with our expectations in this domain, which of course correspond to international standards.
