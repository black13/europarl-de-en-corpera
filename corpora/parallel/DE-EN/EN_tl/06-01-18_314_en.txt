Madam President, with regard to Mrs Segelström's question on Colombia, although it has been reported by several sources that violations of human rights in Colombia are decreasing, any violation of human rights is a cause for concern.
The continuing internal armed conflict in Colombia is at the root of most of those violations, which are predominantly committed by illegal armed groups.
The EU is therefore constantly appealing to the parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law, and it is also in regular contact with, in particular, the Colombian authorities and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota.
I would also add that the Colombian vice-president was in Austria just before Christmas – I spoke to him myself, and in particular we had some very intensive discussions on the issue of human rights.
In its conclusions of 3 October 2005 the Council reaffirmed its full support for the Colombian Government, in particular in its efforts to impose the rule of law throughout the country and in the fight against terrorism and the production of and trade in illegal drugs.
The Council also reaffirmed its long-held policy of supporting the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including direct talks with the illegal armed groups that are willing to engage in a negotiated peace process.
We therefore welcome the fact that there has recently been contact between the illegal armed groups and the Colombian authorities, and we call on all those involved to do everything in their power to reach a peaceful resolution and thus to put an end to the internal armed conflict, which has now lasted for more than a generation, as the primary cause of human rights violations.
