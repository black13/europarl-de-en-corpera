Madam President, Mrs Segelstr√∂m, you have asked a question to which there is really no answer.
Are we in the European Union doing enough for the suffering in many countries?
This is a question that cannot really be answered in abstract terms.
We are doing our best.
However, I would like to point to some concrete initiatives connected with the Council's conclusions of last October, to which I have already referred, although I would add that most of these initiatives fall within the competency of the Commission.
For example, the Commission decided in December 2005 to provide EUR 1.5 million as part of the rapid reaction mechanism.
It remains to be seen whether that is enough or whether we can still do more.
