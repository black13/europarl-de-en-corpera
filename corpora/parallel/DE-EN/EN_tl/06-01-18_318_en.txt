Madam President, I cannot say at the moment whether such a conference will be held in the first half of 2006: it will depend on the troika of the G24 group – led by Mexico – reaching agreement with the Colombian government.
Any such conference would certainly take place very close to the EU-Latin America summit in mid-May 2006 and to the presidential elections in Colombia at the end of May.
The EU-Latin America summit, by the way, takes place exactly in the middle of the two stages of the election, and it is therefore not certain whether the Colombian President will be present at this conference in Vienna.
