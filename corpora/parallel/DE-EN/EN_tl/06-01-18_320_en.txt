Madam President, with regard to Mr Pafilis's question, I would refer to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
Although I am sure he is familiar with this document, I would nevertheless like to quote an extract from it: 'The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States'.
These rights include freedom of expression, and it is not up to the Council of the European Union to interfere in the decision-making process of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly.
The question relates to the activities of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, on which I cannot comment.
