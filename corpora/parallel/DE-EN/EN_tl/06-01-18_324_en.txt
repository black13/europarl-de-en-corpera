Madam President, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly can discuss any subject.
It is up to the Assembly to decide for itself which topics it wants to discuss.
However, it is of course also possible to put forward such proposals in discussions with national Members of the Parliamentary Assembly.
The European Union itself and the Council itself certainly cannot make this proposal to the body of another institution.
