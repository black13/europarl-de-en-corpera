Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you have chosen Mozart’s 250th anniversary, Chancellor, as one of the of your presidential programme.
Some other Members have taken up that theme.
With all due respect to Mozart, a different Austrian and European whose birth we commemorate this year would probably be more useful to us in providing therapy for Europe’s ailments.
I am thinking here of Sigmund Freud, whose work included the study of inferiority complexes, frustration and narcissism, all of them conditions which seem to affect the European psyche.
We have many inferiority complexes.
You referred yourself to the European way of life.
That is primarily a model built on social justice, a model we should be exporting.
We should not be importing neo-liberal models into Europe from other parts of the world.
I therefore appeal to you, Mr President-in-Office, to seek musical harmony with Condoleezza Rice and the Bush Administration but not to sing from their political song sheet.
Represent Europe self-confidently in the world.
Frustration, as we know from Freud, derives from unfulfilled expectations.
These are something that Europe provides all too often.
For example, we promise thirty priority transport projects, and then a Financial Perspective is adopted which makes it impossible to fund these projects from either European or national resources.
In Austria itself, your own Deputy Chancellor has already written off a project to which I attach great importance, namely the rail link between Prague and Linz.
All of this, I believe, has to do with another condition that is especially prevalent in the European Council, namely narcissism and excessive egocentricity, which repeatedly prevent us from bringing Europe any further forward.
