. – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, SMEs are now being given priority in all speeches – we have heard that from the Council Presidency today.
That is a good thing, and I should also like to state quite clearly here that this is also thanks to Commissioner Verheugen, who has given this subject long-overdue momentum.
We are obliged to him for this.
However, except in many speeches, this subject is not always dealt with appropriately.
We can see this in our own institution, as Parliament is starting its discussion at an hour not befitting the issue.
We should pull our own socks up too, therefore, and improve the way we deal with this subject.
Looking at the figures – which have been cited here – we can see that SMEs are our main point of contact for the Lisbon agenda.
Employing two-thirds of the workforce, they are the most important employers, but they are also innovators in many fields, being global leaders in niche and part-markets and also accounting for more than 50% of patents.
That means that, in these fields, Europe has the authority and the competence to provide direction that it so badly needs in global competition.
The financial resources that we allocate to SMEs contrast sharply with this.
In this regard it is plain to see that, in the Commission’s original budget allocation, which was a generous estimate, only 0.3% of all resources had fallen to SMEs.
Some of my fellow Members have raised the subject of the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (CIP).
As the rapporteur, I wish to raise an objection, as there have been cuts in this field.
We all agree that we need to increase these resources to the maximum.
Nevertheless, on the positive side, I should like to say that the Commissioner has appointed a representative for SMEs and, in Françoise Le Bail, has made a very good choice.
I should like to congratulate him on this and offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur on her sound report.
