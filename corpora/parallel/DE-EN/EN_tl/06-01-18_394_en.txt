. – Mr President, I should like to discuss the purpose of these Rules of Procedure and what has changed in them.
Their purpose is to fully ensure liveliness and spontaneity, whilst enabling Members to be called to order in cases of genuinely malicious, continuous disruption of the smooth conduct of parliamentary business.
These have been redefined and aspects of the rules that had hitherto been couched in very non-specific terms have been clarified: that is, the difference between the ‘normal’ Chair, the Chairman of a delegation or committee, or a Vice-President chairing this plenary assembly, and the one President – who is of course present in person today.
The ‘normal’ Chair may issue a reprimand, exclude from the Chamber a Member guilty of continuous disruption, and suspend a sitting, but the really unpleasant penalties may only be imposed by the President.
At first it sounds surprising that the President alone, without plenary, may impose an effective penalty thus, but this is corrected or balanced out by the introduction of a right of appeal, so that Members who consider that they have been unfairly treated by the President may appeal and any penalty wrongfully imposed can then be rectified.
A genuinely new aspect is that breaches of the rules governing confidentiality may now also be penalised.
Another new aspect is that there has been some increase in the possible penalties.
Up to now, it has been possible to suspend a Member from his or her duties for two to five days, but the new period would be between two and ten days.
I share Mr Onesta’s opinion that this is a balanced draft, a proposal that permits liveliness and nevertheless ensures the smooth conduct of business.
Our group will therefore support this proposal.
