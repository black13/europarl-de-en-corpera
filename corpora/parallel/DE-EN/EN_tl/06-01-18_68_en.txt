Mr President, following consultation with the Liberals and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like, with particular regard to the wishes of the latter, to change the wording of our amendment from ‘non-UK consumers’ to ‘non-European citizens’.
I do not need to give an explanation for this; it is self-evident that ‘non-European citizens’ is a great deal broader a term than the reference only to ‘consumers’.
Consultation with the Liberals leads me to ask that ‘UK legislation’ be changed to ‘UK and/or EU legislation’.
That is self-explanatory and the purpose of the change is obvious.
