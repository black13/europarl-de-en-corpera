Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the opposition of the Socialist Group in this House to Mr Costaâ€™s amendment, and will say two things to justify that stance.
Let me begin with the last point that Mr Costa addressed.
What went on here the day before yesterday was, predominantly, what one would expect of an ordinary demonstration by men and women who feel their social security threatened.
These men and women can count on us.
Those who cannot count on Socialists such as ourselves are those who never wait to hear the end of an argument and those who believe that violence can be a political instrument.
We are not in solidarity with them.
They were in a minority, and we repudiate what they did.
Mr President, the ports package is ripe for the vote, it is ripe for rejection, and so we ask that the vote be proceeded with now.
