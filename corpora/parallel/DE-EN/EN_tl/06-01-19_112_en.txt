Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I voted today in favour of Mr Fruteau’s reports on reform of the sugar market, I did so quite deliberately, for the sugar market in the EU is a very sensitive one.
Sugar beet is an important product for many of our farmers, being one that can be cultivated in places where the conditions are too adverse for other agricultural produce, and so well-considered reform is vital if the survival of farms – the small and medium-sized ones in particular – is to be ensured.
Reform is needed, but the Commission’s ideas about it again far overshoot the goal, and so we are today calling for even smaller cuts in the price of sugar and beet, more support for the cultivation of sustainable raw materials as a substitute for the cultivation of beet and higher compensation payments.
The Council, too, has seen the need for adjustments and has, in its decision, referred to many of our demands.
The Council decision in itself amounts to a triumph for this House and for Europe’s sugar-beet farmers, but the cuts still go too far.
In the light of these events, I think it sends completely the wrong signal that the Council should, at the Commission’s insistence, formulate a statement of intent even before Parliament has voted.
I believe that the amendments we have proposed today represent an even better way.
What we have here is a good reform; I want a better one.
It is for that that I stand, and for that that I, today, have voted.
