These are the reasons why I still reject the EU Constitution:
1.
If we are to have any hope of a social and civil Europe, the Constitutional Treaty for the EU must once and for all be consigned to the archives.
2.
The EU Constitution is intended to significantly accelerate the militarisation of the EU and (in III-311) lays down a whole range of militaristic projects.
3.
The EU Constitution is intended to prepare the EU to be able to wage war on a global scale.
It opens up scope for worldwide military interventions (I-41,1 and III-309).
4.
The Constitutional Treaty for the EU includes an explicit obligation to rearm (I-41,3).
If it were to be ratified, there would be an even greater tendency to spend more money on armaments.
5.
With the Constitutional Treaty for the EU, the EU’s foreign policy would be bound only by the principles of the UN Charter rather than by the Charter as a whole (I-3,4).
This would make it possible for the EU to interpret them in such a way as to be able to wage war even without a UN mandate.
6.
The Constitutional Treaty for the EU serves as a programmatic blueprint, making it possible to push the militarisation of the EU forward without reference to the treaties as they currently stand.
Among the examples of this are the extension of the EU Armaments Agency (III-311) and the establishment of the Battle Groups (III-312).
7.
The Constitutional Treaty for the EU is intended to put neo-liberalism on a constitutional footing (III-177), something of which the anti-social Bolkestein directive is but an initial foretaste.
The proposal by the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, that a repeat vote be engineered in France and the Netherlands by adding to the EU Constitution a declaration on the ‘social dimension’ of Europe which would not be legally binding is nothing short of scandalous.
