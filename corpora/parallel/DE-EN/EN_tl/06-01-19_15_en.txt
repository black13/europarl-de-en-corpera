Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union’s role as a promoter of democracy and economic development and as an honest broker between the parties in the Middle East conflict must in my opinion be welcomed unreservedly.
The fact that the EU is also sending many millions of euros to the Middle East is also justified in this connection – including the EUR 1.5 million you mentioned for the Palestinian elections, Commissioner.
We also need to ensure, however, that the results of such democratic elections are accepted by all sides, even if the election winners include political forces – such as Hamas – that we perhaps do not like so much.
If the EU wants to be an honest broker in the Palestine conflict, it must speak out much more strongly in favour of the two-State solution.
Persuading Israel to offer the Palestinian territories the necessary space for democratic and economic development will be an essential step in this direction.
Only a genuine improvement in the Palestinians’ living conditions will make them turn away from political radicalism and terror.
If the EU is to be able to play such a valuable role as mediator in this very problematical geopolitical area, however, it must not become a front-line state or party to the conflict itself.
That is why I would like to take this opportunity once again to warn against full accession for Turkey to the EU.
That would put the European Union on the front line with Iran, Iraq, Syria and also, indirectly, with Palestine.
