The report, which this House has voted on today, by the British Conservative MEP Charles Tannock, reinforces once more the outlines of the EU’s neighbourhood policy, which is intended to pursue the EU’s geopolitical interests while being cloaked in rhetoric about human rights.
1.
The intention is that the EU’s neighbourhood policy should be a means towards creating a geopolitical sphere of influence for the European Union and its Member States, its efforts being aimed at the creation of ‘privileged partnerships’ for the neighbouring countries, including those of the South Caucasus.
2.
The report is quite frank about the geostrategic direction of the neighbourhood policy being towards securing the supply of raw materials for the EU.
‘Energy policy’ is to be an important theme in the EU’s neighbourhood policy, as the EU ‘is surrounded by the world’s most important reserves of oil and natural gas (Russia, the Caspian basin, the Middle East and North Africa)’.
It repeatedly emphasises the geostrategic significance of such transit countries as Georgia and Armenia.
4.
The plan is that the EU’s influence should be underpinned by bringing about regime change in Belarus and elsewhere.
All that is needed is to consider the different treatment meted out to Belarus and Uzbekistan, the latter of which tolerates the presence of EU Member States’ military bases, such as the German one in Termez, for it to become clear that the primary concern here is with the extension of the EU’s sphere of influence.
5.
In terms of military policy, too, the neighbouring countries are being locked in to the EU, the idea being that they should be able to take part in military interventions and participate in the military structures of the EU.
