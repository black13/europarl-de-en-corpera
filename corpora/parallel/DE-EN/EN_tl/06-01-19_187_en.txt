Mr President, it has been said today, several times over, that this resolution is not directed against anyone, but that the European Parliament rejoices at this turn of events, and welcomes the cooperation between Peru and Chile that has resulted in Fujimori being arrested.
The European Parliament, furthermore, supports Peru’s application for Fujimori’s extradition, and calls on the Peruvian authorities, as a matter of policy, to make sure that all witnesses receive comprehensive protection.
Both of these are important factors in getting Fujimori to answer – as he must – for the human rights abuses and the corruption that went on in his country.
The struggle against ‘impunity, is not just one of the main pillars of the European Union’s foreign policy, but also one of the foundations underpinning all states governed according to the rule of law.
There are not a few Latin American states in which an excess of impunity has left so many open wounds, and they add up to yet another reason for supporting this cause and advancing it.
