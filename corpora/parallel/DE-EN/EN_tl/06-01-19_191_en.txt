Mr President, on 30 December 2005, the Egyptian security forces cleared a camp that had been set up in front of the UNHCR’s main office in Cairo in September of that year as a temporary home for over 2 500 Sudanese migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.
In doing this, the security forces acted with great brutality, and the outcome of their actions is a very, very sad one: 30 dead and over 60 injured.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior tried to pin the blame on the Sudanese, claiming that they had panicked and tried to flee, but journalists who were present report that nothing of the sort happened.
If we adopt this resolution, we in this House will be joining a number of leading figures in the United Nations who have already denounced these occurrences.
The UN’s Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, was critical of the security forces’ brutality and said that there could be no justification for this sort of violence and that this loss of human life was indefensible.
It is a good thing that the Egyptian authorities have now decided to investigate what happened.
We call on the Egyptian Government to allow the involvement in these investigations of human rights experts from the United Nations and independent Egyptian human rights organisations.
Since respect for human rights is fundamental to Egypt’s association agreement with the European Union, we urge the Council and the Commission to raise these incidents at the next meeting of the EU’s Association Council with Egypt.
The last thing I want to say is that I would like to move two oral amendments before the vote.
