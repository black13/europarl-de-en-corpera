Mr President, I wish, on behalf of my group, to move a correction to Recital F, which should refer, not to 462 Sudanese nationals, but to 650, that being the number of persons threatened with deportation.
We also wish to move, as part of the same amendment, that this change be made to paragraph 5 as well.
I have checked the French, Spanish and German versions, and the change has already been made in them.
I would ask you to request the services to examine all the language versions with this in view.
