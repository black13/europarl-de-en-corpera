Mr President, I refer to Rule 168 in conjunction with Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure and would like in this connection to ask the Commission whether it is able to accept the amendments adopted by Parliament in this report, in particular Amendment 14, under which 50% of the restructuring funds, which total EUR 6 billion, will go to the producers.
This amendment was voted on by the Committee.
The amendment was tabled by Mr Goepel.
I would also like to ask the Commission to accept Amendments 10 and 11, which require an economic development plan to be submitted for the region when restructuring measures are to be introduced, such development plans to be notified by the Commission and the Member State in question.
