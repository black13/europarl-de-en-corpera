Mr President, I wish, as chairman of the committee, to thank the rapporteurs for working through one of the most important issues to concern us in 2006 at a time when much is in flux, and, in my capacity as a German MEP, to give the services a series of corrections.
The German translation is sometimes misleading and sometimes wrong, with – to give just one example – the term ‘European papers’ translated as ‘Euro papers’.
It is not paper that we want to produce, but political substance.
I shall let you have a series of corrections.
