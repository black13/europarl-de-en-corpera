Mr President, my group does not agree that Amendment 2, tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, lapses if our Amendment 24 is approved.
As we see it, they do not contradict one another but are mutually compatible, so that it is possible to vote in favour of both of them.
