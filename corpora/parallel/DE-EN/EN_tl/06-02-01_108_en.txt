Mr President, when this House discusses financial matters, it is not very often that I am much less forthright than those who have spoken before me.
Although this national responsibility is something I dare not even dream of, I have not forgotten, Mr Winkler, what your Chancellor – and mine – said, standing in this Chamber where you are now, regarding the issue of subsidies using EU funds.
Chancellor Schüssel's words, in his capacity as President of the Council, were: 'It is only right that such information should be published so that people know who has actually benefited'.
I will repeat that: 'It is only right that such information should be published'.
So publish it!
In some Member States, where they are much more critical about many things, such as the United Kingdom, for example, that goes without saying.
Let Austria be a shining example to follow, and finally tell us what happens with the 80%!
Who gets what, how much and when?
My second request, which you might find rather easier: side with your own political group, namely with Mrs Gräßle.
She is introducing reforms in the new Financial Regulation with which we will really be able to work, and with which you will very easily be able to ward off unjustified criticism – provided, that is, that you become more transparent.
