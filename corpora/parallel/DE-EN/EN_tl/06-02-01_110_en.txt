.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have paid close attention to your comments and will, of course, pass on to the Council the opinions you have expressed.
However, I would like to repeat one thing: I am here to represent the Council and the Member States; in other words, the opinions expressed by the Presidency of the Council here are those expressed in a unanimous vote in the Council.
I am sorry if I have disappointed some of you, but there is nothing more I can say at this stage.
I can, however, reiterate – and I hope you will be so kind as to accept this – that we have agreed to examine, in connection with the 2004 discharge process, the action plan drafted by the Commission.
I can also confirm that the Council will continue to support the Commission in its efforts to make an active contribution to financial management at all levels.
It is a matter of certainty that the Council will take on its share of responsibility, which it has no intention of abdicating.
We will continue to work with the Commission to find solutions that everybody, including all of you in this House, can accept.
I am afraid that, at this relatively early stage of the Austrian Presidency, I cannot say any more.
