Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I really just wanted to end by saying that the Council is well aware of how important this issue is.
It is also not true that the Council is inactive or even uninterested in the situation of fish stocks and fisheries in the Mediterranean.
For reasons on which the Presidency will not comment, it has not yet reached agreement.
The Austrian Presidency has now taken over this matter and will work actively towards a solution.
As I said, the intention is to deal with this issue in the Council in April this year.
