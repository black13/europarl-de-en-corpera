Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about the future of postal services, we should start by considering what we are trying to achieve.
The completion of the internal market cannot be an end in itself, but should – as it says in all the declarations of intent – bring positive results for the citizens of Europe.
However, it can already be seen that several states where services have been diluted have recorded a huge impact on remote regions and areas with low population densities.
People in poorly accessible areas must also not be cut off from services.
The idea that opening up the market would, as the rapporteur stated in committee, automatically guarantee that services would be provided to the proverbial old lady in the mountains has since been proved wrong by some classic examples.
For that reason, a study like the one that has been prepared should not pose the questions in a way that practically presupposes the desired answer, as has been done in point 13, for example.
This point clearly shows the author's desire to get a certain answer – so clearly, in fact, that it almost makes the study superfluous.
If we commission a study, we must be prepared to face up to the whole truth.
