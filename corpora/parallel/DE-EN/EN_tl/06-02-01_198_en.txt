Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Toubon, many thanks for the excellent report that you have just presented.
To Mr Harbour, I would say that it is very important that we respect the cultures and traditions of the Member States.
We should always do that in our legislation.
I think my group will also support these amendments â€“ that will not be a problem.
Commissioner Verheugen, you have just said that we need better regulation and, above all, better implementation of Community law.
I absolutely agree with you there, but I would also remind you that it is up to the Commission to ensure that Community law is actually implemented.
I would ask you to be very strict on these issues, because I, as a European, want the decisions we make in Europe actually to be implemented.
On the other hand, you also said that you take as the benchmark the average consumer, as does the European Court of Justice.
That is understandable: we all need a point of reference to work from.
As a social democrat, however, my benchmark in such cases is precisely those people who are not average, because they are disabled, because they are elderly, or because, for whatever reason, they are taking the various opportunities that are available in the Member States and are provided by companies.
It is in these cases in particular that reliability when purchasing basic foodstuffs like bread and milk is especially important.
That is why we must ensure that this reliability is maintained in our shops, and why we will agree to the rapporteur's proposals.
