Mr President, further to Mr Solana’s reference to the Balkans, I would just like to take the opportunity of saying that we give our wholehearted backing to his efforts in a place where we bear direct responsibility for peace in Europe; this is something that nobody else can shoulder for us, and we must credibly and undeviatingly develop the region’s European perspective.
I would like to congratulate you on the decision you took on Monday evening, in which you successfully brought together the very diverse things that are being said in Europe about Iran.
I would appeal to all, while going down the road thus set out, to leave plenty of room for diplomatic manoeuvre and negotiation.
The prospect of the Iranians’ meeting with China and Russia now going ahead is good news, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the decision as to whether the red line has been crossed and world peace put in jeopardy is for neither Mr Schüssel nor Mr Steinmeier to take, but for the United Nations and nobody else.
We cannot control the situation on our own, and it is difficult, when dealing with a hate preacher such as Ahmadinejad, to keep looking for new ways to make him see reason – the reason that is part of the European security strategy that you have set out, which is founded upon non-proliferation.
We know that, if the situation in Iran were to escalate, it would be an enormous threat to the things that it is in our interests to defend – the prevention of nuclear weapons ending up in Iranian hands, the reduction of the threat to Israel and more security for it.
I therefore hope that we will find a peaceful way forward, difficult though that task may be.
Let me say, in my capacity as chair of the delegation, that there is another voice in Iran.
I will not let diplomatic relations …
