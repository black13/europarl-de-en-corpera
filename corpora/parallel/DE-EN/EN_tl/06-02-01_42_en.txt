Mr President, the implication of Mr Wurtz’s question to Mr Solana as to what had improved in the last two years is that decisive improvements in the state of the world are in some way within the power of the European Union to decide upon and bring into effect.
Those who wanted to see a multipolar world with the might of its only superpower reduced can hardly be surprised that this is the case.
What some Members have said tends to reflect their Eurocentric views and their disappointment at our place in this multipolar world.
I can do no other than bid them welcome to a world that has, alas, become no more pleasant for being multipolar and for being home to burgeoning new powers on a global and regional scale.
We Europeans are far from that badly off in this situation, and I join with those who have congratulated Mr Solana on reaching, with China and Russia, a joint decision on the issue of whether to make Iran’s nuclear ambitions a matter for the Security Council.
While I can only hope that that bears fruit, I am far from dissatisfied with the present approach.
