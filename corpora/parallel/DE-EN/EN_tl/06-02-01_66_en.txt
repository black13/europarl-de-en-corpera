Madam President, the new Palestinian parliament is one that has emerged from elections that the international community has internationally recognised.
We respect this result and will support President Abu Mazen as he tries to put together a government that will be strong in its defence of international law and in its opposition to violence.
It therefore appears perverse that the threat should today be made to turn off the flow of European funding to the Palestinian Authority.
If that were to happen, there would be a risk of aggressive states and groupings taking the EU’s place and of unemployed Palestinian soldiers and police officers being recruited by Al-Qaeda.
Let us remind ourselves of the fact that, on 13 June 1980, at the Venice Summit, the EC recognised the PLO.
It went on, through dialogue, to guide what had once been a terrorist organisation along the path that led to it recognising Israel’s right to exist and participation in the peace process.
Hamas’ election victory now presents us with a similar challenge.
It is worthy of note that the USA, before the elections, made it known that there had to be talks with Hamas, despite its being on the list of terrorist organisations.
The European Parliament must now make its own constructive contribution and, as soon as possible, invite a delegation from the newly-elected Palestinian Assembly to Brussels, for it is now that confidence-building measures – rather than threatening gestures – are urgently called for.
