Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, here we are, reacting with astonishment to something that is actually self-explanatory: an election being won by a party that gave people the feeling that it cared about them, while the others could be written off as a crew of corrupt crooks.
There are conclusions that we have to draw from this.
We have to work even more to make EU aid visible, for by so doing we will get the message across to the public that peace and democracy are worth supporting.
I believe it is not just governments that need to hear that.
This election result is a disaster for the region.
One can certainly talk in terms of a five-year rhythm here: it was about ten years ago that Rabin died, and terrorist acts meant that Peres was not elected; five years later saw the start of the Intifada, and now here we are again.
Things keep starting over and over again from square one.
Even so, I do not believe that we should abandon hope of Hamas playing its part in development, but we do have to spell out the conditions under which that is possible.
If, on the basis of the seats won in the parliament, Hamas takes over the Palestinian Authority, it must agree to renounce violence, to acknowledge Israelâ€™s right to exist and accept the agreements already reached, or else everything will have to start again from the ground up.
My hope is that this will happen before the Israeli elections, so that we can avoid the sort of adverse occurrences that would make it harder for us to get back together.
During this period, the quartet will need to make it clear that, if it works, financial aid will be forthcoming and security will be guaranteed.
It is for that reason that I am so glad that the quartet responded so quickly at the weekend.
I would also like to express my gratitude to Mrs De Keyser and her team and also to our parliamentary delegation, led by Mr McMillan-Scott, for their work.
