Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate: I have listened attentively and taken on board a number of points for myself and for the Council.
It seems to me that we are called upon to continue to defend actively the values that the European Union represents – respect for human rights, and the defence of the fundamental freedoms of expression and assembly.
I have also noted the House’s desire that we should continue to provide active support to the peaceful opposition and that we should press for the release of prisoners.
It is nevertheless a fact – and we must acknowledge this – that our options are limited if Cuba does not show at least a minimum level of goodwill.
And, to be honest, the confrontation and embargo policy that has sometimes been proposed in the past has also not brought the desired results.
We therefore think that we should continue with our policy of critical dialogue, involvement and encouraging reform.
