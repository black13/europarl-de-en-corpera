The year 1997 saw the beginning of the liberalisation process in the European postal market, the intention of which was to create an open market accessible to every service provider in what are now 25 Member States.
The national postal services responded to the pressure from this liberalisation process by starting to change their structures and to reposition themselves.
All this progress notwithstanding, the transposition of the directive at national level needs to be closely observed.
It is, for example, unacceptable that Austrian postal legislation should impose disproportionately high sanctions on those who omit to fit new letterboxes on their houses.
That is not something for which the EUâ€™s 2002 Post Directive can be blamed, for it prescribed no such sanctions at national level.
Implementing directives in this way further encourages the public in their sceptical attitude towards the EU, and in their belief that the responsibility for this state of affairs lies with Brussels and nowhere else.
I call on the Commission to monitor the transposition of the Postal Directive with a particular view to ensuring that the penalties planned at national level are not disproportionate and do not imperil the functioning of the postal market.
This should be given priority as a matter for examination in the forthcoming prospective study.
Since this own-initiative report makes the same demand as I do, I welcome it.
