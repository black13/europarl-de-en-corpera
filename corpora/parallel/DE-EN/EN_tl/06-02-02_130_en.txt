I reject this resolution on Cuba, which is one-sided and does no justice whatsoever to the complexities of real life in that country.
If we condemn Cuba,
– we are treating as of no account that country’s efforts at developing in another way, which it is doing in the teeth of resistance from many quarters;
– we are ignoring Cuba’s exemplary achievement in making provision for its people’s welfare, which it continues to do despite the American embargo and serious economic problems;
– we are denying that the continued existence of the Cuban system offers a glimmer of hope to those in the so-called Third World who are on the losing side in a globalised world in which markets and profits matter more than anything else.
This resolution takes a reductivist view of the concept of human rights, and the way it makes use of them betrays an intolerable dual morality.
This resolution is not aimed at defending human rights, but rather at condemning the Cuban system and contributing to its downfall.
I will have no part in it.
