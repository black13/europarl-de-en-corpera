Mr President, digital technology is being used in more and more fields, and so we can hope that the digital journey recorder, too, will do ‘just what it says on the tin’.
I regard the new system as being very much to be welcomed – after all, it is intended, in combination with information and communications systems, to be a simple fleet management tool and to be indispensable in enforcing professional drivers driving times and rest periods.
In doing that, the intention is that it should enhance road safety and prevent social dumping.
We should, however, be under no illusions about the fact that the conversion to digital will achieve its object only if what has been announced – the more frequent checks, including on the vehicle’s roadworthiness – actually happen.
It is frequently the case that vehicles – those from Eastern Europe, for example – are not actually roadworthy.
When one considers the many and various ways in which analogue monitoring devices can be manipulated, digital technology really does seem to bring improvements in its wake, but I do believe that new ways of interfering with it will soon be found.
It is indeed the case that newly-registered HGVs without working tachographs can be decommissioned after May 2006, but, in the absence of any requirement that older vehicles be upgraded, crafty hauliers will probably find a way of using this to their own benefit.
The question also arises of to what extent recourse will be had to vehicles licensed in other countries or preferential treatment given to firms based in them.
It is to be hoped that this will not turn out to be another example of a good idea being turned to EU businesses’ competitive disadvantage.
