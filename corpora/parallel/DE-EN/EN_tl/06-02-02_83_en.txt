The regulation on the harmonisation of social legislation relating to road transport was intended to introduce into the road transport sector uniform rules on working conditions and road safety that had been needed for a long time.
It remains to be seen whether the social position of the drivers concerned will actually be improved as a result of this agreement.
We may at last have achieved standardised driving times and rest periods in the road transport sector, but the final version does not incorporate, among other features that are of importance to me, comprehensive references to the Working Time Directive.
I find it deeply regrettable that the regulation we have adopted today will include no ban on drivers being paid according to the distances travelled and the quantities carried, something for which I have argued passionately as a means towards improving lorry-drivers’ social conditions.
Fixed rates of pay really do protect every worker’s livelihood and I believe that workers in the road transport industry are entitled to that.
The decision to bring about uniform social standards in European road transport is, in general terms, the right one to take, but, when I consider the improvements I initially hoped to see to the conditions of lorry drivers, this result really does bring us down to earth.
I can therefore do no other than vote against both these dossiers.
