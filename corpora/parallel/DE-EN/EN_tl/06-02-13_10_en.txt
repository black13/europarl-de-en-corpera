Mr President, now that the two big groups have realised that everything is connected, we too can depict everything in its proper context.
For a start, Mr Poettering is right to say that the Liberals, in the Conference of Presidents, said that they were not in favour of a broader debate and not in favour of a resolution either.
It was we who, in the Conference of Presidents, expressed the desire for a resolution.
We do not think that the number of speakers matters, but we certainly do think it right that more speakers should be given the floor if the groups feel the need for it.
We are always, as a matter of principle, in favour of resolutions, and we see it as important that this House should adopt one.
We are, however, dead against the idea that the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be taken out of the debate, for the issue of the constitution is a live one in Bosnia at the moment, and it is of the utmost importance that this House should deliver a position in the aftermath of so many American initiatives.
It would therefore be absurd to defer discussion of it, and we are against that.
If we do not manage to adopt a resolution now, then we can go down the third way and have a debate now and leave dealing with the resolution to the next part-session.
