Mr President, that is something of which we have to take note.
The question arises of whether we can come back to Mr Cohn-Bendit’s proposal that, in view of the current situation and Mr Solana’s visit to these countries, we could adopt the resolution at the next part-session.
I see that as a reasonable compromise on which we might agree.
