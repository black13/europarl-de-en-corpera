Mr President, a member of the Liberal Group has put several motions to the House.
The Rules of Procedure provide for a decision for or against them.
We in this plenary, rather than discussing whether to vote for or against a motion intended to correct a decision by the Conference of Presidents, are staging a rerun of it.
The only speakers in this debate are group chairmen arguing against their decision being corrected, and the reference to Mr Solana is obviously meant to indicate that the House is willing to refrain from exerting its influence, but the fact is that, if we wait until he has got back, this House will scarcely be able to have any influence on his policy.
I propose that we stick to the Rules of Procedure and call speakers to speak for or against, rather than having the House repeat what has been said in the Conference of Presidents.
