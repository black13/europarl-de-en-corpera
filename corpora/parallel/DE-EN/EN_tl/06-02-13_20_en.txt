I can tell Mr Poettering that I am opposed, and I also want to explain why.
This week, this whole House is going to have its hands full of this Services Directive, and I see no chance of a proper resolution and compromise in these three days.
That, after all, is why we proposed it last week!
That is why I think Mr Swobodaâ€™s suggestion is a sensible one.
This House does indeed need a resolution on this issue, but it also needs to be given the chance to put a proper resolution together, and that is why we should start the debate now and then follow it up by voting on this resolution at the next part-session.
That would be the sensible thing to do.
All you will be able to adopt in these three days is banalities, and I believe that this issue deserves better than that.
