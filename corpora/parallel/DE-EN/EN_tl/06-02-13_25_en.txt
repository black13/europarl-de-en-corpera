Mr President, this conflict is being discussed not only throughout Europe, not just in all the newspapers, not just by the man and woman in the street day in and day out; it is a conflict with profound implications and is being talked about around the world.
It surely cannot be the case that one institution alone does not discuss it, does not adopt a resolution on it, that the European Parliament, which the people elected to represent them, should choose to keep silent about one of the greatest conflicts Europe has seen.
It just cannot be true!
