Mr President, we always listen to you, not only out of respect for your office but also out of regard for you personally.
We must, of course, vote on these points one by one, but they are interconnected, and so I have to say something about how and why that is so.
Let me say at the outset, though, that this is something that we could have sorted out on Thursday in the Conference of Presidents.
I was the only one to demand, on behalf of my group, not only a resolution but also a debate.
As the Liberals were very definitely opposed to the idea, I am astonished that they have now put forward this motion, but that is their right.
We have just now – while in a meeting of our group – been informed that the Liberals were making this request.
To one part of it, we say ‘yes’; to another, we say ‘no’.
We say ‘no’ to a general debate right now, since that would require us to remove an item from the order of business, and that we do not want to do.
We therefore recommend that this House should, in March or at some appropriate time, have a wide-ranging debate on this issue, but, as far as a resolution is concerned, our group did – as in the past – take the view that we need one.
That being so, Mr President, you are quite right to have us vote on the individual points separately.
