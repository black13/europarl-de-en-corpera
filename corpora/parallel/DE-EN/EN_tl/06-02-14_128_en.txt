Mr President, the EU may well have made a great thing of respect for human rights and democracy – indeed, admission to the European Union is dependent upon them – but it has certainly failed in that respect where Turkey is concerned.
Not only is that country nowhere near finally acknowledging that the Armenian genocide actually happened, but it also threatens punitive sanctions against those journalists who voice any sort of criticism of it, and it also has to be said that there have been markedly retrograde developments on the freedom of opinion and of the press front since negotiations began.
The fact that, in 2004, 11% of applications for asylum by Turks were accepted, and that Turkey, in 2005, was the member state of the Council of Europe most frequently condemned by the European Court for Human Rights have to be seen in this light.
It follows that its record on observance of human rights cannot be a particularly good one.
Over and above that, the recent murder of a Catholic priest in Turkey – a crime motivated by politics and religion – shows that Turkey is either unable or unwilling to protect the minorities within it.
It will take more than the EUR 500 million pre-accession aid paid out this year to make Turkey top of the class on human rights.
