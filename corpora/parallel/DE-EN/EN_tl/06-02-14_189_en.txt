Madam President, I am afraid I must disturb the show of harmony somewhat and point out that the Commission has done the European union a disservice with the Bolkestein Directive.
It does not even have the excuse of having inherited it, since it failed to withdraw the directive last March.
Bolkestein divides Europe into poor and rich, into east and west.
Bolkestein is a draft with few winners and many losers.
It is not a step forward, but a step backward for European integration.
We need a services directive with a win-win situation, a services directive that combines freedom to provide services with recognition of each Member State’s social rights and the protection of workers.
The country-of-origin principle, on the other hand, risks a downward spiral of social rights in Europe.
Many people from all over Europe, from France, Italy, Poland and Germany, are on the streets of Strasbourg today to protest against it.
They are not protesting against the European Union, they are protesting against Europe’s drifting into neoliberalism, against the splitting of Europe.
We already have laws in the European Union that have introduced the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work at an equal workplace’ into legislation in the cross-border provision of services.
That is a win-win situation in legislation.
And that principle is now to be undermined.
Do I understand that rightly, Mr Bolkestein?
If Parliament deletes Articles 24 and 25 from the Commission draft, you intend bringing forward a new proposal?
That, Mr Bolkestein, no: that, Mr McCreevy – it was a slip of the tongue, but perhaps it was right – means you must undermine the Posted Workers Directive retrospectively!
Not if we can help it, Commissioner!
What you say shows there was good reason for so many to be on Strasbourg’s streets today.
