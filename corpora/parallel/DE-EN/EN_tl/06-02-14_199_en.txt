Mr President, honourable Member, the talks about Kosovo are currently taking place under the aegis of the United Nations.
The stabilisation and association process is a process taking place under the auspices of the European Union.
It would probably be unwise to speculate at this time about what would happen if this or that were to occur.
Both these processes must continue.
Ultimately they will have to merge.
It is of course also clear, whatever status is decided for Kosovo, that Kosovo too must have a European perspective, whatever form it may take.
We should not allow ourselves to be influenced by the question of status negotiations at this point, but press ahead with the stabilisation and association process for Serbia-Montenegro.
