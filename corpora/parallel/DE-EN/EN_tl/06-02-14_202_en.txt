Mr President, in the interests of the stability of the European Union, the fact that Austria is involving itself in South East Europe is very much to be welcomed.
We now know that there may be a vote on the independence of the territory of Montenegro in April.
To what extent can or will the European Unionâ€™s strategy towards this new state of Montenegro change?
What forms of support should the EU then give for the building of a stable country?
