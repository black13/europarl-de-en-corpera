Mr President, in answer to this question I would like to say that it would probably not be wise at this time to anticipate how the potential outcome of a possible referendum might affect the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro or between a possible new state of Montenegro and the European Union; we do not even know under what conditions such a referendum will be held.
At all events, the Presidency and the Commission want to see Serbia and Montenegro make the fastest possible progress on integration into European structures.
That is our aim.
We cannot at present say how this will be interpreted if the two parts of the existing state are separated.
However, and this is perhaps the direct answer to your question, we certainly do not want the process of convergence with the European Union to be interrupted, even if Montenegro should become independent.
We must be prepared for all possibilities.
For the present, however, the process must be continued coherently and we must be prepared for all eventualities.
