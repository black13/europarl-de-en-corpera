Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, there was a material background to the Austrian Chancellorâ€™s criticism, namely the fact that there are problems of numbers and financial problems between Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany over access to higher education, similar to those that have arisen between France and Belgium.
Because of the differences in size, it is hard for the smaller Member State in each case to guarantee everything, financially and organisationally, that completely unrestricted access to higher education would require.
Does Austria see any answers to the specific problem of access to higher education, and if so, what?
