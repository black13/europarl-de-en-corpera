Like the European Parliament and the Commission, the Council rates the potential of education very highly for achieving the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives.
It has a very important contribution to make and is certainly also one of the things on which we need to concentrate if we want to achieve the objectives that the Lisbon Strategy has set for itself.
As well as approving the new integrated guidelines for growth and employment, which comprise the broad guidelines for economic policies and the employment guidelines, we believe it is also important to give some thought to the mutual compatibility of the Lisbon Strategy and the Bologna Process in the ongoing debate about the future of the European Union and its institutions.
The Bologna Process, which will involve the establishment of a European area of higher education by 2010, is of great importance for our young people in particular.
The reason for this is probably that the rules governing access to higher education are caught between the rights of the EU’s citizens in the internal market on the one hand and the strict observance of Member State responsibility for course contents and the shaping of the education system, which is anchored in the EC Treaty, on the other.
This tension exists in other areas of the Lisbon Strategy as well, where national competences confront European objectives and solutions have to be found that do justice to both principles.
It is particularly great in education.
That is why it is important that we find common solutions in this area in particular, because we shall not be able to achieve the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives without improving access to education.
