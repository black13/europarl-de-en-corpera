Mr President, Mr Landsbergis, I can only agree with you.
The Council fully shares your concern – and the concern of many – about Russia’s continuing reluctance to sign and ratify the border agreements with Estonia and Latvia.
I cannot agree with you on another point, however.
The European Union is by no means an indifferent observer, as you put it, but is regularly and quite clearly voicing this concern in talks with Russia, most recently at the Troika meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union and Russia in November 2005.
It will continue to do so for as long as is necessary.
If I remember rightly, there is another Troika meeting between Russia and the European Union tomorrow, at which this matter will no doubt also be raised.
