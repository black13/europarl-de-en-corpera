Mr President, the Russian side repeatedly complains that the Baltic States are not meeting their obligations, especially so far as the Russian minorities in those States are concerned.
There have been difficulties, especially in Latvia, over the question of naturalisation and the full restoration of civil rights for the Russian minority.
What does the Council intend to do with regard to these Member States?
Or how do you see this problem?
