Mr President, in its dialogue with Russia the Council regularly points out that, as Member States of the European Union, the Baltic States have of course satisfied the Copenhagen criteria and that the treatment of the Russian minority is therefore also consistent with the relevant standards of international law, especially the Council of Europe and OSCE recommendations, and that the way to naturalisation and obtaining full civil rights is open to the Russian minority.
The Council is therefore perfectly plain in underlining that the rights of the minorities are respected and that the European Union is also making great efforts in practice to combat every kind of discrimination in the Member States.
Such discrimination is not in accord with the relevant rules or the Copenhagen criteria.
It goes without saying that every Member State of the European Union is required to abide by those rules.
