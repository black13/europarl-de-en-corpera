Mr President, I would just like to ask whether the Council is aware that the Baltic Statesâ€™ problems arose because the Baltic States were occupied for decades under the Hitler-Stalin Pact in violation of international law.
Today they form the border between Russia and the European Union.
Does the Council believe that recognition of that border should be made dependent on any conditions, or is it not rather up to Russia to recognise this border with the European Union as a precondition for good and fruitful relations?
