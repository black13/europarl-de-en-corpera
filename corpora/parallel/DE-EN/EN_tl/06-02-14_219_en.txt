Mr President, of course the recognition of borders cannot be made dependent on conditions, let me make that absolutely clear.
Let me tell you something from my own experience, Mr Posselt.
I was Austriaâ€™s Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe when Russia and also the Baltic States were admitted.
Of course I am aware of how this situation came about historically.
We must be clear that it is the result of a historical development.
The important thing is that, as Members of the European Union, the Baltic States should satisfy the relevant provisions, norms and rules of international law, of the Council of Europe and the OSCE in particular.
Because the standards which, thank God, we have in the Europe of the Council of Europe, but especially also in the Europe of the European Union, are actually higher than in international law in general.
We can be proud of that.
The Council also feels obliged to comply with these stricter rules and standards.
