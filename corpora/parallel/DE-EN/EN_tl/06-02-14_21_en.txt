Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, Commissioner Frattini, I too would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for this report.
It is evident from the responses to it that it enjoys very widespread approval.
We have already heard from various quarters how much easier we find it to criticise small states such as Myanmar and impose sanctions on them to do the same with large ones, where economic interests come into play.
This is where we have a problem, a dilemma, and it is one that we should address frankly instead of beating about the bush.
The European Union has a credibility problem, a problem with double standards, and this is something we have to consider in the present situation with these caricatures and what is claimed to be a clash of civilisations.
We very much agree with many of the points made in this report.
I would like to point out, though, that we will be addressing a similar issue – that of the Fundamental Rights Agency – in a forthcoming debate in this House.
That Agency will deal with many of the issues with which we are concerning ourselves today.
I would like to raise Members’ awareness of the fact that we will be able to use this Fundamental Rights Agency not only to improve the protection of human rights within the European Union’s Member States, but also as a sort of early warning system to inform us what is going on in the states around us and how things stand as regards human rights in them.
This presents us with a unique opportunity to improve Europe’s policy on human rights.
This House will be taking a decision on this very soon, and I ask you all to support this.
