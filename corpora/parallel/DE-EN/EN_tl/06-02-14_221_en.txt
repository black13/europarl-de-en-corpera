Mr President, I can answer Mr De Rossa’s question about public voting in the Council as follows.
As the Federal Chancellor said in his speech about the Austrian Presidency last month, transparency is something the Austrian Presidency wants.
So far as possible and insofar as the rules allow, we want to achieve the greatest possible transparency between the institutions.
While we must be clear about the fact that this does have its limits, the Presidency will gladly do what it can in the five months that still remain to us, and we are also talking to the Finnish Presidency about it.
The position at present is as follows.
If the Council is acting as legislator, the outcome of the vote, the Council Members’ explanations of vote and the statements entered in the Council minutes are published.
Information on how the delegations have voted is published and is accessible on the Council’s website.
The site also provides information about the legislative acts finally adopted by the Council in a given month and the monthly list of the Council’s legislative acts.
That list also shows any votes against or abstentions, explanations of vote and the voting rules.
We are endeavouring to make further improvements.
The Council Secretariat is currently taking steps to also post on the Council’s website the outcomes of Council votes on legislative proposals accepted under the codecision procedure, where the public will be able to view them.
Finally, I would also like to point out that when a legislative act has finally been adopted the General Secretariat makes available to the public, without restriction, all documents already produced in connection with that act to which no exceptional rules apply.
We in the Presidency want to try to ensure that the restrictions that exist and are laid down are applied as little as possible.
