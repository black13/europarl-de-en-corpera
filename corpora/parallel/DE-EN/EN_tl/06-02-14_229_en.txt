Mr President, in answer to Mrs Andrikiené’s question, I can only say at this stage that the Council’s position on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 is of course the position agreed at the European Council meeting of 15-16 December 2005.
The European Council has stressed that the objective of economic and social cohesion must continue to be at the centre of the European Union’s policy for the duration of the next Financial Perspective.
This is also reflected in the fact that the European Council has agreed to devote more than 35% of total budget resources for the period 2007-2013 to this area of policy.
