Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the question of course still remains.
Has the Austrian Presidency already received a specific mandate from the Council to enter into these negotiations?
If not, at what level and with what end in view can the talks at the level of the Permanent Representatives Committee II take place in the time until a mandate is given?
