Mr President, I can answer Mr Rack’s question by pointing out that according to the Presidency’s work plan the trialogue meetings will be prepared by the Permanent Representatives Committee II.
All that is already under way.
I can assure you – because I know from my own experience – that they are working hard on it.
You will understand, however, that I cannot at this present time comment on the precise state of the necessary clarifications between Council and Commission, wherever the dossier is at this stage.
That would be to prejudice the negotiations.
I would like to repeat once again, and emphatically so, that we will of course do all that we can, in the Council’s own interests and also in the European Parliament’s interests, to see that these negotiations are begun, continued and brought to a good conclusion as quickly as possible.
We owe that to Europe’s citizens.
The European Union’s credibility will also depend on how quickly and how well we come to an agreement on this matter.
