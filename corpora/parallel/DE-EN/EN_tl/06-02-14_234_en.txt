Mr President, Minister, we all know what great efforts the Austrian Presidency is making to bring the new Financial Perspective to a conclusion.
My question is therefore: Is the Council still convinced that the common agricultural policy and the policy for rural areas are making an essential contribution to achieving the Gothenburg and Lisbon objectives, and does the Council still consider ensuring the necessary resources are available, in the Financial Perspective in particular, to be a priority?
