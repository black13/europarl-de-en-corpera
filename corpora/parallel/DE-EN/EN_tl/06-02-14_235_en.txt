Mr President, honourable Member, I have already mentioned, and I repeat, because this is the Councilâ€™s position: we stand on the ground of the agreement that was reached in December.
That is the framework in which we are moving, and the priorities that follow from that will now have to be set in the negotiations.
Of course we are committed to the objectives you have mentioned and will continue to be so.
