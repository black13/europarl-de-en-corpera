Mr President, as a Munich Member with a Styrian mother, I am pleased to observe the progressive policy Austria is pursuing in the area of biomass.
My question relates to that.
What are you doing to introduce this very progressive policy increasingly into the Council of the European Union, and how in particular do you rate the importance of biomass, not only for motor fuel but also in particular for heating?
