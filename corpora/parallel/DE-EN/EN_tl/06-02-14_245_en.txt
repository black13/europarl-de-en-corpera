Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, in the very first days of your term as President-in-Office of the Council you had to deal with the difficult problem with Russia and Ukraine.
Initially, the problem was not that the gas was being cut off, but simply that Russia was demanding a much higher price for its natural gas.
Does the Austrian Presidency now plan to tackle this vulnerability to energy prices, which affects not only Ukraine but also, of course, the European economy?
We all know that a massive increase in energy prices would trigger high inflation and could considerably slow economic growth or even result in recession.
What do you intend to do with regard to the vulnerability of the European economy to energy prices?
