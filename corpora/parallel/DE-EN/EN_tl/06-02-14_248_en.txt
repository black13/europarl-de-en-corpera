Mr President, as this is the first time I have taken questions from the European Parliament, I am still rooted in the traditions of my own parliament, where questions are always repeated.
I am sure I will learn the ropes by the end of the Presidency: after all, we still have another four and a half months to go.
Supplementary occupational pensions are an important subject, including in connection with our concept of 'flexicurity' â€“ flexibility through security.
The Council has already started examining the proposal submitted by the Commission at the end of October 2005 for a directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights.
By the end of February, the preparatory body responsible for examining the matter, in other words the Council Working Party on Social Questions, will have discussed the proposal in six meetings.
The Austrian Presidency has included the proposal in its draft agendas for the Council's meeting.
In view of the fact that the matter is very technically complex, however, we still need to examine how far this work will have got by the time the Council meets in June.
I will not hide the fact that, quite apart from the general complexity, there are still some key questions that need to be answered, but in principle I believe that it will make, and must make, a very important contribution to improving the mobility of employees in Europe.
