Mr Bartenstein, I can reassure you that you have nothing to learn, because you are already much better than many of your predecessors straight out of the starting blocks.
I would like to expand on what you have said by saying that the point is that, when it comes to occupational pensions, we obviously also have to deal with the differences in competences and in tax systems.
The differences in competences in the Member States have led to major barriers to mobility.
Do you think that we need European minimum standards in this field, a common cost base for European products and a more comprehensive European pensions debate, whilst safeguarding national competences?
