Mr President, Mr Karas, this proposal for a directive certainly is a step in the direction we want and have to take.
Anybody who wants employees to have mobility across European borders must make it possible for them to take their supplementary pension rights with them without too much difficulty.
On the other hand, it is quite clear to see that, when it comes to social security, each country has its own traditions and therefore that any attempt at harmonisation would be doomed to failure.
We do not want that; where social security is concerned, one size certainly does not fit all.
This is therefore certainly an issue in areas where it is sensible and appropriate to establish minimum standards.
In the field of pension rights, we should not forget that most European countries use a contributory system as the basis for state support.
At the same time, we know that it would be appropriate to supplement this contribution-based system in part by one based on capital, including in the state sector.
In addition, as part of this opportunity – we must of course also take account of the incomes of European employees and savers – we should of course also encourage private and occupational pension provision.
I am working on the assumption that the Member States will, and should, retain their decision-making authority and competence over the relatively long term, but that we should also establish – in particular through this directive – ways to make it easier for European employees with pension funds to transfer their pension rights throughout Europe, which the introduction of minimum standards would of course make considerably easier.
