Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, I share your view that the possibility of transferring supplementary occupational pensions undoubtedly increases mobility.
Any measure that increases mobility at the same time increases job security.
I am quite sure that, as part of your Presidency, you are planning further measures to increase mobility and thus job security.
Which of these mobility-increasing measures will you be proposing to the other Member States in the course of your Presidency?
