Mr President, I think that all people in Europe, of whatever educational level – and in the German-speaking countries this includes a large number of apprentices undergoing vocational training – should have the same opportunities that perhaps used to be restricted to people with tertiary, academic educations.
I know that there are best practice examples in Austria of apprentices in training having the opportunity to spend time abroad.
I think it is absolutely essential – with the greatest respect for all the language regimes we operate in Europe – that we primarily give our young people knowledge of English as the language of mobility.
I hope I will not now be deluged with protests from Paris or elsewhere.
If we want to give Europe's young people career opportunities throughout Europe, we must naturally also be prepared to set up programmes during training and to grant subsidies, so that young people can have a first taste of this mobility in the context of such programmes, leading to them being able to get jobs in other European countries later in their careers.
