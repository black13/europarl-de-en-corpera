Mr President, it is a very strange debate that we are witnessing today.
To listen to the representatives of the major parties, you would think that we really had found a solution – but what sort of solution?
The mountain has laboured and brought forth a bureaucratic chimera.
Just take a look at it, those of you here who call yourselves social democrats.
How exactly are you planning to implement what you think you have negotiated?
And we find the same desperate situation on the other side.
Those who really think they can create a more open market have also failed.
What do you do in such a situation in real life, where there is no room for wastefulness or mutual admiration?
You go back to square one.
You start again from the beginning.
It is a tragedy for Europe that you have not done that here.
It is a tragedy that you have not listened to Mrs Rühle.
It is those who actually want to stand up for the idea of Europe who will have to bear the consequences of all the problems that have now been built in, and also of the complaints that will be coming our way.
