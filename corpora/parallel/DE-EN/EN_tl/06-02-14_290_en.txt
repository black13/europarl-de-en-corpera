Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, far from doing any credit to the principle of better regulation, this directive, in fact, does the opposite.
It is you, Commissioner, who must bear responsibility for the annoyance, indeed the indignation of almost all groups in European society, and for what we just heard about from Mrs Roithová – the playing off of Members from the East and West against one another.
We are not talking about raising the drawbridge.
The internal market is not an end in itself.
That is why we needed the three major exceptions: the Posting of Workers Directive, the Temporary Workers Directive, which must remain an exception for as long as the Council keeps the European directive on ice, and in particular the Professional Qualifications Directive, adopted by all of us here in this House.
An efficient internal market without barriers and without discrimination, with fair framework conditions, is a win for Europe – for providers, service providers, consumers and employees.
But that is certainly not what this directive gives us.
I would particularly like to thank the European Trade Union Confederation, which has been working with us to advocate protection, without falling into the trap of national narrow-mindedness.
The solution is not to reject, but to reshape.
