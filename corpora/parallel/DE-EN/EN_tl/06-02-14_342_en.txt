Mr President, the international debate on substantially increasing development aid from the leading industrialised nations had intensified – and that is a comforting situation – because it is highly likely that we will fail to reach the development goals set by the international community at the turn of the millennium.
There is international consensus that a significant increase in public development funding is needed if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and thus halve poverty in the developing countries.
In its 2004 report, the OECD development centre emphasises the importance of the speed with which the additional funds can be made available.
Time, and the growing poverty in many developing countries, is therefore pressing.
The European Parliament must use the decision to continue to exert pressure on the Member States to achieve the 0.7% threshold for funding provided for development cooperation and to press those Member States – including my own – that do not yet have a plan of how to achieve this by 2015 to draw up such a plan as soon as possible.
It is also important for us to emphasise that these innovative funding methods always involve additional resources.
We must not find any forms of funding that are financed by commitments we have already made.
It has already been mentioned that the international financial facility is a method of doubling the necessary development funding.
However, I think it is a shame that the compromise on the table does not take into account other methods that will be required if we are going to provide enough money in the future.
Perhaps we could improve it further tomorrow.
