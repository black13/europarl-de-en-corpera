Mr President, there are many people living on our borders for whom the eastward enlargement changed little, since the people in many border regions had stolen a march on the politicians and local border traffic had long been part of daily life.
That makes it all the more important that we, while agreeing on common rules for local border traffic, should, as is provided for, allow the Member States to conclude bilateral agreements relating to their implementation.
The loss of the internal borders does, of course, make it all the more important that the external border of the Schengen zone be monitored.
Exchange of information across borders, with joint coordination and controls, have made it possible to reduce criminal activity in some frontier regions.
While we must of course make matters simpler and easier for cross-border residents, the option of imposing strict sanctions must be in place to ensure that the concessions made are not abused.
There must also be guarantees that these persons constitute no danger to public safety and order, and it is for these reasons that I endorse, in particular, the Committeeâ€™s proposal for thorough and recurrent checks to be carried out at irregular intervals.
