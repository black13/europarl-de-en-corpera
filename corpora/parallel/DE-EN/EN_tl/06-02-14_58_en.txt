Mr President, I have only a minute, so I will be brief.
Many thanks, Mrs Rothe, you tireless campaigner, for this good piece of work.
I would like to give an example of the potential involved here; in Upper Austria, 1 500 new houses are built every year.
Ten years ago, 1 200 of them were fitted with oil heating.
In Upper Austria this year, only seven were so equipped; all the others used biomass, networks or pellets instead for heating.
That created jobs in the forestry sector, in agriculture, and for local installing engineers, so that today, indeed, oil merchants have gone over to selling pellets.
That is the way we must go, or, to put it another way, we have to take the good practice that is to be found at the local and regional levels, and put it to work across Europe.
I might add that Denmark, too, has done exemplary work in this respect, an example that we in this House will, this afternoon, vote to follow.
It will then be for you to put the work in.
Just another thing on the subject of the Green Paper, Commissioner: if we are to win Europeans over, there needs to be a chapter in it with the title ‘’ That is what the people of Europe expect of us, and you should not fall short of that standard.
