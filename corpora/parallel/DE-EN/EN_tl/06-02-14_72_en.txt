– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Rothe for her wholehearted commitment to renewable energy, and also Mr Turmes for warmly commending the Austrian province from which I come for the exemplary work for renewable energy that it is doing, and doing it, moreover, right across the economy, since what matters to us, quite simply, is that energy production be cheap, safe and clean.
These three considerations must always be seen in context.
The slogan ‘think globally and act locally’ also applies here.
We must be constantly aware of the global situation, while also focusing on how measures can be put into practice.
When issuing building permits or permission to develop land, the authorities should give priority to installations using renewable energy and hence helping to achieve the Kyoto goal.
I regard the proposal that a decision should be required two months following submission of the application as being an absolute priority, for time is catching up with us, and we should also provide for the burden of proof to be reversed in this regard if the authorities turn down a plan.
It is also necessary that projects should yield a return on investment in them, and here a wide range of options are available to us.
I see energy services as presenting, in future, a tremendous opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Some of those Members who have already spoken have – in view of the services directive that we will be agreeing to adopt this week – highlighted the wholly new challenges that cross-border energy supply presents to each and every Member State and the need for simplified procedures in this area.
One particular priority is that bureaucracy should cease to put obstacles in the way.
What matters in the final analysis is that domestic resources be used and small circuits promoted.
That is what we aim to do, and we want to achieve it together with the Commission.
