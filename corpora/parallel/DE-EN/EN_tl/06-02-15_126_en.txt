Madam President, on the subject of the infrastructure costs directive, I should like to ask the Commissioner what the Commission is considering doing in order to further advance the principle of the internalisation of external costs.
Although we have now adopted the infrastructure costs directive, what is the Commission contemplating doing, particularly by way of studies and expert assessments, to more clearly elucidate the link between pollution of the environment and heavy goods traffic and, on that basis, to present a new and final proposal for an improved Eurovignette directive with less of an impact on the environment?
