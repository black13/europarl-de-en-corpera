Madam President, I would like to point out that the Commission has not answered the substance of my original question, and to put a related supplementary question.
It is understandable that the Commission cannot tell us today how it intends to divide up a budget that has not yet even been adopted, but I do believe that it certainly should be giving consideration to how to go about providing these trans-European networks with the funding that they will need.
As we all know, the various transport operators are perfectly willing to pay tolls, and the new infrastructure costs directive established a very narrow base on which these charges were to be levied, so let me follow up the previous question by asking whether it might not be possible to come up with a proposal for extending that and making cross-financing possible?
