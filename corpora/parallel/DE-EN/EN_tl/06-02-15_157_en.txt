Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my question is prompted by the recurrent need, in regional policy, for people to be shown new examples of how to do it.
Since there are many methods of ‘best practice’, and since there is such a thing as the ‘innovation scoreboard’, would it not be possible for you, Commissioner, and your fellow-Commissioners Mrs Hübner, Mr Potočnik and Mrs Wallström, to put your heads together and consider how these tried and tested practices may be better got across to the European public, so that they may have incentives to step us this sort of cooperation in future?
