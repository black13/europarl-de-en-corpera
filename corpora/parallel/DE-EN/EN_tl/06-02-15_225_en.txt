Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Kindermann for his wise and balanced report, as he has put a great deal of commitment and empathy into achieving a compromise and drafting a balanced text.
We are in favour of the forest strategy, Commissioner, but against market regulation, and that is something we want to make quite clear.
We are in favour of subsidiarity in forestry policy and are convinced that we should continue to go down that path.
We certainly should pay much more attention to this sector.
If only 85% of the forested area in the European Union is managed, we must do our level best to bring the other 15% into the economic cycle; and if, as Mr Kindermann has indicated, only 60% of the wood grown is used, it is all the more important to draw attention to it: it is only if they are used that these forests can be protected.
Let me also say that the fairy tale of the dying forests of Europe we have been told for decades really was a fairy tale, a tale told more for political effect than for any other reason.
If there is growth of 450 thousand hectares a year, then the forests are certainly not dying, but expanding.
It thus only remains for me, Commissioner, to ask you to incorporate into your work as much as possible of what ultimately remains binding in the text following tomorrow's vote, and I am pleased that you have already agreed to do so at the end of your speech.
