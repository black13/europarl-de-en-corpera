Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to our rapporteur for his very balanced report, for he has taken a very balanced approach to the three pillars of sustainability â€“ the economic, the ecological and the sociocultural.
This report reflects the European model of forestry: multifunctional forest management, predominantly private ownership of forests and a close entwinement with agriculture, leisure space for citizens and living space for plants and animals.
The report also refers to the regional characteristics of forest management: in the South, for example, as has already been mentioned, the problems of forest fires and cork oaks; in Central Europe the high utility of the forests alongside their considerable importance for relaxation, tourism and vital protective functions, particularly in Alpine areas; and in northern Europe primarily the market orientation of timber production.
It also emphasises the importance to climate policy of wood as an energy source and building material to replace fossil fuels and building materials.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for making specific reference to this.
I see sustainably managed forests as being a sort of green lung.
This report particularly emphasises the need to coordinate forestry-related policies at EU level and to take joint measures, agreed by vote to achieve additional effects for European forestry, whilst safeguarding subsidiarity.
It follows, then, that what we are talking about here is a European forestry strategy.
I would like to make quite clear my opposition to market regulation of forest management, which has been put up for discussion time and time again.
Once again, many thanks for this report.
