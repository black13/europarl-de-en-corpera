â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, allow me, too, to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, for his excellent report and to endorse all of his demands.
In these times of empty coffers, some people are pulling their hair out when they hear about the new things that the EU is doing and spending money on.
However, the EU forestry strategy and the drafting of an EU action plan for sustainable forest management are not new activities and expenditure.
Forestry policy is not a Community matter, although it cannot be denied it, and forest management too, are increasingly influenced by policy in other areas such as the environment and agriculture.
Ever increasing social demands and environmental standards are also pushing the forest and timber industry to the very edge of profitability.
If they are pushed over this edge, the managers will withdraw from the fray.
We see the EU action plan as an opportunity to improve the framework conditions for forest management in the enlarged European Union.
I think there are two key aspects to this: first, improving communication and coordination structures at EU level, and secondly appointing a structural unit within the Commission to take primary responsibility for implementing forestry action plans and strategies.
There are three things that we do not need: firstly, European regulation of the timber market, secondly, more bureaucracy, and thirdly, particularly in the current financial situation, I reject EU aid for communal or state forests.
Forestry in Central Europe is characterised by multifunctionality.
We hope that social, ecological and economic sustainability will continue to be exemplary in the European context, and that European forestry will remain competitive.
