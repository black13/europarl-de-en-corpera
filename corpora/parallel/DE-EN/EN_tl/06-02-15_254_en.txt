. â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McGuiness, for her report.
As the Commissioner has already said in her introductory remarks, this report looks at the strategic guidelines as a bridge between the provisions of the Council regulation on rural development and the implementation of those provisions in the Member States in the form of national strategies and programme planning documents.
One major problem is the lack of the Financial Perspective.
I know, Commissioner, that you are not happy with the Council's decision in December to reduce funding for rural development, but we need to finally set up the financial framework so that the programmes can be started on time in the Member States.
The greater flexibility in relation to the priorities is important for us all.
The Community strategic guidelines form the basis for establishing national strategies.
An important aspect in this is that, on the one hand, the EU's priorities have been taken into account but, on the other, the Member States have been left with sufficient room for manoeuvre.
This is not just about creating new jobs, but also about safeguarding existing employment opportunities in agriculture and forestry and safeguarding all related industries, which are very important to the employment situation in our rural regions, so that we can achieve the goals that Mrs McGuiness talked about so decisively.
Our aim must continue to be to work together to achieve the objectives of Lisbon and Gothenburg.
