. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to recognise that this situation is escalating.
We have to realise that the strategy of President Ahmadinejad is a new one.
He is intent on a breach with the West, on building up an Islamic region and taking over its leadership.
We are seeing a mobilisation of national pride in Iran.
How should Europe respond to this?
I expect us to be guided by reason and make clear analyses.
I agree with Mr Schulz when he says that we have to abandon the ‘strategy of goal-based thinking’, that we need new dialogue partners, and that we must be active in prioritising diplomacy.
I would also say, however, in view of the difficult negotiations over recent days, that the military option has been discussed, and I ask those who have this in the back of their minds to think it through.
I expect them to define how they propose to deal with a military escalation, and tell us whether the way they do so will enable us to achieve our objectives, namely preventing Iran developing nuclear weapons and ensuring Israel’s existence.
I do not believe that it will.
For this reason, I would appeal once more to this House to take account, in today’s vote, of our argument – which we were unable to push through in negotiations – that we should now refrain from toying with any ideas of a military approach, and subsequently to put the emphasis on diplomacy – in spite of all the hate speeches by President Ahmadinejad.
The questions as to whether sanctions should be imposed, what sanctions are appropriate and whether world peace is at risk, are not for President Chirac to answer, the man who suddenly issued the threat of France using nuclear weapons; nor are they for Chancellor Merkel to answer.
The vital issue of world peace is to be decided by the United Nations and no one else, and we should not forestall them.
