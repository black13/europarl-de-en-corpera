– There was something touching in the way the Austrian Secretary of State stumbled through the script presented to him on the subject of Iran and its atomic energy programme.
It shows how far removed from these issues representatives of the Austrian Government have become in the first decade of the third millennium.
That is a good thing; we have learnt our lessons from history, and the first speech by the Secretary of State had a lot to say about responsibility.
Combining the two, the obvious course of action would actually be to take initiatives, to say that we need an even wider perspective on this conflict than that indicated by the previous speakers.
We must not do things back to front, we must start with the basics, and that means ‘no nukes’.
It is incomprehensible why some, the ‘good guys’ – who decides who those are? – are allowed such weapons, whilst others are not.
If the Secretary of State starts there from an Austrian perspective, he may be able to do a great deal of good in the longer term rather than just being superficially diplomatic and pleasant in the short term.
