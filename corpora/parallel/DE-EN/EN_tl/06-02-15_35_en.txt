– Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution is very problematic.
Paragraphs 4 and 7 support the escalating position of the EU-3.
This time, the EU-3 is greatly contributing to the escalation.
Jacques Chirac’s remark that he is prepared to use nuclear weapons against ‘terrorist’ states is scandalous.
The historical comparison drawn by Angela Merkel, too, is completely unacceptable.
It is not only Iran’s atomic energy programme that is dangerous; the nuclear weapons in the EU – France and the United Kingdom – and the USA should also be disarmed in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
The use of nuclear energy in itself is problematic.
Summoning Iran before the UN Security Council is the first step towards a military attack on Iran.
All military options must be ruled out; German SPD chairman Matthias Platzeck is absolutely right about this.
The war in Iraq is obviously a blueprint for the conflict with Iran.
The unspeakable comments by the Iranian President on Israel and the human rights violations in the country must not be exploited for the purposes of a policy of war against Iran.
