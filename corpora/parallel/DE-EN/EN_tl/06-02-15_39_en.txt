– Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must not let the fundamentalists and those abusing the opportunities that freedom in Europe presents destroy our capacity for dialogue.
Events from the caricature conflict, to begin with, to the drastic, unacceptable statements by the Iranian President, cannot be allowed to result in the moderates that live in all regions and countries of the world losing the ability to talk to each other.
I believe that that is a crucial starting point, as, too, is ensuring that a president such as this is unable to win through in Iran, and that the many, well-educated, young people who wish to live a decent life have prospects; and for that reason we have to maintain this capacity for dialogue, in order to support internal reform process here, too.
This also means that we should not climb the escalation ladder too fast; it is not possible to go down a rung, so careful consideration is required.
For that reason, I am glad that next Monday, for example, the Committee on Foreign Affairs will have the opportunity for dialogue with the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which will form an integral part of a debate such as this.
The international community must be resolute when it comes to breaches of the law – irrespective of whether these occur in the context of freedom of expression – or when it comes to ensuring that Iran abides by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the rules that have been agreed.
Iran must also realise that, if it has not done so properly by 6 March, the international community stands together and that the matter may then be discussed within the Security Council of the United Nations.
For this reason, it is important that we ensure this dialogue helps to build a more peaceful world, that we do not now let ourselves be talked into taking steps that render it impossible to use this escalation ladder for peaceful purposes, and also that, in the process, we do not lapse into automatism from which there is no escape.
