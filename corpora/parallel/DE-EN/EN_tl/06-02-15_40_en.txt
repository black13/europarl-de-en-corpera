– Mr President, we are unfortunately having to realise that the situation in Iran is escalating, and that is certainly not the right way for it to go about assuming a responsible role in the future of the international peace process, particularly in the Middle East, as Iran always likes to see it.
I do sympathise with a country’s desire for scientific and technological progress for the benefit of its citizens – it must be given this option – but a field as double-edged as nuclear research requires a common effort by the international community; it is unacceptable for any parties to go it alone.
It is vital to build mutual confidence, both on the part of the USA and Europe and on the part of Iran.
How is that possible, however, with talk of military options on both sides?
The fact is that the political situation in the region is not as stable as we would wish upon the people living there.
For that reason, we would call on all the countries of that region to enter into a process of dialogue.
Regional stability and security cannot be achieved through outside intervention, and power games must not be allowed to result in doors being closed to us, so that we no longer know what is happening behind them.
We should not give fundamentalism or fanaticism any chance.
