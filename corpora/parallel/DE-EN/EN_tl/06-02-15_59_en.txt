– Mr President, I should just like to protest against the fact that this motion for a resolution is only available in English, since all the other language versions had to be pulped on account of errors.
In theory, one could refrain from voting altogether.
I do not wish to block the vote – this is an important issue and we have to vote – but, in my view, it is unacceptable to work in such a slipshod manner here when there are as few resolutions on the agenda as there are today.
