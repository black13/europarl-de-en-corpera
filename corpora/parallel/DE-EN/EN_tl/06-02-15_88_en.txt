Mr President, I would like to reiterate, for the House’s benefit, the reasons why my group initiated this debate.
Bosnia-Herzegovina has at last embarked on the task of amending its constitution, because that is necessary in order that it might draw nearer to the European Union.
In January of this year, there was a very serious situation when, this very stage having been reached, an American think-tank tried to push this change through suddenly without European involvement.
This was at a time when Paddy Ashdown’s mandate had already ended and Mr Schwarz-Schilling’s had not yet begun.
That sort of thing must not happen again.
I am optimistic that Mr Schwarz-Schilling, as High Representative, will have the interests of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina at heart and will take their own responsibility seriously in ensuring that our political objective has a chance of being achieved.
By that I mean that, ten years on from Dayton, ten years on from the European Union’s military intervention, he will see to it that ethnic division is brought to an end and Bosnia and Herzegovina are enabled to face the future together.
