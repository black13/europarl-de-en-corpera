– Mr President, Commissioner, you said that no new positions will be taken up at the Fourth World Water Forum.
What is clear is that you will have a lot of work to do.
You described the right to have access to water as a human right, but that is precisely what the disputes were about at the last Water Forum.
The cause of conflict at it was an argument about whether the availability of clean water was a human right that had to be guaranteed by the State, or whether it was a need that should be met by the market.
Despite massive protests by the campaigners present, the ministers at the forum refused to say anything in their final statement about access to water being a right.
I wish you much success in getting its status as a human right recognised in Mexico City.
As for the forthcoming World Water Forum itself, we will also have to consider what democratic legitimacy it possesses.
It is organised by the World Water Council, which is largely dominated by private industry and businesses.
Since its chairman is the head of a subsidiary of French water companies, we must of course ask ourselves to what degree it is influenced by the industry and just how useful are the solutions that may emerge from it.
What I would like to see – perhaps at a future meeting of the United Nations, which would have the appropriate democratic legitimacy – is debates held without the massive influence of the companies that are making themselves rich from water supply and drainage in many countries around the world.
