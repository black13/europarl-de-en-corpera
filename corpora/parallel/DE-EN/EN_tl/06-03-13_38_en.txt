– Mr President, I would like, again, to bring to the House’s attention the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor who have been jailed in Libya.
In 1999, they were accused of deliberately using blood transfusions to infect 400 children with the AIDS virus.
Although they were sentenced to death in 2004, the sentences were a matter of legal contention and have now been suspended.
We welcome the Supreme Court’s decision and look forward to more transparent procedures and a fairer trial.
These people have been subjected to incarceration and torture for seven years, and we now hope that their trial will not be exploited and misused for political ends.
Until such time as they are at liberty, it is our task as parliamentarians to highlight this case and follow its progress closely.
