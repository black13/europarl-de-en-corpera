. – Madam President, I hope that this resolution will end up right in the back of the net and thereby bring this issue, once and for all, out of the taboo area and into the public eye.
Forced prostitution is something that nobody wants to talk about: the people engaged in it do not want to, and nor – unfortunately – do its victims.
We must also make much more of an issue of the connection between migration and job creation.
The German Football Association wanted to keep this issue in the taboo zone, and our breaking through its defensive wall amounts to a massive success.
As has already been said, we really do have to be firm in showing people-trafficking and forced prostitution the red card.
We have to make it abundantly clear that fair play in sport involving saying a firm ‘no’ to forced prostitution.
Under no circumstances whatever can it be tolerated.
I have to tell Commissioner Frattini, though, that we not only have to get the criminals, the people-traffickers themselves, in our sights – although we must of course do that – but, in order to do that, we also need solutions that do not criminalise only the women involved, which is what happens at present.
I hope that you will address this issue in your speech.
My expectation is that we do more than just require visas, for it would be the women who would bear the brunt of that, when what is needed instead is prevention and care and support for women.
Much as is done already under Italian immigration law, we must guarantee women who are unwilling to testify as witnesses the right to remain.
We need to do more if women are to be enabled to escape from forced prostitution.
