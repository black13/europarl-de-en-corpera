â€“ Madam President, it is very important that the issue of how to combat the traffic in people, and in women, be debated before the football World Cup kicks off in Germany.
We are talking here in terms of thousands of additional prostitutes, most of whom will be working against their will and as a result of coercion.
My many years of experience with NGOs working in the field of child prostitution on the borders between the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria lead me to believe that these crimes can be dealt with only by improving the laws, by giving more powers to the various institutions and authorities, and by cross-border cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe.
In the longer term, though, it will be necessary to combat poverty and mount information campaigns in order to send forced prostitution off the field for good.
Instituting an Anti-Trafficking Day will make people more aware of this problem.
