– Mr President, I am glad that the rapporteur – after what were at first considerable differences of opinion in the Committee – has succeeded in achieving such a broad compromise on this report.
It is a compromise of which I am very much in favour.
There are three points that I would like again to highlight.
Firstly, I was interested to learn that only a very few companies that relocate actually get European aid, that is to say, aid from European tax revenues, and, as cohesion and structural policy are founded on solidarity with more vulnerable regions, I do not think that anyone here in this House will be undermining them.
Secondly, there needs to be more transparency as regards which companies get which aid, in order to make it clear to our electorate what we in the European Union are actually doing and what we are supporting.
In any case, we will not stand for any ‘subsidy hopping’.
Thirdly, where relocations result in job losses, there is a need for an instrument to help those affected, and that is what the globalisation fund could be.
