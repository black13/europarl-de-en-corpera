Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human beings, eco-systems and animals in the wild.
Mercury is classified as a priority hazardous substance under the Water Framework Directive and also retards microbiological activity in soil.
Mercury is a persistent substance and can change in the environment into methyl mercury, which has enormously adverse effects on human health.
Dental amalgam, which is discharged in the course of dental surgery and from crematoria, is a significant source of mercury emissions.

The use of mercury in dental amalgam is a live issue.
The approach to be endorsed is that all the potential dangers involved in the use of mercury in dental amalgam should be examined, and action taken on the basis of what emerges from that examination.
