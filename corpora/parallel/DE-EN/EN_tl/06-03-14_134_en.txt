– Mr President, here we are now, seeking new ways of making more and more things digital.
The idea is that digital libraries, digital equipment for recording journeys, biometric passports and -government will bring miracles to pass.
The fact that information and communications technology accounts for 40% of economic growth is indeed impressive.
With all this euphoria about new technologies, though, we must not lose sight of reality.
Even though there are, again, encouraging signs of growth in the digital sector, these will do more to put an end to jobs than to create new ones, for the fact is that the high-tech sector is a particularly mobile one, moving first to the eastern Member States and then, in due course, to such countries as India and China.
Yet again, the EU’s dreams of a corporate job-creation machine will not become reality, but it is good to see that small and medium-sized enterprises are tending more and more to upgrade their equipment, with the aim of becoming more productive and competitive, and of opening up new markets.
It is to these small and medium-sized businesses that we will have to give more support.
