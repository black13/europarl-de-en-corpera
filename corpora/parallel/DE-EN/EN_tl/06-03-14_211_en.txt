â€“ Mr President, as the Council Conclusions of 7 November 2005 also indicate, the Council is agreed on the importance of supporting political reform in Iran and of promoting human rights and democracy.
The EU obviously wishes to see Iran develop into a society in which human, civil and political rights are fully respected, in which democratic values and freedom of expression are able to blossom, and in which equal treatment and equal opportunities prevail over discrimination.
At the same time, however, we are aware that the implementation of this objective will require sustained, long-term efforts and patience.
The Council has endeavoured in the past and will endeavour in future to promote political reform, namely by supporting various authorities and organisations in Iran, including Iranian civil society.
It is with this objective in mind that the EU has resumed its comprehensive political dialogue, and it is also making intensive endeavours towards restoring a meaningful, constructive human rights dialogue.
The EU is currently seeking the best way to support political reform and democracy in Iran, and its deliberations include strengthening the role of the media and democratic forces.
