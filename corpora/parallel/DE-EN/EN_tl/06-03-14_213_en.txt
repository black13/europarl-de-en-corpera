– Mrs Malmström, we are aware that we cannot do everything at once, however much we should like to.
Nevertheless, we believe that dialogue is the only alternative open to us, as breaking off dialogue and ‘punishing civil society’, as it were, is certainly not a viable option.
It is of course disappointing that the human rights dialogue has not been held since June 2004.
Indeed, that was why the General Affairs Council, back in November of last year, called on Iran to take steps to resume substantive discussions within the framework of the dialogue.
I can tell you, Mrs Malmström, that, in recent weeks, Iran has indeed shown interest in resuming this dialogue, although the EU has laid down certain framework conditions for this, as there is no point in dialogue for dialogue’s sake.
If we succeed in imposing the framework conditions that permit a meaningful dialogue, and which also support civil society, we shall be glad to resume this dialogue.
We hope to be able to resume the dialogue – which we also hope will be meaningful and beneficial – even before the end of the Austrian Presidency.
