– Mr President, I should like to give the following reply to Mr Beglitis’s question.
The EU’s unambiguous position on all the activities contravening international law that are carried out by Israel in the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, remains, and is expressed repeatedly, regularly, emphatically and clearly at all levels in the sustained political contact between the EU and Israel.
The tools used by the EU in following this political line are the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel, which envisages such contact, and the EU–Israel Action Plan, which was agreed in early 2005 within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
This position has not changed; a fact that was revealed once more on the last two occasions on which we were able to discuss the Middle East peace process and the situation in the Middle East, namely at the last General Affairs Council and at the informal meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, or ‘Gymnich meeting’, in Salzburg last weekend.
The EU and all its Foreign Ministers continue to follow this line of fairness and of speaking clearly – including to Israel – when it comes to drawing attention to activities that we consider contrary to international law.
