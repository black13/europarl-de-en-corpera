– I am sorry if the honourable Member felt that my answer was bureaucratic – that was not my intention.
I believe that I made myself very clear when I said that, wherever the Council considers conduct to be contrary to international law, it is taking every opportunity to say so openly at all levels.
To cite just a few examples, we have stated very clearly that we consider the wall, the separation barrier erected on Palestinian territory, to be contrary to international law.
We have unambiguously criticised Israel’s settlement policy on repeated occasions and shall continue to do so.
I hope that the honourable Member does not feel this to be bureaucratic; indeed, we are not doing it bureaucratically, but in an entirely political manner.
