– I can answer this question as to whether the EU should participate in undertakings, as it is not, in itself, incompatible with the remit of the Council.
I can only repeat what I have already said, and I apologise for this repetition.
Naturally, the EU supports only projects that are in accordance with international law and that conform to the rules.
Differences of opinion are possible as to precisely what is and what is not in accordance with international law but, at all events, the Council’s view is that we naturally support only projects that are in accordance with international law.
