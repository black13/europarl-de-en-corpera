â€“ I am much obliged to the President-in-Office for her comprehensive answer.
I should like to put a supplementary question relating to the European Constitution.
Part II of the Constitution provides that the product of the work of the then Fundamental Rights Convention is intended, as it were, to supplement and also, to a certain extent, to reinforce the provisions of Article 6 of the present Treaty.
Can we envisage its implementation, as already addressed by the Commission and Parliament, by the Council, too, and could that improve the situation as a whole?
