Indeed, that is one of the reasons why we regret that the European Constitutional Treaty is not yet in force, because one of the major benefits I can see in this Constitutional Treaty is that it would incorporate that very Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It would no longer be necessary to discuss precisely those minimum standards for procedural safeguards that we were debating in great depth earlier if our Treaties had a single legal basis.
I see this as a very great benefit, and for that reason it is also important to continue the discussion in one way or another.
Indeed, I am hopeful that we shall reach a solution to this in due course.
