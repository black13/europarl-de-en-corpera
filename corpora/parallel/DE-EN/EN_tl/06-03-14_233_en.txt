. – I can assure the honourable Member that, in these cases, as in all cases of flagrant human rights violations, especially those concerning representatives of the people, the EU is continually, regularly, and wherever possible working to ensure compliance with the relevant human rights provisions and standards.
As has already been correctly pointed out, this does not always take place in public, because that does not always produce the desired effect – sometimes silent diplomacy is better – but it does take place, and regularly.
It is very often carried out by the local representatives of the EU – including, in particular, the Troika.
It is carried out in the course of discussions with high-ranking officials from the countries concerned.
In addition, I can assure the honourable Member once again that we shall of course also continue to work on, and attend to, the cases you mentioned.
