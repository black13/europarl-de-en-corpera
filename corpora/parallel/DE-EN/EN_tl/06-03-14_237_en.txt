– Mr President, generally speaking, there is a great deal of information on offer to EU citizens.
The Commission’s Judicial Atlas, in particular, which is available to every man and woman on the Internet, plays a very valuable role in this connection, because this enables jurisdiction and similar matters to be accessed very simply throughout Europe.
That is one very important aspect.
We are of course concerned that our citizens receive as much information as possible – particularly with regard to access to justice – and so it is important that information also be passed on promptly.
To this end, it is particularly essential, from our point of view, that cooperation with the vital institutions concerned is very constructive, very swift and very efficient.
That is a crucial aspect.
I consider it vital that we carry out a great deal of work in the Member States on obtaining information from the courts, so that the required information can be transferred from the courts to the public.
That is another crucial aspect.
A sound legal system in Europe can only function if the public knows where to turn to.
