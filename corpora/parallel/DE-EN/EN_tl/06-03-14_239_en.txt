â€“ Generally speaking, of course, the honourable Member is right: the field of -commerce will play a quite decisive role in the Europe of the future.
There are, of course, regulatory instruments whose provisions are already starting to include consumer protection, particularly in the field of -commerce, since we are aware that frequent abuses are possible in this field.
I am also aware that individual -commerce providers are already using seals of quality and such like, which is their own form of access.
I envisage our dealing with these instruments, too, in future, although this will not be done primarily by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, but rather will fall within the domain of the Competitiveness Council.
