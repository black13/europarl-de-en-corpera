. â€“ The honourable Member has raised a very delicate issue, which, of course, particularly in the case of the Regulation establishing a European small claims procedure, is one of the main issues under discussion.
Strictly speaking, there are no plans for compulsory representation by a lawyer under the European small claims procedure, which, of course, raises a central question regarding the matter of cost, and particularly regarding the reimbursement of court costs, for which different arrangements exist in the various Member States.
Generally speaking, we have already been making efforts to establish legal instruments within the framework of legal aid, in particular, and these are already being implemented.
We shall certainly have to think about further instruments for the other field.
Meetings of Council working parties have revealed this to be an issue that my experts are discussing and one where we shall certainly be able to work out a solution in respect of the European small claims procedure, too.
