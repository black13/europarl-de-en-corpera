– I could not agree more with the honourable Member’s statement.
From the Presidency’s point of view, we of course have every interest in sending out an important political signal on this, too.
We assume that the seminar we are holding will objectify the matter again and, by means of expert opinions – particularly large numbers of expert opinions – will produce an outcome that will make it possible for us to strike the necessary balance in future between our shared aspiration: namely, to oppose racism and xenophobia most effectively, but without putting freedom of expression at risk as a result.
At all events, we wish to make quite considerable progress, and we hope that, given a new impetus, it proves possible for the Finnish Presidency to successfully conclude this dossier, or at least to continue the negotiations, on the basis of our work.
