– Madam President, Mr Mitchell, I think that that is a good idea in principle, as I, too, believe that we must together fight to ensure that racism and xenophobia in Europe do not stand a chance.
I also see that sport is capable of building bridges in this regard, because when young people, especially – who are our future, after all – and often adults, too, exercise together, they can then go on to undertake activities together.
It is not only sport that has a potential role to play here, however; I also see definite opportunities in the field of culture.
Even though the two are not directly connected, we have to try to build these bridges in many different areas.
Racism and xenophobia are very often connected with prejudice.
Prejudice tends to arise out of unfamiliarity with other cultures, because unfamiliar things are often associated with fear.
Since fear, in turn, gives rise to negative feelings, it is entirely possible, of course, for racism and xenophobia to arise.
For that reason, everything that could result in our getting to know one another better, getting to know other cultures even better, is welcome as a means to beat xenophobia.
The question is – since the honourable Member specifically addressed me as a Minister for Justice – whether the Council actually has the competence to do this under the EU Treaty.
I do believe, however, that this is an important political message that all of us together should pass on.
