– Madam President, Commissioner, I do realise that there are no grounds for panic, as you say.
Nevertheless, I should like to ask you whether it would perhaps be desirable to raise this issue as part of accession negotiations with Turkey, to ensure that such coins are taken out of circulation very quickly.
After all, there is also the temptation for the Turkish parallel societies in Europe – in Germany or Austria, for example – to misuse these coins.
Would it not be possible to speed up the process – even though, as you say, minting coins is very expensive – in order to reduce the harm to Europe and the European economy?
