â€“ Madam President, the Commissioner speaks of complicated procedures, a complicated situation.
We are all aware of this, but the situation is further complicated if the Commission is not prepared to introduce greater transparency into its decision-making process.
After all, the decisive meeting of the Board of Governors is coming up in mid-April.
Why is the Commission not prepared to simply say, on the basis of its own criteria: this is how far we have come, these are the figures, and this is how far we can go?
If the Commissioner just perpetuates the obscurity, he cannot expect an improvement in satisfaction within the language sections.
