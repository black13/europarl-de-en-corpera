– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, pension policy, poverty reduction, and health and long-term care are key tasks for us and key issues for all citizens of the EU.
Parliament must therefore considerably increase its involvement in open coordination in all aspects of social protection and social inclusion.
The current procedure is totally unacceptable.
The state of affairs we are discussing today is already outdated.
The Council has already discussed the Commission’s follow-up communication.
For this reason, an interinstitutional agreement is urgently needed.
The Commissioner has said today that he is committed to a dialogue with Parliament.
I am most obliged to him for this, but we do not want just a relaxed dialogue; what we really want is the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement laying down crystal-clear rules.
Furthermore, in future, the issues of the reconciliation of professional and family life should increasingly be dealt with, and particular attention paid to childcare, within the framework of the open method of coordination in the field of social protection.
