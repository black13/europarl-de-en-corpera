– Mr President, in a parliamentary democracy, people’s representatives can, must, should and may set an example.
If so many of us are now forced to require the people in our countries to make sacrifices, this can only function, in the spirit of democracy, if we, too, make sacrifices.
Reducing Parliament’s budget from EUR 1.2 or 1.3 billion to under EUR 1 billion is the way to achieve credibility.
To make a couple of suggestions, the many Members who have promised to claim only those travel expenses actually incurred from now on should pay back the surplus.
In 2004, just 37 Members accounted for a ludicrous EUR 234 000.
We know that EUR 26 million are squandered because of incorrect use of interpreting services.
The many minutes of needless silence here cost further millions, and so it goes on.
EUR 100 million a year have been spent on something or other, and so we look for something to enter it against.
Let us have an end to this.
We would have no problem at all in saving the EUR 300 million; and in so doing we would not only spare ourselves negative headlines in the international press, but also earn ourselves positive ones.
I am saying this as a pro-European.
You will wake up again tomorrow to read something you call scandalous, but no, it is what is happening here that is scandalous.
I am sorry, but Europe cannot progress unless savings are made right here, at the top, at long last.
