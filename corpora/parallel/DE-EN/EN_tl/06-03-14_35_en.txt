– Mr President, I am very grateful to Mr Cottigny for the very hard work he has done on this report.
I do, however, doubt that the report’s underlying goal – that of lessening the social impact of restructuring – is actually capable of being achieved.
Firstly, the European Union sets enhanced competitiveness in global markets as the goal of economic activity and hence also of restructuring, and that amounts to nothing other than an attempt to seek out and find the weak areas outside the EU, to which the losers can be transported.
Secondly, if society really is to be able to alleviate the consequences of restructuring, the funds for those who lose out to globalisation would have to be so substantial that they would themselves reduce competitiveness.
If, then, we in the EU are not to export our problems, we should say ‘yes’ to restructuring, but ask ourselves how it should work.
What is needed is another way of managing things economically, another way in which society’s goods can be produced, that really is founded upon social and global sustainability.
The object of this must not be to beat our competitors at any cost, and we must not allow this to shape our thinking.
That is the real challenge that we face.
