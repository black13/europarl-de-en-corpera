. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed the case that we in the European Union need another effective instrument to enable us to take greater strides towards equality for women and men, for if we carry on mincing along in the way we are now, establishing equality will still be a struggle even for our great-grand-daughters.
The planned Institute for Equality Issues can be that additional instrument, but, as we European parliamentarians – and we women in particular – want not only to work hard, but also to do so to lasting effect, the future gender institute must also have the right framework conditions in which to operate, and those include the funding available to it, with which it will have to manage.
There are two comments that the Committee on Budgets and its permanent rapporteur on agencies would like to make in this regard.
Firstly, we already have 23 agencies, many of which are being set up or in the course of restructuring, and all of them need a lot of money.
If our agreement with the Council on the next financial framework results in less money all round than this House has proposed, this will affect the decentralised agencies too.
Secondly, the Commission has proposed – and to this proposal this House has not objected – that the Gender Institute should be fully financed through the Fifth Strand of PROGRESS.
In June of last year, this House, in its position on the Financial Perspective, allocated over EUR 850 million to PROGRESS, but the Council, in December, cut almost 300 million from that amount.
Without adequate funding, though, we will be unable to achieve any lasting effects where equality is concerned.
Real policy-making and real work require real money if we are not to find ourselves building yet more Potemkin villages, frustrating workers, and throwing sand in the public’s face.
