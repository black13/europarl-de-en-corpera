The Commission announced the creation of the European Institute on Gender Equality even before Parliament had delivered its report on the subject.
Procedurally speaking, that is the wrong way to go about it.
We are voting on it today, and Parliament’s voice carries weight in this matter.
The intention is that an Institute should be created, with a budget of EUR 54.5 million, with the specific function of monitoring men’s and women’s equality of opportunity by producing statistics and reports.
This House has, however, for practical and financial reasons, and as recently as last year, recommended that the Institute for Gender Equality should form part of the European Human Rights Agency.
More action and more resources are needed to address equality issues in an effective way, but no provision is as yet being made for them.
It follows that the original idea of combining the two agencies in one single Agency for Fundamental Rights deserves support.
It is for that reason that I have tabled Amendment 73.
Rejecting the creation of an independent institute on Gender Equality is not in any way to be seen as an expression of hostility to policy on women’s issues.
The money available to us should be invested in women’s education.
That would be the first step towards equality.
The current debate on the reduction of bureaucracy is another reason why an additional agency does not make sense and would not be something readily explicable to the public.
It is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of this report.
