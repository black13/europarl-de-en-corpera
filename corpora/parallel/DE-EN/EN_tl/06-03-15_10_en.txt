Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those moments when one is very uncertain, not knowing what might happen next, and when one is therefore concerned that it might be the start of some negative developments, after we had hoped for many years following the start of the Oslo process that agreement could be reached in this key area of world politics.
President Abbas, who was elected directly by his fellow Palestinians and therefore has legitimacy, seemed to be taking on a mediation role, in order to negotiate between those who advocate the renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist and Hamas, which has not so far recognised this but has won an election, so that Hamas can be brought into the fold.
I am afraid that it is now obvious that this role is being abandoned and we do not know who else can fill it.
The action in Jericho was a significant, emotive event, which leads to problems on the Palestinian side.
However, I am much more worried that the withdrawal of the international observers from the United States and the United Kingdom will lead to the Quartet losing its credibility as a stabilising influence and a guarantor of stability.
I am afraid that it all goes much deeper.
On the other hand, Fatah's actions in Gaza showed that those who were previously in favour of the renunciation of violence under Mr Abbas are taking on a new role now that they have lost the elections and have lost their sources of profit.
And on the other side Hamas is not yet there.
Those who used to advocate the renunciation of violence are moving away from that position, and the others have not yet reached it.
That seems to me to be the current situation.
Both President Abbas and the Quartet have lost credibility in putting things right.
That is how it looks to me at the moment.
In our own interests, I hope that this depiction of the situation will prove to be false.
