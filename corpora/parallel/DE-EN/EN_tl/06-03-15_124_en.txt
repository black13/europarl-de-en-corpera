– Mr President, in times when dividends and profits are rising, and managers’ salaries with them, the jobs available are doing the opposite and decreasing in number.
Looking at Europe as a whole, as many jobs are hit by restructuring as by insolvency.
In Austria alone in recent years, between 15 000 and 20 000 jobs are estimated to have been lost to the new Member States.
Restructuring is a panacea enabling today’s businesses to depict themselves to the world as success stories, on paper at any rate.
There has been even more restructuring in the public services than in the private sector, not least in response to guidelines from the EU.
It is now coming to be realised that there is often a high price to be paid for economy measures, in the shape of lost quality, know-how, competence, staff motivation and strategic potential.
Despite the great risk of failure if restructuring is used as a substitute for a clear strategy, this is a trend that the EU’s privatisation guidelines and preferential treatment for subsidy tourism has positively encouraged.
It is high time that it faced up to its responsibility and desisted from further enlargements, to which these developments are in part attributable, and got back to being more concerned about social justice.
