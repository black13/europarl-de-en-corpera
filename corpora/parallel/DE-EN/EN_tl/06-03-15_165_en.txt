â€“ Mr President, this was announced as a debate with the Council.
You have just said that the Council is not yet present, but I do think we should wait for it to arrive, for what we want to do is to hear, and then discuss, a report on the Salzburg summit.
There is no point in us having the debate before we hear the report; it would be a pointless ritual.
