Mr President, I refer to Rule 142 in conjunction with Rules 132 and 137 of the Rules of Procedure.
Democracy can only work if the representatives of the people do not personally act in complete disregard of the wishes of the electorate and of the promises they made.
When we call – as we sometimes need to – for sacrifices to be made, when public budgets get tight, I would like to call on you once again to start your sittings on time; today we once again started five minutes late.
Your personal behaviour regarding the cumulative delays has already cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of Euro.
I call on the Members whose central election pledge was that they would use funds honestly – based on the world's leading daily newspapers today, the and the – finally to keep that promise.
It is pretty hard to take that you are now trying to prevent me from speaking.
