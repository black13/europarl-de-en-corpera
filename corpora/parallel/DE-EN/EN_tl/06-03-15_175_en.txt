â€“ Mr President, the problem is, of course, that certain Members who are down to speak on the Brok report are not there now and will be arriving only later on.
We can, of course, rearrange things somewhat.
Mrs Napoletano was ready to speak, and I am speaking now because I do mainly speak on the subject of the Balkans.
We can now, of course, simply combine the two, but some Members will be cross at not being able to speak to the Brok report because they were not there.
That is the problem!
