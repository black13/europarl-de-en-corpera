– Mr President, can I just, politely, ask whether you are in possession of information as to when the Council is actually going to turn up?
If what I hear is indeed the case, and they will be here in another quarter of an hour, then we can wait for a quarter of an hour, for we have had plenty of 15-minute delays in this place.
What I would suggest, then, is that, if the Council is going to be here in 15 minutes’ time, we can suspend the sitting for that long.
If they are going to turn up in an hour’s time, then we will have to think of something else.
We have no information on this whatsoever, but perhaps you do.
