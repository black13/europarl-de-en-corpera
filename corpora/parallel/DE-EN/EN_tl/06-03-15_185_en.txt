– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, while I would like to endorse what Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck said about my group’s stance on Israel’s policy over the past few days, I would also like to respond to what you said about the importance of this transitional stage.
It is one in which the EU should send out a clear message highlighting the principles of cooperation, those being renunciation of violence, acceptance of existing agreements and the recognition of Israel’s right to exist.
That is incredibly important, and the EU must not distance itself from it in any way.
That is why I believe the EU is making a grave mistake in continuing to give the interim government financial support.
While the EU should send humanitarian aid to the Palestinian areas and help the people who live in them, it should not be supporting the authorities there, for Hamas has neither acknowledged Israel’s right to exist nor renounced violence, and the message we are sending is a deadly one, in that Hamas has reiterated its view that the EU’s decision to continue sending money is an indication that it accepts its policies, while it is still refusing to negotiate with Israel on the grounds that it does not recognise its legitimacy.
The whole object of EU support is the promotion of the peace process, but it is wrong to give financial support to those who seek its downfall.
The EU must keep to the course it has set so far and must not abandon financial aid, which is its most important bargaining counter, and it is for that reason that I ask you to take another look at this.
