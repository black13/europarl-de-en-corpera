Mr President, I made the observation and expressed the wish that you should please try to get here on time.
Your predecessor Mr Cox saved the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of Euro by doing so.
The same applies to the committees.
This wastes EUR 12 million a year.
We cannot then say that we have no money for important social projects.
