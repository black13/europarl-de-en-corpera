– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report calls for the geographical boundaries of the European Union to be determined and its nature defined.
Not only some Christian Democrats, but also some Social Democrats, are casting around for alternatives to membership of the European Union.
I would like to remind the House that, a few years ago, political scientists and analysts could not imagine that the day would come when the Iron Curtain would no longer be there.
But it has gone now, and in that we can rejoice.
I appeal to the House to be cautious in predicting what the European Union will be like in twenty, thirty, or forty years’ time, when most of us will have long ceased from active involvement in politics.
I believe that would become us well in view of the way in which most of us were wrong about what was going to happen in 1989.
The other thing I would like to say is that everyone has been talking about the need for the Ankara protocol to be implemented, and they are right to do so, but what also has to be said is that Turkey and Northern Cyprus are also in favour of a solution, and we have given undertakings.
The old ‘’ maxim applies, and what that means is that the isolation of the northern part of the island, must, as the European Union has promised, be brought to an end.
What I have to say to Mr Brok is that I wish Helmut Kohl were not consigned to the history books, but might also, from time to time, again play a part in shaping the CDU’s policy on Europe.
