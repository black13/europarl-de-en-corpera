– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have a great to deal to add to what I said at the start.
I declared my support clearly, on behalf of the Council, for competition in the interests of consumers.
At the beginning of the debate, Mr Lehne requested that the Council deal with this issue.
Mr Radwan made a similar appeal to the Council.
I can only say that, where an effort is required on the part of the Council, and where we have the competence, the authority, we shall of course take action, and we shall do so in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties.
I should like to take this opportunity to engage, if I may, in a little self-promotion.
I should like to draw the House’s attention to an event that is being organised jointly by the Austrian and Finnish Council Presidencies, which may be of interest to those present.
On the occasion of the now traditional European Competition Day, Austria and Finland, the two Council presidencies for 2006, are holding an event entitled ‘Competition law and its surroundings – links and new trends’ in Vienna on 19 June 2006.
The main emphasis of this event will be on current trends in mergers and merger control.
Under the heading ‘Do mergers keep what they promise?’, the issue of the extent to which the Merger Regulation has brought in a new approach will be discussed on the basis of examples of a merger and the situation in an economy in transition.
We shall have the pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Kroes and also Martin Bartenstein, the Austrian Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Labour, to this event.
I can imagine that this will meet with some degree of interest.
