Mr President, I apologise if I have spoken for too long.
I will abbreviate my comments and conclude.
There is an urgent need for action on a variety of subjects.
My remarks would be incomplete if I did not mention the labour market, including in particular promoting the integration of young people into the labour market.
Within the European Council itself, we want to pay particular attention to combating youth unemployment.
One of our aims is to reduce the number of school drop-outs by 2010 and to ensure that more young people complete secondary education.
Combating long-term unemployment must also be at the heart of our efforts.
Finally, the subject of energy will also play a particularly important role, not only because of the importance of the sector in generating jobs and growth, but also, of course, in the light of recent events.
I hope that, in this respect just as on all the other subjects I have mentioned, the European Council will provide an important impetus that will decisively influence the future activities of all the institutions of the European Union.
