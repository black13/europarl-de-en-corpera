– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when we discussed the United Nations reform summit in late September of last year, one of the few things that we could really describe as a success was the planned replacement of the discredited Commission on Human Rights with a new Human Rights Council.
The only thing that was not yet settled was its composition and procedures.
It would really have been a serious defeat for the cause of human rights, but also for the United Nations, if we had failed in our attempt to replace this discredited Commission with a new Human Rights Council in a timely manner.
For this reason, today’s outcome of the lengthy negotiations was an important success, including for President Eliasson.
We congratulate him on this, as real improvements have been made.
To elaborate: the members of this new Human Rights Council have to be elected by secret ballot, namely by at least 96 countries.
Members can be excluded from the Human Rights Council subject to a two-thirds majority if they are guilty of gross human rights violations.
The Human Rights Council has to meet at least three times a year.
More continuity has been introduced into the work, and there is to be a regular review of the human rights situation in all the UN Member States.
These are five important successes.
I was at a loss to understand, therefore, why the United States attempted to block this.
Mr President-in-Office, the US made not only positive demands, but also the demand that the five members of the Security Council retained their privileged status, that they remained on the Human Rights Council, as it were, without being elected.
That would have been a serious error if one considers the human rights situation in the People’s Republic of China.
It is a good thing that today’s vote supported the proposals in this form.
