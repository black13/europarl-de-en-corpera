â€“ Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers: it is important that a decision has been taken not to leave this Human Rights Council in an embryonic state.
Respect for human rights in the classical sense is one of the cornerstones of the European understanding of values, which will be reinforced by the creation of this new body.
Although the proposal adopted is not ideal, it is a clear improvement on the Commission on Human Rights, which was still susceptible to influence from countries who had themselves committed extremely serious human rights violations.
It is an important step for human rights in the world.
A functioning body will be able to intervene more quickly in urgent cases and must oblige countries to stand up for, fight for and promote human rights.
A blockade would have meant the international community losing credibility in the fight against human rights crimes.
That is why it is a very good thing that this project did not fail; including in view of the important work of the many NGOs.
