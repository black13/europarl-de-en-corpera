– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to join in thanking the rapporteur for his really excellent reports, and also the shadow rapporteurs for their very efficient cooperation on this.
I regard both of these reports as among the very important dossiers of this parliamentary term: particularly the report on protected geographical indications and protected designations of origin.
As the Commissioner mentioned, there are already over 700 products that have been registered and 300 procedures that have been commenced.
That represents a key aspect as far as European agriculture and rural areas are concerned.
I believe that intellectual property is also relevant to these products, and that these products, as it were, contribute towards the identity of a region.
If we open up our markets to products from third countries, we must be able to make this conditional on these countries applying the same standards in terms of quality and social aspects as prevail within the EU.
The fact is that we are living in a global world, but nevertheless fair competition can only be afforded if the same requirements and rules apply within the WTO and are put into practice.
Generally speaking, however, we must take care that the procedure involves careful scrutiny, and that there is no levelling down.
Quality has its price.
As Horst Köhler, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, said yesterday, the EU’s higher prices must be matched by superiority in quality.
To cite an example, in Austria, there are 180 000 farmers engaged in production.
These demonstrably safeguard approximately 600 000 jobs upstream and downstream.
This also reveals how important active farming enterprises and family-run farms engaged in production are to rural areas.
