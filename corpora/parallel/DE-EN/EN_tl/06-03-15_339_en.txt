â€“ Mr President, in the last two centuries, population growth, the exploitation of natural resources, and environmental pollution have resulted in a rapidly increasing loss of growth.
As has been said many times today, man is dependent on biodiversity.
Forests, for example, not only supply us with the raw material wood and increase the oxygen content of air, but also clean our water and prevent erosion and flooding: a function of which awareness is growing in all corners of the world as the impact of climate change is increasingly felt.
As the Commissioner said, a decision was taken at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss.
At that time, the European Parliament delegation strongly criticised this insufficiently ambitious demand.
Within the EU, we went beyond that demand and said that, by 2010, the trend towards biodiversity loss was to be reversed.
I believe that the Commission and the Member States should continue to play a leading role and ensure that, at the 8th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreement is reached on measurable objectives and a specific time frame for the achievement of such objectives.
The EU and the Member States should also pay particular attention to marine biodiversity, and the EU must look at its own performance on this.
I should like to make just a fleeting mention of the European fisheries policy, a subject that is currently being discussed with our ACP colleagues on account of the alarming fall in stocks of various fish species.
