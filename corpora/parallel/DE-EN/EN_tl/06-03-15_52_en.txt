– Mr President, It goes without saying that the Lisbon Strategy’s goals – of 20 million new jobs, a 3% average annual growth in GDP, and a similar increase in the amount spent on research and development – are the right ones, but I have to tell Mr Lehne that the problem lies not in the destination, but in the strategy whereby it is proposed that we reach it.
Let us consider the present-day realities: our economic growth is averaging out at 1.5% and we have created only something like a quarter of the new jobs we hoped for – and very badly paid ones at that.
That is the fundamental problem.
This is the course we have been steering for six years, and the newly-adopted guidelines, which now have to be implemented as part of the national plans, reflect it.
Just take a look: in every Member State of the European Union, profits from productivity are going through the roof!
But what about wage rises?
Wages are staying where they were!
How, then, do you propose to stimulate domestic demand?
What is done always reflects the idea that social security benefits have some sort of adverse effect on a national economy, yet they do no such thing; they do it some good!
In the final analysis, high wages result in economic growth, but policy needs to be thought out all over again.
What we do not need is permanent deregulation and privatisation.
We do need competition, but what we need to compete for is higher social standards and higher environmental standards.
We need to come to the insight that the goods that we produce need to be manufactured in line with international labour standards.
That is what we need!
We will then have a chance of really following through the Lisbon Strategy to the goal we want to reach, and we will not do that by constantly reducing social security benefits in order to give businesses even more freedom; that is the wrong way to go about it.
