– Mr President, I would like to warmly thank Commissioner Verheugen for the speech he has just delivered, which was an excellent one.
With my headphones on, I was able to listen to it, although I have to say, Mr President, that if I had not used them I would scarcely have been able to understand it, the House’s loudspeakers notwithstanding.
There is no point in you, in your characteristically amicable way, speaking your own language into the microphone to tell the Members to sit down; the fact is that they will not understand you if what you say is not interpreted for them.
If you wanted to get them to sit down, you ought to have wielded the gavel.
I would just like to address a request to the House, and I do so as one of its own Members.
I do not think it is acceptable if we are unable to exercise the very minimum of courtesy and listen to those who address us.
