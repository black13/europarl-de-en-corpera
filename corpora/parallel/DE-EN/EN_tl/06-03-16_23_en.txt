Mr President, many of the diseases that people in Europe suffer from today are more or less directly related to our lifestyle.
One only has to think, for example, of the increase in nutrition-related diseases or in those caused by lack of exercise.
The approach of promoting strategies for a healthier lifestyle is therefore certainly an important one.
Their success will be doubtful, however, if some EUR 1.4 billion are put into an information system on health issues that serves only to exchange health reports.
Most of the diseases people suffer from, even here in Europe, are not caused by a lack of available information.
The truth is that health starts with your attitude to life.
Every child knows that people who take plenty of exercise and eat sparingly but naturally stay healthier.
People have known for a long time what is harmful to health without it being written on cigarette packets, beer and wine, sweets or finished products; that is imposing on people and taking decisions for them, when they want to make their own judgments.
Such supposedly deterrent measures are of doubtful success and I do not believe the public wants them.
As you may know, 66% of respondents in a survey were in favour of promoting health-conscious behaviour, by discounting insurance contributions for having regular medical check-ups, for example.
We ought to move more in that promising direction.
What is more, one thing is perfectly clear: preventing disease would also reduce the financial burden on our health system.
