Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to sincerely thank Mr Trakatellis for his excellent report.
It is in fact very difficult to do the greatest possible justice to all legitimate interests here while at the same time remaining cogent.
I therefore regret, for example, that cancer is no longer explicitly mentioned as a priority in the new health action programme.
You are more than right, however, Mr Trakatellis, to point out in your report that there must of course also be sufficient resources for all the objectives we have set ourselves.
At present we are a long way from that, however, not to mention the fact that we shall today be rejecting the Commission proposal for a joint action programme for health and consumer protection as totally unacceptable.
In health policy, too, the public wants more protection from Europe, not less.
Health policy takes fourth place among the European policy priorities you mention.
That itself makes it a matter of urgency that health should be given its own action programme again.
I cannot understand how even the Commission could propose such a low budget allocation or how the Council could cut it still further.
We are therefore trying to remedy two cardinal errors here today.
We want two separate programmes, and we want more money.
I am saying that primarily to the Council.
If the further reduction you want were to become reality, it would mean we only had one third of the previous funding for what will be 27 states.
That would mean, however, that we would be completely unable to provide primary and secondary prevention of certain diseases or the urgently necessary protection against the risks of disease occasioned by globalisation.
