Mr President, I would like to endorse everything the previous speakers have said and to thank Mrs Dührkop Dührkop in particular.
I want to make one thing perfectly clear: nothing can justify terrorism.
It is important that all democratic parties, all citizens who live in democracy and peace, clearly say: there is no way we will accept terrorism, that is not what we want, we want to live in peace and friendship with one another.
Every victim of terrorism is one victim too many.
Democracy and human rights: these are the values for which we all stand.
I hope that this day with the ETA announcement really will result in a political and peaceful solution to problems in Spain.
