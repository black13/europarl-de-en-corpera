Mr President, I refer to Rule 103 and Rule 130 of the Rules of Procedure.
Rule 130 is concerned with the agenda, Rule 103 with statements and proposals by the Commission.
I am not referring to today’s agenda, however, but to the agenda for the next plenary session, and I have the following request.
On the agenda for the next plenary session of the European Parliament we have a debate and a resolution of the European Parliament on the situation in Belarus.
Since the President, Vice-President and other members of the Commission are present, I am taking this opportunity to ask the following.
The situation in Belarus is cause for concern.
I do not believe the European Union can stand idly by while a dictator shamelessly destroys democracy in Europe.
Thought must therefore be given to the measures the European Union can take to put Mr Lukaschenko in his place.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission today to put forward suitable proposals on this agenda item before the debate in the next plenary session and to explain the measures which it – the Commission – is proposing or is able to propose for taking action against Belarus and its present government and for strengthening the opposition there.
