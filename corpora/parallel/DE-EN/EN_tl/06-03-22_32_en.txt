Mr President, there are situations where one has to come to an understanding.
You are no doubt correct in your interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, but we have another sitting tomorrow morning and I request, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we debate the situation in Belarus here in this House tomorrow ...,
in order to express our solidarity with the democrats in Belarus.
