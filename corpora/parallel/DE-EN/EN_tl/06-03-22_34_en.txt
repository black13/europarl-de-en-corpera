Mr President, I agree; our Group accepts that.
We can debate Belarus here tomorrow morning, that is no problem at all.
But we shall also have to discuss the hypocrisy that has just been shown here.
If a Group believes that this subject ought to have been debated here today or tomorrow, Mr Poettering, then a telephone call would have sufficed.
I spoke with you by telephone five minutes before the start of this sitting and I heard not a word from you on this subject.
I have just requested here that we debate it in the next sitting, then a fellow Member asked that we do it now.
You also show your democratic credentials in your ability to listen!
I have nearly finished.
A fellow Member asked that we do it now; that can be discussed quietly.
But to rehearse this revolt here, as though you – and you alone – were the defender of Belarus’ interests, we cannot go along with that.
We can debate the matter tomorrow, but not with your farcical behaviour.
