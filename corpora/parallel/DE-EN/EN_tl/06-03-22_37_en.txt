Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I am always pleased when the grand coalition starts to shake.
That is always good for Parliament.
The second thing I would like to say – and there is no need for excitement, because I think Mr Poettering is quite right, even if he did perhaps only see the light when he was in this Chamber, which would not be a bad thing either, Mr Schulz – is that we, the European Parliament, must debate this situation and take a clear stance towards Belarus and towards Russia, because Mr Lukaschenko would no longer be in power at all without Mr Putin!
If we do that tomorrow, we will have earned the stars of the European Union.
