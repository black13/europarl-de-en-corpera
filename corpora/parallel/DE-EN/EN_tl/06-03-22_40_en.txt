Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I came into the Chamber just now – and I am only speaking because Mr Schulz addressed me – I thought, this is the first sitting since I have been Group Chairman in which I do not need to speak.
It has turned out differently – you made the announcement about ETA and I responded because others spoke.
When I spoke on the telephone with Mr Schulz, on his initiative, at five minutes to three or five minutes to two – I do not exactly remember – I certainly had no idea that there would be a debate on Belarus here today.
Please believe me, I am putting my cards on the table, when I say that if I had wanted to instigate such a debate I would have spoken not only to Mr Schulz, but also to Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mrs Frassoni, Mr Wuertz, Mr Cawley, to everybody.
I came into the Chamber not knowing about this debate, heard my fellow Members’ reactions and thought I would show my good will by suggesting that we debate in the morning.
I still believe that is a good suggestion.
