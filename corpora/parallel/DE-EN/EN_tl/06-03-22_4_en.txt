Mr President, as you can imagine, the information you have given this House has provoked a lively response within our Group today.
One of the 200 members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is herself a victim of ETA terrorism, since her husband was murdered by ETA.
I hope you will agree to my asking my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop to say a few words on behalf of our Group.
