Mr President, our highly respected fellow Member Mrs Dührkop’s concluding remarks would also have been my first, namely that our thoughts today are with the men and women murdered by ETA and with their families.
Pleased as we of course are at this announcement, we are equally firm in saying there must be no political reward for such an announcement by ETA.
At a time such as this, when we hope for a peaceful future for the whole Basque country and the whole Spanish nation, our thoughts go out to people all over the world who are dying because of terrorism or who are being deprived of their individual liberties, as at present in Belarus, where some of the opposition is being imprisoned.
As freely elected Members of the European Parliament, it is our moral duty to speak out whenever the protection and dignity of human life are at stake.
Because the dignity and the protection of human life is the supreme value in Europe and in the world.
