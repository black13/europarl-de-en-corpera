Mr President, I am including the Parish report when I say that there are three things that Europe needs to secure its future: firstly, a healthy environment, particularly in terms of air, water and soil; secondly, healthy food and enough of it; and, thirdly, energy.
Rural areas are capable of offering us all these three things in sufficient measure and independently of external sources, on which we would only become reliant.
In this respect, it was disastrous when, a few months ago, in this Chamber, Tony Blair defamed farmers in Europe, in particular, as backward-looking.
Every cent that we invest in agriculture and in rural areas is an investment in the future of Europe.
These are three vital fields, which are full of innovation and future prospects.
The key to securing Europe’s future – and this is a revolutionary development of which we have yet to take nearly enough account – lies to an ever-increasing extent in our rural areas and rural, decentralised structures.
