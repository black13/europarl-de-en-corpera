Mr President, anyone who has ever flown over Africa in daylight knows how much the Democratic Republic of Congo is its geostrategic heart.
For this reason, we have to attempt to secure democracy and stability there.
However, the present critical discussion of this issue should be seen as a last warning sign that the necessary structures should be created at long last, including to safeguard Europe’s own interests in a neighbouring continent of such great strategic importance.
We are rightly making policy in other continents, we are taking responsibility for peace and freedom, but we are not managing to provide the instruments that are needed.
We need a European army at long last, a professional army, to supplement our conscript and other armies.
The national armies must continue to undertake domestic defence, but, largely, we are still lacking the instruments to intervene in other continents.
We are risking taking on too much, and so I say ‘yes’ to this deployment.
However, we must take this as a serious warning to make sure our common foreign and security policy also has the necessary instruments for peacekeeping at its disposal at long last.
