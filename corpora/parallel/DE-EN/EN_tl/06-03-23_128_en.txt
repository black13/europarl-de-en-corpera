Mr President, singles are praised in the contemporary media as the measure of all things.
Families with several children are virtually seen as antisocial.
Yet the higher the proportion of childless people today, the more young people will, in turn, want to remain childless.
In my opinion, the parents of tomorrow need to grow up with children to be able to appreciate them.
Therefore, we have to step up action to put the contemporary image of the family straight.
If we want to avoid a scenario where, in cities, the traditional family only exists among immigrants, I believe that we need to increasingly orient the promotion of the family towards the indigenous population of Europe, too.
Another important starting point, of course, is the reconciliation of family and career.
It is no coincidence that those countries that have succeeded in this have higher birth rates.
