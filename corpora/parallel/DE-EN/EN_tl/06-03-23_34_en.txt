. â€“ Mr President, alongside climate change, demographic change is probably the greatest challenge of the present day.
There are very many reasons why our birth rate is falling, with a consequent decline in future prospects for our society.
I should like to select just one aspect of this extremely complex issue: pension provision for mothers.
The work done by mothers, especially those with several children, receives far too little recognition.
One of the main problems is that most mothers from the days when mothers could not have or did not want careers because of bringing up and caring for their children are at a clear disadvantage, first in their careers and subsequently in old age.
In our affluent society, bringing up and caring for children should be given at least the same recognition as activities in the production and services sectors and should thus count fully towards pension entitlement.
The simplest, most comprehensive solution would be an unconditional basic income for all.
