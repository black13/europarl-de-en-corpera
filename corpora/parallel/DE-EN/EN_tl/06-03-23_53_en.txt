. â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his own-initiative report, which shows great commitment, and also for taking the trouble to travel to various Member States and see for himself the kind of possibilities already existing in the renewable raw materials sector.
As the Commissioner mentioned, over the last six months, energy has become the most important issue of the day.
An environmentally friendly, economical mix of all energy sources is indispensable for Europe.
Renewable raw materials and renewable energy could also form the mainstays of this mix.
Alongside wind, water, photovoltaic cells and biogas, this particular sector of renewable energy provides for basic needs in the fields of building and insulating materials, and raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry.
Producing food and crops for the generation of energy was common practice for centuries.
The use of fossil fuels on a massive scale took over from the energy for our draught animals, which was derived from plants.
The production of renewable raw materials for energy purposes is of fundamental importance to European agriculture and forestry, and to rural areas.
It has opened up new sources of income and also made an essential contribution to not only maintaining existing employment but also creating new jobs in rural areas.
The EU would do well to regard renewable sources of energy as an important factor in energy use, in order to reduce its own dependence on international energy producers and, particularly, on politically unstable regions.
Many thanks and sincere congratulations to the rapporteur.
