– Mr President, according to the original title, we were to have been debating the Assyrian community in Iraq, but then the Conference of Presidents changed the title to ‘the prisoners in Iraq’.
We have nothing against discussing the situation of the prisoners in Iraq, but we do think it a matter of urgency that something be said about the Assyrian community, and so I would ask that we agree that this debate is to be about the Assyrian community and the prisoners in Iraq.
