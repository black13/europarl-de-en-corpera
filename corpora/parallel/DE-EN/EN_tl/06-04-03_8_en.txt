– Mr President, without, admittedly, having given you prior notice, I should like to say something more on the subject of ‘Better Lawmaking’.
This is an important debate, and we agreed that it should be held this week, but it has turned out over the last couple of hours that there are still a few issues to be resolved as regards the vote.
It has been agreed with the authors, at any rate, that the vote on all four reports on better lawmaking should be held during the next part-session rather than this week.
I do not know whether we can go straight ahead and vote now if there is a consensus, but I did, in any case, want to say today that there is a strong movement in favour of debating the reports on better lawmaking this week, while not yet voting on them.
