â€“ Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Prets for her committed and competent work on this report.
Even though some of the previous speakers have already mentioned the problems that occurred in specific cases, I should like to emphasise that, so far, the history of the European capitals of culture has by and large been a successful one.
The individual cities named as capitals of culture have benefited, but so has Europe as a whole, because, time and again, these European capitals of culture have made it clear how diverse, rich and varied European culture is.
Nevertheless, I should like to focus on two aspects of this redrafted report that are particularly important to me.
Firstly, the idea of sustainability requires the capital of culture action not to be purely event-based, but to make a real contribution to encouraging greater social interaction, more promotion of art and culture, and new architectural designs.
This also includes the issue of structural change, and the value of cultural activities for Europe as a whole.
Secondly, the objective of establishing a truly European outlook and exchange and of emphasising European added value is a really decisive point in the redrafting of this programme, and there is still more to be done in this regard.
The best way we can win people over and generate enthusiasm is to make it clear what European interaction really is, and not to refer just to what was already available without it, but to get together with many European players and develop new facilities.
That will make the idea of European capitals of culture even more attractive in the years to come.
