â€“ Mr President, in the discussions prior to Austria's accession to the European Union, one of the main arguments put forward by those opposed to accession was the danger that environmental standards would fall.
We are now faced with a tragic example of this.
Greenhouse gases are currently on the agenda, and the effects of climate change can be seen in the news, in the form of the floods in Germany and Austria.
Climate protection really must be our absolute top priority, particularly now.
What do you imagine interested citizens think of you when you give free rein to greenhouse gases in the name of the internal market?
Austria and Denmark have acted consistently.
The economies of those countries were flexible enough to adapt and to deliver the goods.
Do you now want to protect the dinosaurs of the market, who do not want to move, from those who were lively enough to change?
I call on you to rectify this error.
Given the dangers now facing the global climate, penalising the pioneers of environmental protection is completely absurd.
