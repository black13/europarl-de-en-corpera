– Mr President, at the end of the debate you are now getting a hefty dose of Austrian contributions.
Austria may well, unfortunately, not always be a model pupil when it comes to environmental policy, but on the issue of fluorinated greenhouse gases we have stricter measures than were proposed in the package of harmonised legislation.
In my view, the European Union has two choices: either we harmonise at a high, ambitious level, or we continue to allow the Member States to retain their stricter, more ambitious targets and measures.
Austria and Denmark – as has frequently been mentioned, including, commendably, by the rapporteur, who has continually defended this position – have laid down general bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases.
Experience in those countries has shown that there are alternatives to these gases.
The draft approved by the Conciliation Committee at the end of January provides that Member States may retain stricter national requirements until 2012.
This step is possible under Article 95(10) of the Treaty – the 'safeguard clause', which allows stricter measures to be retained temporarily.
The European Parliament and the Council have agreed on such a safeguard clause.
This ensures – at least for the time being – that Austria and Denmark can continue to apply their stricter regulations.
It also means that the scientific evidence referred to in Article 95(4) need not be provided.
I am pleased that Mr Bonde obviously has access to more recent information according to which there is a better declaration from the Commission.
The statement we got from the Commissioner at the start of this debate was not satisfactory.
That, too, has been stressed in a number of contributions.
I also call on the Commission to take note of the attitude of Parliament and the Council and to give the Member States the necessary room for manoeuvre.
