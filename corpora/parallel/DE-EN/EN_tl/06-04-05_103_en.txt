– Mr President, I am giving this explanation of vote on behalf of the delegation from the Austrian People's Party.
We voted against the report because it calls for the currently applicable transitional periods for the free movement of workers to be abolished.
We voted against this because we expect the accession treaty, which all countries – including the new Member States – signed, to be retained, including its transitional provisions to protect the Austrian labour market.
This is quite justified, because statistics show that the number of workers from the new Member States has already doubled in the last two years.
The delegation from the Austrian People's Party opposes the report because, both now and in the future, only Austria can and will decide how long the entry restrictions guaranteed under the accession treaty will be retained in the interests of the Austrian workforce – it could be for up to seven years.
