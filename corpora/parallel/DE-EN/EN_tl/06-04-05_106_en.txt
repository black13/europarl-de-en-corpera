â€“ Mr President, there were transitional provisions when Greece and Portugal joined the EU, too, to enable the labour markets to adapt to the new situation.
It follows that this is not a way of branding the new Member States as second-class states.
Moreover, the transitional provisions are also welcomed by the new Member States to the east, inasmuch as they also serve national interests there.
In view of the high levels of unemployment, particularly in Austria and Germany, and of the increasing pressure on the low pay sector, freedom of movement for workers right now would be completely irresponsible.
We are already having to deal with large numbers of people pretending to be self-employed, some of whom are evading taxes and social contributions.
Until companies stop relocating to the low-tax economies in the east and trying to extricate themselves from tariff agreements, and until the market has adapted to the new situation or appropriate accompanying measures have been put in place, complete freedom of movement for workers would be irresponsible.
That is why I voted against this report.
