. – Mr President, Commissioner, Mr High Representative, during the elections in both Palestine and Israel, it was still clear to me, despite the different outcomes, that the great majority of citizens on both sides are moderate, and that they want peace and an end to violence.
It is important to reach an agreement that will stand up.
It must therefore be a negotiated agreement, because only negotiated agreements accepted by both sides can stand up.
It is important for us to contribute to this and, in particular, for the Quartet to have a greater presence in the region than previously, through their leaders, in order to provide the necessary security guarantees and encouragement.
In this context, it is clear to me that Palestine must be a viable state, and that we will therefore have to continue to provide humanitarian aid.
To what extent that can go through the autonomous authority remains to be seen.
When I read on Xinhua that the new Palestinian Foreign Minister has said, 'I hope that our dream of having an independent state on the entire territory of historical Palestine will be realised one day, and I am sure that there is no room for the State of Israel on this land', in times like these, that is not a good statement to hear.
Maybe that is a misquotation, but, if it is, in any event it needs to be corrected so that the process can carry on in the right direction.
It is abundantly clear that the renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist will continue to be two of the essential preconditions for good relations with a Palestinian government that wants our support – especially financial support.
We need to understand how important this task is: there is a correlation between peace in the region and world peace.
That is why we should help the new team to achieve a breakthrough in the new situation following the elections.
