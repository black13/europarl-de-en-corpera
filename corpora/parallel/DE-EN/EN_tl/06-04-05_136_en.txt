– Mr President, I am very pleased with the statements by the High Representative and the Commissioner.
By the way, you speak for the majority of this House and for the majority of Europe, and certain others need to accept that.
I am also very pleased about the emphasis placed on the need for a negotiated solution.
It is true that we need to negotiate, but that means that Hamas and Israel must also be prepared to do likewise.
Thinking about Gaza, Israel did not negotiate there.
Of course, we also need to explore the reasons why Hamas was elected.
For years, another government, namely Fatah's, was undermined, partly by its own fault – through corruption and other circumstances, for example – but also due to Israel's refusal to accept it as a negotiating partner.
Even following Mr Arafat's death, when Mr Abbas was President – and this was during the withdrawal from Gaza – it was not accepted.
It therefore takes two to negotiate, and both sides need to be willing.
Secondly, Israel's right to exist, in a peaceful climate and within reasonable borders, must obviously be recognised, but Israel must also accept, at least in principle, that the UN's resolution regarding its borders is right.
It is quite clear that corrections will still need to be made – we all know that, if we are realistic – but if even the principle is not accepted, there will be difficulties.
My third point is that we must do all we can to improve the situation in Gaza, including economically, so that Gaza is viable.
The withdrawal of troops alone cannot guarantee that.
Finally, we are deeply concerned at the developments in East Jerusalem.
Even though we welcome Kadima and the reasonableness of its members, when it comes to East Jerusalem they do not yet have the sense to acknowledge both that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that the Palestinians have a claim to East Jerusalem.
That should continue to be a clear policy within the European Union.
