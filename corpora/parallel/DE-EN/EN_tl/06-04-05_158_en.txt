– Mr President, I should like to start by warmly welcoming, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, our guests from Belarus, Mr Milinkevich and Mr Viachorka.
Our group has the greatest respect for the achievements and the courage of the active opposition movement in Belarus.
Despite threats of violence, you protested against the election fraud in peaceful demonstrations.
We also believe that Mr Lukashenko no longer has any legal claim on power, and we admire the independence, calm and clarity with which you, Mr Milinkevich, dealt with the difficult situation in October Square and Kupala Park.
Many congratulations on this achievement!
We saw in the television reports how the peaceful demonstrators were brutally detained by the police.
For many of your supporters, arrest, imprisonment and expulsion from university were the results of simply exercising their right to free expression, a basic right that goes without saying in the countries of the European Union.
However, we believe that they are the new power in the country and can bring democracy and economic recovery to Belarus.
We hope that the spirit of freedom will stay alive in Belarus.
Mr Winkler, thank you for taking on board many of our requests.
When imposing the visa bans, though, please do not leave out those who detained the demonstrators in such a brutal way.
They must go on the list.
Please also remember – as others have already said – that Mr Putin supports Mr Lukashenko and that this fact must be a focus of discussions with Russia.
