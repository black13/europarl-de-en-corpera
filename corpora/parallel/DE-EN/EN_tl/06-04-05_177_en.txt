Mr President, I will be even briefer, because the President-in-Office has already said it all.
The elections were indeed free and fair, and we can really be delighted with that.
President Yushchenko set himself that target, and he certainly achieved it.
It now remains to be seen what sort of coalition will be created.
The coalition negotiations are in progress, and they are not easy, but it is important that we make it clear now that we will be happy to work with any coalition that wants to continue to work with the European Union and move in our direction.
It is very important for us to indicate right now that we will give Ukraine the option of a closer agreement, in which the issue of the WTO will play a particularly important role.
Once Ukraine is a member of the WTO, we can have a free trade area, which is absolutely vital for further progress in Ukraine.
That pretty much covers everything.
It goes without saying, though, that we want to continue to work with Ukraine as it approaches the European Union, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy.
