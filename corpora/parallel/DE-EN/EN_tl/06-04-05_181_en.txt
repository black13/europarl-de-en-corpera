– Mr President, what was the most important thing I noticed as an election observer in the Ukraine?
It was the total dedication with which many citizens exercised their right to vote freely, for which they had fought a year previously.
It was almost shocking to come back to Germany after these elections and to see how unimportant this right now is to Germans, and how few people really value it.
The conclusion I draw from this experience is that Europe can benefit enormously from this process in Ukraine.
We cannot continue with the 'business as usual' attitude that has crept into the relationship between the European Union and Ukraine just one year after the Orange Revolution.
I have the impression – and this is based partly on the writer Yuri Andrukhovych's stirring speech in Leipzig – that there is a risk that Kiev is losing hope in Europe.
That must not be allowed to happen.
Therefore, I would say to you, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, and to the Council: you must be more precise and more ambitious in the offers you make to Ukraine.
You must not allow the statement by the former Commissioner for Enlargement, Mr Verheugen, that there would still be no place for Ukraine in the European Union even in 20 years time, to stand.
Nobody in a position of responsibility in the European Union should make such dogmatic statements in public.
