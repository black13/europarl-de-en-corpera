Mr President, I would just like to respond to a few questions.
Mr Tannock, I am deeply impressed by your report on the elections.
I would not go so far as to compare Ukraine’s election law with the law of our countries, as different countries have different election laws, but the important thing is that the elections in Ukraine were indeed fair and democratic and I think that is very important.
I was also very impressed by the election observers' report of the great enthusiasm.
In order to keep up this enthusiasm, and the faith in the European Union, we – the European Union, that is – must now take specific steps.
We are ready to do so.
I absolutely agree that it is not sensible to talk about specific timetables, but to avoid stumbling we need to take one step at a time, and not try to run before we can walk.
The next step is to develop greater cooperation.
There is a specific need for this, and the Council will do so in cooperation with the Commission.
We are doing this in order to help Ukraine to develop further and to implement the necessary reforms.
When Mr Kaminski said that it was not up to us to assess the elections and the parties, he was quite right.
However, we can note with satisfaction that those who advocate a closer relationship with the European Union won and have the majority.
We should therefore hold out our hand to them.
