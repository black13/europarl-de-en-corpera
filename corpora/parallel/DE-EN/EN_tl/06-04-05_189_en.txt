Mr President, I, too, will keep my comments brief.
I should just like to assure you that we will certainly not let this become a matter of routine.
I am sorry that Mrs Harms has already left, because I should have liked to have said that to her personally.
It is precisely using this possibility of a deeper and stronger agreement that it will be achieved.
When one looks at what it all involves – quite apart from increased political dialogue – it primarily comes down to cooperation in legal matters and in the particularly important fields of justice and internal affairs.
Firstly, one thing that is particularly important to us, and which was mentioned during the debate, is the issue of energy policy, which, for all of us, is becoming an increasingly vital aspect of foreign policy.
Then there is the free trade agreement, to which I referred earlier.
There can therefore be no question of 'business as usual' in this field.
Secondly, as the Commissioner responsible for this field, I always made my statements extremely precise, perhaps too precise for some.
I should like to make this quite clear: as I have always said, the future cannot be prejudged.
At the moment, however, we are working through the neighbourhood policy, which does not provide for membership.
I cannot be any more precise.
That does not mean, though, that we will not continue to work with Ukraine with great verve and enthusiasm, as the President-in-Office said.
We are very pleased with these elections.
They represent a huge step forwards, and I am delighted that so many of you observed them and share this opinion with us.
