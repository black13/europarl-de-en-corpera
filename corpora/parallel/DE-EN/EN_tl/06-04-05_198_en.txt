Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate goes back to a very serious question from the Committee on Transport and Tourism about the financing of present and future measures in the matter of security.
That is what I want to comment about.
Transport security could also have been discussed with the Titley report.
So it is being discussed now, and we are talking primarily not only about the financing of additional measures in individual States, which are calling for more security at airports, but also – and this is serious – the overall system.
We were promised a communication here that ought to have provided us with the basis for this debate.
Now Parliament is being called upon to put forward proposals.
I am sure we all agree that we want a good foundation on which to do that.
We are not talking only about aviation.
The tragic events in Madrid have given us cause to reflect that other traffic routes and modes of transport are faced with the same challenge.
However, if we want fair competition between the different modes of transport, there must also be fair rules for the financing of security measures.
Hence my question: when can we expect the study?
Does it include this aspect, and can we count on being able to make good plans for further action on the basis of that study?
