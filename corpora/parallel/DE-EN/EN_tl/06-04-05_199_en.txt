– Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we can only put a positive image of Europe across to people if we have as many specific examples as possible to make clear that acting at European level brings people definite added value.
More safety in the transport sector, especially on the roads, will benefit hundreds of millions of European citizens: more safety, fewer accidents, less human suffering.
The mid-term review that has been mentioned several times shows that.
But it also shows that we still have a great deal of work to do.
If we look at it like that, it is important that renewed efforts are made.
But it will also be particularly important that all projects and all measures are well organised.
The proposed policy mix sounds sensible, but it will also cost money.
In this connection, we must try to ensure that European money is used sensibly, appropriately and economically.
It is of course also important that these scarce European resources ultimately end up with the people and do not drain away somewhere.
When I say that, I am not at all thinking of embezzlement, fraud and the like, but am thinking of the fact that, in aviation in particular, most European airports and airport operators make a great deal of money.
It is four years since we agreed on public cofinancing in the interinstitutional agreement, and if we now make money available – which will take some time – I am almost certain that people will not benefit from that money, but that we will get a new charge that will then probably be offset by refunding other charges.
So if we take this route and use public money, we should ensure that people and air passengers will actually gain something tangible from it.
