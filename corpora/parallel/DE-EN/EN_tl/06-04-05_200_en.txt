Madam President, Vice-Chancellor, Vice-President of the Commission, I am now rather confused.
Mrs Lichtenberger has already said that today’s subject – as the Committee on Transport and Tourism also intended – should be transport security and everything related to it.
Now I listen to the Vice-Chancellor and there is not a word on transport security.
In my opinion, that is no way to deal with this House.
At least part of your speech should have dealt with this subject.
After all, that is what Parliament wanted.
I cannot understand why that did not happen, because I do not believe that 11 September passed you by unnoticed.
The only reason is perhaps that the Council is not interested in the subject.
But that would be the wrong approach.
As regards the content, I of course agree with my fellow Members that counter-terrorism is clearly a state responsibility and clear lines must be drawn here.
It must be clarified that in some countries the taxpayer pays for it, in other countries the airlines, in others the airports and passengers.
That is why I want the Commission to take measures relatively quickly so that we can deal with this matter in practice and as legislators ensure that the situation is clear and there are no distortions of competition in this area.
