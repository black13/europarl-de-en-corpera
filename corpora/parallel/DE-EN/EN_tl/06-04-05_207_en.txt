I can tell the honourable Member quite plainly that we will never be satisfied until all international obligations are met.
That is why we must repeatedly make inquiries and refer to individual cases.
The situation is still not satisfactory.
That is also the reason why we will continue to raise this question at all levels.
If you are calling on us to apply more pressure, then I must ask you, honourable Member, what pressure the European Union is supposed to bring to bear on China.
Political pressure, that is bringing forward questions and repeatedly reminding them of them?
Yes!
Other opportunities, where the European Union does not confront China directly – and I believe they are important – are international bodies, the United Nations, hitherto the Human Rights Commission.
It will certainly continue to be a matter for the UN Human Rights Council.
I have already mentioned that the UN special rapporteur has a particular role to play here.
These are all levels and channels through which this question can be raised.
We will only ultimately be satisfied when complete freedom of belief and religion has been achieved.
