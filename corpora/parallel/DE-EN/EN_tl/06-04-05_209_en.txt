I have never said – because it would be incorrect – that our efforts are concerned only with Catholics or only with Christians.
Freedom of religion is a human right that applies to all religions moving within the democratic framework.
Falun Gong is a special case, especially because we know, as you mentioned, that degradation and torture are used.
We are of course following this with great concern and are also raising it repeatedly.
You mentioned the re-education camps.
We have raised them as well, not only in connection with religious freedom but generally.
The Chinese side has known for many years that re-education camps have long been a thorn in the flesh of the European Union, because they certainly do not meet the normal international standards of human rights.
You can therefore be assured, honourable Member, that we are also seeking to end the suppression of the Falun Gong faith and its adherents.
