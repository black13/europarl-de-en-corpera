Madam President, in response to Mr Papadimoulis’ question I must first of all say that the Council has never discussed the incidents he mentions.
I must also point out that it is the Commission’s task to ensure compliance with the Treaties and the provisions enacted by the organs of the Union on the basis of those Treaties.
If the Commission believes that a Member State has failed to comply with an obligation under Community law, it may of course refer the matter to the Court of Justice for a decision, and that is what it does.
Madam President, I could now say something about the legal position.
I assume the honourable Member is fully acquainted with the legal position and would therefore prefer not to list every single directive, but to mention just a few, such as the data protection directive, Directive 95/46, and a number of others, such as one which requires operators of publicly accessible electronic communications services to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to guarantee the security of their services.
There are also a host of other Community rules.
If those Community rules are not complied with, then the Commission has not only the right but also the duty to initiate appropriate measures, and it does so.
