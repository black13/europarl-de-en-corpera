Madam President, I believe in the rule of law.
The regulations are clear.
There are national and European authorities that monitor compliance with those regulations.
Of course, none of us is immune to breaking the law.
The important thing, however, is that the competent European authorities take appropriate action when Community law is broken.
The Council has no powers here.
If the Commission believes that the rules are not adequate, it and it alone has the right to propose that they be amended.
That is how the European Union works, and we would be well advised to stick to these procedures, which are laid down in the Treaties.
