I do not know whether that was a philosophical question.
I am not a philosopher, I am a lawyer.
I would answer your question like this.
Infringements of civil rights must always be a matter of concern to us, not only abstractly, but quite specifically, whether it is the illegal tapping of telephone conversations or anything else.
The rules that we have, both national and European rules, are there to prevent that.
If they are unable to prevent it, we must draw the appropriate conclusions.
That seems to me the logical answer to your question and to the question from the honourable Member from Greece.
So far as I am aware and according to the most recent Commission report from last year, Greece has incidentally not yet notified any measures to implement the directive in question and the Commission has therefore taken it to the European Court of Justice, which only goes to prove that the system is working.
Austria, too, is repeatedly accused of being in breach of the Treaties.
We are given the opportunity to comment on that.
That is how the system works and in my view that is how it ought to work.
