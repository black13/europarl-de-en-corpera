I share your belief in the rule of law, Mr Winkler.
But I am sure you can still remember the unpleasant bugging scandal in the Justus Lipsius Building, where the offices of several delegations were bugged, in particular some from the present Council Presidency.
When it was discovered where the bugging had originated, the whole matter fizzled out.
Was there a final report on the matter and what measures have been taken to prevent this building being bugged?
