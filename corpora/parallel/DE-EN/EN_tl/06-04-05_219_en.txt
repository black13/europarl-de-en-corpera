To be honest, Mr Seeber, I do not know.
I have no answer to your specific question as to how that matter was concluded, but I nevertheless believe that wrong remains wrong.
The fact that something unlawful happened should not call the legal system itself into question.
I cannot give you a definite answer on the incident.
It also took place before the Austrian Presidency, and the Austrian Presidency did not therefore feel itself in any way called upon to take any particular steps in the matter.
Besides, I assume that appropriate measures were and are being taken to prevent such incidents recurring.
