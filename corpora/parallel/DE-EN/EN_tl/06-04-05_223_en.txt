.
I do not agree that we as the Council of the European Union are sending contradictory signals.
There is a clear procedure that is moving forward.
Everything will be examined in due course and the various points will have to be satisfied as stipulated.
Besides, the Council is constantly deliberating and will have to reach a conclusion.
There is not always unanimity there.
But signals are only sent out when there is a consensus.
I do believe that the Council is proceeding consistently and logically over the progress of negotiations and seeking compliance with obligations and will continue to do so; as I have made very clear, these are obligations that must be met.
