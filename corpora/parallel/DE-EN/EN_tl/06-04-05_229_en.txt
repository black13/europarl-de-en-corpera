I entirely agree that this is a very serious case.
If this case was raised at a relatively brief meeting like a lunch, that does not mean we do not take the case seriously.
As you know, the European Union is about to begin negotiations with the Lebanese government on an action plan as part of the European neighbourhood policy, in which we shall of course be raising human rights and democracy as main priorities, as is usual with such action plans.
This action plan will also mention the necessity of building an independent and impartial judiciary.
It will be a useful instrument for supporting the government in tackling important and necessary reforms in these areas.
You mentioned the association agreement that came into force on 1 April; that means we now have an additional new instrument available to develop and intensify the human rights dialogue with the Lebanese government.
