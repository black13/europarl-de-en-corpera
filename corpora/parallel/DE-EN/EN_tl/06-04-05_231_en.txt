.
I can answer this question very briefly.
I fully agree with the honourable Member.
It is not only – it is also – about the question of the fulfilment of obligations in connection with the initiatives and activities with regard to Syria, as we know them within the United Nations.
So far as the European Union is concerned, it is quite specifically about the fulfilment of human rights obligations.
It is being raised, we are taking it seriously.
We now have the necessary means to be able to raise these questions in all seriousness and with all urgency, and that we will do.
