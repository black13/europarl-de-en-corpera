I would like to make it absolutely clear that we in the Council are certainly not applying double standards.
Human rights violations are raised whenever they occur.
The question of the compatibility of Guantánamo with the relevant provisions of international law and of humanitarian law in particular has been raised with the United States.
I have also quoted what the President of the Council said when she voiced the hope that Guantánamo will soon be a thing of the past.
We as the Council of the European Union have also supported the efforts of the UN special rapporteur on torture, Mr Novak, to prevent arbitrary arrest and inhuman treatment.
We certainly do bring this question up with US representatives, including and starting with the President, and with the Secretary of State.
It is certainly not true that we are trying to ignore the matter.
