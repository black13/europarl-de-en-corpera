. â€“ Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question related specifically to the time frame for the European Magistrale from Paris to Vienna via Strasbourg and Munich and the branch line to Rome through the Brenner Base Tunnel.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office about the overall project, but in particular the connections from Munich to Vienna and Rome.
