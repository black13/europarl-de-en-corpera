. – In response to the question by Mr Posselt, I should like to say that the Council Presidency is of the opinion that the extension of the two railway axes – axis No 17: Paris – Strasbourg – Stuttgart – Vienna – Bratislava, and axis No 1: Berlin – Munich – Verona – Palermo – is vital to counteract congestion on the roads, particularly by heavy goods vehicles.
These are large-scale projects that aim to create a balance between the various modes of transport and to contribute towards a sustainable transport system in the EU.
In addition, these cross-border projects improve economic integration in the internal market.
Since the honourable Member has specifically enquired about the timescales, I can say that the construction of the two axes is expected to be completed in 2015.
However, the final decision on these large cross-border projects and their swift implementation naturally depends on the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013 and partly – as I have already mentioned – on the necessity of finding private funding.
Once there is agreement on the necessary budget, a long-term implementation plan is required for the completion of these ambitious projects.
By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is my firm personal conviction, particularly as regards the North–South transit route of axis No 1: Berlin – Munich – Verona – Palermo, that the first sod will have been turned by the end of this year and we shall be able to begin.
I myself turned the first sod for the heart of the project, the Brenner Base Tunnel, and, over the last three-and-a-half years, together with my fellow Minister Mr Lunardi, I have done my utmost to bring this project to where it is now.
I believe that a concerted effort is appropriate and necessary in respect of these two important axes.
