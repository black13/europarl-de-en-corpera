. â€“ It is like I have already said.
There is a total of thirty priority TEN projects, and these are ranked, with coordinators appointed for the most important six.
Experience will show delays here and there, however, and then the ranking will have to be reviewed.
That is why I have emphasised that the ranking system is good and important.
The High-Level Group under Mr van Miert has done excellent work on this.
We shall have to show flexibility, however, as the routes are important not only for economic growth and employment, but also for the implementation of the principle stated in various white and green papers, namely that of shifting freight transport from the roads to the railways.
We need to provide intact projects for this, too.
I am convinced that we cannot fight too hard, together, to secure the relevant resources for this, including beyond the coming period.
I have great confidence here in the innovative potential and approaches, mentioned earlier, of making use of private funds, too, so that projects can be implemented more quickly than would otherwise have been possible, not only in the interests of the economy and of job creation, but also, in particular, of the environment and the people living along many transit routes.
