I am very much obliged to the Vice Chancellor for first raising the subject of the Financial Perspective.
Indeed, we have tonight agreed to provide EUR 500 million more direct funding for the TEN projects and an additional EUR 500 million to obtain EIB loans.
He has therefore ended up with EUR 7.3 billion.
My question to the Vice Chancellor relates to one of the projects vital to Europe and to Austria, the Brenner Base Tunnel.
Can he tell us how he sees the progress that has been made on this TEN project, since this project is so vital to the EU?
