. – Mr Karas, I shall be very happy to do so.
The situation with the Brenner Base Tunnel, the heart of the Berlin–Palermo transit route, is as follows.
The Commission has promised to cofinance the pilot tunnel to the tune of 50% – a large sum.
The investment volume for this pilot tunnel amounts to approximately EUR 450 million.
We are currently in phase 2, the preparatory stage, and, in the summer of this year, we shall start boring this pilot tunnel and do our utmost to implement phase 3 – the phase of constructing the Brenner Base Tunnel itself – in no more than two-and-a-half to three years, so as to guarantee its completion by 2015 at the latest, as envisaged by the international treaty between Italy and Austria.
As I have always said, if we are ambitious in our pursuit of these objectives, it is quite possible to save a couple of years, so that, in the best-case scenario, the heart of this transit route – the Brenner Base Tunnel – could be completed in 2013.
I should also like to emphasise here, however, that, if the countries concerned are in agreement and the Commission gives them maximum support – as Vice-President Barrot, who has also been enquiring about the situation on site, has just done – there will be progress to match.
I am also relying heavily on the Commission and the EU for the remaining cofinancing.
