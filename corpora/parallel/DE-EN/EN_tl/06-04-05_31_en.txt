â€“ Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true to say that this spring summit has not been a failure, but it did repeat certain errors of the past that I regard as worthy of criticism.
Promising the creation of 10 million jobs was, after all, strongly reminiscent of the first Lisbon summit.
The emphasis on youth was something else that tended towards the rhetorical, and, to judge by the French example, the young do not appear to have taken much notice of it.
I regard the globalisation fund as a reward for those who reject reform; fostering structural change is what the structural and cohesion policies are there for.
Mr Schulz is also right to say that the Member States would not pull their weight.
At an energy summit held in Berlin yesterday, everything was up for discussion except the opening up of the electricity and gas markets.
Not a lot is to be expected of the Member States on this front, and so it is all the more encouraging that the Commission is at last rejoining the fray and instituting proceedings against the Member States, not least the French, in respect of their protectionism on the energy markets.
The necessary response, then, is not to do as in the past and make promises, but to make more competition possible, and the fact that the Commission is at last doing something about this gives cause for hope.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
