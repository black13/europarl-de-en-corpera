Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe needs a new energy and transport policy.
What I would say to Mr Schüssel is that it is yet to be seen whether opting for 20% more energy efficiency and 15% renewable energies amounts to a breakthrough.
For my own part, I am convinced that the most important thing about this is that we need, in transport and energy, a new culture, so what do I mean by that?
If it is indeed efficiency that we want, we need to forge an alliance with artisans and banks in order, at last, to make headway with our stock of buildings.
We need an alliance with the major cities in order to make our cities, once more, welcoming and pleasant places in which to live; we need less traffic and to be mobile while consuming less oil.
The reason why this initiative does not, I think, do sufficient justice to this is that the Commission relies too much on big business rather than on an alliance with small and medium-sized businesses and the general public.
I have three specific questions that I would like Chancellor Schüssel to answer.
The first has to do with research into energy.
How do you propose to explain to the Austrian public and to Austrian small and medium-sized businesses the fact that we, in the fifth research programme, will be spending, or intend to spend, five times as much on nuclear power than on renewables?
How, too, do you propose to carry on a debate about nuclear issues in Austria and Europe when Mr Barroso has deleted any reference to ‘risk’ as regards the atom from the Green Paper?
I have to tell him that an ideology-free debate is one in which we also discuss the risks associated with things nuclear.
It is with you, Mr Schüssel, that responsibility rests for our having an objective debate, and you cannot simply retreat and shelter behind national independence.
