– Mr President, if we take the twin-track approach to the Lisbon Strategy – considering it once as part of the budget and again through the national plans – then it does indeed get me wondering whether the compromise for which we are currently striving in the context of the European budget will really be enough to make the necessary resources available.
I say that it will not, any more than will the national budgets, if you care to take a look at those.
The funds that are needed for research and development, for training and education, are quite simply not being raised as they should be.
At your summit, you said that more needs to be done for the small and medium-sized business sector, and you were right to do so, but, if I want to do something for the small and medium-sized business sector, if I want to create jobs, then I have to do something to bring about an increase in public investment, and it is an unfortunate fact that that is not increasing, not in the Member States.
I have to do something to build up domestic demand, and you cannot do that by cutting incomes, by trying to extend people’s working lifetimes, by substituting private insurance schemes for social security systems founded upon the principle of solidarity.
That is precisely the wrong way to go about it.
Instead, we need to replace the Lisbon Strategy with a strategy of European solidarity and sustainability.
Just take a look at the results.
The risk-of-poverty threshold has not changed; it stood at 16% in 2000, and that is the level it is at today.
During the same period, long-term unemployment has risen from 3.9% to 4.1%.
The percentage of people in work has risen from 63% to 64%, which represents a slight improvement.
We are a very long way from what we undertook to achieve, and the reason for that is that the strategy is wrong.
This Lisbon Strategy in its present form will get us nowhere.
