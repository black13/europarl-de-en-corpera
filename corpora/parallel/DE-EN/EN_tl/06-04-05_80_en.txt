â€“ Mr President, I voted in favour of the Roure report on the grounds that it constitutes a very positive initiative in favour of greater security.
For the first time, the cooperation of liaison officers posted by Member States to serve in third countries is put on an institutional footing and specifically regulated.
For the first time, too, the cooperation of liaison officers with Europol liaison officers and their coordination by Europol liaison officers in the third countries is assured.
Moreover, Member States facing potential threats from states in which they have no liaison officers, can be supplied with early information through liaison officers of other Member States.
The institutionalisation of the cooperation of liaison officers adds to security around the European Union and in its immediate neighbourhood.
This is in the public interest and in the interest of security within the European Union.
