Receiving the title 'European Capital of Culture' is meant to – and should – considerably improve a city’s image, but European Capital of Culture status should not primarily be about a year-long festival in the city and short-term marketing of local culture.
Newcastle and Bilbao have shown that culture can also have a long-term effect.
In times when budgets are being pared to the bone, the follow-up costs for new prestige projects are often neglected.
The proposed Internet portal, as a tool for exchanging information and providing assistance, could be used to avoid problems in the organisation and implementation of the year of culture before they arise.
It could, at a much earlier stage, avoid applicants unnecessarily spending millions on elaborate advertising campaigns without actually getting the grant in the end, or even, as in the case of the former capital of culture Weimar, having to close down the city museum because of major financial losses.
In 2009, the title of Capital of Culture will go, once more, to an Austrian provincial capital – Linz.
The preparations are already underway, and it remains to be seen whether they are being made with the necessary foresight.
