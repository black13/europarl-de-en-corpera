– Mr President, the effectiveness of aid and the fight against corruption runs like a scarlet thread through many debates, but particularly through those we have had since yesterday evening.
Today's order of business features Mr van den Berg’s report on the effectiveness of aid and on combating corruption in developing countries, and I too would like to join in the congratulations and gratitude to him that have been expressed; his report and what he said by way of introduction to it show very well the need for corruption to be fought and prevented for hampering development any longer.
At a time when we need to get it into our heads that a significant increase in spending on development cooperation is needed, serious talking needs to be done about fighting corruption, so that corruption can no longer serve as an easy excuse.
Corruption, as a phenomenon, is both global and complex; it is not only in the developing countries that the causes of its occurrence there are to be sought.
The OECD’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials is an important means of addressing the connections between corruption on our own countries and corruption in the developing world.
I believe that we – that is, the European Union – must do everything possible to get Latvia, Lithuania and Malta – which are EU Member States – to ratify this convention as soon as possible.
I would like to say something else about direct budgetary support.
There is an increasing tendency in the European Union to opt for direct budgetary support rather than projects, and, basically understandable though that is, there are very many doubts about this, which have indeed been aired today.
There are doubts as to whether we have at our disposal sufficient capacity and sufficient personnel to guarantee the comprehensive monitoring that will be necessary.
