I wish, by means of this statement of vote, to give my support to this proposal, which I believe makes it possible to bring about a substantial improvement in this process.
The consequence of the current situation is that there is an enormous amount of work to be done by the Member Statesâ€™ consulates in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein, and costs are incurred by third-country nationals.
This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs and must be changed.
When issuing residence permits, both Switzerland and Liechtenstein carry out exact examinations and inquiries, paying careful attention to security.
I would also like to point out that both Switzerland and Liechtenstein apply in every case the same high-quality security standards as the other States, which belong to the EU.
It is important to me that this statement of vote should be supportive of Switzerland and of those in it who are working towards its accession to the European Union.
Were Switzerland to join the EU, that would be something I would very much welcome, since Switzerland is a byword for high standards and has distinguished itself, , by a transport policy that many Member States should take as an example of how these things are to be done.
