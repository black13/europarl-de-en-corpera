On behalf of the SPÖ delegation and as their representative on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to state that Austria and Denmark have imposed overall bans on the utilisation of fluorinated greenhouse gases.
This legislation must ensure the possibility of stricter regulations being retained.
The draft produced by the Conciliation Committee provides that Member States may retain stricter national requirements until the end of 2012.
This step is possible under Article 95(10) of the Treaty and ensures that Austria and Denmark can retain their stricter measures on a temporary basis.
It also means that the scientific evidence pursuant to Article 94(4) need not be provided.
Any restrictive interpretation of the safeguard clause must be rejected, since the Member States’ discretion must in no way be impaired.
