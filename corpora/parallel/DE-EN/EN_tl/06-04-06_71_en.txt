â€“ Mr President, again and again, we are shocked by reports of tragedies involving refugees and by the accounts given by the victims of unscrupulous gangs of traffickers.
Many people have nothing left to lose other than their lives, and even those they very often lose as they journey towards the Europe that they regard as a land of milk and honey.
Even if they reach their destination, they are obliged to work endlessly to pay off their debts to the traffickers, under intolerable conditions, and as, among other things, prostitutes.
The only way we will break this vicious circle is by a restrictive common immigration policy.
For that, we do of course still need refugee camps outside Europe, since our own camps in Europe are often full to overflowing, with serious violence breaking out between inmates of different cultures.
For that reason among others, and also in order to rob refugees of the illusion that they can enter the EU illegally, I have voted against this resolution.
