Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make one thing quite clear – my comments should of course not be seen as a rejection of MEPs' rightful privileges.
They exist in all of our states, they have their justification, and it goes without saying that the Council recognises that.
As the Presidency of the Council, we will of course submit the wish expressed here to the Member States, referring to all elements including the statement that has already been cited here several times.
The new Statute will, in any event, enter into force in 2009.
Any decision now taken regarding an Intergovernmental Conference would of course have to be ratified by all the Member States of the European Union according to their constitutional requirements.
It is also barely conceivable, or at least unlikely, that, even if an Intergovernmental Conference were to be convened straight away – which, as I said, I do not currently think is appropriate – and it did adopt a regulation of this kind, it could come into force before the start of the European Parliament's next parliamentary term.
In conclusion, I should like to come to the question raised in the debate regarding the cooperation of the European Parliament with any such Intergovernmental Conference.
In this regard, I would just make it clear that any such involvement and the extent of it would of course have to be laid down in the Council Decision on convening the Intergovernmental Conference in which the modalities for involving other institutions in the conference would have to be set out.
