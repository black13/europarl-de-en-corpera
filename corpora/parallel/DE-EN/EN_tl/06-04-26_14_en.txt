– Mr President, the decision under discussion – about which Mr Wurtz has said everything that needed to be said – was taken because we wanted a debate, but we also, considering among other things Mr Abbas’ forthcoming visit here in Brussels or in Strasbourg, said that it is not proper for us, here today and considering a subject like this, which can potentially have such a great political impact, to come to decisions and put them in the form of a resolution, and that is why we will not be supporting this motion, perfectly plain though it is that the motion is a legitimate one to put to this plenary, which is the highest authority in this House.
On this point I wholeheartedly endorse the line taken by Mr Cohn-Bendit.
I would, though, like to impart to the House something that Mr Cohn-Bendit did not say.
The Conference of Presidents is composed of ordinary Members – that is true, and Mr Cohn-Bendit is one of them – and the same Mr Cohn-Bendit, in the Conference of Presidents, welcomes the support of other group chairmen whenever they endorse his schemes – even when they are things that would not be likely to get a majority if voted on in this plenary.
