– Mr President, it is a fact that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is in the comfortable position of having two chairpersons, one of them being Mrs Frassoni, and the other Mr Cohn-Bendit.
I am always glad to see them, although I regret that I never see them together.
As Mr Wurtz and Mr Schulz have said, we agreed that there is a need for a bit of goodwill in this House, that we would debate this issue, but – things being as they are – would not draft a resolution, and that was what everyone agreed to.
This House is of course entitled to take the final decision – that goes without saying – but the decision taken in this instance by the Conference of Presidents – whose members are mere mortals, and so not everything we do is right – was a right and proper one, and I would appreciate it if the House were to act in accordance with it.
