– Mr President, well may we complain about this time.
Almost 100 million people are currently watching live – not here, but inside in front of the television where the rest of the world is – watching Barcelona against Milan; the score is 0:0, by the way.
And here?
I can see three girls here and 11 boys – and one of them was specifically asked to stay.
One wonders what is political about this debate: this is a matter of substance.
This is about – if we take it seriously, which we are not doing to judge by the yawns of the Commission – the discharge, about billions of euros.
We all know, though – if we really look closely – that nobody here can in good conscience, if he has a conscience at all, agree to the discharge.
We are all well aware of the 'you scratch my back, and I will scratch yours' attitude.
We know that we have allowed this Europe, this Union, to be steamrollered by a Mafia-like system where everybody, quite logically, does just what everybody else is doing.
What, then, is so terrible about the city of Strasbourg?
They are just doing exactly what many of the Members of this Parliament have done too: they are cashing in a bit.
What is happening here is dangerous, very dangerous.
Sixty-one years after the end of the war, we are drifting towards the end of democracy and prosperity for large sections of the population in Europe, because we just let things slide, because the Anti-Fraud Commissioner Mr Kallas cannot implement the European transparency initiative about which he has been speaking because his hands are always tied, precisely because there is no more leadership in politics.
Tomorrow, please listen to the conscience that you at least used to have when you entered politics, and reject all the so-called discharge reports.
We need to make a new start – it is the only thing that can help Europe in this situation!
