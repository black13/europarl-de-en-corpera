– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘think global, act local’, as the saying goes, and we have learned that the Internet, eBay, payment by Visa card and DHL make it possible to do business with the whole world.
Access to these platforms is nowadays open to anyone with an interest in using them, and so it is a very good thing that we should give some thought to how people can get into the business world, and what support can be given to them.
It is in the initial stages that risks are particularly large, and if the state is to have, through taxes, a share in a firm’s profits later on, then it can also take a share of the risks involved in starting out.
Yet more important, though, is what happens to a business when the older generation hands it on to the younger.
It is at times like these that businesses are particularly vulnerable, when what is needed is not taxation, but rather real support and help of the kind that enables the young entrepreneur to be innovative and to modernise and renew the business.
It is for that reason that it is vital that the infrastructure, training and development of skills should, in future, be brought together in clusters, thus enabling the interested parties to be successful, and, at year-end, in the black.
