– Mr President, Commissioner, once again we face the dilemma – which we have brought upon ourselves – of whether or not we might have to change a scheduled accession date without offending the country – or countries – concerned.
Giving more time to the reform processes that have already begun would, however, be as much in the interests of the EU as of the candidates.
Past experience has taught us that welcoming, out of political – or what are claimed to be political – considerations, a country into a club for which it may well not yet be ready can have devastating consequences.
It is always the public who have to pay the price when the political nomenklatura want to press on towards something for which the time is not yet ripe, and this is something that we have to bear in mind when considering the possibility of enlarging the EU to include Romania and Bulgaria, even though they do, of course, belong to the family of European peoples and must become Member States.
Not only is it questionable whether the Romanian and Bulgarian economies can currently take the strain of accession to the EU, but it is also nothing like clear how the funding required for the first three years – which can potentially run up to EUR 24 billion – is to be arranged.
It is possible that we will be left with no other option but to delay this enlargement by a year, or in any case by a certain period of time.
Any other course of action could well send the wrong message to other candidates for accession and would, in the final analysis, be detrimental to the people of Romania and Bulgaria.
