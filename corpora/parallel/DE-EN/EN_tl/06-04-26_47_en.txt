– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that we in this House may well soon be able to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union, for that would mean that that reunification of the European continent – for which we have all been working for many years – would have been successfully accomplished.
I would be even more glad, though, if it were even now clear that all conditions for their accession had been fulfilled and hence that conditions were ideal for these two countries to become Member States of the European Union.
I can, then, do no other than urge Commissioner Rehn to do, as regards the report, what the Commission is required to do in its role as guardian of the treaties, in which capacity it has to ensure that all those things that are agreed are actually done, and to consider whether the period left, which now runs until the end of the year, is sufficient to get those things done that have not yet been.
That is the Commission’s task, and, having performed it, the accession treaty requires that it draw the necessary conclusions.
In the last few days, I myself have had the opportunity to travel with a delegation to Romania, and I would like to say that what we were able to see and experience both in Bucharest and in other parts of the country was very impressive.
I can do no other than urge all those in positions of political power – not only in Romania, but also in Bulgaria, where recent days have shown that there is some catching up to do where reform is concerned – to maintain their zeal for reform and not, once 16 May dawns, to fold their arms and say that everything has been sorted out.
This is something we have to do together, and we will not be able to unless the process is continued with determination.
Let me conclude by saying one thing, namely that the reason why these reforms have to be carried out in Bulgaria and Romania is not in order that these countries might pass muster in the eyes of Commissioner Rehn or of the European Union; on the contrary, they are necessary in order that their peoples may live in countries in which they may be certain of the law’s protection, with their interests served by stable and democratic institutions.
If that is understood, then we will be on the right track.
