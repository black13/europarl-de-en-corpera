– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the most difficult situations in which we have ever found ourselves, for what is being done here is wrong.
It is unthinkable that taxpayers’ money should be handed straight over to an authority, a sort of government, that does not renounce violence and is opposed to another state’s right to exist being recognised.
It is for that reason that it is unthinkable that they should be given the money, although we do know, on the other hand, that there are others who will stand in our stead and gain influence, and that is not a particularly good outcome.
The only way of getting policy right in this area is to welcome the suspension of payments to the authority, while at the same time finding ways in which we may help the population directly, but this aid must have a high degree of visibility, so that the people on the ground see us as supporters of social and humanitarian processes, and so that it dawns on the population that opting for peace is worth it, for it is peace that most Palestinians – like most Israelis – want.
They have had enough of violence and want to live together peaceably in two viable states, whose continued existence in the region is guaranteed.
It is with this in mind that we must continue to explore the ways in which another legitimate authority in the Palestinian sphere, namely President Abbas, can be helpful and what room for manoeuvre he possesses, for he – in exactly the same way as the Palestinian parliament – was directly elected by the people and possesses a democratic legitimacy of his own.
He has renounced violence; he has recognised the State of Israel’s right to exist, and the Commission must consider in what ways this might be given shape in terms of actions and support.
These two possibilities are alternatives to paying the money to the Hamas-run Palestinian Authority, which has responded to the suicide bombing by making appalling statements, while the Israeli Prime Minister Mr Olmert has been measured in his words.
I hope that the process may be set in motion by the continued use of well-judged language on our side too, and also wish to thank the presidency for its evident efforts at guiding the process down this path.
