– Mr President, there is, of course, in our interconnected world, no alternative to the acquisition of new knowledge or to the mastering of more than one language.
It is of course inconceivable that English should ever be banished from the world of business and science, but German, being the first or second language of some 125 million people, is one of the most important languages in the world, and with 90 million people having it as their mother tongue, it is also the most widely spoken language in the European Union, in contrast, for example, to French, which is now spoken by only 23% of Europeans, and of those, only 11% have it as their mother tongue.
There is, then, no doubt about multilingualism being an overarching objective, but there has recently been a perceptible, increasing, and unacceptable tendency towards the imposition of a single language, and this I believe needs to be resisted.
The fact is that there is no democratic basis whatever for the favoured position accorded to English and French within the EU, and, particularly given the greater importance of German as a consequence of the enlargement, it is not acceptable that the EU should disregard long-standing agreements and more or less ignore German as a working language.
It is an unfortunate fact that this House is as yet the only institution that not only reaches its decision in full public view but also makes them accessible to the public in their own national languages.
Of the official working languages – English, French and German – it is always the last of these that draws the short straw.
The Commission will, however, give way to the pressure exerted by the German and now have the progress report on the accession countries translated, so perhaps this gives rise to the hope that more use will be made of German under the Finnish Presidency.
