– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to Rule 168(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have heard that three of our groups are having problems with this draft resolution, with the consequent risk of there being, on this important matter, which is of course to some degree connected with the debate and with the Members’ Statute, no majority – or at any rate, not a large one – whereas a large one is what we want.
I therefore move that this proposal be sent back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
If that cannot be done or if we cannot agree to it, I move that, as an alternative, the vote be deferred to the next plenary part-session.
The first option, then, is to send it back, with, if that does not happen, the next plenary sitting as an alternative.
