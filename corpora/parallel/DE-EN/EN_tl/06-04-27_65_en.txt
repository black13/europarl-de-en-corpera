. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that what we actually wanted to do today was to give discharge to the European Parliament and the administrative authorities, but, over the last two days, we have been presented with new events and new facts, which we have not been able to examine while producing this report.
They have to do with the leasing of two buildings in Strasbourg.
It took us several meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control to examine the situation and work out a solution, but, since we, despite careful reading of the Rules of Procedure, have failed to find the most suitable legal basis for this, and bearing in mind the requirement that we comply with the Financial Regulation, I propose that we, pursuant to Annex V, Article 5(1)(a), vote against the discharge, which does not mean that we will not be giving it.
We will, though, be gaining automatically six months of time in which to review the additional facts that have come to light and thereby establish a proper procedure for resolving all those questions that demand answers.
I therefore also ask you to vote ‘no’ in the first round of voting, so that all the questions that have been raised can be answered in a proper manner.
