. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report was debated very late at night yesterday, and so there were few Members present.
I would like to take this opportunity to briefly revisit one of the amendments.
The report was the subject of a great deal of interest in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where some 150 amendments were tabled to it, most of which could be dealt with by the drafting of compromise amendments.
One of the objects of the debate in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee was to decide whether we should recommend to the Commission that the weaknesses that have been discovered in the existing directive should be dealt with by individual legislative measures and by action on the part of the industry, acting on its own initiative, or whether we should propose to the Commission the drafting of a whole new directive.
By going for the first option, we decided against having a completely new directive.
Even though we reached our decision with only one vote against it, and therefore, in principle, unanimously, along comes the Socialist Group in the European Parliament with its Amendment 6, the intention of which is to again put a question mark against it, and, since Amendment 6, in principle, turns the report’s reasoning on its head, I ask the House to throw that amendment out.
