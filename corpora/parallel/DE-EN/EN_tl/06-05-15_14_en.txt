â€“ Mr President, questions of immunity ought to be dealt with either by the immunity committee or by the whole House.
I would like to ask, again, that immunity matters no longer be brought before the Committee of Presidents, since I do not see that as a place in which I am in a position to rule on them.
I said nothing more than that, nor did I wish to do so.
I will, in any case, as the Chairman of a group, no longer take part in such debates in the Conference of Presidents.
