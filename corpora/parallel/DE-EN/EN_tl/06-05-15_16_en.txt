– Mr President, while I cannot at the moment name the rule, I refer to what you have just said about the Council.
I would like to say in this plenary what I said in the Conference of Presidents about the Council’s announcement of its inability to be present.
I do not regard a statement of that sort on the part of the Council as one that this House should accept.
As I understand it, the Austrian Government is composed of 16 members and has 16 secretaries of state, which adds up to 32 people who ought to be in a position to represent the Council, even after seven in the evening.
I think it is quite improper that a Council Presidency should declare itself unable to be present here after 7 p.m with no better reason than that Parliament's calendar has changed.
I would like to know just what would happen in a national parliament if an executive were to tell it that it was knocking off for the evening at seven.
That is not acceptable, and you should tell the Council so.
