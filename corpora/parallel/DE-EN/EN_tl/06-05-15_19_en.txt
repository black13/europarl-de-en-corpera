– Mr President, being an Austrian myself, I would like to make a suggestion of a pragmatic nature.
This is obviously about the Council wanting, come what may, to catch the eight o’clock flight back to Austria.
Perhaps, Mr President, you would inform the Council that there is also a train that runs between Strasbourg and Vienna, which makes it no problem at all to actively participate in the sitting here and be in good time for the Parliament in Vienna the following morning.
All that needs to be done is to fly a bit less and perhaps do without a few luxuries.
