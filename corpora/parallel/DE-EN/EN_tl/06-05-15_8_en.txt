– Mr President, my group, on the basis of Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, wishes to move that the Speroni report – which has to do with the lifting of the immunity of Mr Pflüger, a member of our group – should not be discussed, but should instead be sent back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I see this as being the appropriate decision to take, since the fact that the decision as to whether or not to lift immunity was taken by a mere eight members of the Committee on Legal Affairs shows us in a poor light, and that is something we should avoid.
Any one of us could end up having our immunity suspended, but it is intolerable that less than a third of the Members who actually work in the relevant committee should actually be present to vote on it, and so I ask that we should send the report back to the Committee rather than having a vote on it.
