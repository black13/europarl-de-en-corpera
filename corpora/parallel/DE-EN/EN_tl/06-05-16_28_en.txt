– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the agenda for the citizens of Europe is a well-intentioned initiative, but, in the final analysis, a missed opportunity and hence a disappointment too.
It is a missed opportunity because you give the impression that the whole programme could be realised by the existing Treaty of Nice and that the constitutional treaty could be put on the back burner.
That, at any rate, is the impression that Mr Barroso has given in his speeches and statements, and that is what the people of Europe have come to believe.
The new ‘plan D’ ought to do both.
You ought to be setting out the great challenges and suggesting ways of resolving them, while also telling people what works with the present Treaty and what would work better with the new one.
This is what you are failing to communicate; instead, you are hiding behind the governments and letting us here in this Parliament do most of the work, and that is not enough.
All your posturing about the completion of the internal market will not help to defuse the prejudice against the new treaty, which is prompting people to spread rumours about this being a superstate, a neoliberal concept, about the unbridled centralisation and militarisation of the EU, and this ‘plan D’ is doing nothing to lay these prejudices to rest.
When the day of truth comes – which it will – we will have to get the treaty accepted in the remaining Member States, and all I can say to you is that many small projects for Europe are no substitute for the great European project that is the Constitution.
I hope you will succeed in combining the two; only then will you have done your job.
