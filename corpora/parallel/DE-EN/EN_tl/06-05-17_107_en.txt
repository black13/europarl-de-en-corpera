Although this compromise, like every other of its kind, has its weak points, it is nevertheless a step forward and one worth supporting.
Accession negotiations, new initiatives in research, and so on, demand more in the way of resources, and Europe would be sending the wrong message to the new Member States and to those with legitimate expectations of solidarity between Europe's regions if the countries had not agreed to this compromise.
It needs to be acknowledged, though, that negotiations of this kind need to be more open and more transparent.
It is not acceptable that certain countries should demand solidarity in one area – agriculture, perhaps – while denying it to others in other areas, such as the structural funds, for example.
It is in everyone’s interest that a Europe characterised by such ‘egoisms’ should steadily be done away with.
