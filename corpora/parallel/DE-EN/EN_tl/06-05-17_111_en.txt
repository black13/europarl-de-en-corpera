My group has the following reasons for rejecting Mr Böge’s report.
Since it rightly states that Parliament is disappointed in the existing financial framework, it is incomprehensible that this so-called compromise should meet with approval.
Even though the concluding negotiations produced improvements in quality, the underlying problem has not gone away.
This paltry budget will do nothing to help the EU achieve its high targets in terms of cohesion and development.
Today has also seen discussion of the report on the budget for 2007, according to the first paragraph of which Parliament ‘expresses concern about the visible discrepancy between the challenges that the European Union faces and the means capable of being made available under the relevant headings of a backward-looking Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 in order for these challenges to be effectively addressed, especially in relation to competitiveness, research and innovation, which the Council and the Commission have categorised as priorities’.
It is to 2007 that the new Financial Perspective will first be applicable.
The adoption of a far too tight framework plan, involving a reduction of 15% in the funds available for the period between 2007 and 2013 over against those originally considered necessary, followed immediately by complaints about the lack of financial resources, does not testify to political farsightedness.
