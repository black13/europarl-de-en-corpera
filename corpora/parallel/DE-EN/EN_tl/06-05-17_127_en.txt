– Mr President, I voted in favour of the Rack report even though I believe that traffic’s considerable impact on human beings and their environment makes it essential that more freight be carried by rail.
This is an area in which there is ever-increasing, and ever-tougher, competition in the private sector, and, although the Austrian railways, among others, were able to increase the amount of freight they carry, it became evident at the same time that margins were becoming tighter.
A study has shown that an increase in the toll levied on HGVs would result in the transfer of scarcely any traffic onto rails, instead doing no more than speeding up the large-scale closure of small haulage firms at the same time as imposing burdens on the economy and businesses.
The only thing that would promote the transfer of goods to rail would, it appeared, be qualitative and structural improvements.
I believe that the only rational approach to resolving this problem would be a radical reshaping of our transport system, which has, to date, favoured transport criss-crossing the EU from one end to the other.
If, though, this crazy approach to transport is to be maintained, then support should from now on go only to what are termed ‘roll-on roll-off’ trains.
