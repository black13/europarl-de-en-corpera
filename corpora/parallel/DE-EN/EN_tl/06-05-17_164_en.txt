– Mr President, the report on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2005 and the EU's human rights policy is one that I welcome, agree with, and endorse, in that it sheds a self-critical light on the EU’s human rights dialogues and gives a balanced evaluation of them.
Despite the progress that has been achieved, through, for example, the initiatives taken by the human rights sub-committee and the appointment of a personal representative for human rights, deficits are still apparent, particularly in the EU’s dialogues on human rights with third countries.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the pre-eminent importance of human rights, which are universal, and it is vital that greater account be taken of them in every area of policy and that they become a permanent component of them.
Among this House’s essential functions are the global prosecution of violations of human rights and the promotion and defence of those rights.
What I would like to see in future would be closer attention given to the human rights situation in the countries that are applying for accession to the EU.
