. – Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur on the Neighbourhood Instrument, Mr Szymański, for having taken on board so many of our committee’s suggestions, which has added value to the Commission proposal.
I can do no other than stress – and in this I am expressing the Employment Committee’s view – how important it is that the social dimension be given greater emphasis in promoting the Neighbourhood Instrument.
It is particularly at the outermost border of the European Union that an enormous economic disparity is to be found, and tensions can be reduced only if the social dimension is given an equal priority as the country draws nearer to the EU.
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate how important is the role played by the social partners in the Neighbourhood Instrument.
If there is to be partnership with these countries, then it is absolutely essential that their role be strengthened and promoted.
This House can count the implementation of educational measures and their social role as accompaniments to the action plans among its successes.
