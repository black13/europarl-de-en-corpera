– Madam President, very interesting though this stability instrument is as an approach, there is a quite fundamental problem with it, for it amounts to something like an attempt to disregard what is stated in the Treaty of Nice – namely, that there is no free-standing military budget – and introduce something of the sort by a circuitous route, and that I do regard as highly problematic.
This draft, however, states quite openly that the intention is that the new financial instruments should play a crucial role in ‘developing the Union as a global player’.
It is fairly plain to see that what it is talking about here is military expenditure.
According to the Treaty of Nice, there can be no freestanding military budget, and we should actually leave it at that.
What is happening instead is a piecemeal approach to exploring alternative means of funding and developing them.
Another problem is the vagueness of this financial instrument, for it is capable of being used to fund not only civilian but also military projects.
I would urge you to be quite open in saying that you want to fund military operations, and be quite open about doing it, for that is something that can be handled politically.
That is why this is so very problematic.
