– Madam President, I am glad that the new pre-accession assistance programmes are to be given an unequivocally political slant, and conclusions have been drawn from our experience with them, so that funds will from now on be spent in a more targeted, efficient and flexible way.
We know that progressive European integration is the driving force behind the processes of change in the countries of the western Balkans, and in Turkey as well.
This House has an interest in being consulted in good time when the framework rules are drawn up, when results are assessed and when conclusions are drawn, and we will consider very seriously the Commission’s undertakings in this regard and also in respect of the Neighbourhood Policy.
If our solidarity is to be taken as read, then we must insist on unambiguous compliance with international law and conventions being expected in the same way.
By so doing, we will not only be reinforcing sound economic development, but also, and in particular, helping to underpin civil society as the seedbed of European integration.
