â€“ Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is in the interests of the European Union to encourage our neighbours, particularly the countries in south-eastern Europe, to adopt our standards.
It will bring stability not only to that region, but also to the European Union as a whole.
The programmes we have had in the past have, for the most part, been implemented extremely effectively: we could list a whole host of examples, particularly with regard to the Balkans.
I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has started, in cooperation with Parliament, to develop new programmes for the period post-2007.
We need to do this, because it is in the interests of both sides.
However, it is also in the interests of Parliament and of everyone to ensure that the funds for these programmes are used optimally.
I can tell you from my own experience that there are too many projects in which there is too much discussion and not enough concrete action and aid.
There are too many projects that run in parallel and overlap with one another, and sometimes our projects compete with those from the USA and other states.
At any rate, there is no coordination.
My request to the Commission therefore comprises three points.
First, we need to draw up a specific overview of the projects in progress, and then keep this overview up to date and ensure that the resources and projects are coordinated.
Secondly, projects should only be approved if they actually provide practical aid ensuring that standards are raised.
Thirdly, the provision of funding must be linked with appropriate success.
I was pleased to hear the Commissioner state that we will undertake an initial review in 2009, which will show where we are making good progress and where we have problems.
In general, it comes down to being able to guarantee that the European Union's money is used optimally in the interests of security and stability in the region as a whole.
