Madam President, I am delighted to have another opportunity to take questions under your presidency, and we will start with the first question from Mr Posselt on the progress made in the accession negotiations with Croatia.
Let me make it clear from the start that, in the accession negotiations with Croatia just as in all other accession negotiations, the principle is that each country is assessed on its own achievements.
In the interests of transparency, this principle must continually be emphasised, and the speed of the negotiations depends solely on the extent to which the candidate country – in this case Croatia – meets the conditions for accession.
It goes without saying in this regard that, as is stated in the relevant decisions, the EU's assimilation capacity must be taken into account.
The Council cannot and should not specify a date for the conclusion of the negotiations, which started on 3 October.
With regard to the next step, the Council launched the accession partnership with Croatia on 20 February; this partnership will set out the priorities that need to be met en route to accession.
The Commission's screening reports on the negotiation chapters 'science and research', 'education and culture', 'public procurement' and 'competition' are now available.
The Council has examined the screening reports on the first two chapters, 'science and research' and 'education and culture', and invited Croatia to set out its negotiation positions.
I am now in possession of these positions, and the Council now needs to draw up a Common Position.
The plan is that the specific negotiations on this chapter will commence on 13 June as part of an accession conference at foreign minister level.
I would reiterate that how fast and how far these negotiations can be taken ultimately depends on the progress made by the candidate countries themselves.
