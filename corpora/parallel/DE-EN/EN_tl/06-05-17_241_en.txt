I would like to ask a question similar to that put by Mr Posselt, who pointed to the potential for a dangerous parallel course with Turkey.
I see a different, more fundamental, problem.
We are currently having major difficulties in arranging the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria in such a way that we can stick to the deadline set, frankly very prematurely, by the Council and still ensure that the candidate countries have in fact achieved what we expect of them.
In the case of Croatia, the situation is slightly different: much has been achieved, much progress made, but it seems to have been put on the shelf.
