I disagree, Mr Rack.
Nothing has been shelved.
We all recognise that Croatia has made considerable progress, and we have rewarded this progress accordingly.
There is absolutely no reason to doubt that the negotiations will progress rapidly, and that the progress achieved will be honoured accordingly.
I also see no connection here with other past or future negotiations.
