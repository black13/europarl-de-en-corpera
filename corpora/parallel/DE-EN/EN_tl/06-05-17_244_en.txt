On this question I must point out that, as you will all be aware, consular matters – of which this is one – are the responsibility of the national authorities.
As far as the Council is aware, negotiations between Portugal and Canada on this matter have reached an advanced stage.
I can therefore only say that the Council does not really have any competence on this issue, and I would add that, at the request of the country concerned, the issue is also not being discussed any further in the Council working group on consular affairs.
