I would point out that this is, and must be, ultimately a question of what the country involved actually wants.
If a Member State of the European Union wants to deal with a national issue nationally and bilaterally, and to discuss it with the third country, then the European Union should not interfere.
Were Portugal to say that it wanted something else, the Council would of course look into it accordingly.
