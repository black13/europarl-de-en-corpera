In general, the EU and the Council are monitoring the human rights situation in Iran very carefully and with growing concern.
At the 60th session of the United Nations General Assembly, it was the European Union that tabled a resolution on human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, thereby publicly expressing to the world its concerns regarding the situation in Iran.
I can assure the honourable Members that the European Union is using all the means at its disposal – publicly and confidentially, in declarations and démarches – to express these concerns regarding abuses of human rights in Iran, and it will continue to do so.
Regarding the case of Masouma Kaabi and her son, it has been reported that they were released on bail a few weeks ago.
The European Union is monitoring the situation and will take every available opportunity to discuss and express these very justifiable worries and concerns.
