Concern for the fates of individuals is, in fact, and quite naturally, particularly close to the hearts of the European Union and the Council.
Particularly in individual cases, it is important to proceed in a way that is efficient and does not have the opposite effect to that intended.
That is difficult.
I myself have worked in this field for long enough to know that it is often difficult to find the right path, and to avoid giving the impression that we are not interested in these cases whilst at the same time not running the risk, by proceeding too officially, of the result being the opposite of what we actually wanted.
You can be assured that the European Union and the Council are working very hard to find the right path in each individual case – and it goes without saying that we care very much about the fates of these people.
However, I must tell you, quite openly and frankly, that the European Union's options are sometimes very limited and that we do not always achieve the level of success we would hope for – and this is, admittedly, sometimes very frustrating.
However, we will not be put off by that, and we will continue down this path.
