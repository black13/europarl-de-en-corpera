In this connection I should like to start by saying, as before, that it is a matter of balance.
Iran is certainly very interested in resuming this human rights dialogue, and of course the Council is also, in principle, interested in holding such a dialogue with Iran, because it offers an opportunity to raise many issues in this connection, including individual cases.
However, we cannot allow the European Union to get involved in a dialogue that will be abused by the other side as, so to speak, an alibi or as a whitewash.
The European Union therefore has a very specific view on the conditions under which this dialogue could take place.
One of the preconditions for the European Union entering such a dialogue is that certain specific concessions must be made in advance.
The European Union's expectations in this regard include, in particular, the release of political prisoners.
As I said, though, we are prepared to enter into dialogue, and if Iran is seriously interested in such a dialogue, the European Union will willingly take part, under the specified conditions.
