I should firstly like to congratulate the Council on its success in having the 2007 internal market for the end user included in the final documents.
It will involve a lot more work now, but I think that it will be of corresponding benefit in terms of the Lisbon Strategy.
My question is: What actually is the situation where the Energy Community is concerned?
May it be extended to further states, and which states are the main candidates?
