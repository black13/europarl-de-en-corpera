Good progress is being made in establishing the Energy Community.
The Treaty has now been signed by four states.
I see no basic reason why, if such a development is helpful, this Treaty might not be extended to other states too.
To my knowledge, there is not, however, at present any definite intention to extend it in this way.
The negotiations with Turkey, which has not signed the agreement, are also being continued with.
As a country of transit and a connecting link, Turkey is, logically enough, of great interest.
I could imagine some future development too entailing an extension to the number of states that are signatories to the Treaty.
