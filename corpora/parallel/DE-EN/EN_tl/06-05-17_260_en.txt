â€“ Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission has produced a fine paper on the security of energy supply in the EU.
We know, however, that powers in this area are very fragmented.
What can the Presidency of the Council do in order to enable Europe to present a united front, particularly to Russia, and what can be done to enable our partner, Russia, to maintain in the field of energy production those standards of sustainability that we have achieved in the Community?
