– As a representative of the Austrian Ministry of Finance, I wholeheartedly agree with you that there are two sides to every budget – an expenditure and a revenue side.
There are two ways of handling budgets.
Our aim is to achieve a balanced budget in all the Member States at least through counterbalancing cyclical trends: by increasing revenue, on the one hand, which – of course – is unpopular with the public and the business community.
On the other hand, we are striving towards more efficient spending – we need to cut back expenditure, but we need to do so efficiently; and, on the revenue side, we need to ensure that governments do in fact receive all the fiscal charges provided for by law instead of introducing new fiscal charges.
This is an important discussion, and I recently travelled to some of the new Member States to discuss issues such as this, for example turnover-tax fraud, which is a major problem throughout Europe and is estimated to cost the economy EUR 70 billion.
The same goes for the fight against customs fraud.
Under Austria’s Council Presidency, we held discussions with tax experts in Vienna in February on ways of bringing turnover-tax fraud under control, such as introducing different tax systems and improving the existing system.
