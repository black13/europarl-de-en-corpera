This issue of course demonstrates that unanimity is a stumbling block not only on taxation in general, but also within taxation issues.
After all, as the President-in-Office has said, there is majority support for this uniform assessment basis, but an open door to agreement is not yet in sight.
My question to the President-in-Office is: to his knowledge of the counter-arguments, how many countries firmly oppose this, and does he envisage any possibility of overcoming the barrier of unanimity?
In addition, should we not abolish unanimity altogether in the case of taxation relevant to the internal market?
