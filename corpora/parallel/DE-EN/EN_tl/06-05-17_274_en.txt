– The problem of unanimity now that there are 25 Member States is particularly acute in matters of taxation.
Member States who have only recently introduced a completely different tax system, for example a flat-tax system – that is, a single rate for company taxation, income tax and such like – have difficulty supporting a uniform assessment basis.
It is natural for these countries to object, as they are currently benefiting from tax competition.
In specific terms, there are four countries that object to introducing it too quickly or to making any changes at all.
In my view, the only remedy is to be found in the form of a constitution, which Europe needs – and the more countries that join the EU, the more imperative this becomes – so that we are able to take majority decisions in this field, too.
As we have also seen in the matter of the reduction in turnover tax, which was very difficult to resolve, unanimity in matters as difficult as taxation causes problems when it comes to taking decisions necessary for the economy and to creating growth and jobs – something that can also be seen in connection with the Lisbon process.
To do so requires a flexible decision-making process and a Council that is capable of action.
