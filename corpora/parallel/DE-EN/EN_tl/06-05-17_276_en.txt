– This relates to the same subject.
The issue of finding a uniform tax base is a matter of tax harmonisation, and the question has also been asked as to what documents there are relating to this.
Unfortunately, there are no data available as yet on the amount that could be saved by this means; that is to say, on the costs that the economy could be spared.
Nevertheless, the Commission recently published the European Tax Survey, which establishes that enterprises doing business across borders, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, incur substantial costs on account of the differing tax systems in the EU, and that this is by no means beneficial to competition.
In this connection, I should like to draw the House’s attention also to the Commission communication entitled ‘Towards an internal market without tax obstacles’, which was addressed to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee and whose most important objective is to relieve the burden on economic activity in the EU.
In addition, at the informal Council held in Vienna on 7 and 8 April, the President of the Commission requested the presentation of detailed calculations with regard to the economic benefits of a consolidated tax base.
In general terms, I should like to point out, however, that the issue of transfer pricing represents an enormous administrative burden for enterprises operating in the internal market, one that would hardly arise at all if a common consolidated tax base were to be implemented.
In the past, the Council has adopted several measures to make it easier to carry out cross-border economic activities in the Community, including the Parent-Subsidiary Directive, the Merger Directive and the Interest and Royalties Directive.
In addition, the Commission has presented the Council with a proposal to amend the Interest and Royalties Directive, which is currently still under discussion in the Council.
