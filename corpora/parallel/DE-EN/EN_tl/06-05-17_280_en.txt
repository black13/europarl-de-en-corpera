. – Harmonisation of company taxation is, on the one hand, a matter of simplifying the system for the business community so that tax bases are not different in every country – with country A having different write-off facilities from country B or country C – but instead the facilities are always the same; as this is a great problem for enterprises.
Companies operating internationally have enumerated the variety of legislation that has to be observed in the motor vehicles sector – car manufacturing – alone, and the extent of the resulting administrative burden.
On the other hand, this harmonisation is about fair, transparent competition.
Transparent competition means that business profit – the base – is taxed according to uniform principles, and competition then arises from different tax rates.
We do not want to eliminate competition.
It should always be carried out within the meaning of the Lisbon process.
The second point is that we are an internal market, and an internal market requires common rules.
