. – I agree with the honourable Member in that ideally, of course, an internal market covering almost the whole of Europe should have tax rules in place; but these also need to be effective, and neighbouring countries and, if possible, countries outside the continent need to apply the same rules, otherwise we hand the EU public the possibility of investing its money abroad, where such rules do not apply.
That is why it was important to overcome any opposition – and I visited some of these countries myself when the agreements were being negotiated.
In any case, Liechtenstein, San Marino and the countries I named earlier have signed this agreement and, in this way, we at least guarantee that these territories follow uniform tax rules.
Naturally, we should like other countries, too, to follow this example.
Switzerland in particular, situated as it is in the middle of Europe, should make efforts to apply the European rules, and should also be bound to them by an agreement.
