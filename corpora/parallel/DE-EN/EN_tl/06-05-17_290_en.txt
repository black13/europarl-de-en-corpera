– It was for this very reason that we made the Lisbon Strategy such a high priority at the last European Council.
This Council discussed growth, as growth is a means of increasing employment and thus reducing unemployment.
Specific objectives were given, including the gradual creation of one million jobs; and achieving these objectives in practice is a very important starting point.
Unemployment is the main problem facing Europe at the moment.
This Council Presidency, in particular, has taken very specific, targeted measures on this.
One factor currently endangering growth is the development of oil prices.
This potential risk must be clearly recognised.
We hope to see stability restored in this regard – particularly in global politics.
Indeed, for the most part, the issue of oil prices at the present time is less a problem of supply and more a psychological phenomenon.
The issue of Iran has already been mentioned.
We must do our utmost to ensure that, on the one hand, we really achieve growth rates – a very tangible presence before us – in international competition with the USA and the Asian economic area, and that, on the other hand, by means of political stability, all the risks that emerge time and again, and naturally have the potential to affect economic growth, play a less prominent role.
If we are to reduce unemployment effectively, however, we need to aim for even better growth rates.
A growth rate of around 3% would reduce unemployment perceptibly.
That is why the growth rate of 2.6 – even if it is a good rate in comparison with previous years – is still too low.
