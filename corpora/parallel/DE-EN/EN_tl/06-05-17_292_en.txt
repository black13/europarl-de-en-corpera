. – I refer once again to my previous answer.
I have named all the countries concerned – Italy’s deficit being a prime example.
It must always be borne in mind in this connection, of course, that these countries – Italy in particular – have had elections this year, which naturally hinders an excessive deficit procedure such as this, because it means that political decisions are postponed for a while.
Italy has given assurances that it will now, with its new Government, take all the measures stipulated by the Council.
I have named all the countries giving cause for concern: Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom and, among the new Member States, Hungary in particular, with its 6% deficit.
Each Council meeting consistently works towards reducing the deficit, and this has borne fruit.
To reiterate, the 2005 financial year saw a general reduction in the deficit compared with the previous year.
