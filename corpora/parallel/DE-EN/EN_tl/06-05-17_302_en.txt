. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports the present Treaty, but we should like to emphasise a number of points that have already been raised, in order to qualify our assent with some reservations.
In our view, all the signatories to the Treaty should actually make an unqualified declaration of belief in European fundamental rights or, in other words, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
We believe that it is absolutely necessary, including to prevent disruption in the energy market towards which we are striving, that the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding – impact in the fields of employment, social standards, working conditions, health and the environment – be given a binding legal basis.
The Commission and the Council need to take very seriously the call for these to be made binding.
In our opinion, it is very important that this Treaty not enable or pursue energy strategies that would have been appropriate 20 years ago at best.
We believe that energy efficiency must be a very important concern in this new Treaty and that the market that we are intending to create should not be geared towards demand alone.
In accordance with the discussion on greater autonomy in Europe’s energy supply, consideration for renewable energy must be central in all regions under this Treaty.
We greatly fear that privatising the sector too quickly and without proper consideration could be harmful.
We have had experience with privatisation of state monopolies that was carried out too quickly, and believe that the Commission must bear in mind that the public interest in privatisation and the strategies to carry this out needs to be taken into account.
