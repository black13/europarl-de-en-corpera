Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my congratulations on this Treaty.
I believe that the EU is developing in the right direction here: in the direction of cooperation, and of approaching the global energy market with our eyes open.
My questions are as follows.
Which countries are continuing negotiations?
What priorities are we setting?
Then there is my chief question: have the effects of the Kyoto Protocol been analysed with respect to these Treaties?
What will be the impact on energy generation?
What mix of energy sources will arise, and what kind of investment behaviour will develop in this field?
After all, I believe that these Treaties present us with an opportunity to sketch out certain structures and thus to realise the Lisbon agenda.
