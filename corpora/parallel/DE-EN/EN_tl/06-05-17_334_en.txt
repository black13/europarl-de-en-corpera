Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Elles for his work.
The Annual Policy Strategy for the 2007 budget will be decisive in shaping the further positive development of Europe.
The support for the two internal policies – the Lisbon objectives and rural policy – seems to me to be particularly worth mentioning in this connection.
In view of demographic developments and globalisation, it makes perfect sense to pay greater attention to our reformed agricultural policy and our rural policy.
In this case, in particular, the Lisbon objectives can and must be used to solve current problems such as unemployment and economic stagnation.
The common agricultural policy, the EU’s only communitarised policy, has been constantly subjected to reform in recent decades compared with other policy fields.
Agricultural policy-makers and farmers have repeatedly proved their willingness to make sacrifices and accept change for the sake of a European community.
Players in European agriculture have demonstrated that they are amenable to reform.
It is now time to honour this.
Sustainable agriculture, our European model, needs planning security, and establishing the budget until 2013 – that is to say, for the next seven years – has given it just that.
It must also be beyond doubt, however, that, as decided in the course of CAP reform, the budgetary resources will apply until 2013 without cutbacks.
We have carried through the reforms, and now we farmers have reached our pain threshold.
This is as far as we will go.
