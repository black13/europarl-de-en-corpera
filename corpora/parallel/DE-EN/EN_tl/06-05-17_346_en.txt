. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am obliged to Mrs Krehl for her constructive cooperation.
It has proved possible to orient the guidelines towards the principle of sustainable development.
I wish to emphasise this point in particular, because the Commission has now moved away from according due importance to this.
Earmarking, which has now been integrated into the general regulation through the back door as a competitor to the guidelines, causes problems in that it destroys the comprehensive approach of the guidelines, which is both horizontal and vertical at the same time.
Separating the Lisbon Strategy from the Gothenburg Strategy means that industrial regions and cities are the winners and rural areas the losers.
I do not want to compete with the previous speaker, Mr Beaupuy, in saying that, as he is talking about the problem regions in the cities, in particular, but this separation calls into question cohesion in many regions – with disastrous consequences.
I shall simply give the example of the country the Commissioner knows best.
Following the earmarking, Riga and the surrounding area will obtain all the money, but the Latvian region fundamentally in need of support is Latgale, the poorest region in the EU at the moment.
This will receive only the remainder of the subsidies, which cannot be right.
In my view, these problems of the Commission’s own making can only be solved retrospectively if, in the operational programmes, the Commission ensures that, in all dimensions and for all areas – both urban and rural – sustainable development receives equal attention in the economic, social and environmental approach, that is to say, in a balanced development approach.
Whilst the Commission’s attention is insufficiently focused on this, there can be no real cohesion in Europe.
