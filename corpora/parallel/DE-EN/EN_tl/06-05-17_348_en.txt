– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by saying a word of thanks to Mrs Krehl for her sound report and excellent cooperation on this issue.
The economic disparities between the regions of the EU will only increase in the coming programming period – particularly as a result of the forthcoming enlargements – with no increase in Structural Fund appropriations – if we did not know that before today, we do now.
In the light of this, it is now necessary to use the scant resources available in an intelligent and efficient manner, always bearing in mind that cohesion policy cannot solve all the structural problems or be a substitute for the efforts of the Member States.
I endorse the critical appraisal of earmarking, for example, which puts us in fetters.
There is a danger that the regions will not have the flexibility they need in developing the programmes to meet their local and regional requirements.
I should like to emphasise the particular consideration for the urban dimension, of which the Commission’s proposal takes insufficient account.
Owing to their economic and social disparities, conurbations are in particular need of increased assistance.
The use of private cofinancing to aid the implementation of all the programmes is very important.
This needs to be emphasised time and again, particularly at a time when public funds are scarce – and this opinion is in fact shared by the majority of all the members of our Committee.
It is essential to promote private cofinancing at project level.
Public-private partnerships are, unfortunately, too little used in connection with the Structural Funds, since they raise a host of legal questions that have to be resolved.
A welcome development is that the negotiations on the Financial Perspective succeeded in largely harmonising the different standards within the framework of cohesion policy for the old and new Member States.
