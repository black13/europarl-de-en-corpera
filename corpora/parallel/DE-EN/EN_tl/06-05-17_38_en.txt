Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday saw us debating the possible ways out of the constitutional and confidence crisis, and the President of the Commission and some in this House thought we should concentrate more on reforming the context rather than the text itself.
We should try to cope with this crisis of confidence through the sort of policies, results and reforms that restore public confidence.
It sometimes happens that the moment of truth arrives earlier than one thought it would.
What we have to deal with today is the context of the European Union’s policies and the options available to it, and what I ask of you is how you propose, by means of this Budget, to meet people’s expectations.
There is something spooky afoot when the President of the Council talks about a fair and balanced budget.
This House hears what the specialist committees have had to say on the subject, about development cooperation being unsatisfactory, about education, youth and research not being up to any kind of standard, about defective communications on our security missions overseas, about the dramatic reversal in rural development.
It is in a state of affairs such as that that you are proposing, in all seriousness, to win back the trust of Europe’s citizens.
There have been negotiations between Europe and 25 states, whose public expenditure share of GDP ranges between 45% and 50%, and which, in return for handing over between 30% and 40% of their functions to Europe, give it 1% of their money.
That is a recipe for disappointed public expectations; the worsening of the crisis is built in.
You cannot leave the text and the context unchanged.
