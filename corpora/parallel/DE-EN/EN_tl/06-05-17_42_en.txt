– Mr President, Mr Grasser, there can be no meaningful financial agreements without transparency, and it is for that reason that I would like to read this out to you: ‘We must listen when some of our citizens bemoan the misuse of EU funding or the squandering of resources within some programmes.
There are cures for these ills in the form of independent scrutiny.
We must listen when some people call for greater transparency in European decision-making, for example the publishing of funding awards, so that people know who has actually benefited.
Why not?
It is only right that such information should be published.
This is European taxpayers’ money that we are talking about.’
I am sure that you, Mr Grasser, can agree with that.
That was quoted, in any case, from your Federal Chancellor, the President of your Council, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, who said those words, in this Chamber, on the very spot where you are standing, on 18 January this year.
Now, though, what has become of publications by the Ministry of Finance?
Eleven EU Member States have adopted the practice already; Austria, even under your Presidency of the Council, has not, even though the President of the Council gave a binding undertaking that we would be allowed to know how much money from the EU has gone into the pockets of big farmers and Austrian television journalists, including those around the farmers’ representative in the Austrian People’s Party, Mrs Schierhuber.
So just do it at last; pay no heed to those who whisper lies in your ear, and do not succumb to the deceitful intoxication of power.
Do not believe the editor-in-chief of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation; do not make him out to be more important than he is by appointing him as Secretary-General of its General Board, and make everything public once and for all!
