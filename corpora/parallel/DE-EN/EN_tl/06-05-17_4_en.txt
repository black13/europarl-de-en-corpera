– Mr President, I have been in politics for 32 years and regard the freedom of speech and of the press as democracy’s greatest assets.
For two days now, early every morning – yesterday, it was at 8.15, today it was at 8.30 – I have been being followed and harassed by a team of television journalists, who have been pestering me with improper questions.
I really do feel under threat.
I would also like it to be known that yesterday – as witnesses will confirm – Mr Hans-Peter Martin was behind this team, although he was not there today.
I would ask you, Mr President, to cause appropriate action to be taken, since I find this sort of mobbing intolerable.
