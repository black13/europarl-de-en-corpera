– Mr President, I would like to follow Mr Lamassoure in concentrating on the reform of the financing system.
The one we have at present is unworkable, unfair, lacking in transparency and is no longer sustainable.
One of the things we regard as essential is that this House should be involved in the 2008/2009 reform process.
I am grateful to those who have negotiated on our behalf.
We need a new system, one that the public can understand and that is also fair, an objective system to replace the net payers, net recipients and rebates that we have at present; it will probably be a proportion of a tax levied in all the Member States.
Secondly, there is the period for which the Financial Perspective will apply, which we want to see brought into line with the period for which Parliament is elected; five years, in other words, instead of seven.
There would be a closer connection between policies and the means by which they are funded, and so better democratic control and greater transparency would be possible.
My third point is that I think it is a good thing that we have transitional rules for the advent of the Constitution, which I do of course see as desirable, since it will strengthen Parliament’s prerogatives.
It is good that item 4 makes preparatory arrangements for that event.
I also think it is worth mentioning that financial control of the EU’s external policies has been improved; that is normally a prerogative of the executive, so that parliaments have no part in it, but this budget has enabled us to get a foot in the door, and things that usually escape our grasp – such as the decentralised agencies and the European Schools – are included in this agreement.
Thank you, Mr Böge; thank you, Mr Sousa Pinto.
