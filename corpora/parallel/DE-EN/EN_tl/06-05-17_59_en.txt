– Mr President, I keep on hearing today that we are supposed to be approving a compromise.
The usual practice when a compromise has been reached is to talk about whether the glass is half full or half empty, but that is not the case today, and that is why this so-called compromise will get no support from the Austrian Social Democrats.
As the previous speaker mentioned, we are facing a backward movement in policies at national level.
What was inherently wrong with these negotiations on finances was that six Heads of State or Government had said we could have more Europe, and achieve more European objectives, with less money, but that does not work – it does not work back home, and it does not work in Europe.
All you need to do is flick through the newspapers.
Yesterday morning’s headline in the Austrian was ‘EU fails to meet its own education targets’.
There are six million young people leaving school without qualifications, and, on top of that, the figures for lifelong learning are 42% down on what Parliament proposed.
It is quite clear from this that things are out of joint.
Assuming we get a majority this lunchtime, we will be assuming joint responsibility for a budget on which we have not made our mark.
Much as I respect our negotiators – who are outstanding and I really do want to congratulate them – the difference that they have managed to make over the last few months amounts, in terms of the total amount of this seven-year budget, to something like 0.2%.
That is what the directly-elected European Parliament has managed to do with a budget like this one.
It is not enough; the glass is not half full – it is empty.
That is why I hope that many Members of this House will refuse to give their endorsement to this Financial Perspective.
