– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would just like to start by saying what a joy it is to see that these negotiations have managed to turn the decision by 25 Heads of State or Government – which was more an expression of the intergovernmental Europe – into a European resolution, and to say how very grateful I am to them for that.
I also believe that it has, slowly and surely, become evident to the Member States that Europe cannot function on the basis of nobody paying in and everyone drawing out, and that, on the contrary, a rational balance must be found between the Member States’ demands for the funding they think Europe should provide, and what they themselves are willing to make available in terms of resources.
Negotiations with this House’s delegation made it quite clear what is at stake here, and what we have achieved together is a great triumph.
That having been said, though, I would like to say in plain terms that the Interinstitutional Agreement that we will – I hope – adopt today, provides us ourselves with an array of possibilities in terms of how we can help to ensure that European taxpayers’ money is handled carefully and properly.
There is just one issue I want to highlight and that is the great European disease of ‘agencyolism’ – the compulsion to keep on creating new agencies.
We have now taken that function out of the Council’s hands; under the Interinstitutional Agreement, Parliament’s consent is always required.
We are now the doctors who can grapple with this sickness within the Council, and we should take the use of these instruments very seriously.
I believe that by doing so, we will add more European value than if we were to leave it in the hands of the Council and its secretive meetings.
