Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Grasser, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are those among us who voted against the December summit decision with greater passion than they are able to summon up today for what has emerged from these tough negotiations.
We would probably have enjoyed greater short-term popularity in the eyes of very many observers if we had said ‘no’.
The lead stories in some of the media on 5 or 6 April would probably have been along the lines of ‘Parliament shows teeth: Council rebuffed’, but would we then really have achieved more in terms of European goals, more for Europe’s people, more for a better Budget, or more for an effective European Union?
Those are the questions that we – every one of us – must ask ourselves today.
If we do not effectively discharge our responsibilities; if the institutions are unwilling to work together; if there is no agreement with Parliament; and if we do not give our assent today, then there will be no security to plan ahead for a period of years, no interinstitutional agreement, no greater scope for manoeuvre for us to use in the annual budget negotiations, no review clause and no improved consultation on the programmes and the monitoring of them.
Every one of us must consider whether there really would, without our consent, be an extra EUR 800 million for education, EUR 400 more for the CIP programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, an extra EUR 100 million for social policy, EUR 300 million more for the cohesion fund, EUR 200 million more for Natura 2000, and so on and so forth.
It is precisely because our agreement has mobilised an additional EUR 7.9 billion that it needs, in the interests of the European Union, to be supported.
