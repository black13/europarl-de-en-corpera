– Mr President, following on from Mrs Schierhuber’s statement, I would like to add that we, here in this European Parliament, are engaged – and rightly too – in enacting laws intended to prevent people from being mobbed and harassed at their places of work.
Since this House is our workplace, we should ensure that its Members are accorded the same protection that we demand for Europe’s workers.
