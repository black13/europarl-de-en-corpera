– Mr President, since my name has been mentioned, I would like, further to Rule 149 (1) of the Rules of Procedure, to simply say that I, too, have been questioned by a television crew, and, before misleading rumours arise, that it is indeed the case that I was using my car early yesterday morning in Kehl, but this is no cause for even more speculation.
Quite apart from that, I do – difficult though you, ladies and gentlemen, may find it to accept – believe in the existence of the fourth power, namely the press, the independence of which we should respect.
Of that I am all in favour.
