– Mr President, that we in Europe must stand together in contending against the adverse consequences of natural disasters is not a matter of doubt, and for that the regions affected rely on the solidarity of neighbouring Member States; European programmes are also needed to help in crisis situations.
The report provides a whole range of examples of how to go about this.
To European aid in a crisis, then, one has to say ‘yes’, but the prevention of disasters is primarily a responsibility for the Member States, and it is a responsibility from which we should not discharge them by passing it on to the European level; the same is true when it comes to organising the response to crisis situations, otherwise known as ‘European civil protection’.
There is no need for new powers in respect of civil protection and disaster prevention; they would result in twin-tracking and wasted money in administrative systems.
That neighbouring states within Europe should help each other when disaster strikes is, then, perfectly obvious; what Europe can do is to help with programmes promoting improved coordination and alleviating material need.
New European powers, though, would do more harm than good, and these reports do not alter the fact that this is still something we need to talk about.
