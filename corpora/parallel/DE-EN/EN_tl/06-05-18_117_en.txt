. – Mr President, in Nepal, a king has managed to destroy not only a new democracy, but also an ancient monarchy with deep roots among the people.
Restoring both on an unequivocally democratic basis will be a very difficult task, and one in which our support will be required, for there is a risk of evil being used to drive out evil and of one dictatorship replacing another.
I would not like to see the democrats who are now at the helm in Nepal suffering the same fate as Kerensky after the first Russian revolution, when, the rule of the tsars having been overthrown, it was replaced shortly afterwards by a totalitarian one-party dictatorship.
It is for that reason that we must give the democratic forces – which are very weak and fragmented – massive support and ensure that this democracy does not soon give way to another dictatorship.
All the Nepalese need to do is to take a look at their neighbours in Tibet to see the damage a one-party dictatorship can do to an ancient Asian culture.
So let the Nepalese democrats be given every possible support in order not to end up being ground up between two millstones.
