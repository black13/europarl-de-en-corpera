. â€“ Mr President, the situation in Sri Lanka is getting worse.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are committing new atrocities, and it is the Sri Lankan Government that decides where.
The general image of the situation presented by some of the media is that it is a war with the heat turned down, and that description I regard as an accurate one.
The question that arises has to do with what role the EU might play in de-escalating this conflict; how might it be possible to prevent it from getting even worse?
It has been proposed that the LTTE be, officially, put on the EU list of terrorist organisations; to do so would be extremely counter-productive, particularly in the present situation, as it has not been possible to hold the negotiations on EU territory and the fact that there is any kind of negotiating process at all is thanks to the Norwegian Government in particular.
That being so, the way the EU should do its bit for de-escalation is to refrain from apportioning blame, something of which the proposed resolution is a lamentably bad example, in that it tends, fairly one-sidedly, to present the LTTE as the guilty party.
The Sri Lankan Government, too, has recently done much to crank up the conflict.
There is a quite different respect in which the EU plays an important part in this, for some of its Member States are continuing to deport people to Sri Lanka, consigning them to a situation of simmering warfare, and these deportations must be brought to an immediate halt.
We must get really actively involved, without attaching blame to one side or the other, and that is a demand I make not only of the Commission, but also of the Council.
