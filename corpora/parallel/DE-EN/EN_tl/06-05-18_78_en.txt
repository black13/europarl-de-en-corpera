. – It is unfortunate that, when it voted today, this House rejected a motion from my Group which condemns the grave human rights abuses in Iraq and recalls ‘that the war in Iraq is illegal and violates both international law and the Charter of the United Nations’.
A majority in this House, voting by roll-call, was also found to reject the demand that the UN should mount an investigation ‘into the human rights violations committed by the international coalition, particularly as regards the use of prohibited weapons such as white phosphorus in the attack on Fallujah and the collective punishments inflicted on the Iraqi population, which are banned by international agreements’.
This vote may be taken as emblematic of the double standards to be found in the human rights report.
Human rights violations in states with which the European Union is on friendly terms are subject to insufficient criticism or to none whatever.
One consequence of this is that no reference is made to the ongoing offences against human rights in Turkey.
Restrictions imposed around the world on the right to refuse to do military service are simply whitewashed away, and, if one were to go by the human rights report, neither NATO nor EU Member States are waging war or participating in warfare at all.
It was heartening, though, to note the adoption of a motion on the Western Sahara in which the Group of the Left denounced ‘the continued violations of the human rights of Saharaui population’ and called for ‘the protection of the Saharaui people’.
