– Mr President, the partnership between the USA and Europe is a difficult but necessary one.
As President Barroso once said, it is necessary when speaking with the USA to be at the same eye level.
Now, it makes little sense to demand of the USA that it should go down on its knees, just so that we can speak at the same eye level.
We have to become stronger, we have to exploit our potential fully – economically, but clearly also in terms of foreign policy.
On foreign policy I would like to mention two areas where I believe there have been a few very positive developments.
The first is the Middle East question regarding financial support.
I know, Commissioner, that you were very active behind the scenes so that we could come to a reasonable and pragmatic solution.
I am very happy that Europe and the USA found a solution here.
The second topic is Iran.
I not only wish you a lot of luck, Mrs Plassnik, I also hope that you can do much work of persuasion here too.
We must remain firm in this matter.
However, the USA has to talk directly with Iran as well, as has just been announced.
Above all, though, there is no place for military adventures.
These are two areas in which I hope that we can speak with the USA as genuinely independent, self-confident partners.
