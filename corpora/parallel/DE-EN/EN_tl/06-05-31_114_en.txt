– Mr President, I am glad indeed that Mrs Plassnik and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner are still here.
Last weekend there were violent excesses against peaceful demonstrators in Moscow.
I think it is most necessary that we as the European Union say that this should not be allowed to happen in a country that currently holds the chair in the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers.
This issue concerns a strong partner of the European Union.
We will be demonstrating on Friday afternoon in Brussels and in many other places in Europe against the violations of human rights committed against peaceful demonstrators.
On the weekend after next in Warsaw, Gay Pride will take place, and I have heard statements from officials in Warsaw that there could be excesses here too and that anyone who participates must be prepared for the possibility of violence.
I will march and fly the flag for the rights – guaranteed by Article 13 – of everyone in the European Union.
I hope that many people will take part and say: there is no place for intolerance in the European Union.
Let us fly the flag!
