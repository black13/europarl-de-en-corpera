- Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, especially on her negotiation skills and on the constructive result that we have today.
This regulation on the security of childrenâ€™s medical products is a great success for patients in Europe.
It is long overdue, and now it is important that it enter into force quickly.
This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this helpful compromise, which makes an agreement with the Council at second reading possible.
We have had lengthy and extensive debates in this House on the renewal of patents for research-conducting producers of medicines, and sometimes there was haggling over each individual month of renewal.
Many colleagues have been quite upset about the possibility of additional profits for the pharmaceutical industry.
This unspeakable debate is now finally over.
This is, after all, about the security of medical products for children, which must be guaranteed.
If the research-conducting producers of medicines require an additional incentive in order to develop their products, then they should get it.
Finally, economic logic requires it too.
If this incentive has the additional effect of strengthening European research and attracting research-conducting pharmaceutical businesses back to Europe, then this is positive.
