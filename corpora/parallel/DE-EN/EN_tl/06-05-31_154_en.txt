.Madam President, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for searching so cooperatively for solutions, especially considering the general need to reduce the size of the budget.
This is an outstanding example of cooperation.
And my particular thanks also go to the Commission, to Commissioner Verheugen, whose work on this programme has proved his dedication to promoting innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises.
The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on which I am to report here for one minute, was adopted on 1 December 2005, before the framework resourcing plan.
It follows that our wishes far outweighed the eventual achievements.
We fell into line; we endorse the motions for less bureaucracy in the programmes, for more sharply focused support and for innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises.
This has been recorded in the Chatzimarkakis report, and these motions will be vigorously supported by my colleagues on the Committee.
