Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always endorsed and promoted the enlargement of the European Union and has always said that this enlargement, including accession to the euro zone, must move forward without further delay.
That has always been our policy, and it still is our policy.
In addition, it has been the policy of the Group of the European People’s Party throughout recent years to fight for a strong euro in line with the Maastricht criteria and accompanied by strict adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact.
For this reason there have been extensive discussions with the Commission in recent years whenever the large countries were involved – France, Italy and Germany.
We will therefore continue this policy in pursuit of a stable euro and so would like to assure the Commission of our unequivocal support for the clear stance it has taken on the question of our future approach to enlargement of the euro zone.
Let me say once again that we are very clearly in favour of new Member States entering the euro zone; this must, however, take place in accordance with particular criteria; we have a certain amount of tradition and rigour to uphold in this respect.
So, once again, our heartfelt thanks to the Commission.
At the same time, however, I would like to encourage the Commission to be more assertive the Member States when it comes to data.
It has the support of Parliament.
I also encourage the Member States to grant the Commission more rights in relation to the verification of data pertaining to potential entry.
I say this because Parliament will ask the Commission whether it can vouch for the data on which it bases its recommendation.
It must therefore be given greater access to information, and this requires the Member States to be more cooperative.
