Mr President, I am speaking in the expectation of being allowed the same length of time as the previous speakers, to whom you were very generous.
What you present us with here is really an extremely sad situation.
Yet again, the report shows that the budget is to be raised by another 4.2% and that another 250 new posts are to be established.
This makes what you are doing here an expression of organised irresponsibility.
It is clear that a group of people have hijacked the European project, and I am, regrettably, convinced that those who acquiesce once again will go down in history as benighted squanderers.
If you took this report, translated it into all the official languages and gave it to the men and women of Europe to read, they would be horrified; they would say, ‘What are you thinking?
We do not have that any more; we cannot afford that any more!
Even half of that would be too much.’
And everybody here knows that, but they do not act accordingly.
It reminds me very much of the late Soviet Union, where every year they would talk about new record harvests and new maximisations and efficiency gains.
What we have here is a disgrace and is unworthy of the European Parliament.
