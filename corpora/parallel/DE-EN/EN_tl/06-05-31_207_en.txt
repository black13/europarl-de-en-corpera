.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks first of all to the rapporteur, Mr Vidal-Quadras, both for the report itself and for our close cooperation.
From this very comprehensive committee report I would like to pick up only a few points of particular importance to my group.
Firstly, the recognition that the prescribed target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 must be amended upwards.
The Commission’s target is based on an oil price of 25-30 dollars per barrel.
I need hardly stress that this assumption is far removed from any current and future reality.
This means that we can expect energy-efficiency measures to be far more cost-effective.
In this context, the report also establishes how cost-efficiency is to be assessed.
Its assessment should take into account such factors as rising energy prices, reduced dependence on energy imports, the protection of the climate and of the environment, the security of energy supplies, innovation and the effects of energy saving in the medium and long term.
Alongside ambitious targets we need ambitious energy-efficiency action plans.
I am referring not only to the Commission’s European action plan but also to national action plans.
We really must make these action plans the heart of a much-needed energy-efficiency offensive, meaning that we need good, intensive PR, practicable and effective proposals and differentiated energy-efficiency scenarios.
