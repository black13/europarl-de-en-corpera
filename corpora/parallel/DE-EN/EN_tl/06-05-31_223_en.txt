Mr President, Commissioner, given the late hour I will make just a few short remarks on the subject.
Banning sex offenders from relevant jobs on a Europe-wide basis in order to prevent them reoffending in child-care or youth work, for example, is undoubtedly important.
To date, however, therapeutic methods have perhaps been geared almost exclusively towards convicted sex offenders, neglecting the possibilities of preventive therapy.
Improvements in police methods of prevention with regard to known sex offenders are surely also needed, as is more restricted recourse to early release from prison.
Police cooperation and the sharing of information in this area also need to be improved, in my opinion, and we might even consider following the American example of making information on these offenders generally accessible.
