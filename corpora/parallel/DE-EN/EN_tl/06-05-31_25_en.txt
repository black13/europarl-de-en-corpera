â€“ Mr President, I am quite delighted that we once again have a statesman who has a vision of Europe, because part of our problem is all this pussy-footing around, this self-doubt, this half-heartedness, this downright fear of taking further steps towards European unity.
If even political leaders are not committed to Europe, people become disorientated and distrustful.
Therefore, Mr Verhofstadt, I should like to welcome you, and to thank you for the vision you presented both in your book and here in Parliament.
You have repeatedly emphasised that the heart of the European idea is political union, not just a huge market.
The European Economic Community was just a detour that we had to take because the Defence Community did not become a reality.
That bears repeating, and the Treaties of Rome were preceded by the Messina Declaration.
I very much welcome the possibility that we might be able to adopt a kind of 'Second Messina Declaration' next spring.
It will not be called that, but the core could be the same: a renewed commitment to the objectives and grand projects of the EU in the coming years and decades.
We also need projects that are attractive to the people.
Once again, we are discussing energy policy.
We know that, in 20 years' time, 70% of our energy will come from imports from unsafe regions.
Why do we not have the courage, as Jeremy Rifkin proposed, to launch a third industrial revolution in Europe with a solar hydrogen economy?
We need it all: coal, oil, gas, that is business as usual, but this new basis for an energy revolution would be something that many people could approve of, and I would advise you to adopt something like this at the summit in June.
