– Mr President, the Chairman of my group, Mr Schulz, said that he would like to see more Heads of Government like Mr Verhofstadt.
I should like to continue with this theme and say that I should like, in particular, to see a Commission President with so much commitment to standing up for Europe’s future.
I shall continue from where the previous speaker left off.
In criticising the defective economic and social policy, he highlighted, among other things, the Lisbon Process and this open method of coordination.
I believe that this method is a particularly good example of the principle of subsidiarity being misunderstood, as the Member States formally insist on their powers in these areas but are, in fact, unaware, or only partially aware, of what these specifically amount to.
The consequence of all this is that the damage is taken to have been caused by the European Union, and the Member States are not seen as being responsible.
We know that our shortcomings in terms of economic and social policy are not, unfortunately, all going to be solved by means of this Constitutional Treaty.
These shortcomings were also the basis of our failure in the Convention, as we achieved almost nothing, or not very much, in this area.
My question is now as follows: what solutions, other than the opportunities in the eurozone that have been pointed out, do you envisage whereby, in spite of holding on to this Constitutional Treaty, we can secure what is contained in the Treaty with a view nonetheless to making further progress in this area?
