– Mr President, I would ask you to give me the floor on the basis of Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, which relates to the examination of respect for fundamental rights.
I should like to request, on behalf of the leaders of the groups Mr Wurtz, Mrs Frassoni, Mr Watson and Mr Poettering, that the agenda of the next session of the Conference of Presidents should include those incidents that, in the past few weeks and months, have particularly worried all of us in the European Union, namely the increase in xenophobic, racist and, in particular, homophobic violence in the European Union or targeted at EU citizens.
We are particularly concerned about the fact that a leading Member of a governing party in one of the EU's larger Member States, the deputy leader of the Catholic League of Polish Families – who is now the deputy leader of the main governing party of Poland – has openly advocated violence against homosexuals who want to exercise their right to demonstrate in Warsaw.
It is unacceptable for leading representatives of the government of a Member State of the EU to behave in that way.
I should like to take advantage of the presence of Prime Minister Verhofstadt, who is one of the most tolerant Heads of Government in the Union, and who consistently defends the citizens' civil rights, to appeal to you as President of the House: let us consider how we in the European Parliament can counter the fact that, every day, the Right in Europe goes one step further to test how far they can go in provoking civil society.
We have had enough – we can no longer accept the provocation, whether it comes from the in Belgium, the in France, the League of Polish Families in Poland or the Nazis in Germany.
Let us discuss how we can signal our opposition to this.
