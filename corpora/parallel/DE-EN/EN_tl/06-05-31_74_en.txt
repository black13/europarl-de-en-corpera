Madam President, we in the Council shall continue, attentively and with a sense of our responsibilities, to pursue and deal with the subject of Guantánamo.
That is because this subject is at the interface of a number of the European Union’s political priorities: on the one hand, the issue of the universal validity of human rights and of international humanitarian law, as well as the fight against the scourge of terrorism on the basis of the principles of the rule of law; on the other hand, however, good transatlantic relations, which are also affected by this subject.
It goes without saying that these relations should be completely open and that controversial subjects should be addressed with certain goals in view.
We shall undoubtedly continue with the policy we have pursued during the Austrian Presidency and also before that.
I mentioned some of the key points in the introduction.
We shall also address these subjects at the forthcoming summit on 22 June.
Finally, I should like again to point out that, in all the investigations concerning suspected illegal flights and secret prisons, we in the Presidency have acted to ensure that cooperation with the investigative bodies has been as extensive as it possibly could be.
We hope that it will be possible to conclude these investigations as soon as possible.
