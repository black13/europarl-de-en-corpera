Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every partnership has its ups and downs, its strengths and weaknesses.
The most important thing is that the basis is sound, and despite all the differences of opinion and all the frustration felt by America’s friends about some of the present administration’s policies, the basis here is sound.
As the President-in-Office of the Council says, economic exchange is strong; people-to-people contacts are working, and politically too, numerous networks of intensive contacts have emerged from different dialogue formats and ad-hoc cooperation.
Yet the mutual cooperation could still be improved: the New Transatlantic Agenda was well-constructed, but it has not become a genuine foundation and must be revitalised.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe therefore supports the proposal put forward by Mr Brok in his report for a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement as well as Mrs Mann’s vision of a transatlantic market.
Of course an agreement will add value only if it is filled with life, which means that the American side, too – especially in Congress – must demonstrate a real commitment to it.
Given the current and long-term challenges that we face, progress here is absolutely necessary.
As great democracies, we cannot afford not to fulfil our joint potential, and that is why a Partnership Agreement could be a step in the right direction, so let us take it!
I would like to add that I am glad that we are having this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.
