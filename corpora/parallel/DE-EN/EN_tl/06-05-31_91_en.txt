– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Deputy President of the Commission, I will concentrate on Mr Brok’s report.
Insofar as the report deals with the International Criminal Court or the question of food safety, we hope for clear speaking.
I believe that it is important to ensure that the European position is taken into account in an appropriate way.
In the context of the Transatlantic Partnership, which should enter into force in 2007, it is however an important fact that the present American administration has become a sort of lame duck, and so it is open to question whether it makes sense to conclude this sort of agreement with it.
Finally I would like to discuss a point in connection with environmental policy, to which my group attaches particular importance.
I would like to heartily recommend to all Members the new documentary by Al Gore; his film draws the attention of our American friends to the very, very important problem of global warming, which concerns us all and which should feature more prominently in the report, and I would like to quote Al Gore’s statement that:
‘I even believe that there is a chance that within the next two years even Bush and Cheney will be forced to change their position on this crisis.’
