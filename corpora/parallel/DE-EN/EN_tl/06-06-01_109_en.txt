– Mr President, if I understand the rapporteur rightly, he would like us, by reason of the unsatisfactory state of our proceedings, for which we all share responsibility, to adjourn the vote to the next part-session and call it a day for now.
The result of the whole thing – not just the final vote, but also the vote on the individual motions – means that this can be described as a procedural mistake.
It is the rule that those things that are subject to codecision should be dealt with at the beginning of a vote.
We have not observed our own rule, and that has been shown to be a mistake.
