New partnership?
The EU is promising the USA rearmament and close military cooperation.
By a large majority, the European Parliament has today voted for a new trans-Atlantic partnership, at the same time expressing its particular support for close military cooperation between the EU and the USA, but there has been no real criticism of the ongoing occupation of Iraq or of the escalating war in Afghanistan.
The CIA’s torture flights and the use of American military bases in Europe for the wars in the Middle East are not to be allowed to interfere with the new partnership, nor is the fact that American nuclear weapons continue to be stationed in EU Member States to be a topic for discussion at the forthcoming EU/USA summit in Vienna.
The affirmation of Europeans and Americans as brothers in arms culminates in the undertaking that ‘Europe’s military capabilities are to be increased’ ‘with a view to establishing better partnership relations between the European Union and the United States in political and military terms’.
This undertaking is an unambiguous commitment to continuing, in future, to wage war side by side with the USA, and to ongoing support for those wars that are already being fought.
Nevertheless, the real aim of those responsible for EU military policy is to be able, quite independently of NATO and without help from the USA, to conduct military interventions anywhere in the world – as is now happening in Congo.
The concept of a civilian Europe is one that the Members of this House abandoned long ago.
