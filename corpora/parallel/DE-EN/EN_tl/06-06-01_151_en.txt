â€“ Mr President, the single European currency may well be helpful as a means of fostering a common European identity, and so one ought, no doubt, to welcome the admission of the Republic of Slovenia to the euro zone.
Under no circumstances, though, must the euro be used to play politics with historical emblems.
For example, when Slovenia insists that its euro coins should bear such Austrian symbols as the coronation stone of the Princes of Carinthia, then that amounts to a provocation capable of being interpreted as a claim on historic territory by Laibach, otherwise known as Ljubljana.
As there have already been problems with Turkish coins, I believe that we should, where the design of euro coins is concerned, be more rigorous in imposing our own conditions.
It is for this reason that I have voted against the Langen report.
