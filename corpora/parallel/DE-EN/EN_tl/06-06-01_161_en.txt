I abstained from voting on the grounds that I believe that the same criteria must apply to all EU Member States and that the enlargement of the euro zone must not involve more stringent criteria being applied to new ones.
My abstaining from voting alters nothing, however, as regards my fundamental criticisms of the Stability Pact, which is an instrument completely unsuited to the task of resolving the EU’s economic and social problems and benefits nobody except big business and the property owning classes.
There is no need for a pact that one-sidedly favours price stability, but there is a need for a social and employment pact that meets the population’s needs.
Joining the euro zone under present conditions will do the people in the new Member States no good at all, any more than it benefited the old ones; on the contrary, they will be damaged by it.
