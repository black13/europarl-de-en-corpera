The militarisation of the EU is being driven forward under cover of the deployment of women in armed conflicts.
The core elements of Mrs De Keyser’s report, which really do have to do with women in armed conflicts, are generally good in themselves, but the rapporteur has proved unable to draw a line between the actual subject of the report and general positions on the EU’s military policy.
There are no fewer than seven positive references to the current ESDP, which devalue the report and make it impossible for me to vote in favour of it.
At one point, the report goes so far as to encourage the EU to ‘give greater attention to the presence, preparation, training and equipment of police forces forming part of its military missions, since police units constitute the most important means whereby the security of the civilian population, particularly women and children, may be guaranteed.’
Precisely what the ideology of what is alleged to be ‘humanitarian intervention’ is doing in this report remains a secret known only to the grand coalition in the European Parliament that advocates, with neither ifs nor buts, the militarisation of the EU.
The intention is that the deployment of women in armed conflicts should be used as a pretext for manufacturing consent to the militarisation of the EU, and it is for that reason that I voted NO to the De Keyser report.
Constantly spending more and more money on armaments research and arming the EU to the teeth in order to be capable of waging war is the wrong approach.
All attempts at using allegedly humanitarian motivations to legitimise the militarisation of the EU must be rejected.
