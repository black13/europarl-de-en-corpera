Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you – and Mrs Niebler in particular – most warmly for this debate, and also say how appreciative I am of the participation in it of so many men, that is to say, of your House’s male Members.
The debate has highlighted the fact that there is still, in practice, much to be done as we progress towards full equality; this is where there is work for all of us to do, and to do together, for equality of opportunity for women and men is not merely an important fundamental right, but it also makes our businesses and our economy more competitive.
Today’s society is dependent on the talents of all workers and must therefore seek to integrate women more into the labour market and keep them there in the long term.
In this – as everyone here has pointed out – compatibility between work and family life is of enormous importance and is much to be valued.
We must, however – particularly when considering society as a whole, and the changes in its population most of all – bear in mind the fact that we, as a society, are getting older, and must, in future, try not only to produce more children, but also, and at the same time, to enable people to combine working life and a family.
That is why I believe that this recast directive is a vitally important step, in that it simplifies and modernises a substantial amount of existing law on the equal treatment of women and men.
With it, we really are making it possible for the public to have better – and, it is to be hoped, easier – access to an important area of the law.
