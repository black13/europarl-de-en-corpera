. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse this report.
The situation of Europe’s Roma population is not a good one.
Roma women are disadvantaged at every level.
There is a vicious circle in operation here, and too little is being done by those who make and implement policy to break it.
It is often the case that girls are pressured by their parents into leaving school in order to help keep house and look after their siblings, resulting in a lack of education, poor working conditions – that is, if they actually manage to get onto the labour market at all – and low pay.
Their living conditions and family circumstances are often wretched, and the health care available to them insufficient.
To that one must add the intolerable and inhumane crime of women being forced, without their knowledge, into being sterilised, something that formed part of a birth control programme in Eastern Europe in Communist times, and what is particularly outrageous is that this sort of thing was still going on in recent years.
We must do our utmost to make at least some restitution by getting these damaged women every kind of psychological and material aid.
We must, as a matter of urgency, see to it that targeted education and information makes it impossible for such inhumane things to happen in Europe again.
We voted last year that the pig farm on the land once occupied by the Roma concentration camp at Lety in the Czech Republic should be removed, and it is regrettable that this has not yet been done.
