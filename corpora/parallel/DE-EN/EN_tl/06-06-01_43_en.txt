. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs De Keyser for her report, which contains much that is important and that I can unreservedly endorse, particularly the demands she makes in the field of reproductive health.
If United Nations Resolution 1325 were to be consistently implemented, it would amount to a gigantic step forward in terms of women’s participation at every level of the institutions engaged in preventing, overcoming and resolving conflicts, yet it is a disgrace that there is still, apparently, a need for quotas in order to guarantee six and a half billion people around the world equal rights.
Women suicide bombers are a relatively new phenomenon and one that calls for expert analysis and special aid programmes.
The religious context must not be allowed to conceal the fact that religion is here being perverted for political ends.
I do not believe that a more substantial military presence – not even one consisting of women soldiers and police officers – would make for greater security.
Speaking as draftsman of the Committee on Development’s opinion, I have to say that I, instead, see the best possibility of long-term stability and security being established through reinforcement of the civil society actors.
It is absolutely vital that political dialogue should take precedence; in time of conflict, women must be offered more protection and better access to food and health care, and security in refugee camps also plays a major part in this, for the conditions in the regions of under-developed countries hit by conflict are catastrophic.
More soldiers – and I want to emphasise again that whether they are male or female, hostile or members of the so-called peacekeeping forces, is irrelevant – do nothing to bring more security; on the contrary, they make it more likely that women will become the victims of sexual violence.
