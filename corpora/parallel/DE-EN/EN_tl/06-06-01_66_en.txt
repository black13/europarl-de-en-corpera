– Mr President, I have a request to make of you.
Item 9 is meant to be the vote on the Hughes report.
Mr Hughes is on his way back here from Luxembourg, where he has been performing his duties, and I would like to put to you the request – which the Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs endorses – that we might take this vote at the end of voting time today.
