. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, SMEs in developing countries are generally micro-businesses, and one of the problems they have to face is that many of them work on an informal basis, that is to say, in the black economy.
That is why it is important that there should be legal recognition for the property of these entrepreneurs, not least – and this is no empty phrase – for that belonging to those of them who are women.
Land registry entries and legal property rights are the key to the success of SMEs in the developing countries as much as they are anywhere else.
I wish to thank all those who worked on this report, which has been adopted unanimously by the Committee on Development, and ask the House to give it the greatest possible support.
