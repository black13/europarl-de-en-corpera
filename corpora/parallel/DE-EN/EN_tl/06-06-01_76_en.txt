– Mr President, I wish to endorse this motion.
Much as I agree with this resolution’s conclusion that what we are dealing with here is a violation of the rule of law and that this facility must be closed, there are a number of areas in which the arguments and justifications are no longer up to date.
I believe that, if we want to maximise our influence on the way this matter is resolved, we do need to be up to date and rally as broad as possible a majority in this House before the summit, in order to be able to bring the necessary influence to bear on it, and so I would ask the House to give Mr Coveney’s proposal its backing.
