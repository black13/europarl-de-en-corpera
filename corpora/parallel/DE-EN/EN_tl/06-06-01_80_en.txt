. – Mr President, I have a suggestion to put to the House and to the Member who put that motion to it.
I could well, as rapporteur, recommend a ‘yes’ vote if they were agreeable to the motion comprising only those words up to and including ‘Convention’ and that the last sentence would be dropped.
If that is your message, Mr Brie, then I could recommend a ‘yes’.
Mr Brie says ‘yes’, so I will indeed recommend that we vote on the words up to and including ‘Convention’; the second part can therefore be regarded as withdrawn, and so we can all vote ‘yes’ to that.
