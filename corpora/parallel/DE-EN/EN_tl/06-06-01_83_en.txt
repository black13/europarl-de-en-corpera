. â€“ Mr President, at this point, the voting order suggests that we should vote on Amendment 18 first and then on paragraph 7, and do it in four parts.
What we need to do here is, first to vote on Amendment 18, which is compatible with the proposal for split votes, while keeping things in the right order.
I would, however, propose that we ignore the vote on Part 1, which is identical with 2, 3 and 4, apart from the difference that split votes have been proposed for 2, 3 and 4 and that Part 1 proposes that 2, 3 and 4 be voted on together.
I would also make so bold as to add something.
The proposal for a split vote on Parts 2, 3 and 4 refers only to the amendments to the English version and not to the versions in other languages.
I hope that makes sense.
