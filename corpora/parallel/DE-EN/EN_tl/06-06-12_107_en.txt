Mr President, I should like to associate myself with the numerous congratulations offered to the rapporteur for her good work.
With this report and the unanimous backing it has received from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have a good basis for drawing the fangs from the common position.
Our vote tomorrow must send a clear signal on health and the environment, while our amendments, which are very likely to be adopted tomorrow, strengthen Article 6, thereby making it a clear sign of intent to protect the environment more effectively.
May I also stress that it is essential to avoid any exceptions.
The common position provides for an exception for pollutants from diffuse sources.
It is important that the amendment relating to this provision should be adopted.
Such an exception would complicate the monitoring of diffuse sources and lead to legal uncertainty.
One of the keys to the protection of our groundwater is a set of uniform European standards for the main pollutants.
Only with such standards can distortions of competition and environmental dumping be prevented.
The ceiling for nitrates should be set at 50 milligrams, and there must be no exceptions for agricultural activity, which is primarily responsible for the pollution of groundwater in many parts of Europe.
I therefore wholeheartedly support the amendments formulated to this effect.
