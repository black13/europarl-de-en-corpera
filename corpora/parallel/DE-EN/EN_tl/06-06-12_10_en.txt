â€“ Mr President, I am very surprised at the accusation that Mr Brok has laid at our door.
We cannot just renounce a right that we have earned through struggle.
We absolutely have to make a statement.
I am very surprised at this change.
Of course I must take note of it, becoming cleverer is also a good democratic right.
However, we stand by our opinion that there should be a resolution.
As for the result of the vote, we shall have to see.
In any case, we believe that it certainly does make sense to state our opinion before a session of the Council, our opinion being that we are endeavouring to do everything we can to ensure that accession takes place on 1 January 2007.
