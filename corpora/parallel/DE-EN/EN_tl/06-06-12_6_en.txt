â€“ Mr President, I would just like to ask whether I have understood this correctly: are we talking here about an extraordinary plenary session?
That is just utter nonsense.
A long time ago, we introduced the practice of having a Conference of Presidents that was open to Members.
Surely that is what is required.
Is that so or is it not?
Anything else would be nonsensical.
We do not need a plenary session.
