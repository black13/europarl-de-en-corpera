I would have liked the reference to the Nitrate Directive to have remained in the Groundwater Directive.
This reference was extremely important for the agricultural sector, and its deletion by the majority of Parliament will lead to unnecessarily high costs for agriculture and to legal uncertainty, because the two directives now trigger separate measures independently of each other in the case of serious effects caused by nitrates.
