We still take it for granted that drinking water, as the primary necessity for life, is available at any time and in unlimited quantities.
However, if we do not increase the awareness of our citizens and industry of the need to be careful with water, the reality already facing other countries, namely the battle for this priceless resource, could threaten our future generations.
If we build in the wrong places, groundwater may suddenly disappear, never to return; and if we manage sensitive areas poorly out of greed, it could take decades for the groundwater to recover.
Particularly with regard to groundwater protection, it is time for us to take a critical look at our support schemes.
If, for example, we support trans-European transport or the cultivation of insecticide-intensive crops such as maize or tobacco, we are also increasing the risk of groundwater pollution.
The EU must give a good example in such matters and, for example, provide greater support and encouragement for organic farming.
