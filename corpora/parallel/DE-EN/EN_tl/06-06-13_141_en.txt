â€“ Mr President, the greatest threat that is repeatedly brought up in connection with bird flu is the appearance of a new virus sub-type that can be transferred from one human to another.
Fortunately, we have not yet reached that stage, but even without this worst case scenario bird flu is a major threat to human health.
The WHO uses a six-phase system of pandemic alerts in order to inform the world of the level of danger.
We are currently in alert phase 3.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.
His measures show what coordination and networking measures are and will be necessary in order to be better prepared for the situation.
Bird flu is a global infectious disease, and I would therefore point out that this topic will also have a role to play at the ACP meeting taking place in Vienna next week and that we are going to adopt a resolution in this regard.
Commissioner, both you and I have been addressed at many events and development policy discussions, and asked not only for the European Union to provide technical and financial aid to the developing countries to help deal with this problem, but also that we do not lay the burden of the fall in the poultry sector on the economic back of the developing countries by granting massive export subsidies and thereby once again destroying and damaging markets in these areas.
