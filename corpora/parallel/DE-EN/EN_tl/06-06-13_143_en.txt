â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to Mr Adamou on his excellent and detailed report, which is very good in terms of content.
We have founded the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC, in Stockholm in good time to ensure that we are equipped for our coming tasks.
When it comes to the possibility of an influenza pandemic, the European added value of which we are all so fond is clear to see: joint planning, joint crisis management, joint coordination, joint logistics and joint travel restrictions are being implemented, and joint virostatics, joint vaccines and joint stockpiling are needed.
We have solidarity in cases of disaster: Europe is called upon in cases of disaster, and joint action and cooperation have priority over subsidiarity.
In this connection, we urgently require an open, honest and rapid exchange of information within the Member States, and the ECDC and the Commission need to collect and monitor this data.
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission.
I am very sparing with my words of thanks, which makes them all the more significant.
Many thanks for so quickly agreeing to make EUR 100 000 million available for aid both here and in the developing world.
I should also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development for their willingness to include the pandemic as part of the Solidarity Fund.
We all hope that the pandemic will remain a fictional, theoretical exercise, and will never occur, but I am optimistic that we are well prepared for the possibility of an outbreak.
