. – Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur on his excellent handling of an extremely difficult task.
We can see that representatives of new Member States, too – in this case Poland, of which the rapporteur was of course prime minister – are excellently placed to get to the heart of such difficult subjects.
I am pleased that, having been a researcher in the course of his career, he has demonstrated here in Parliament how important it is, when getting to the heart of the issues, to take a professional, objective, political approach.
We can all welcome the piece of work in front of us and be proud that Parliament and the people have tabled so many amendments.
The objective is crystal clear: we all want to live long, healthy lives.
We need to carry out a great deal more research in this regard and see what can be done in the way of prevention.
We want to improve employment as part of the Lisbon objectives.
Mr Pühringer, the Head of the Government of Upper Austria, hit the nail on the head when he said that if we want to live healthy lives we have to execute policy accordingly, and that research is the basis for a sound social policy.
We must always bear this in mind if we wish to achieve our growth objectives with the research programme, particularly in the field of exports.
I believe that the European export sector is also capable of affording protection against globalisation in this regard.
We need the world markets, we need the opening-up of the markets, and to this end we need excellent products and services.
For this reason, it would make sense to endeavour to ensure that this programme does indeed start on 1 January 2007.
I would be in favour of our attempting to begin a trialogue following Thursday’s vote, and then we may really be able to launch this programme on 1 January 2007.
That would be a good thing for research, a good thing for our 2009 elections, and a good thing for Europe.
