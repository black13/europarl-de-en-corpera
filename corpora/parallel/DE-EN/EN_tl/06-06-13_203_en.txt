– Madam President, the Commissioner’s answer was brief, but comprehensible and clear, and for that I am obliged to him.
I am very positively struck by the breadth of his concept of information collection and also of transparency.
There is another matter, Commissioner, concerning which I would like further information from you.
You said that this House would be kept informed.
I believe that it should also be involved in this decision-making process, and for that reason I should like to know how you think it might be.
