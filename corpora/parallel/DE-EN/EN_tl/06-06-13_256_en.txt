â€“ Many thanks for that very good and very exhaustive reply.
While I far prefer Commissioner Kroes to Commissioner Michel, that has less to do with him than with her, but I would nevertheless like to ask why he is not here today.
Secondly, I would like to know what the Commission is doing about bringing up the specific issue of the introduction of sharia law in certain Nigerian states, and the acts of violence that are actually being perpetrated, including the killing of Christians and the burning down of churches in the central states, to which you have already referred.
