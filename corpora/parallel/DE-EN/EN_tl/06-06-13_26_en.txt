Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow rapporteurs, Mr Buzek, I should like to comment in particular on the energy research on which Europe is now to decide for many years hence.
Of course, this Parliament is not permitted to exert any real influence on the majority of the energy-research funds spent under the Euratom Treaty and may in fact influence only a minority of the funds spent under the Seventh Research Framework Programme.
Since Mr Chatzimarkakis has mentioned public opinion on research, I must say that the imbalance being decided on is inexcusable particularly as regards the question of what the public thinks.
It is certainly no longer in keeping with the times to spend the majority of energy-research funding on nuclear fusion, under Euratom, without democratic control.
Nuclear fusion will make no contribution to the Lisbon objectives.
I see Lisbon as our resolving to fight climate change efficiently and secure employment in the coming years.
How is it possible to combat climate change using a technology that even leading scientists say will make no contribution to energy supply in the next 40–50 years?
Climate-protection objectives must be achieved by 2020 or we can forget Kyoto.
Nor will employment benefit from a technology that is restricted to a few very large research centres.
It is true that we are attempting to secure some of the funds under the Seventh Research Framework Programme for efficiency and renewable energy sources – there are some interesting amendments on this.
Nevertheless, even this amendment on the bundling of funds for efficiency and renewable energy will do nothing to redress the irresponsible imbalance in favour of nuclear research.
