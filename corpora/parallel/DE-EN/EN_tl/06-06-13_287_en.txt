– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in discussing the Roure report, we are debating a further measure in the interests of greater security for our citizens as the Hague Programme is realised, for which cooperation between police and justice authorities is needed.
Such cooperation cannot be put in place unless the relevant information is exchanged and made available, but the whole scheme of things needs to be subject to appropriate control, and this is where the rapporteur deserves congratulation on having succeeded in striking the necessary balance between, on the one hand, the protection of personal data and hence of private life, and, on the other, the improved cooperation between police forces and justice authorities in the interests of public security, which is absolutely vital.
There is no doubt that this report has also created the conditions for reflection on how data protection can be made more uniform throughout all our Member States.
Thirdly, it also creates the conditions under which databases such as the Schengen information system and the visa information system – which will in future exist in a new form – can be used jointly and under which cross-connections can be established to the benefit of security.
This report, then, endorses the principle of the interoperability of databases, and that is something I regard as a quite decisive quantum leap in terms of the European Union’s future security policy.
This new security package, which we are discussing today in the context of the Hague Programme, will, however, be complete only as and when we have adopted the regulations on the visa information system and on Schengen II.
