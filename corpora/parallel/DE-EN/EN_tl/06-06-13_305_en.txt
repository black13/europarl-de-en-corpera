Mr President, Mr Vice-President, the first thing this report does is to endorse what is simply a technical necessity, that is to say, the adaptation of this drugs monitoring centre, but what I see as far more important is what the rapporteur does in the other part of the report, which addresses the issue of how the work of the Monitoring Centre on Drugs can be organised in a more efficient way.
I do not think it is enough for a drugs monitoring centre to do no more that collect data and then publicise them every year in an illustrated document.
There are many more possibilities, and this report, and the rapporteur’s proposals, go much further.
What we need is for the data to be, at last, comparable; there needs to be more analysis of them, with the various drugs policies evaluated in order to make it possible for a recommendation to be made to the Member States on the basis of which strategies are successful and which are not.
What is needed is more cooperation with other organisations, such as the World Health Organisation or the UN, in order, quite simply, to avoid overlaps and duplications, as well as cooperation with Europol in order to tie drugs offences in with the crimes with which they are associated.
This report gives us a chance to extend the Drugs Monitoring Centre’s powers, at least to some degree, which is desirable if the monitoring centre is to carry more weight and offer our Member States real help in the fight against drugs.
