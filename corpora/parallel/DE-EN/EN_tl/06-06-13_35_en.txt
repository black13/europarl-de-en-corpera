Mr President, this vote is also a litmus test of whether the EU is a community of values or whether human dignity and human rights are under threat.
Regarding embryos as exploitable material risks opening the ethical floodgates.
We have some very successful alternatives such as adult stem cells and research on umbilical-cord blood cells.
It is incomprehensible why the EU is unnecessarily risking dividing the EU on this.
The cloning scandal in South Korea has made it clear that a principle, too, is at stake, namely the ban on commercialising the human body – the female body in particular.
Women are degraded to the level of suppliers of egg cells as raw materials.
The proposal by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy even entails the risk of setting in motion human cloning, because the revision clause envisages exactly that.
I would plead, therefore, that we not be responsible for opening the door to the acceptance of embryonic stem cell research in Member States in which this is prohibited – that would be questionable from the point of view of democratic politics – and certainly not be responsible for paving the way for human cloning.
