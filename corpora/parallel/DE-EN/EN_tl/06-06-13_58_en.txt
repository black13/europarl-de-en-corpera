â€“ Mr President, I should like to discuss a point to which the Commissioner referred: he expressed the hope that the Research Framework Programme would bring the Lisbon Agenda to the fore once again.
I think he is absolutely right.
Indeed, the advantage of the European Research Framework Programme and of the European research area is firstly that we can define our research identity in the European Union, and secondly that we can be part of international developments.
Overall, these programmes are of course promoting the competitiveness of the European Union.
There are currently quite a lot of difficulties regarding the issue of stem cell research.
Some Members are attempting, in effect, to renationalise this area, whenever it is a matter of critical research.
I think that is highly problematic.
This kind of renationalisation would affect many areas of research in future, such as nuclear research, security research and many other areas where certain nation states have ethical or other concerns.
I do not think we should do that.
This kind of renationalisation would be highly damaging not only to the Lisbon Agenda but also to the European Union as a whole in future.
I therefore hope that we will reach broad consensus on the Research Framework Programme.
Congratulations to Mr Buzek, to our shadow rapporteurs and to Mr Busquin.
