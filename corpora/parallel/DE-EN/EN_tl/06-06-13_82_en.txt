Mr President, I refer to Rule 131(4) of the Rules of Procedure.
Cross-border environmental problems can only be combated effectively through international cooperation.
Protecting the Alps is one of the most important tasks for all Member States, because the economic, social and ecological problems of the Alpine region can be felt beyond its borders throughout Europe.
The Convention on the Protection of the Alps was signed by the European Community on 7 November 1991 in Salzburg, and entered into force in 1998 following the Council Decision of 26 February 1996.
Recently, the European Community signed the protocols on soil protection, energy and tourism, and they now need to be ratified.
Unfortunately, the central protocol on transport has not yet been signed, and I would call on Italy in particular to do so.
