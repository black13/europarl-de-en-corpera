Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just as when the Financial Regulation was last reformed in 2002, Parliament has again, in the March part-session, only voted on the amendments and not on the legislative resolution.
However, only this formal resolution will mean that the European Parliament has issued an official opinion within the meaning of the EC Treaty.
Under Parliament's Rules of Procedure, ladies and gentlemen, this matter must be put before us again and again until we, as Parliament, reach a definitive decision on it.
We are still waiting for another document from the Commission relating to important implementing provisions, which should be ready by the beginning of July.
Until we have had an opportunity to examine this document, we cannot seriously vote on the Financial Regulation.
As rapporteur, I therefore once again move, on behalf of the competent committee, that it be sent back to the Committee on Budgets pursuant to Rule 168(1) of the Rules of Procedure.
At one of the next plenary sittings, we will present the legislative resolution to the House, so that negotiations can be opened with the Council.
