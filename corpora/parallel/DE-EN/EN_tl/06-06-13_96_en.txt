The Alpine region has a sensitive ecosystem that is being put under considerable pressure by the ever increasing levels of traffic.
It will take years of major financial investments to repair the resulting environmental damage.
The people in the region too, however, also suffer particularly from health problems due to the increasing heavy goods traffic.
If the Convention on the Protection of the Alps and the associated Transport Protocol, which are being held up mainly by the Italian freight lobby, actually do founder due to the lack of capacity in the Italian rail infrastructure, then it would be appropriate to work, for example within the Marco Polo framework, to expand that infrastructure.
The Transport Protocol must finally enter into force in all eight Alpine states if we are going to prevent the progressive destruction of this valuable natural area and improve the quality of life for its inhabitants.
