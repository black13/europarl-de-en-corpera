Mr President, even though the vote on Mrs Roure's report has been postponed, this has given me the opportunity to express my opinion on it.
In my opinion, the European Union encourages people's fears regarding the transparency of their personal data, for example when it approves the transmission of personal data to the United States, a country with poor data protection security by European standards.
We also need to ensure that personal data are adequately protected when it comes to the planned electronic identity documents for cross-border use, and, in my opinion, the proposed taxation of e-mails and text messages would be a monstrosity, because flat-rate contracts would require individual records to be kept and personal data collected for forwarding to the financial authorities.
I do not feel that any of this has been given sufficient consideration in Mrs Roure's report.
