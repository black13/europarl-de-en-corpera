Mr President, although we take the view that Romania and Bulgaria undoubtedly belong to the European family of nations and need to have a European perspective, we do not expect that the two countries will be able to resolve their many problems with regard to corruption and organised crime within a few months.
Particularly with regard to Bulgaria, you are very much mistaken if you cherish the hope that the country will be able to take more effective action against corruption and organised crime within its borders as a Member State of the EU.
The problems in this area may even get worse, and increase the burden on the other Member States.
The justified concerns and fears of the European public have not been taken seriously, and an enlargement avalanche has simply been set off with no reference to them, with a automatic path to enlargement.
I cannot accept that, and I have therefore not approved this resolution.
