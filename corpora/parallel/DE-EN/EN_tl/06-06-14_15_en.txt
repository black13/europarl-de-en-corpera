– Mr President, allow me to offer some constructive advice.
Use your many means and your sensory mechanisms to find out what the European public really wants.
The answer will presumably be security, justice, accountability and democracy.
The field of security is not doing too badly.
The field of justice – which can only be the product of the two last-mentioned fields, namely democracy and control – is sadly lacking.
I am convinced that the breakthrough can only come if you make a break with the things that have previously failed, move away from the things that have not worked: away from the Constitution and towards the Basic Treaty, with subsidiarity, transparency and control.
There is a very great lack of this.
I would ask you to understand that, to very many Europeans, the elite gathered in Brussels and Strasbourg is currently as welcome as chewing gum on the cashmere sweater of society.
This has to change.
When it does, you are in with a chance.
