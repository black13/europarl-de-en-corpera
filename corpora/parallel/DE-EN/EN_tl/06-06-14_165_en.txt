Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the website on sustainable development that was started by the Commission on the 30 May is well-meant and very interesting - the same goes for the two other websites on climate change and climate control - but that does not lessen my criticism of this Commission communication.
It does not contain a Sustainable Development Strategy, but a catalogue of measures introduced, individual problems and intentions.
In taking this view I simultaneously endorse the main criticism expressed by the Social Platform.
I also agree with this network that the cardinal problem here is the definition of political priorities.
However, I would like to go even further and say that sustainable development is the democratic realisation of a social model, one in which each and every person can live independently and with dignity.
In my view, sustainability means that on the ground, in Europe and around the world, more and more people increasingly have access to the conditions that are necessary to ensure peace, protection from violence, democracy, social security, unspoiled nature, education and culture.
The Sustainable Development Strategy must therefore set out three priorities: the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals; the combating of poverty and social exclusion in the EU; and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming.
That means disarming, demilitarising and democratising economic relations and our societies as well as redistributing and redirecting flows of resources through structural change, restructuring the energy economy and of course reorganising the social division of labour.
