Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to rural development.
It is important that we do not lose sight of rural spaces as a whole as an aid to economic development.
This means that in financial respects too we must ensure that sufficient means are available.
Unfortunately the so-called second pillar of rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 has been reduced by EUR 20 billion in comparison with the proposal by Parliament and the Commission, and that reduces possibilities of development.
That is why we must surely make use of the optional modulation system of 20%, I mean by redirecting funding from the first to the second pillar.
We also have to ensure, however, that we give our support to the international development of rural spaces.
In order to do this we need a fund that can be accessed on an international basis for rural development projects, in a similar way to the existing European one.
Only in this way will there be a chance to develop rural spaces as a whole.
