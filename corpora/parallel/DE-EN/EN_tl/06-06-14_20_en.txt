– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow is the day when the Heads of State or Government come together to ceremonially extend their period of inaction and helplessness.
Guy Verhofstadt called it a ‘deafening silence’: the din of cherry picking, subsidiarity and proportionality, of ‘emergency brakes’ and ‘core groups’ from the sandpits of technocracy – most of these terms not even translatable from the English.
We have another year of this din in store for us.
I wish to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that an interim report on the European debate is due to be presented at the end of his country’s Presidency in June of this year – but there is no debate.
The Presidency has promised us a roadmap for overcoming the crisis in Europe – but does not have one.
It has promised that Europe would listen – but its discussions have been held in closed circles among hand-picked elites, have been held with experts behind closed doors, and the Presidency has only heard what it wanted to hear.
The citizens are not speaking about all of this.
Having had one year to think things over, the President of the Commission comes here and gives the following answer to the question as to the causes of the Europessimism of the people: the cause is the failed referendums.
The President is mixing up cause and effect.
The failed referendums are the result rather than the cause of Europessimism.
The cause is the failure of intergovernmental Europe, of its massive democratic deficit, of its weak legitimacy, of its becoming bogged down in unanimity and nationalistic rivalry.
The Governments have been standing in the way of Europe.
They want to rule Europe as a sideline.
They are not able to come up with a social response to globalisation.
These are the causes of the pessimism among Europeans.
They are disappointed in Europe; and that is why a European democracy is needed.
I hope that this understanding plays a role in the Council, too.
