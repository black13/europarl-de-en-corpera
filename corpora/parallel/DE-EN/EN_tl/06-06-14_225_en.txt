Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to Mr Posselt’s question – one that has already been asked in this form – I can only confirm what I said before: there is no connection between different accession negotiations.
Of course, because of the fact of scheduling accession negotiations with several candidate countries, certain parallels may arise.
However, the accession procedures – the screening, the analytical test and, importantly, the negotiations – are of course carried out separately with each country.
I would like to remind you that one of the fundamental principles of the accession negotiations is that every negotiation is based upon the individual achievements of the individual country concerned, and that cross-connections can not be made.
The speed of progress in the negotiations depends solely on the extent to which the individual candidate makes progress in fulfilling the conditions for accession.
A parallel has arisen, although mainly for practical reasons, simply because the Commission produced the first screening reports on Turkey and Croatia at almost exactly the same time, and so they were dealt with at the same time.
Nevertheless – as was evident two days ago – they were treated completely differently and with entirely different results; and I believe that this connection may be broken again in the future – this connection does not exist in any case – if, for example, the European Commission proposes benchmarks to open the negotiation chapters for only one of the two candidate countries, and if these benchmarks are then confirmed by the Member States; or, if the two accession candidates fulfil these benchmarks at different times.
We stand at the beginning of these negotiations; our next concern is Chapter 36 including other business; in other words, in practical terms and due to the rhythm of negotiations, the two are very soon likely to drift apart from each other.
