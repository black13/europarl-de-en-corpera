Mr Posselt, there will be no formal connection, and there cannot be one.
There is no provision at all for such a thing, neither in the Rules of Procedure nor in Council practice.
Nor do I believe that it is appropriate to demand such a thing of the Commission.
Different rhythms of negotiation will come about automatically.

Therefore - in practice - different speeds of negotiation are very soon bound to emerge.
