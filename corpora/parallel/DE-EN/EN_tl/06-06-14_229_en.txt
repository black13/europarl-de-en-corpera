I do in fact believe, Mr Rack, that the negotiations with Croatia have an important effect as an example to the many Balkan countries that – as I know from many conversations with their representatives – see Croatia as showing them the way.
Croatia is going on ahead of them and there is no doubt that the progress it has made in terms of economic and social policy constitutes an incentive to the other countries in the Balkans.
I would remind you that Croatia will be following Greece in holding the presidency of the South Eastern European Cooperation Process.
This too is important, in that it makes it more likely that Croatia will exercise influence as an example to the other countries in this forum, which comprises only countries from that region.
I personally have high expectations of the negotiations with Croatia, not least for the sake of the other Balkan countries.
