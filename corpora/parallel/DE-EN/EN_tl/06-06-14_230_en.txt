Since the statistics have, for some time, shown the Croatian economy to be making very good progress, the country would appear, in economic terms, to have been ready for accession some time ago.
The only problems appear to be with the sluggish implementation of laws relating to the EU, where the process is hampered by the requirement that proposals for legislation be sent first to the Commission.
Might it not be possible to give the Croatian Government some practical help with this?
