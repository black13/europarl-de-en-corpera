I believe, Mr MÃ¶lzer, that we are doing that.
Croatia is getting very effective assistance from us, from the European Union, from Austria, from the Presidency, in its efforts, and we are in close contact on a very regular basis.
Nor do I believe that it is fair to say that the Commission is in some way dragging its feet in this regard.
The Commission is doing what it is required to do, and I also believe that the negotiations themselves are going very well.
It goes without saying that Croatia will continue to receive assistance from us at Council level as it endeavours to become a Member State of the European Union.
I can only agree with you that there has been not only an improvement in the economic statistics but also very much greater willingness on the part of the country and of its people and so the negotiations should not be too long drawn out; it is on that that we in the Council are building.
