The visa facilitation and returns agreements signed at the summit with Russia in Sochi on 25 May – to which reference was also made in yesterday’s debate on the Sochi summit – were negotiated with the intention of making it easier for people to keep in touch with each other and travel between the European Union and Russia.
That is not only in Russia’s interest, but also in our own.
It is also the intention that this agreement should, in harmony with the timetable for the development of the single area of freedom, security and justice, ensure that people can cross borders lawfully and without problems and stay legally in both areas.
According to this timetable, these agreements – which must first, however, be ratified and implemented – are to be seen as a first step in a process aimed at making the free movement of persons, and their return, easier.
Furthermore, the timetable envisages the dialogue on visas with a view to examining the conditions for the introduction of bilateral exemption from visa requirements being moved forward, albeit as a long-term project without a definite point in time being specified.
The dialogue between the European Union and Russia on visa matters will be continued on this basis.
