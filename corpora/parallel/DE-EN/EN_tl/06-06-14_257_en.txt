I will start with the issue of the increased visa charges, which have become necessary as a consequence of the introduction of biometric data, which have made the grant of visas and the processes leading up to it a good deal more complex.
However, I hope it will answer your question when I say that, in the discussion on the increase in visa charges, the possibility of derogations was conceded not only for the countries of the Western Balkans – who are a particular priority of the Austrian Presidency – but also for those countries to which the European Neighbourhood Policy applies on the grounds of the great importance of both of them.
The relevant legal act therefore includes, among other things, the provision that the visa fee for nationals of those states with which visa facilitation agreements have been concluded, of which Russia is one.
As you will be aware, efforts are being made to conclude visa facilitation agreements with other countries as well.
I have already had occasion to observe today that visa facilitation agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans will, if at all possible, enter into force next year.
There had previously been concern that the countries with which we want to maintain particularly close relations should not have to suffer the increase in these visa charges, which were to be – and have been – imposed for reasons that are objectively perfectly understandable.
