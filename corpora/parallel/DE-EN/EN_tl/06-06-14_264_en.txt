â€“ Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a very warm welcome to you, and I would like to ask you whether the Council is giving consideration to how much more is to be invested in research and development in this specific area.
I am convinced that this type of energy production will create jobs in rural areas and thus help implement the Lisbon Strategy.
Is the Council Presidency in possession of approximate estimates as to how many new jobs this will create in rural areas?
