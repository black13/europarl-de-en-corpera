You are talking about something that is true not only of European energy policy, but also of the ways in which the nation states perceive European targets and achieve them.
All I can say is that we can see from the optional 5.75% target for biofuels that more and more countries are now joining in.
Austria has achieved this target by means of binding legislation; the Hungarians are very definitely interested, and in Germany, too, this target is already the subject of legislation that is going through the system.
A lot is being done, then, and I am very optimistic about the likelihood of the Member States consistently achieving the targets we have set down both in the biofuels strategy plan and in the plan for biomass.
I will concede, though, that this is often not just a matter of political will, but also of the way in which trends in fossil fuel prices are consistently confirming that we are going down the right road.
In discussions with our counterparts, we always reiterate the point that strategies must not only be devised at European level, but also implemented by the nation states.
Some are going on ahead, while others are lagging behind, but, at the end of the day, we are all going in the right direction.
I am very optimistic.
