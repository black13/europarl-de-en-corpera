I can do no other than agree with you that the push for renewable energy sources is certainly not a matter for energy policy alone; it must be supported by a policy on the supply of raw materials – that is to say, agricultural and forestry policy, biomass, and agricultural production – and by action in the spheres of environmental, economic and fiscal policy.
It has to be clear to us that what we need for input, for incentives to produce, is more stringently binding agricultural targets.
In addition, the Commission's proposal will be up for debate at the end of the year, and that is a very good thing.
We are evaluating where we stand and what we have the potential to do.
We will, in June – before, that is, our presidency draws to a close – be embarking on the debate on a forestry strategy for Europe and on the assessment of ways in which forests might be used in the future, and economic and fiscal policies at national level must also make allowances for renewable energies, whether we are talking here about green power, support for heating, support in terms of equipment and infrastructure or research and development.
This is a task for all of us together, but an enormous amount is happening on this front.
