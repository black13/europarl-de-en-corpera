I do not see it like that.
Giving the answers is a matter for the European Union and for all of us.
I tried earlier to show how the issue of certification might be handled.
What we in Austria did about implementation was to make a mixture of 5.75% mandatory, and we will achieve that in October 2008.
We are a very, very long way down the road towards doing that.
Facilities for producing biodiesel and ethanol are being set up, and jobs created with them; in my own province alone, a new factory for ethanol is currently creating work for 180 people.
That is what we have done, and we take responsibility for it.
We have also made it quite clear in the specifications that the products mixed must be produced in accordance with European social, environmental and agricultural standards.
If it is possible for that sort of product to be manufactured in Brazil, then Brazil is in competition with us, but even if Brazil is in a position to do that, the long distance that the products have to be transported is one of the factors that blunt its competitive edge.
We are, then, in a position to respond to this, and we can do it by means of certification and by means of decisive action on the market, which we must evaluate and defend at WTO level.
What we do not want is to establish sustainable energy policy in Europe and then end up doing something like importing the products.
Our ten new Member States – to whose number Romania and Bulgaria are soon to be added – give us incredible potential, with a very large number of plots of land capable of being set aside for the production of energy rather than of foodstuffs, and the agricultural specifications have been chosen in such a way as to make this possible.
