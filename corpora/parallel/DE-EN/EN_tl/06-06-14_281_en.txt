I regard that scenario as absolutely necessary.
We must not, in Europe, make a mistake of the kind that we have sometimes made at national level, for example in energy policy, by discussing ambitious goals to the exclusion of all else.
How big should renewable energyâ€™s slice of the energy cake be?
What we really need is an evaluation of potential.
What long-term potential is there in Europe for the production of renewable energy from biomass, wood, biogas, wind energy or water?
What is the workable potential when account is taken of sustainability, and by what means do we want to inject funds into rural development in order to make use of this potential on the energy supply market in ways that make good, effective and cost-efficient use of resources?
That is what the forestry strategy, on which we are now embarking, and the biomass action plan, which is already underway, are intended to enable us to discuss.
The Finnish Presidency of the Council will be making the forestry strategy one of its core priorities, and now, in June, we are playing the overture to it.
There must be greater emphasis on resources in debates, not least in those on rural development, as we, indeed, are doing in Austria, where, since 47% of our land surface is wooded, we will, in future, be prioritising the sustainable supply of biomass as a raw material, using, funds for rural development and a programme specifically for that purpose.
