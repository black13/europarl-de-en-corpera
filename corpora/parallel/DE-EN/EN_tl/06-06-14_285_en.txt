The honourable Memberâ€™s question specifically relates to a region in which forestry has historically been beset by problems, particularly with forest fires and all the other things that are matters of concern around the Mediterranean, and it is clear that the forestry strategy can be not only a strategy for the European countries with productive forests and a great deal of land covered by them, but also that we must, at the same time, take into account the problematic aspects that he has mentioned.
I therefore take it as read that very serious attention will be given, under the Finnish Presidency and its successors, to the issues of afforestation, environmental action and fire prevention, among others, in the countries and regions to which you, Mr Fernandes, have referred.
We also have to devise appropriate action for the most disadvantaged regions, and it matters to me that we should do so.
The forestry strategy is planned to be not only for such countries as Sweden, Finland and Austria, but is also to take account of all circumstances throughout the European Union.
