That, Mr Rack, is a matter that is not so much of direct relevance to the European Union as to the manner of implementation at nation state level, but it is important, in the forest strategy, Natura 2000, and all other measures that have an effect on property – which protective measures for animals and plants certainly do – that local landowners be involved in their design and practical implementation.
That is a task for those who have to put Natura 2000 into practice.
Lack of experience has meant that many mistakes have been made, and Natura 2000 in the broadest sense of the term has for that reason often got a bad name for itself, but, in those regions and countries in which it has been implemented well, not only with dialogue with landowners in devising the management plans but also with an appropriate range of direct payments on offer, the system has been effective.
One can point to a number of exemplary instances of this, but what is necessary is that the landowners be involved in the development of strategy and of management plans, and there must then be no doubt about what is on offer: if the environment is to be used, then, in the forest, appropriate compensation must be made for that.
