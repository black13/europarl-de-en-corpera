The question that I am trying to answer in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council is not only a very specific one, but also one that I am, in particular, bound to answer as a national minister.
By adopting Directive 2060/EC, Parliament and the Council agreed on a comprehensive regulatory framework for Community measures in the sphere of water policy; the directive has, , the objective of progressively reducing the introduction of hazardous substances into water.
It provides for cooperation between the Member States in respect of cross-border water courses, an area in which the Commission can, where necessary, act as a mediator.
Turning to the specific question you put to me concerning the Raab, I can only report that foaming does occur along the river mainly on an occasional basis, that it is very much restricted to the local area, and, in particular, occurs downstream of protective overflows.
There has to date been no evidence of this foaming having any detrimental effect on the Raabâ€™s water system, yet, nevertheless, Austria, not least as a result of the efforts of my experts, in its report analysing the pollution and its effects in accordance with Article 5 of the Water Framework Directive creating a regulatory framework for Community measures in the sphere of water policy, described the chemical state of the affected stretch of the Raab as being associated with the risk of failing to achieve a good standard of water.
In accordance with the rules contained in the EU Water Framework Directive, further samples are being taken with the aim of determining the causes and the extent of, and possible solutions, to the problem, in order to put the programme of measures on a secure footing.
Speaking from where I am, I can assure you that I have the utmost interest in finding, in an ordered and positive relationship with our Hungarian neighbour, a solution to that which is provided for in the common European water policy plan, and will do everything in my power, in consultation with the officials responsible in the regions, specifically in two Austrian federal provinces, to get the problem taken seriously and progress made towards a solution that benefits Hungary as well.
I have an absolute interest in that; I will ensure that it comes to pass, and, in Austria, I have already taken appropriate action to that end.
