When compared with that in other countries, the quality of Austrian water is very good.
Problems do occur from time to time – there is no doubt about that – and we must, together with Hungary, work towards finding solutions to them, but, taken as a whole, water in Austria is of outstanding quality, as can be measured against the standards laid down by the European Union’s Bathing Water Directive.
It was at one of the first debates that I, as a young minister, was allowed to attend, at the first Council of Environment Ministers in March 2003, that we first discussed the Bathing Water Directive in which these standards are laid down, and so I am able to tell your House today that we have been able to make constant improvements in the quality of running water, and that the water in all Austrian lakes is fit to bathe in and, in most, even fit to drink.
That cost us billions of euros in terms of investment in purification plant, but it is nonetheless important.
It is in the same spirit that brought us that development that we want to join with Hungary in working to resolve the problem on the Raab.
