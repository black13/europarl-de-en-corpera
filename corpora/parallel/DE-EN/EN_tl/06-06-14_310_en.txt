– Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, some of what my esteemed colleague Mr Bradbourn had to say was his personal view; I can assure the House and the Commissioner that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is – with the exception of one amendment – right behind the Costa report, and I will take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to the Chairman of the Committee and to the rapporteur for their very constructive cooperation.
I just want to say something about two peculiarities in this House’s amendments.
The first is that I believe that the costs of all security measures at airports should be split between those who use the airports and the Member States, for the measures put in place at airports are not primarily for the benefit of the individual passenger, but serve to avert dangers to all and sundry; that, traditionally, is one of the functions of the state, and it is the state that should pay for it to be done.
By way of comparison – and on this evening it might well be an appropriate one – let me point out that my own country, when football matches are being staged, has hundreds of police officers on duty before, during and after the match, and not one spectator is required to pay even a cent for them.
If, then, the cost of protecting people against danger at football matches is borne generally, then the same ought, even if only to some degree, to apply at airports.
Secondly, we must make sure, once and for all, that the system of a single security check is brought in on flights not only within the European Union, but also between the European Union and secure third countries.
It is surely not acceptable that someone should arrive at Frankfurt airport by air from Israel and be subject to a second security check before he travels on to Hamburg, and the same is true in the case of the USA.
It must be possible for people arriving from a safe country to avoid going through additional security checks when they change flights within an EU Member State.
This would be a sensible arrangement, and I hope that we, together with the Commission and the Council, will adopt it.
