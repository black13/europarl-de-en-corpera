â€“ Mr President, I too would like to take this opportunity to explain why I voted against this motion for a resolution against racist and homophobic violence.
No sensible human being believes in racist or homophobic violence and everyone will condemn it wherever it actually exists.
However, it seems to me that in this motion for a resolution, individuals who stand up for their own culture and national identity are all too quickly and easily suspected of racism.
It also appears to me that individuals who stand up for the traditionally Christian, European image of the family are all too quickly suspected of possibly even welcoming homophobic violence.
In my opinion, it is absolutely inadmissible when this is also then to be pinned onto individual EU Member States.
