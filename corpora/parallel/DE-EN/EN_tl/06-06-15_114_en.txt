We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats condemn racially motivated attacks, assaults and discrimination in every shape and form and firmly repudiate racist tendencies; that was stated in the motion for a resolution on homophobia that was adopted in January, and we have also spelled it out in our latest draft motion for a resolution.
We call on the EU institution, the Member States and all political parties in the EU to do likewise.
The joint motion for a resolution tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is not a document we can endorse, on the grounds that it arbitrarily pillories individual Member States and puts a motion for a resolution – a parliamentary instrument – in the service of false statements and insinuations.
To name but two of these:
Paragraph 2 includes reference to: “the brutal assault on a German citizen of Ethiopian origin ... in particular because of its racial motive.”
The German Attorney-General, whose remit includes major crimes jeopardising the peace within Germany, sent this case back to the relevant court on the grounds that it was not primarily racially motivated.
The draft motion for a resolution contains generalised presuppositions concerning the Member States’ police forces: ...
“Member States should consider whether their police forces and judicial systems suffer from ‘institutional racism’....”
These people put their lives and limbs at risk, day in and day out, for the safety of all of us, and I refuse to lump them all together in this way and denounce them as racists.
