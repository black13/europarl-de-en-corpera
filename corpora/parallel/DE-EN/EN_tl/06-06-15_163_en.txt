. – Mr President, Syria is on the receiving end of very open threats of war from the outside world.
The USA, for example, listed the country as part of what they called the ‘axis of evil’, and the EU, too, is very forthright in its criticism of the Syrian regime.
At the same time, though, there is very close cooperation with Syria; for example, terrorist suspects are flown out to Syria and tortured there.
Various EU Member States also cooperate very closely with Syria, with the Dutch state bringing Syrian refugees in the Netherlands face to face with representatives of the regime.
Within Syria itself, there is increasing repression of the democratic opposition, particularly of those who signed the so-called Damascus-Beirut petition, which emphasises the ‘necessity of a definitive acknowledgement on the part of Syria of the independence of the Lebanon’.
This declaration also states that external influence and aggression, for example on the part of Israel and the USA, are rejected, and the petition includes the same statement.
A number of months ago, the Left Group had as a guest in this House, Michel Kilo, a member of the Syrian opposition; today, he is in a Syrian jail.
It should also be noted that many of those arrested are adherents of the Left.
We demand the release of all these detainees and also an end, once and for all, to the threats to Syria from the outside world, notably from the USA and also the EU.
We must support Syria’s democratic opposition.
