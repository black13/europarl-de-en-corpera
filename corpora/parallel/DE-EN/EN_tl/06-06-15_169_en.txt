– Mr President, having just, at short notice, taken over my colleague Mr Maat’s one minute’s worth of speaking time, let me say that I share his great concern about the human rights situation in Syria.
The right to free expression of opinion is, to all practical purposes, non-existent.
Repressive measures are taken not only against journalists and civil society activists, but also, and increasingly, against ethnic and religious minorities.
It is of the utmost importance that the EU should delay signing an association agreement with Syria until there have been substantial improvements in the human rights situation.
We all know that paper is patient; if we were to sign it, the pressure would be taken off the regime, despite the continuing arrest and torture of supporters of the opposition and even though the situation as regards freedom of opinion would not have changed and Syria was still not seeking reconciliation with Lebanon.
For the EU to put pressure on Syria is not to threaten it; on the contrary, I believe that it would constitute legitimate action against a pretty authoritarian regime on the part of a union of democratic states.
