– Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, OLAF and its officials deserve our thanks and our appreciation for doing a very difficult and very important task.
The result can be seen clearly: OLAF is an important and powerfully effective partner for Europe in the fight against fraud.
I would like to invite Mr Martin to back up his accusations of allegedly unconstitutional procedures.
It is in our vested interest that OLAF, as part of the budgetary authority, always grows stronger as a partner.
However, if we now review the last fifteen months, then actually the Commission has not done very much to strengthen OLAF.
Long-drawn-out appeal proceedings were heard; with the result that institutions were weakened and people were damaged.
Now it is announced that OLAF is to be strengthened.
The European Parliament will watch over the independence of OLAF with Argus eyes, according to the new legal bases.
I would sincerely ask the Commission to formulate the draft so that it may be judged in these terms.
We shall carefully scrutinise it, to see how serious the Commission really is about fighting fraud.
The more independently OLAF is conceived in the draft, the greater the Commission’s interest in combating fraud.
I would like to assure you of our support.
There are many other initiatives being worked out that are directly aimed at combating fraud, for example the Green Paper on the transparency initiative, and the question of whether to publish the names of the recipients of subsidies or at least to make them public, to bring them to the attention of the Commission.
We have a first draft that includes these things, I mean the Budget Regulation which is present in draft form.
Now, for everybody’s sake, we must send a reminder to the Council about this and follow it through, otherwise the fight against fraud will remain incomplete and be a toothless tiger.
