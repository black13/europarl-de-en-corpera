– Mr President, instead of constantly looking for new sources of funding, for example in the form of new EU taxes, and instead of constantly increasing the level of expenditure, it is in my view high time to intensify the fight against fraud and waste.
It is precisely during the payment of EU grants – made at appropriate points throughout the Member States – that irregularities occur time and time again.
What is remarkable is the increase in fraud cases in several Member States of the EU.
Member States should, finally, either resolve their lack of administrative capacity in this regard or be made to make good the losses that arise from it.
In my view it is indeed important that we optimise OLAF and constantly look for new solutions to improve our fight against fraud.
However, all these changes will achieve little if OLAF dossiers are not rapidly processed, because the responsible officials in the Member States are overworked, and if the recovery of erroneously paid funds is not handled rigorously.
In my opinion, we must, finally, act decisively so that the fight against fraud does not just remain a pious wish.
