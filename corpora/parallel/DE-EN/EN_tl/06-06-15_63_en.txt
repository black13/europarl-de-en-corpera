– Mr President, I would like to state in the clearest possible terms that the members of the Austrian People’s Party support the clear stance adopted by the Federal Government on the Euratom issue, and that their voting is in keeping with the result of the public referendum in Austria.
I regret the fact that Mrs Niebler’s proposal on the ethical issues was rejected.
The Austrian People’s Party delegation declares itself clearly opposed to destructive embryo research.
