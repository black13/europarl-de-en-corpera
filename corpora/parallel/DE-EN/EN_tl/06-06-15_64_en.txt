– Mr President, in my opinion, the nuclear lobby is attempting to worm out further billions for nuclear energy projects by means of untenable promises of a clean, safe and environmentally-friendly energy solution and by withholding the true costs.
Nuclear research budgets are seven to eight times greater than the amount of money spent on renewable energies and renewable energy sources.
If the actual costs – for example, those relating to the disposal of nuclear waste and the consequential costs of possible radioactive contamination – are included, it would become clear that nuclear energy is not only extremely dangerous but also unprofitable.
In my opinion, no new money should be allocated to nuclear energy.
Instead, this money should be given to extend renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency.
