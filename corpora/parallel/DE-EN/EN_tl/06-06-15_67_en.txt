The European Parliament’s decision at first reading is a disaster.
Parliament has not succeeded in setting the EU Commission clear, ethical limits regarding research policy.
The close nature of the vote result gives cause for hope, however, that this can be rectified in Council and at second reading.
It is a sign of inadequacy that Parliament has not used the opportunity to support ethically straightforward and very promising alternatives.
It is unacceptable to lower human embryos to the level of raw material.
There is the risk of the commercialisation of human life and the orchestration of women for the purpose of egg donation.
Moreover, the funding of research into embryonic stem cells could undermine trust in the EU if values such as human dignity and human rights are so obviously subordinated to financial interests.
It would be outrageous to continue to expect German taxpayers to finance projects prohibited under German law.
Already in the current Sixth Framework Programme, six projects are being funded, in contravention of promises made to the European Parliament, which do not comply with German legislation.
The Council is now on the ball in terms of correcting this precarious ethical situation.
The Federal German Government must make it clear that it contradicts the principle of subsidiarity and that it is very problematic to cofinance research funding of this nature which is ethically highly emotive, and which is not in accord with Germany’s legal position.
