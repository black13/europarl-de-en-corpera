In the EUâ€™s Seventh Research Framework Programme, security and defence research is established as a separate budget item for the first time.
Starting from 2007, the EU will undertake massive investment in these problematic research areas.
Parts of the research budget allocation will still be coordinated with the European Defence Agency (EDA).
Defence companies such as EADS and BAE Systems will be able to have a decisive say in how funds are used.
On the one hand, defence research is designed to establish weapons technology as the leading technology within the Lisbon Strategy.
On the other, by means of the massive investment in defence research, a further milestone is achieved in the establishment of the EU rapid reaction corps and EU battle groups.
Moreover, space research has taken on a military bias.
Hence, GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security), which was openly established with a view to enabling the European Union to observe its strategic role, is to be funded.
History teaches us that rising defence expenditure and, hence, increased funding for defence research, too, is always a sign of further wars and conflicts.
Contrary to all assurances of surgically precise weaponry, the number of war victims and, above all, the proportion of civilian victims of war, have always risen the more technically advanced the weaponry.
