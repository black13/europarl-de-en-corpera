I would like to use my explanation of vote to justify my abstention during the vote on Amendments 90 and 91.
It should not be the case that the application of rules in the field of civil aviation security is adopted in the first instance for all airports located in Member State sovereign territories while Gibraltar airport is exempted from this regulation in a rider.
How can we talk about a Union when generally applicable laws suddenly no longer apply to certain territories?
Both Spain and the United Kingdom belong to the European Union.
I would like to say that squabbles of this nature should not be dealt with on the back of the European Union nor, in particular, at the expense of civil aviation security, which this report deals with, and which should apply its measures and rules to prevent acts of unlawful interference in relation to civil aviation to all EU airports so as to safeguard the welfare of all passengers.
