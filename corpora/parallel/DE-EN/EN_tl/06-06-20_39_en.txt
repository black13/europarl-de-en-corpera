Mr President, Mr Federal Chancellor, the Austrian Presidency of the Council has been a complete disaster – from the point of view of the Austrian opposition parties.
They are truly working increasingly hard to find a fly in the ointment.
In reality – as we have seen today – things are a bit different.
Very many in Europe see Austria’s European Presidency as a success story.
I believe it has been just that.
It has been a successful working Presidency overall with many important individual successes and with major issues tackled.
The Financial Perspective has been mentioned, as has the breakthrough in relation to the Service Directive, and the important message has been reiterated again and again that the substance of the Constitutional Treaty should, indeed must, be given a chance.
In addition to the major issues there are the numerous important individual issues, far too few of which have, in my view, been mentioned.
You yourself have mentioned the Directive on Transport Infrastructure Costs.
With this, we have now succeeded in finding a sensible European solution to a dispute over the Transit Agreement that has lasted for 15 years.
The same applies to programmes like Marco Polo II, to the Driver’s Licence Directive and to progress on the railway package and on local traffic.
Where many of these issues were concerned, it might have been, and indeed was, possible to hope for a little more.
However, politics in Europe amounts either to a painstaking search for consensus or to spectacular actions with little substance.
Austria has chosen the former route: small but important steps in and for everyday life in Europe.
Finland and Germany would be well advised to follow in these footsteps.
We wish them all the best in the process.
(Applause)
