Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo Mr Lehne’s words of thanks to the rapporteur.
The report, which does not really fit into the series of diverse reports on company law that have previously been adopted in this House, especially as it enjoys a sort of special status through having been drafted on the initiative of a parliamentary committee, helps to fill a genuine gap, and the Commission should now fill that gap completely in the coming years with initiatives of its own.
We eagerly await the Commissioner’s statement on the next steps in the realm of company law, because, as we all know, European company law is an important element of the single European market and an important instrument for the continuing integration of companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.
This means that the policy we are pursuing here is one which directly creates jobs.
Jobs can only be created in really large numbers if SMEs receive special support.
And SMEs can derive particular benefit from this form of company law because it lowers their consultancy costs and because a harmonised legal form would make it easier to start up a business, which we also want to encourage on a cross-border basis – as you said, Commissioner – by improving mobility.
For this reason, I believe it is right that the Commission should take initiatives to simplify the creation of European private companies in future.
There is already Mr Lehne’s project, of course, to have Parliament foster the Commission’s activities by means of a motion for a legislative resolution.
I also welcome the fact that the proposal to introduce a European private company, which was contained in the action plan back in 2003, is now to be resurrected.
The amendments contained in this report, which focus especially on accounting standards, are extremely important in my opinion, and I therefore ask you, Commissioner, to give these amendments due consideration.
