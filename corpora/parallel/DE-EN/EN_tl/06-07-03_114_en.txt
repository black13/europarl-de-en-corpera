. – Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, on her well-balanced report.
Indeed, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament support her on many points – with the exception of the one about creating a separate emissions trading scheme for air transport.
From 1990 to 2002, the CO2 emissions from international air traffic that were generated by the 25 EU Member States rose by 60%.
In addition, the altitude at which air traffic produces emissions means that their impact on the climate is far greater than their quantity would suggest.
Heavy fuel taxation is common practice in Europe, yet almost nowhere in it is aviation fuel taxed.
This has a considerable impact on the competitiveness of the other modes of transport.
Long-distance rail transport is stagnating.
Parliament should give its resounding support to the Commission’s intention of further pursuing the introduction of kerosene taxes, and implementing these as quickly as possible.
The EU must take the lead on this and set a good example by taking timely action at regional level.
This report does not discuss only the kerosene tax, however, but also the massive distortion of competition caused by tax exemptions on air transport.
Rail transport is subject to taxes and to the Emissions Trading Scheme, which entails considerable cost increases for this environmentally friendly mode of transport.
Emissions trading is not a replacement for the measures needed to reduce climate change impact, but it has the potential to be, provided it is properly organised.
As I have already emphasised, we support the Commission’s proposal to integrate air transport into the existing Emissions Trading Scheme, but we also support paragraph 24, which calls for a pilot phase of a separate scheme covering the period 2008–2012.
