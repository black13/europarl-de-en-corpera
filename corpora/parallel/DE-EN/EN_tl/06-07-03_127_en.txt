– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here, at last, is a report that takes a sufficiently critical line on the impact of aviation on climate change.
I am much obliged to the rapporteur.
All the previous speakers have mentioned the enormous growth rates recorded in aviation.
The rates are so high that their further growth could destroy all the savings that the other economic sectors have worked very hard to achieve.
For this reason, aviation, too, must of course be taken into account in the Kyoto objectives if it is not to continue to be privileged in such an abominable way.
Since we have waited so long, a whole package of measures is now needed to bring the negative impact under control – emissions trading alone will by no means suffice.
As my fellow Member has already said, tourism within Europe will also benefit as a result.
This is not possible at the moment at global level, but we must take action at long last, before the emissions from aviation eat up all the savings we have made in other economic sectors.
We cannot wait any longer.
