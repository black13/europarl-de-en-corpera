. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am much obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for his committed work.
Of course, his original proposals were rather more ambitious than the outcome of the Conciliation Committee we have ended up with, and so it could be said that this is not an unqualified success for the environment.
What was decided does, however, represent a clear improvement in the protection of human beings and the environment against the hazardous chemicals that can escape from batteries.
That is why a vast majority in the House should support this outcome tomorrow.
I agreed with Mr Blokland on most points but, even from the start of the procedure, I disagreed with the extension of the cadmium ban to industrial batteries.
I am pleased that we have managed to find a solution in committee at second reading.
A cadmium ban relating to industrial batteries – unlike such a ban relating to portable batteries – would have put too great a strain on industry whilst having little effect on the environment, as we have an effective recycling system for industrial batteries.
The German Federal Environment Agency has informed me that even operators of certain plants in the Libyan desert are looking into how to dispose of their industrial batteries, as these batteries are so large that they cannot just be put into the household waste.
Even in the Libyan desert, therefore, recycling is a real consideration, and that is why I advocated a derogation for these from the outset – which has in fact been laid down in the final resolution.
I agree with all the other proposals Mr Blokland has presented, however, and am glad that agreement has been reached between all three institutions.
