Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all aware, the European Union has already taken a host of measures in connection with the war on terrorism.
One of the most effective measures needs further improvement, and that is why we are now looking at this means of checking the flow of funds.
In the war on terrorism we must not only assist the competent authorities in combating money laundering but must also go further by enacting measures to improve the surveillance of electronic payment transactions where these are being used to finance terrorism.
For this reason, the authorities must be able to trace electronic payment transactions from start to finish.
We do, however, need a practical solution, in other words a solution that helps the authorities without making unreasonable demands on providers of payment services.
In the tabled proposals we have struck a decent balance between these requirements.
One of the problems is posed by donations.
My own country of Austria is one of those in the spotlight here.
We know that the donation system is being abused to finance terrorism.
On the other hand, we cannot stop donations being made to charitable organisations or for academic or research purposes.
This is why I am in favour of these practicable proposals being implemented for non-profit organisations, including those engaged in educational and scientific activities.
I also welcome the practicable solution of the reduced thresholds.
This is another advance that came out of the negotiations.
In general terms, I am convinced that this will give us a small but important additional instrument to cut off terrorist funding and to raise security standards in the European Union still higher.
