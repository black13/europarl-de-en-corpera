I voted for Mr Silva Peneda's report.
Three quarters of the amendments tabled by our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were accepted by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, and then by the European Commission.
The Austrian presidency of the Council played a vital role in securing the compromise; once again, its good work has borne fruit.
It has breathed life into the concept of 'flexicurity', working for flexible labour markets while defending social security and winning the approval of people in employment as well as those affected by unemployment.
The European Social Fund contributes to economic and social cohesion and is compatible with the new Lisbon Strategy.
It fosters employability through the creation of local partnerships and job-creation companies, especially in structurally weak areas.
It helps to combat youth unemployment and long-term unemployment, to overcome the shortage of skilled labour and to reduce social exclusion and discrimination.
I welcome the signs of willingness to involve the representative bodies of management and labour more fully in the design and implementation of projects.
The ESF is to develop into a guarantor of quality that supplements national programmes effectively rather than replacing them.
It makes important contributions to efforts to meet the challenges posed by globalisation and demographic change and to kick-start urgent reform of Member States' economic and social policies.
