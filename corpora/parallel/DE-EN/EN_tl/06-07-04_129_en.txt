The discussion about the EU budget has hitherto focused exclusively on constantly increasing the size of the budget and seeking new sources of revenue.
Instead of clamouring automatically for a European tax, we should be subjecting the expenditure structure to close examination.
Billions of euros from our common budget continue to seep out into dubious channels or are cast aimlessly to the four winds.
For this reason, the first thing we need is a top-class anti-fraud system; secondly, we need to curb administrative expenditure through measures such as the abandonment of one of the seats of Parliament and the assessment of expenses on the basis of actual costs incurred; thirdly, there are billions to be saved by not foisting enlargements on our unwilling citizens.
