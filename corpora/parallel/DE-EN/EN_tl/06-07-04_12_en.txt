Mr President, I would like to avail myself of the option of making personal statements at the end of debates.
I cannot now remember which precise Rule of the Rules of Procedure it is, but I would ask you to allow me this personal statement.
I have listened carefully to everything the previous speaker said.
I will not go into it in detail, but I want to say one thing on behalf of myself and my group: what we have just heard is the spirit of Mr Franco.
It was a fascist speech and it has no place in the European Parliament!
