Mr President, as a Catholic I would like to say that we stand for human dignity, human rights, the rule of law, democracy and freedom.
We do not consider dictators and supporters of totalitarian regimes – be it fascism, national socialism or communism – the right people to defend our ideals.
We defend our ideals with our own convictions.
