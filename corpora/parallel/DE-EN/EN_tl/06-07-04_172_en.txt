Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me make two more brief remarks.
With regard to the individual case that has featured so prominently in the contributions to this debate, namely Azambuja, the allegation that the company is making enormous profits on the backs of its workforce and the European taxpayer would be rather hard to substantiate, for the days when General Motors recorded profits are long past, both in Europe and in other parts of the world.
If I remember rightly, the last annual loss amounted to ten billion dollars, which is not by any means chicken feed.
This case therefore needs to be assessed rather differently from those that Mr Schulz, for example, had in mind when he referred to certain forms of modern capitalism which do indeed have socially damaging effects, as no reasonable person can deny.
Secondly, there is clearly agreement in this Parliament that structural change is inevitable, and there is also agreement here that it must not be meekly accepted like sunshine or rain but that something can be done when structural change occurs – and indeed something must be done, because people’s well-being is at stake.
The vital thing that a modern economic policy can do now is to shape structural change in such a way that people are not left by the wayside as its victims.
That is precisely the aim of our policy.
A number of very interesting proposals have been made here.
I should like to focus on at least one of them and strongly emphasise that I, too, am firmly convinced that the reinforcement of employees’ rights in Europe would make it possible to shape structural change in a more beneficial manner.
