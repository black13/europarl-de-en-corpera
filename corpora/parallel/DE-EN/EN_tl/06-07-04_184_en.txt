â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, in an age of innovation continual further development and research are necessary, since trusted technologies become out of date all too quickly.
We cannot remain static; instead, we need continual advances.
That is a truism, and one with which we are all familiar.
It is known that for many years our work in research and development lagged far behind that of the frontrunners, USA and Japan.
Even if this is, in the meantime, slowly beginning to change, there still remains a lot to do.
We have to create better conditions for innovation.
To this end we require an up-and-coming generation of researchers capable of competing on an international level.
The low proportion of graduates in technical and scientific disciplines, combined with the brain drain towards competing economic systems that offer the temptation of self-led research should give us cause for concern, as should the problems that our universities have in retaining qualified lecturing staff.
We will also, finally, have to stand by our small and medium-sized enterprises, with which the greatest potential for innovation and job creation ultimately lies.
If we fail to do this, these small and medium-sized enterprises will reduce their research and development activities, because they will be unable to take advantage of our complicated EU investment programmes.
