Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the weaknesses in the Commission's draft cannot be laid at Mr Calabuig Rull's door: in our view, the real weakness is the fact that this framework does not yet have a strategic outlook.
In our opinion, and in this I agree with the previous speaker, a successful strategy would need to be based on clarifying the interaction between industrial, regional, competition, trade and, last but not least, environmental policies.
In connection with our complaints about these analytical weaknesses, we are concerned by the fact that industrial policy is determined by high level groups that have recently been springing like weeds from the soil of Brussels but that are dominated by a few large industrial companies.
We see one problem with this as being that democratic controls are being weakened in this field, and another as the virtual lack of any say whatever in these high level groups for small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ 50% of all workers in the processing industry.
Where industrial businesses in Europe have failed in recent years because they were unable to innovate, that was certainly not always due to poor policies, but down to the fact that certain business leaders have completely failed to recognise their workersâ€™ potential for innovation, or the need to innovate at all.
