– Commissioner, I would just like, once again, to ask you to make it absolutely clear that Montenegro has exactly the same prospects for accession as all the other countries in the region under the Thessaloniki Declaration, and that, with particular regard to the issue of minorities, Montenegro has an exemplary policy in this domain.
Secondly, I would just like to ask what the situation now is with regard to Serbia.
With whom are you negotiating – the former federal level, or the former republic level in Serbia?
