â€“ Commissioner, at the moment, energy trading, and particularly energy imports, generate high profits at international level.
Discussions are currently underway regarding reinvesting these profits in Europe, which would mean OPEC, Russia, and perhaps China too in the near future, cornering the European market.
What is your view of this future situation with respect to competition?
To give a practical example, Gazprom is buying up the larger energy companies in Europe.
What action will the Commission take in this respect, in order to safeguard the security of our energy supply in future?
