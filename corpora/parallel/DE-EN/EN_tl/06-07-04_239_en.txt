â€“ Commissioner, many thanks for that very detailed reply.
I would just like to follow up by asking whether the Commission Representation in Moscow has already got in contact with the families of the prisoners, or whether it could do so.
Secondly, the prisoners have clearly been subjected to unjustified punishments that also contravene Russian law: penalties that could extend their sentences and imprisonment far away from their homes are both contrary to Russian law.
I would therefore just like to ask you to draw this to the attention of the Russian authorities.
