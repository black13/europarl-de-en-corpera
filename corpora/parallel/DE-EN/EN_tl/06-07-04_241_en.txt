â€“ Do you not see a connection between the examples of contempt for the freedom of the media, the restrictions on civil society in the new Act on NGOs, the human rights violations in Chechnya and the conditions under which these prisoners are being held?
The connection is that they do not actually comply with Russian law.
These men were convicted in Moscow Oblast, so they should also serve their sentences there, but after their show trial, which I witnessed myself, I do see a connection there.
If it is possible for something to be treated with contempt here, then it will be.
