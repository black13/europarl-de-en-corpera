There are masses of programmes for this purpose.
The fact is that we have, ever since 2003, been working very hard to stabilise Iraq, and we have spent to date EUR 513 million in doing so.
We have also, for example, set aside another EUR 200 million for this year, although I have to say that the programmes are very broadly based.
There are on the one hand programmes that are run through the World Bank and UN funds and are aimed at meeting the population’s basic needs for such things as, for example, education, health care and water.
There are also, however, programmes the primary object of which is to build up the most important ministries, those being the ministries of commerce and energy.
Provision is also being made for efforts to make Iraqi society more democratic, such as the elections and referendums, which were held under UN supervision, and for which the Commission gave financial support; we will, of course, continue to strive to make a contribution to national dialogue and reconciliation.
Another EUR 200 million – which is a lot of money – has been set aside for this year.
