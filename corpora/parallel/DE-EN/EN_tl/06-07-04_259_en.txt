– Commissioner, you described the situation as regards Russia in a great deal of detail, and I am very grateful to you for that.
What I would like to know is whether you – or the Commission – think that Russia and other states in its orbit are capable of being reliable partners in the future where the supply of energy is concerned, and – since you have yourself quoted the figures – to what degree the European Union is dependent on either Russia or Ukraine.
Can we have confidence in their reliability?
