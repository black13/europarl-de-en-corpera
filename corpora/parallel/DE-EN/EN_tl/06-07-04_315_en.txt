â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reference has already been made to the Naiades action programme, and that which we have not yet negotiated today will at last accord inland waterways the attention and support on the part of the European legislator that are rightfully due to them.
Today, of course, we are taking a less spectacular decision, but one that is nevertheless long overdue, in that this House, at second reading, will be agreeing to the harmonisation of technical regulations for inland vessels, thus bringing to an end a legislative process that has been going on for nine years now.
This directive adapts Community standards to the more extensive ones contained in the Convention on the Navigation of the Rhine, and this, as we see it, guarantees free competition on all internal waterways with the same high safety standards applying in every instance.
At first reading, and in the Common Position, this House and the Council made various amendments.
Like the rapporteur, to whom I am most grateful for her report, I, too, take the view that these amendments are generally acceptable and add to the original Commission proposal in a reasonable way.
We endorse the view expressed by Mr Grosch and Mrs Wortmann-Kool in their amendment on the subject, that certain types of vessel are subject to two sets of legislation, and, even though we have now been advised that the two sets of legislation are quite different, we do nevertheless think that the amendment is sound, and what we would welcome at the earliest possible opportunity is the revision of the technical annexes of the relevant directives in order to remove the duplication.
Apart from that, what both my group and I want is for the legislation to be completed without delay.
