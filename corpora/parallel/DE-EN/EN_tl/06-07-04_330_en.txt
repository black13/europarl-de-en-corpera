– Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, let us just rejoice, for this House’s tenacity and the Commission’s support have made it possible for this dossier to be completed after all.
We can look back on five years, on a great deal of work and a great deal of sweat, so let us just rejoice!
Secondly, Commissioner, I urge you to take your courage in your hands; what we ask of you is that you re-examine the special arrangements for night express flights.
The Council would say it saw that as an excuse for inaction, but be bold, do something, make some proposals!
I believe it to be a simple fact that there is a difference between the living circumstances of pilots of passenger aircraft and those of freight aircraft.
In conclusion, I would ask of the Vice-President and all Members some understanding for why I am not making full use of my two minutes.
In this House, there is agreement all round; on the television, there is something really exciting, and I am sure you will understand when I say that I am going to go for the more exciting option.
