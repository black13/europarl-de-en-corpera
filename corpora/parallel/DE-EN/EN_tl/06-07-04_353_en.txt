() Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank the Commission for taking this initiative, for it is timely that it should give some thought to the essential things in the European Union, among them safety standards and the extreme risks involved in this technology, and that there should be awareness of the fact that the currently existing safety standards differ to the utmost degree and are, in many cases, in need of better monitoring, of, that is to say, what is termed a peer review or of some other means whereby they may be reviewed objectively and transparently.
As I see it, the question arises of what the position is in this area as regards consultation between the Commission, Parliament, and the relevant Member States, or of what is going on as regards the new strategy, according to which the Councilâ€™s nuclear working group is, in effect, seizing powers exclusively for itself and treating our other partners in the European decision-making process in a manner that has no place in the present time.
We should be trying to establish a balance by taking, right now, responsibility for monitoring and transparency, which are becoming ever more necessary in this extremely sensitive area, rather than waiting for an accident to happen somewhere and only then looking for the responsible or guilty parties.
We should also be taking competition seriously, considering such questions as which costs arise from the removal and disposal of waste and also in connection with the safety and security of transports and the standards according to which these things are done.
This is where the European Union needs to act, and I would ask you all, bearing in mind the fact that the Euratom Treaty has been in place for fifty years, to embark upon a serious debate and put issues of safety and transparency centre stage.
