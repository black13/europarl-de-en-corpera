Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur I would like to look mainly at the European Regional Development Fund.
At first reading, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments, appreciably changing the Commission proposal, especially in the areas of strengthening the urban dimension, greater protection for the environment and cultural heritage, non-discrimination and the treatment of persons with disabilities, most of which is also brought out in the Hatzidakis report.
The possibility of using ERDF aid to assist with the construction of social housing was also accepted.
The Common Position, which was unanimously adopted by the Council, is therefore a satisfactory compromise.
The majority of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament were either taken over in full or in part, or the principle of them was accepted.
One of the most important changes, which also reflect the outcome of the December 2005 summit on the Financial Perspective, must surely be the eligibility of non-recoverable VAT where there is private cofinancing.
To avoid double standards – and that is one of Parliament’s successes – in the coming period this support will apply for all Member States.
My group therefore believes that, in view of the urgency, not only the ERDF Regulation but the whole package of Structural Funds regulations should be adopted as punctually as possible so that there can be no further delay in preparing the operational programmes that are so important for us in the regions and the projects in the regions can begin promptly.
In view of the fact that Parliament has emerged from the negotiations with great success, we recommend acceptance of the Common Position without further amendment.
