Mr President, the Cohesion Fund is an ideal way of putting across one of the European Unionâ€™s most important basic principles, solidarity between Member States, to people where they are.
I very much welcome the fact that this support is more geared to sustainable development and that sustainable urban transport, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies are considered key sectors.
The crucial thing for me, however, remains how these principles are put into practice.
I am looking very much to the Commission there.
Together with the regional players, we will be looking to see whether the eligible environmental and transport sectors are really balanced, whether projects contravene environmental regulations, whether the Gothenburg objectives are complied with and whether there is genuine participation and not just a formal invitation to the relevant partners when programmes and projects are drawn up.
