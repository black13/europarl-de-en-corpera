Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European structural policy has a secure perspective for 2007-2013.
At last!
The compromise was a long and tedious process, but the results are plain: the weakest regions will gain from European solidarity.
In the economically stronger regions, we support regional competitiveness.
In the border regions the EU’s emphasis is on supporting cross-border cooperation.
In that way, Europe seeks to help the regions concerned to get to grips with structural change and overcome high unemployment.
That is a challenge, especially when growth rates in many countries are lower than anticipated, and the resources deployed amount to only a few percentage points of the recipient countries’ gross domestic product.
That is all the more reason why we must now press for European money also to be used in the way Europe requires, not squandered on consumption expenditure, not used to finance windfall gains when businesses move in, and not misused by state or semi-state authorities for other than structural policy purposes.
That is why we need an implementing regulation for the Structural Funds that will create transparency.
We must all know, and we want to know, precisely what European taxpayers’ money is being used for.
Parliament must back the Commission in this sensible initiative, because structural and regional policy can only be successful if we use European money in a controlled and targeted way for the most pressing problems.
