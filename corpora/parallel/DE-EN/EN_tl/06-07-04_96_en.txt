Mr President, decisive action needs to be taken against smuggling.
Smugglers now earn similar amounts to drug dealers.
The European Union has deployed a large number of measures to combat smuggling, but those measures are not enough.
I am therefore glad that the European Union is now negotiating with the United Nations and has signed a supplementary protocol guaranteeing that in future joint measures will also be taken with other countries beyond the European Union to combat smuggling.
I therefore backed the European Unionâ€™s signing of the supplementary protocol because it creates a further weapon in the fight against smuggling and thus also against organised crime.
