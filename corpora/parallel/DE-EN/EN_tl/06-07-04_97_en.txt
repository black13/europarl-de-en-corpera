Mr President, my declaration relates to the second subject area, namely traffic in human beings.
As in the case of the smuggling of migrants, the European Union also signed an additional protocol on trafficking of persons.
Human trafficking is another of the major crimes of the present age and generates millions in profits at the expense of individual people.
The European Union adopts appropriate measures but is not able to deal with the problem on its own, hence the need to seek cooperation with countries outside the Union.
The United Nations protocol gives us a new instrument of international law, enabling all states affected by the problem to adopt more appropriate measures than hitherto in their efforts to combat human trafficking.
In this way we are adopting a humanitarian act on the one hand while fighting internationally organised crime with a very efficient additional instrument on the other.
