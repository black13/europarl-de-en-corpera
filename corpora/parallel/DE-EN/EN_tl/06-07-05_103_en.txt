Mr President, I regret that the Commission did not take the floor.
The decision we have just taken on nuclear exports is relevant to the forthcoming G8 Summit.
Based on this morningâ€™s debate, I expect the Commission to raise the issues of human rights and the environmental situation in the Urals in relation to the Mayak and Chelyabinsk reprocessing plants with President Putin on site.
