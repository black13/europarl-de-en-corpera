There can be no doubt that the only effective way of combating organised crime and crime tourism is by strengthening cross-border police cooperation.
In this connection, the Schengen Information System, or SIS, in particular, seems to have proved itself in everyday policing.
Indeed, owing to its speed, many alerts are now being sent only via the SIS and no longer via Interpol.
On the other hand, we now have a juxtaposition of multiple forms of police cooperation: Schengen, Europol, Eurodac, CIS, many forms of bilateral cooperation and now the Pr√ºm Convention, too.
This gives rise to the question as to whether we may now be seeing some unnecessary overlaps here, and also whether we may be starting to lose sight of the overall picture.
In any case, we must also ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the protection of personal data.
