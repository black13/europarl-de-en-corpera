I vote in favour of compromise Amendment 1.
As Mr Stockmann has done such a splendid job as rapporteur, I shall be voting in favour of compromise Amendment 1.
I take this amendment to be, among other things, an indication of the very particular need on the part of all parties for safety in the air.
The new rules on flying times and rest periods is a milestone in terms of air safety and guarantees a marked enhancement of the safety not only of passengers but also of the crew.
It is not only the passengers, but also the whole crew, who stand to benefit from the establishment of uniform standards in all European countries, which will make it possible, even though the number of people who travel by air is constantly increasing, for the same safety standards to apply wherever they do so.
