Even though the nuclear industry has spent five decades looking for solutions to radioactive waste, we are, in this respect, still at square one.
Nuclear waste is transported the length and breadth of Europe in convoys that cost the taxpayer millions, entail a high risk of accidents, and are an ideal target for terrorist attacks.
Risk-free storage over a period of millennia is an impossibility and the idea of it takes the argument about clean and cheap electricity from nuclear power to absurd lengths.
All we would be doing would be to burden future generations with the potential dangers from these ticking time-bombs.
Our scientists have not, as yet, even succeeded in agreeing among themselves as to what geological conditions are best suited to disposal, and so, for example, we see the desperate attempts at preventing radionuclides from escaping from the former Asse II salt mine in Germany, which are costing over EUR 120 million.
Over the coming years, the taxpayer will be required to invest some EUR 500 billion in the decommissioning of currently operational reactors in Europe; even if the atomic energy industry were to be obliged to bear the costs of storage itself instead of being able to shuffle them off onto the public purse, electricity generated by nuclear power would still be at least 20% more expensive and hence unprofitable.
It really is high time that the billions in subsidy that keep this nuclear extravaganza afloat were cut off.
