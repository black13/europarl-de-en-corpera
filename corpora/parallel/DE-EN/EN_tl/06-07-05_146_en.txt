Mr President, the CIA – in the name of freedom and democracy – has abducted people, transported them, made them to disappear, and has not only caused them to be tortured but has also done the deed itself.
If there was even one Member of this House who was not already speechless with fury, the hearing of Khaled El-Masri must have had that effect.
What, though, did our governments do?
They did nothing.
The El-Masri case was the subject of canteen gossip in Skopje; German officials knew about it, but the German Government, no doubt for reasons of state, left Mr El-Masri to his fate.
Let me put it bluntly: every government has the duty of protecting its citizens from the violation of their human rights by others; failure to do anything is a gross violation of human rights.
Over and over again, evidence is demanded, yet, instead of obliging the government to produce it, such evidence is demanded from the victims.
This is the line taken by right-wingers, not least those in the ranks of the conservatives in this House, but who is to be required to produce the evidence?
Mr Marty of the Council of Europe is quite right to say that it is a fundamental duty incumbent on governments to actively investigate all human rights violations that are committed on their territory or against their citizens.
They have to demonstrate that their conduct has always been correct and that they have acted in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the fundamental values shared throughout the EU.
That is why our committee cannot yet declare the case closed.
We must not allow governments to bury their heads in the sand, and that is true whether we are talking about the government of my own country or the government of Macedonia, a candidate country that has tried to put one over on us.
