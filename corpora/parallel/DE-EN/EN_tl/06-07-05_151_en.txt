Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the defence of human rights, the maintenance of the fundamental freedoms that protect citizens and respect for our European legal systems are among the principles underpinning the European Union; accordingly, it was and is the function of the CIA Committee to examine whether the Member States had misapplied Community law.
It is unfortunate that its interim report, which we now have before us, is as yet neither even-handed nor complete.
I can live with the fact that the groups in this House attach different values to the statements made to the committee, but it is a fundamental requirement of any balanced report that it should include all statements, including those that do not tally with the committee's preconceived ideas.
Completeness demands, then, that the statements by Mr Solana and Mr de Fries at their respective hearings to the effect that they were not aware of any breach of the law on the part of any Member State, be included in the report along with the fact that no evidence has been provided, to this day, of the existence of so-called secret prisons in the European Union.
This report must also include the statement made by John Bellinger on behalf of the American administration; after all, the members of the committee had travelled specially to Washington to ask him the questions he answered.
None of the things I have mentioned have as yet been included in the report, for the reason that the majority on the committee found them disagreeable; I dare say that that is hardly commensurate with their task of seeking out facts and establishing the truth.
The justified interest in the investigation of the accusations that have been made must not result in a one-sided approach to the assessment and evaluation of the facts.
If this committee and this House are to have any credibility, then this interim report must reflect objectively all the information available to us; then – and only then – can we adopt this report by a large majority.
