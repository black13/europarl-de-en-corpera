– Mr President, Commissioner, the committee’s great claim was that it was in the business of establishing fact, and it has made a credible job of it, with 26 hearings, a visit to the USA, and close cooperation with the Council of Europe and the Commission, not least here in this House, but has anything new emerged from all this?
One cannot avoid the conclusion that what it has come up with is quite negligible, and rightly too, for that only goes to show either that no offences were committed, or that those that were were isolated occurrences.
I was, then, all the more astonished when I eventually came to read the report, which was one-sided, tendentious, and did not reflect that which was brought to light during the committee’s deliberations.
I would like to ask those on the other side of the House why they refused, when it came to the vote in committee, to incorporate what Mr de Vries and Mr Solana actually found out, that being that there was no proof.
Why, I ask you, did you refuse to incorporate a statement to the effect that no evidence could be found that secret prisons actually existed?
Why did you refuse to include what was said by Mr Bellinger in the USA?
Why did you refuse to include a reference to the fact that it had been established in the USA that that country had not made any use of torture?
Tomorrow will see the European People’s Party making another attempt to introduce balance into the report and to include in it the conclusions to which the committee actually came.
The real test for you will be whether you will vote in favour of the facts and of what was actually said in the committee, whether you want to have broad majority support for this report, or whether you want to leave it as it is – one-sided, tendentious, and failing to set out the facts that actually emerged from the committee’s hearings.
