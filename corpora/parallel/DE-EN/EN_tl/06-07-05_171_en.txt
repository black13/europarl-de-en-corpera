Mr President, those who have been defending this committee and are now also defending its report are often accused of anti-Americanism, but is the United States Supreme Court anti-American simply on the grounds that it insists on due process of law where Guantanamo Bay is concerned?
Are, indeed, all those in America who look to see whether the war on terror is being waged in accordance with legal principles to be described as anti-American?
No, I really do not believe that they can be!
Secondly, we are then told that we are undermining the war on terror.
We are all in favour of the war on terror, but what it calls for is broad support, popular support, in Europe, so if we want to wage this war, we need support from the people, who have no less interest in the rule of law being upheld than we do.
We must explicitly uphold the rule of law as an essential element in the European Union, and this is a point that Commissioner Frattini constantly, and rightly, makes.
Thirdly, whom do you want to punish?
This should not be about punishing just anyone; let us be frank: in the aftermath of 11 September and that dreadful deed and the terrorist activities in America, we did perhaps take too relaxed an approach.
It was believed in various European states that rapid action was called for and that we had to support the Americans, and that I can understand.
Now, though, we have to get back to the rule of law, which is absolutely necessary if war is to be waged on terrorism with any success, and one of this committeeâ€™s essential objectives is to ensure that the war on terror can, in future, be waged effectively and in accordance with sound legal principles.
