Mr President, the so-called ‘CIA flights’ really have got Europe’s political class seriously rattled.
The elucidation of the circumstances under which, in various European states, suspects were alleged to have been seized and their rendition organised, is still patchy, and that may well be because there is in fact less to bring to light than some particularly zealous persons who are critical of America or hostile to it had hoped.
Let me say something fundamental about what has been going on over the past few weeks: Europe in general and we in this House too should not, in a difficult time like this one, be dissipating our energies with enterprises the ultimate motivation behind which is the need of certain persons to distance themselves from the United States.
We still have no certainty of eventually getting the Constitution in place.
There are complicated issues concerning the enlargement of the Union, our common identity and the limits of the European project that we have to address.
As regards all these issues, there are far fewer proposals for solutions on the table than the development of Europe could do with.
With things as they are, it strikes me as reflecting a rather idiosyncratic scheme of priorities for all the European institutions to devote their attention to CIA flights up to the point where the main thing we know is that we know nothing.
Europe has more serious problems to deal with than the question of whether someone or other was flown somewhere or other from one Member State of the EU or another – or was not, as the case may be.
If we want ourselves to be taken seriously, then we should dissolve this superfluous committee at once and, in short order, move on to thinking more about ourselves than about the possible misdeeds of a state that is our strongest ally and will – I hope – remain so in future.
It is with all these considerations in mind that I will be voting against the anti-American resolution with which we have been presented.
