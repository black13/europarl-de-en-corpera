– Mr President, Prime Minister Vanhanen, Mr President of the Commission, I believe that the Finnish Government has set itself the right priorities.
We say ‘yes’ to strengthening the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including raising the profile of security policy.
We say ‘yes’ to more competition and to greater transparency in EU legislation.
We also say ‘yes’ to a calm debate as part of the constitutional process, as the Prime Minister no doubt has in mind for his country’s Presidency.
As he can see, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament have great confidence in the success of the Finnish Presidency.
All of this is taking place against the background of the Prime Minister’s recent statements in the Finnish Parliament, however.
He said there that the Union no longer shares a common core, and that instead coalitions are formed depending on the individual case.
The common European interest is taking second place to intergovernmental cooperation on a case-by-case basis.
We should like him to do something for the common European interest, for the European core, and thus also to set an example for the subsequent German Presidency.
