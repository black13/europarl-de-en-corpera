Mr President, I am much obliged to Mr Vanhanen, who made it clear in his speech that he wishes to win over the public, to further the development of Europe and to move over to specific action.
I congratulate him on this motto – it is a motto for the future, and has my full support.
We want specific projects, and the Services Directive is one such project.
Mr Vanhanen has expressed the desire to conclude the Services Directive at second reading in autumn.
I am confident that we can succeed in this, as the decision of the Council of Ministers to incorporate and further develop Parliament’s fundamental demands provides the basis for doing so.
I am confident that it will prove possible to reach a compromise on the Services Directive under the Finnish Presidency.
I should very much like to see this.
This is an expression of the common will to make a commitment to the community of values for the public.
After all, that is what we want to achieve – and Mr Vanhanen expressed this very clearly in his speech: we want to develop the community of values, determine Europe’s future and ensure not only that we have a free internal market, including for services, but also that there is respect for citizens’ rights, labour law, social legislation, consumer protection and patient protection.
That is what we want to achieve, and it is also the way to really ensure that citizens say ‘yes’ to Europe in future.
That is the best thing we could achieve.
The matter of prime importance is the Constitution for Europe, and that is the best present that Mr Vanhanen could give himself on the 100th anniversary of the right to vote in Finland.
