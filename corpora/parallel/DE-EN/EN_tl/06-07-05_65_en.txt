– Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, this is one of the debates that leaves one increasingly dumbstruck.
We have had to seek new ways.
The Commission is producing a wealth of ideas as to how to help the Palestinian people despite the fact that the new Palestinian Government fails to recognise Israel’s right to exist and has not renounced violence – in this the Commission has our full support.
However, the other party must also make a move.
It goes without saying that there are things, such as the Kassam rockets, that are unacceptable to Israel, but the question is whether it really had to react like that at a time when President Abbas had been on the way to making some progress with Hamas.
This would at least have been worth putting to the credibility test.
On the other hand, however, there have been occurrences that further detract from the credibility of President Abbas, and so it is increasingly difficult for us to find points of contact.
This whole situation is a vicious circle.
It is hard to say who was originally right or wrong, because the circle keeps turning.
We must make the position of the EU and of the Quartet crystal clear.
Our conditions must be Israel’s right to exist as a state, and a viable Palestinian state.
Both parties in the region must be aware that they are pursuing a policy that is not only causing their peoples serious harm, but increasingly also causing problems for the whole international community and endangering peace in general – as this is not just a localised conflict.
Decisions are urgently needed in this matter.
I should like to ask the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that the Quartet makes a joint appearance on site and explains the dangers, rather than its members travelling there separately and thus achieving nothing.
