Mr President, inaccuracies in the German translation of our compromise proposal on cabin crew have caused confusion among some of my fellow Members.
These inaccuracies are found in Amendments 20, 22 and 24(1).
The authoritative version is the English ‘where relevant’, which translates into German as ’ and not , which would be ‘if relevant’.
