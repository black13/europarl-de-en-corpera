. – Mr President, the press is now talking about Mauritania in terms of its being a model for democracy in Africa, and the EU has officially re-established relations with it, but is the situation really that good?
It certainly is not!
That there is to be a referendum in Mauritania on a new constitution, and, in particular, that the President’s powers are to be limited by it, are things to be welcomed, but, according to the information available to us, there is still slavery in Mauritania, and that is utterly unacceptable, and something must be done about, not least on the part of the EU.
The name of Mauritania also comes up whenever discussion turns to the way the European Union deals with refugees, a very large number of whom are sent there, where they are left to their fate.
The EU is making its defences against refugees more and more military in character – the Frontex agency is one example of this.
Major military manoeuvres recently took place in Cap Verde; the plan had originally been that they should be held in Mauritania, and the reason why they were not was that France objected.
I have had sight of the scenario for these manoeuvres, which do indeed have something to do with repelling refugees.
The UNHCR has since noted that no checks on individuals’ refugee status are now carried out in such places as Lampedusa, where refugees from Mauritania are living, and the concept of what are termed ‘safe third countries’ is now being introduced, the eventual effect of which will be that refugees will not be able to get into the European Union in the first place.
We must therefore insist on help being given to people in need.
What the EU is currently doing is building up what amounts to a deportation machine, and it must not be allowed to get away with it.
Help must also be given with the ongoing democratisation of Mauritania.
