Mr President, when you hear of yet another putsch in Africa, you tend to think it is about one autocrat replacing another and carrying on plundering the country; fortunately, though, what happened in Mauritania after the putsch of 3 August 2005 appears to be something different.
It is not just that things went to a timetable, with a constitutional referendum in the June following the putsch, and elections now expected to be held in November, but also, everything has been done in agreement with all the political stakeholders, the Military Council, the transitional government and with the institutions – such as the independent electoral commission – that have been set up.
That in itself I regard as pretty remarkable, and a joint delegation from the ACP and the EU went there to review what was going on, affording a good example of how North and South can come together to consider problems and conflict situations.
Now that we have completed the Article 96 process with Mauritania, I would like to see us making aid fully available again, but we do have to take care that income from the oil reserves, which were plundered as a result of a contract with an Australian firm, appears as income in the country’s budget, so that the resources it possesses really can be made available to the people.
We have already heard what the key issues are.
There are refugees who must find their way back home.
There are others who must get back to their economic activities in various sectors, and I hope that we will all join together in supporting this country as it continues on the road ahead.
Now in particular, at a time when it appears to be on the right track, we must not lose sight of the need to encourage all the interested parties not to deviate from it.
