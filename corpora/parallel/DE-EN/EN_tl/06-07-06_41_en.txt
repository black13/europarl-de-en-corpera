– Madam President, I wish to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur and also to the draftsman of the opinion.
It is a very fine report.
In the case of certain speakers, one gets the impression that they have not read the report and are giving lectures they have brought with them from other political fora.
Irrespective of whether fair trade is written with capital or small letters, for me, it is very important that attention is drawn to the fact that the ‘fair trade’ label, under the corresponding conditions, can be a model for the global market.
I am wondering why people in this House are so afraid of fairness in world trade.
We would save ourselves numerous discussions on development and migration policy if the world trade system was structured more fairly.
We spoke with entrepreneurs from the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States when a parliamentary meeting took place two weeks ago in Vienna.
Representatives of these small business employers told us about the important role played by the ‘fair trade’ label in their regions.
They also mentioned that it would be a good example and a solution to the problem in their regions if international trade as a whole would move more in this direction.
Reference was also made to the enormous influence of fair trade production on combating poverty in general and, specifically, on the lives of women.
It is important that we state this clearly and I hope that we adopt the rapporteur’s report as is so as to support both the ‘fair trade’ label and fair trade itself in an energetic manner.
