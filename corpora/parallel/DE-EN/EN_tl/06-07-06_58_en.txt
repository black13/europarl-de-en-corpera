, . – Mr President, I would like to emphasise an important point as the outcome of the negotiations and, provided there are no objections, I would also like to have this put on record.
The Commission and the Council have agreed that these three instruments shall be subject to a review prior to the European elections in 2009.
As regards this review, Parliament’s full rights, including its power of codecision, should be preserved so as to thereby facilitate practical and flexible management without delay and to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to carry out checks, but also to ensure at the same time, in the case of a project which, in total during this financial period, including the development instrument, accounts for EUR 43 billion, that Parliament’s influence is guaranteed.
I would like to say a special thank you to the rapporteurs, the Commission, the Commissioner and their assistants for their cooperative attitude.
