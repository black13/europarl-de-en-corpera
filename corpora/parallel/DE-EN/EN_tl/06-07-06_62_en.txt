Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, would like to thank Mr Alvaro and Mr Lauk for their good cooperation.
We have come to agree, to a very great degree, on how a proper basis in law should be created, although, as regards the European Union, we do take the view that it is best to frame laws that everyone has to comply with and that every member of the public can comprehend.
It is on this small point – the only thing that divides us – that we are to vote today.
All I want is for this procedure to be technically unobjectionable.
There is a certain connection with the Corbett report, which has just been adopted, and in respect of which an amendment tabled by Mr Radwan was adopted, the intention of which was to affect a single technical detail in the way we are now to vote.
That does nothing to change the result, but the amendments relating to comitology have a minus against them in all the voting lists, in that we all agree on them; they should not be allowed to lapse, but should be voted on.
Let me now tell the House which ones these amendments are; I ask you to allow them to be voted on, but all the groups that have considered them have marked them with a minus.
Even so, we need a clean procedure if comitology and the Corbett report are to be brought into line with the item of legislation that we are now enacting.
The amendments in question are Nos 20, 22, 24, 103, 124 and 125, and they are to be voted on, and they are to be voted on even if there is a minus against them; that is the political compromise on which the rapporteurs have agreed.
