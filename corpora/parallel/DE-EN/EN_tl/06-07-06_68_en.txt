Mr President, while it is envisaged that the original document be translated into all languages, Amendment 1 proposes that these be whittled down to English and French.
I wish to propose, by way of a compromise, that it be translated into the languages of those EU Member States affected by the investigations.
I think it only fair that we should do this, not only for this House, but also for the benefit of other committees of inquiry in – for example – other parliaments.
