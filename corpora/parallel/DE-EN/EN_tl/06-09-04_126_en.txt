â€“ Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, extreme natural occurrences are becoming more frequent, and so it is a good thing that the Community has the means to deal with them on the basis of solidarity.
The Disaster Relief Fund will be able to give help in Spain and Greece in particular, but also in other countries.
That aid must be as unbureaucratic as possible.
What these regions need is European solidarity, and we have the means to help them.
The fact is, though, that Europe is not a suitable source of funds if fires are regularly started deliberately, and so, while I urge support for the victims, I also expect the Member States to call the arsonists to account and to punish them severely, particularly if their actions are motivated by land speculation, about which we hear every year with depressing regularity.
However the damage was done, we must help now, and the forces deployed to deal with disaster situations must be subject to binding rules on their coordination, at least in the states that want that.
Whether, however, Europe should apply its precious financial resources to rural development or even to cross-border cooperation in preventing and fighting forest fires, is another question; while I realise that a number of delegations are calling for this, I do not regard the prevention of forest fires and the creation of firebreaks as a specifically European task.
If the Member States affected want to use EU funds for that purpose, then they should be allowed to do so.
Commissioner Dimas described the various options, including Life+, but please can these be kept within their national financial frameworks, and not take anything away from the protection of the environment in other countries?
Moreover, they should be used only in response to current emergency situations, and not as functions of the future European structural and agricultural policy.
