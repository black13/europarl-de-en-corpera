– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, I myself was hemmed in by flames while on holiday in Halkidiki, and saw two thousand people gasping for breath.
In such a situation, one wonders what could have been done better beforehand.
First of all, of course, I want to thank the emergency services, who did their utmost with promptness and speed, but I also want to thank the Greek Government for organising everything so very well, and with the help of the Greek Navy, for managing to save over a thousand lives.
What I regard as vital in a case such as this is an improvement in communications facilities.
I can remember trying to dial 112 – the emergency number.
When one is in a state of panic, numbers get confused, so it would certainly be a good idea to automate this to some extent.
I also think it important that we in Europe should set up a civil protection force, the primary function of which would be to resolve the problems arising in disaster situations of this kind, and which would be able to try to get the situation under control as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Such a strategy for natural disasters is a core challenge.
If there is to be cooperation not only between the armed forces, the rescue services, the fire brigade and the police, but also between all the bodies with responsibility in such situations, they need a suitable communications platform in order to be able to help each other rapidly and effectively.
Something else of importance would be a European observatory to make information available.
I had to telephone, from Greece, the APA press service in Austria in order to find out the actual extent of the disaster.
It was very interesting to see that the Austrian office very quickly got in touch with the Greeks, and it was this that enabled the Navy to save many people’s lives.
