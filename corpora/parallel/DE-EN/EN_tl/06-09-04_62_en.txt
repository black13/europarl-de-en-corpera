– Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for drawing up this report.
Having, on behalf of my group, helped to produce the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I, too, have had to give this dossier my attention, and I would like now to concentrate on two principal points.
Firstly, I would like to say how much I welcome the Commission’s proposal for the abolition of vehicle registration tax.
It is this that leads me to endorse the report, subject to the condition that the progressive abolition of vehicle registration tax is retained.
Among those Member States that levy a registration tax, there are massive differences not only as regards the amount of the tax but also the basis on which it is calculated.
Of all the charges levied on private motor vehicles in Europe, it is in registration tax that the widest variations are to be found, and, as these differences interfere with the smooth functioning of the internal market, the proposal for the abolition of registration tax should be acted on.
Along with my colleagues, in particular Mr Langen, I also endorse a direct proportional link between the tax burden and the amount of CO2 emitted.
Every gram of CO2 discharged into the atmosphere has the same effect on climate and should therefore be subject to the same amount of tax.
In doing this, the tax must also be technology-neutral; proportionate taxation guarantees that vehicles producing higher levels of CO2 will be taxed more than those that produce less, and that is crucial in terms of climate protection.
I also believe that pollutants such as NOx and particulates should be included in the tax base for motor vehicle taxes in order to encourage environmentally-friendly cars.
With this end in mind, we in the Committee on the Environment have already managed to get these amendments accepted, and tomorrow in the plenary I will be voting in favour of the report as a whole and of Amendments 10 and 19 in particular.
