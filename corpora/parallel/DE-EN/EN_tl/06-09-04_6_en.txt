Mr President, the situation in Zimbabwe is, of course, a dreadful, tragic and disastrous one, but, since there have – unfortunately – been no new developments on this front, it would be perfectly possible to replace this item in this part-session by the item on Transnistria, where, on 7 September, there is to be a referendum, with the possibility of the situation there being made considerably worse.
Those Members who argue that this is not solely a human rights issue may well be right, but the situation in Transnistria does have to do with the human rights of those who live there, and do so under dire conditions.
I would therefore ask that we should, on this occasion, consider Transnistria rather than Zimbabwe.
It might be possible – if you, Mr President, agree to it – for the chairwoman of the relevant delegation to say something more about this by way of justification.
