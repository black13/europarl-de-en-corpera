– Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteur for being here today and for putting this report together.
This report has to do with the taxation of motor vehicles, and there are two reasons why it is going in the right direction.
The first is that it is reasonable, from the point of view of environmental policy, for all emissions to be included in the tax base for any taxation of private motor vehicles.
Both the emission of CO2, which is responsible for climate change, and the pumping out of nitrous oxide and particulates, which are the causes behind the build-up of ozone and the incidence of lung diseases, should have an influence on taxation; that is reasonable and the right way to go about things.
The second is that the planned demise of vehicle registration tax is also to be welcomed, not only from the consumers’ point of view but also in terms of environmental policy.
It is because of registration tax that vehicles produced in one EU Member State are exported to another one with registration taxes, only then to be reimported by reimporters from the country in which they were made.
This results in needless movement of vehicles and in higher purchase prices for them.
It may be that the loss of registration tax in Europe will cause this reimport trade to be banned and the average age of the vehicles on the road to be reduced, which will ultimately be of benefit to the environment.
