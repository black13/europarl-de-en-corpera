. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has put before us a proposal for extending the remit of the Maritime Safety Agency, and it is surely right, and surely makes sense, that the Agency should be allowed to perform operational tasks in combating pollution, for there is no doubt that the agency possesses the know-how required to support – and I emphasise the word ‘support’, for there is no intention that it should replace them in what they do – the Member States in preventing maritime pollution and in dealing with it.
If, though, its responsibilities are to be extended in this way, this must go hand in hand with the allocation of the necessary funding for the long term.
No agency can do a proper job of work if it does not have enough money.
The Commission’s proposal for the sum of EUR 154 million over the seven-year period is very realistic, being based as it is on the experiences gained in 2005 and 2006.
It goes back, though, to a time when EUR 58.5 billion more was meant to be allocated to Category 1A.
The whole category from which the EMSA is funded was cut down to 71%, although the EMSA is not affected by this cut, as the old amount still applies.
Do not misunderstand me: the Committee on Budgets takes the view that the EUR 154 million constitutes the minimum that should be allocated to the EMSA to enable it to cope with its additional functions.
We in the Committee on Budgets would have been happy if the members of the lead committee had taken exactly the same view, had supported us in our approach and had incorporated this into the regulation, for our position is that, if the Community fails to allocate sufficient resources, it is doing no more than wasting money.
