Mr President, with reference to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure, according to which Members are bound by their own conscience, I find it absolutely incomprehensible that you, in the Chair, should have given the floor for so long to a lady Member – of your own group, no less – who, wringing her hands all the while, was seeking a common position.
It is not one of the functions of this House to facilitate group consultations between a vote and a final vote, particularly not when they involve Members who are obviously incapable of making their own minds up.
While I am not familiar with the relevant Rule, I am sure you will be able to find out which one it is, but I have to say that I also think it unprecedented that you should then decline to permit a point of order to be made about this.
I would like to point out that what you said, and what Mrs Sommer said, will be recorded at length in the Minutes.
I would also like to say that your conduct of the vote has been highly partisan and unworthy of a President of this House, and that, too, should be noted in the Minutes.
I believe that your actions show that this House resembles more than anything a karaoke parliament, in which the pretence is maintained of adherence to democratic rules, whilst not every Member, contrary to what is written, is equal before the law or treated equally in this House.
The fact is that, if the Member had been someone else or from a different group, I know full well that you, Mr Friedrich, would, in your capacity as president, have stopped them speaking, just as you did not even allow me to speak in the first place.
