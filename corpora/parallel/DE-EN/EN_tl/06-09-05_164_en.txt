Mr President, it is a pity that this report on a European Social Model for the future does not get us much further on.
None of the social models existing within the EU have, to date, even begun to do as they have claimed to do and create the conditions under which every human being really can live a self-determined life in dignity within the EU.
As I see it, the main challenges, not least for the EUâ€™s internal market, are the abolition of poverty, the removal of social divisions, and energetic action to protect the climate.
I therefore believe that the Economic and Monetary Union needs to be supplemented by a European Social Union, action to establish which could be taken, for example, firstly, by creating the machinery to combat social dumping; secondly, by laying down minimum social standards across Europe, and, thirdly, by creating European social security systems that make poverty impossible.
It is regrettable that the report before us on a European Social Model for the future contains no proposals of any substance for a truly social Europe characterised by solidarity.
