Mr President, Commissioner Dimas has said that the national allocation plans have been submitted by only nine countries – although, if Mrs Doyle is right in what she claims, and Ireland has done so, by ten – and that only six of them did so by the end of June as they meant to.
Our tardiness in matters such as these is particularly disturbing in view of the fact that we have in fact seen a renewed increase in emissions, above all in the old Member States.
What can the Commission, the European Council and the Presidency of the Council do to bring pressure to bear in this area, going beyond merely drafting resolutions to actually putting them into effect?
The second point I want to make has to do with the substance of these national action plans.
What I would like to know is how the Commission or the European Council can ensure that the national action plans are rigorous, that our Member States are required to meet the Kyoto Protocol's requirements, to comply with our own laws, and prevented from buying their way out of their obligations?
