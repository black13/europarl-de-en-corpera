– Madam President, Commissioner, in view of the fact that, in any given year, 10 000 people in Europe lose their lives as a result of passive smoking, I am sure you will understand why I am not particularly happy about that statement.
While I do of course understand that there are loopholes in the law, it is – if I understand these things rightly – your job to close them.
Thinking back to how, at the time of the BSE crisis, we responded to a vague suspicion of risk by turning Europe’s whole food policy on its head over a period of one or two years, we really should do more about this issue, where facts are actually to hand in the shape of some 10 000 victims per annum.
We can tell you that my group will certainly do something about this by producing an own-initiative report along these lines with the aim of supporting you.
