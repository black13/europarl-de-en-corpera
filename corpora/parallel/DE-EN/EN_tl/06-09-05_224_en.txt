– Although none of us want to live in a world in which everything is forbidden, I do believe that smoking – and passive smoking in particular – are examples of a situation in which our own actions are harmful to others.
European hotels and restaurants have in fact undertaken to set aside certain parts of their premises as smoke-free areas, but this is no more than a voluntary commitment.
Would you consider enacting a Europe-wide regulation according to which certain areas would have to be smoke-free, and with this actually being monitored, since controls on this are, to a great degree, more or less effective from one Member State to another?
