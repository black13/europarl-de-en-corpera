I am sure you will understand that this question will have to be examined, for my answer to it would constitute a commitment on behalf of institutions for which I have no direct responsibility.
What I will say, in rather more general terms, is that I do indeed believe that the instruments available to us for ameliorating the consequences of sudden structural change can be used in such cases as well, and so I could certainly envisage creative financial instruments in individual cases, but they really would have to be examined on a caseâ€”by-case basis.
Here too, the problem is that European legislation is not possible under the framework conditions existing at the present time.
