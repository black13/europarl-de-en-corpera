I can do no more than tell the honourable Member that he and I are in complete agreement; that is precisely what the Commission is trying to do, and his question makes it clear to me that there is a need for more information and better communication.
It seems to me that perhaps not everyone in Europe is as yet aware of what the essential substance of our strategy is, so I will repeat that the fundamental strategy that this Commission is pursuing is a strategy for growth and employment.
That is what it is primarily about; that is what it is primarily intended to do.
Alongside the many other means at our disposal, industrial policy is one of the instruments we use to achieve the goal of growth and employment.
