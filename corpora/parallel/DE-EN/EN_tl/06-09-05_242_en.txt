We could have an extremely interesting debate on this, but my answer is a clear ‘no’.
You may be surprised that I am able to give such a clear answer.
It is a fundamental error to think that it is possible to pursue a policy that favours the services sector over the manufacturing sector.
In reality, the services sector cannot be developed at all without strong industry – a strong manufacturing industry – to purchase its services.
If we look at the economic reality in Member States with a particularly high proportion of service industries, we see that many of the activities of the services sector have been contracted out by industry, but are exactly the same in substance as before.
Our argument, therefore, is that, without a strong, efficient industrial basis, it will not be possible to carry out the expansion of the services sector that would be necessary to solve the employment problem by this means alone.
I think that we need to look at these two as being closely interlinked.
