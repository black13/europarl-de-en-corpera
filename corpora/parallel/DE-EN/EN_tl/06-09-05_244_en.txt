I have to admit, Madam President, that my problem with this question is that the sheer volume of the Commission’s recent activities and initiatives on this issue is such that I would need a very long time to relate everything we are doing at present.
I shall give a summary, therefore, which will also help the President save time.
Cutting red tape and reducing administrative costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, including by improving the quality of our legislation, is one of this Commission’s major political projects.
That is what this Commission stands for.
We have brought about a real paradigm shift.
We are currently undertaking a systematic screening of the whole body of European legislation – and by this I mean really law by law, provision by provision – to see whether it can be simplified, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, and whether it contains requirements that put obstacles in their way.
As the House knows, the Commission has put SME policy in its rightful place at the heart of our economic thinking, as it is they, rather than large enterprises, that are the decisive force in Europe, and what they need is to be given more freedom and more responsibility for their own affairs.
They need an environment in which they can develop.
We firmly believe that the ‘Bureaucracy reduction and better lawmaking’ project is a cross-cutting task for the whole of the Commission, a task that involves all the Directorates-General, and will make a vital contribution to strengthening the role of SMEs and encouraging more people in Europe to start up their own business, to take a risk themselves, and thereby provide jobs for others.
Madam President, in the interests of time, I would perhaps suggest I provide the honourable Member with the full version of my answer, which details all these initiatives, and I am also willing to provide any further information required.
