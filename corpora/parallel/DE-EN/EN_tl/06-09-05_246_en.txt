I would not now put it as strongly as that.
Last year, I would have said just the same as the honourable Member.
In the meanwhile, however, as he is aware, the Lisbon Strategy – the strategy for growth and jobs I have just spoken about – that was decided on last spring has been undergoing a complete revision.
Without wanting to anticipate the report the Commission is due to present at the end of this year, I believe I can say one thing, which is that positive effects are indeed starting to emerge.
They can be seen in the policies of Member States, and even in the European economy.
I do not know if the honourable Members had the same feeling as I did when reading the newspaper today, but for the first time in a long time we read that production growth in Europe and economic growth in general has overtaken that of Japan and the USA.
We are now, once more, growing faster than our American and Japanese competitors.
That means that the gap is beginning to close, and I hope that this trend will continue.
It is just an initial indicator, but it gives me hope and shows me that we are on the right track.
