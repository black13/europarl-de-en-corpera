I regret that I have to contradict the honourable Member, as the exact opposite is true.
In the relatively short time since the launch of this initiative, we have achieved more than I had ever imagined.
Firstly, as the honourable Member is aware, we have withdrawn one-third of all pending legislation without replacement as an initial step.
Secondly, we have transformed legislative methods and introduced the compulsory complete impact assessment, which in itself brings a considerable improvement in the quality of ongoing legislation.
Honourable Members will notice this here in Parliament when they discuss the proposals presented by the Commission.
Thirdly, the simplification programme is in full swing.
I am sorry to say that the Commission has been making rather faster progress on this than the other institutions.
I always welcome criticism, but this criticism would be easier to bear if the speed of the decision-making by the Council and Parliament on the simplification proposals the Commission has already presented to the other institutions matched the speed at which the Commission presented them.
