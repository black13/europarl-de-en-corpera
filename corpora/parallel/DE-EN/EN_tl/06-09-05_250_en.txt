I cannot answer this question without knowledge of the specific case.
I would ask the honourable Member to give the relevant documentation either to me or to whichever of my fellow-Commissioners is responsible – of course, I do not know the field of competence in which this is supposed to have occurred – and then the case will be examined.
At all events, there is no Commission policy of favouring large enterprises over smaller ones.
The exact opposite is true.
The requirements to be met by small and medium-sized enterprises when bidding for contracts and projects are significantly less exacting than those for large enterprises.
SMEs can also receive a higher percentage of support than large enterprises.
I am surprised by the practical example the honourable Member has given.
It cannot be the rule – it must be an isolated case – and I would be happy to look into it.
I would ask him to provide us with the relevant information.
