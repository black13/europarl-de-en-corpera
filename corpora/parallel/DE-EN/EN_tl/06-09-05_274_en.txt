â€“ I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his good answer.
I should just like to ask again, in specific terms, whether Turkey has given him an answer, and whether it has had anything to say about what time frame it has in mind for the adoption of appropriate legal provisions.
Or have these been put on hold until after the Turkish elections, or even shelved completely?
