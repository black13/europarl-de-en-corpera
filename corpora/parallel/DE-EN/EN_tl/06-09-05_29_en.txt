Mr President, there is a real risk of the longer-term suspension of the Doha talks again resulting in a multiplication of bilateral free trade agreements, and, while there is no doubt about the fact that the poorest countries of the world will lose out as a result of this, it will also become more and more difficult to defend workers’ interests.
We once had the ambitious objective of building an environmentally and socially sustainable society, and what has become of that?
Beginning in the 1970s, the industrialised states committed themselves to spending 0.7% of their gross domestic product on development cooperation; in 2005, we spent a feeble 0.33% on it.
A sort of global Marshall Plan could now be a new initiative to the benefit of both sides, on the one hand doing away with poverty in the really poorest countries of the world and giving them a fair chance in the world’s markets, while, on the other, preventing environmental and social dumping.
