– Madam President, Commissioner, I would like, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, to thank you and seriously urge you to do what you have just been talking about by drafting a legal instrument to actively combat violence against children, women and young people.
Today, there was support for this proposal from almost all the groups in this House.
I ask you to take up this debate now in order that we may achieve a result without delay.
You can rely on our cooperation.
