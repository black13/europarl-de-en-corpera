Mr President, what is at issue here is the funding of the programme.
When we vote on Amendment 74, which has been tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we will be voting on the sum of EUR 125 million, and so I ask that we vote on this amendment first.
If it is adopted, then Amendment 71 – which refers to the sum of EUR 120 million – will lapse.
