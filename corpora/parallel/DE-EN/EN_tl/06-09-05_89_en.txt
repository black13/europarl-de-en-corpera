Mr President, before we proceed to the final vote, I would like to ask the rapporteur to say something.
To judge by what I have taken note of, this vote has been utterly chaotic.
At one moment we are in favour of taxing pollutants, the next we are against.
At one moment we are in favour of taxation on the basis of fuel consumption, the next we are against it.
At one moment we are in favour of taking efficiency into account, the next we decide not to.
In the space of a moment we go from wanting to retain registration taxes to wanting to do away with them.
Perhaps you could tell me what to do now we have come to the final vote; I really have no idea what I am supposed to do.
