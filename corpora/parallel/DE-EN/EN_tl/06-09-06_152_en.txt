Mr President, for a moment I found it liberating when our esteemed colleague Mr Watson said that we must look forward, rather than back.
However, the people killed so cruelly and senselessly, in this cruel and senseless war, oblige us to ask whether this war could have been avoided, and that is a question that Europe, too, must answer.
In March 2005, this Parliament adopted a resolution condemning Hizbollah’s terrorist activities and asked the Council to take measures to deal with them.
No such measures were taken; the Council did not comply with this request.
As for the UN resolution on disarmament: there was never any initiative on the part of the European Union to ensure its implementation.
On the contrary, Hizbollah was arming itself massively for years.
Did our secret services not know this?
Did we not notice that Hizbollah were setting themselves up with hundreds of rocket bases under the cover of civilian residential areas?
Nothing was done about this.
Did we really not see that Iran was using this conflict as a means of gaining hegemony in the region?
Could we in Europe really not see the impending danger of war, so that we can now so simply cover up our inactivity by looking forward, rather than back?
Every side in this House invokes Israel’s right to exist - quite rightly too, and I am very glad about this - but why do we then look on while those who wish to destroy Israel continually reorganise themselves, until social, political and even military panic breaks out over there?
Could it be that in looking back we see our own joint responsibility for these events?
