Mr President, I get the impression that this was exactly the right time to put this parliamentary question in relation to what emerged from the delegation’s visit, for the fact is that there really is much more left to be done if we are actually to be prepared for the tasks we shall have to carry out.
I am particularly disappointed by the proposals put to us today by the Council, which are not particularly practical.
The litmus test for us has to do with how the European Union manages to cope with the situation in what Commissioner Rehn so aptly called ‘our front garden’.
I think it would be true to say that we do not need UNMIK to be replaced by EUMIK, but I do know from personal experience that we do, in very many areas, still need a long process of monitoring by our partners; it is needed at every level of civil administration; it is needed in the police; it is needed in the performance of the justice system’s functions and not least in the building of a democratic civil society, of which hitherto, alas, only the first budding shoots have been visible.
I wholeheartedly endorse Commissioner Rehn’s view that we are not – in financial and personnel terms – prepared for the challenge that will face us from next year onwards, and that is why I beg the Council, as a matter of urgency, to listen to us and to appeal to the Member States to make it, perhaps, possible for us to remedy the situation to some degree through bilateral treaties and the supply of specialised personnel.
We have to adjust to the fact that the countries of Western Europe will, in the near future, be returning to Kosovo a very large number of people currently living within their borders; are we at all prepared for this?
