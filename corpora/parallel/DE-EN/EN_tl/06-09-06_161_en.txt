Mr President, we must look forward, but it is also worth looking back to see how the Lebanon crisis was managed.
Although the result achieved by European engagement is acceptable, the way in which this result was achieved is not entirely so.
We have seen how there was confusion for weeks, with debates taking place in the national capitals, but not in the European capital, in Brussels.
I maintain that it is thanks to the Finnish Presidency and to the Italian Government that Europe has narrowly escaped embarrassment.
The crisis zone is in our neighbourhood, and we therefore have a particular responsibility.
It is very nice to hear from Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that the EU is ready to give humanitarian and practical aid immediately.
The chain of responsibility for this is clear, as are the mechanisms and methods for it.
When it comes to political and military aid, however, nothing is clear.
Here there is a huge gap, a great deficiency, and it took ages for things to get coordinated.
I would also say that this crisis has once again clearly demonstrated the price we pay for lacking a Constitution.
We need new instruments, a President of the Council who can call upon the Heads of State or Government, a European foreign minister who can make use of this operational level, a European foreign service which can gather information on the ground, and a group of Member States to be able, through enhanced cooperation, to act on the EUâ€™s behalf.
Let us look forward.
I would also say: we now have a chance to become not just financial donors, but also political actors in the Middle East.
Europe has something to contribute.
The CSCE or Madrid Conference must now be the model for the next step.
We have put an end to the Cold War: this must also be possible in the Middle East.
