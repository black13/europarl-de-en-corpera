– Mr President, it is not irrelevant to say that one cause of the present state of affairs in Kosovo is NATO’s war of aggression against Yugoslavia, in which many EU Member States participated, and in which it was their bombs that killed civilians.
Why, then, is the Serb minority in Kosovo under threat today?
That, too, has to do with this situation, and with the one-sided approach that the EU Member States took back then.
A second consideration is that people are being deported to Kosovo, even though many people find the situation there utterly intolerable.
It is intended that there should be more deportations, and the Commission needs to make it quite clear that this is not acceptable.
Joachim Rücker has been put in charge of UNMIK.
I do not know whether that is a good idea in view of the fact that he was, formerly, primarily responsible for privatisations there, which did the people of Kosovo no good at all.
What I would like to know is how, in practical terms, the Commission envisages the future status of Kosovo.
What I have heard so far I have found highly unsatisfactory.
Commissioner Rehn was right to say that funds should be devoted to social and economic development rather than to military matters, and I am all in favour of that.
