– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution of the status issue is not only in the interests of Kosovo itself, but also in those of the European Union.
It is, however, conditional on our finding ways of protecting the minorities – and by that I mean all of them – in a credible manner, for it has become apparent during our numerous visits there that people are still afraid, and events over recent years have shown that those fears are still justified.
That is something we have to take into account, and that is why the European Union still needs to be involved there, firstly in building up the police force – something that is very important indeed – and, secondly, in building up the legal system and the administration, for I share Commissioner Rehn’s view that this is where resources need to be made available, but Kosovo’s economic development will be dependent most of all on peace, stability and functioning institutions, and it is to these that our efforts must be particularly devoted.
This will also involve resolving the issue of which military forces are to perform the function of keeping Kosovo secure once it is independent, and I could well imagine a similar solution being arrived at to that found for Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the KFOR being replaced by European armed services.
When we visited the country, I put this question to the Prime Minister, and it was evident from the answer he gave that nobody had given the matter any thought until then.
Greater involvement by the European Union in this area would also be in line with our security policy – or with the security policy of which I am an advocate.
What is important is that we, at this stage in the development of our security policy, should prioritise our efforts in our geographical neighbourhood, and the stabilisation of the Balkans continues to be our most important task.
