– Mr President, the late reaction of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has quite astonished me, since there was plenty of time in the long process leading up to the resolution for it to express its opinion.
I too received the letter from the Chinese representatives, to which perhaps this reaction is attributable, for it does indeed contain some astounding so-called refutations of the claims made in the resolution.
Among other things, the Dalai Lama is once again called a separatist, even though he has repeatedly stated in public that he does not question the One China policy.
Moreover, the Falun Gong was described as an ‘evil group’, a choice of words in which we no longer have much confidence.
We must ask these questions when we talk with China, for failure to do so will not gain us more market share, but rather lose us the respect of our partners.
A good partnership is based on frank discussion and on each partner being able to say what they do not approve of about each other.
This is a partnership between equals, and this requires that we ask these human rights questions frankly and clearly.
