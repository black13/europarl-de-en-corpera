Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China is one of the rising powers of the twenty-first century.
Economically and politically, the People’s Republic has become an important player.
Of course, the differences between our political systems mean that there are limits to cooperation, but, nevertheless, the EU must view good relations as a central priority for this partnership, and I think, Commissioner, that - as Mr Coveney has already said - you have, today, struck this balance extraordinarily well.
One example of positive cooperation is in foreign policy.
We want China to assume a greater responsibility in matters of foreign policy; a China that is credible and reliable in terms of foreign policy could make a substantial contribution to international stability.
We are having a dialogue with China on human rights and civil rights, and on the right of non governmental organisations and political foundations to go about their business freely.
I therefore welcome emphatically this House’s call for the reopening of the office of the German liberal Friedrich Naumann Foundation in Peking, which was forced to close in 1996.
It is important that the Foundation should resume its work of promoting democracy and development, and this must be implemented.
It would be an important contribution to the development of the strategic partnership.
Let me conclude by responding quite briefly to what has been said today: should we have a dialogue with the USA about China?
I think we should.
We are witnessing a power shift within the international system.
We can see it happening before our very eyes, and I believe that it is the responsibility of the great democracies in Europe and North America to consult with each other about such a change in the international system.
It is better, it is most important for us to talk about it with each other.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
