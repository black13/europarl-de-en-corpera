Mr President, I would like to offer my greetings to the Presidency, to you, Commissioner, and – in its absence – to the Presidency of the Council.
The excitement about this China report shows us that in our own House there are double standards of morality.
This is improper for a debate on politics and human rights.
The EU is known around the world as a champion of human rights, at the same time it is China’s most important trading partner.
It is on this basis that we need to act.
We all know about the serious violations of human rights in Tibet and in China, and that, time and time again, our Parliament calls upon China to respect those human rights.
I am addressing Mr Brok when I say that this clear demand must be reinforced by the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Tibet.
An amendment to this effect has been tabled by my group and by Members from other groups, and I would ask for it to be supported.
The EU makes respect for human rights into a condition of cooperation with all countries, without exception.
Moreover, I reject the Chinese Embassy’s shameless to us on the subject of Tibet.
