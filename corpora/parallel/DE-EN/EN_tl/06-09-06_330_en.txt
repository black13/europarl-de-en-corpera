– Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is the region in the world with the greatest buying power, and that speaks for itself.
We are an attractive market for Chinese manufacturers, and we are a good source of income for Chinese workers.
We are in a win-win situation.
Thanks to affordable purchases and a wage situation different to our own, our consumers can buy affordable products, and meanwhile in China they have financial reserves totalling hundreds of billions enabling them to buy products from us as well.
I am thus talking about opening our markets to each other, reducing quotas, lowering customs duties, which will lead to a win-win situation on both sides.
As the speaker on questions of energy for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the issue of energy and the issue of Kyoto are matters of particular importance to me.
China plays a very important role in the field of coal: 75% of its energy is produced from coal and, Mr Brok, only 1% from nuclear energy.
We must therefore face up to reality: 75% of the Chinese require a great deal of technology in order to get onto a level footing with Kyoto and with the general implementation.
Here there are great opportunities for both sides, just as there are in the use of water power.
In this field China has enormous potential: worldwide, it has the largest share of water power.
Here there are still many resources that can be developed in the future.
The consumption of crude oil, too, which at the moment amounts to around 5.5% of world consumption, will rapidly increase in the future.
At present, China accounts for 40% of the additional worldwide demand for oil.
We can see that energy is a central challenge, and I would ask the Commissioner to properly address this issue at the summit.
