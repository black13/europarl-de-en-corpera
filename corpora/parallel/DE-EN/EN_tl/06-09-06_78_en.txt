Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we face the third vote on the Budget Regulation within the space of six months, and, in order that no time be wasted, I ask you to vote a rapid response from this House to the Council, which I am asking – indeed, urging – to at last enter into dialogue with this House on the subject of the Budget Regulation.
We have left it late enough as it is, and only if we embark upon it now can the Budget enter into force by the required deadline at the end of this year.
Only if it does that will the multiannual programmes and their implementing provisions be able to benefit from the simplified procedures in the new Budget Regulation.
By its delaying tactics, the Council is making it less likely that it will be possible to draw on grant funds promptly and complete grant-making procedures more simply and without delay.
I ask that negotiations be commenced.
