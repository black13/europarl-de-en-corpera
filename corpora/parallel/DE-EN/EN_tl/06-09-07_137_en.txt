. – Mr President, even before 1989, both Mr Deß and I were campaigners together against the Iron Curtain and against the division of Germany and Europe.
At that time, many thought we were pursuing an illusion, just as they believe today that the idea of Korean reunification is illusory.
That does indeed seem to be the case when a firmly entrenched dictatorship – and one, moreover, with nuclear weapons at its disposal – is engaged in the brutal oppression of its people, but we will not desist from speaking up for a free and reunited Korea.
Until such time as that comes to pass, however, we must offer protection to the people who are being persecuted there.
This, I believe, is where Thailand should hold fast to its own great tradition, which it first demonstrated decades ago in its handling of millions of Cambodians.
People keep losing sight of the fact that most Cambodians were able to survive the Khmer Rouge terror simply because Thailand – albeit with European help, but it was Thailand's doing – afforded them aid and protection, and if it was possible to do that for millions of Cambodians, it also ought to be possible to do the same thing for a few thousand North Koreans persecuted by Communism.
It is with this in mind that my group endorses this resolution.
