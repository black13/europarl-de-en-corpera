– Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have this ruling from the ECJ, our first priority is to avoid the vacuum that results from the absence of a treaty, for the consequences of this would be negative not only for the airlines but also for their passengers, in that it might even result in planes being banned from landing, and will, in any case, mean longer waiting times for passengers flying to the USA, since they will now have to supply the information at the airport.
It is for that reason that we support – and I personally do – Commissioner Frattini's intervention in these negotiations, which should involve an amended legal basis in accordance with the ECJ’s ruling, but with the substance of the former agreement, covering precisely those things we proposed then and those that have been added.
For the benefit of all those who have not read the agreement, let me say that it includes the reduction of the data units to 34, the restriction on the use to which they are put, the requirement that passengers be informed, the requirement that the data be forwarded to only one department, namely the Department of Homeland Security, the right of review, and also the right to lodge complaints and appeals, not to mention the requirement that the European Union be notified where terrorist involvement is suspected – in short, it brings us greater security, and that, above all, is something we should make use of.
That, I think, is why it is now necessary that Commissioner Frattini be supported, be encouraged to embark on these negotiations, in which he should of course seek a resolution of those matters where our demands have not yet been completely met – that much is clear, but what is fundamental is that we must not end up without any treaty: fundamental, that is, in the interests of our citizens’ security, of those who travel by air, and of the airlines.
