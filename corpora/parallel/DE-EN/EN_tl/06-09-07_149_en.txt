Mr President, this is not the first time that we have debated a resolution on Zimbabwe, but I have to admit that there have been those we have discussed, the content of which has been better than this.
Not least in our cooperation with the ACP states, the lack of democracy and the massive violations of human rights in Zimbabwe, along with the grave economic crisis and the food shortages, unemployment and hyperinflation that go hand in hand with it, have frequently occasioned criticism and debate.
When one considers all the problems of a country that was once known as the ‘breadbasket of Africa’, one cannot do other than speak of the many courageous people who, in an atmosphere of heavy-handed oppression, are bold enough to keep on denouncing the abuses that go on.
In adopting resolutions, our aim should be to stiffen the sinews of these very people who are fighting for freedom, democracy and development.
The impression I get from some parts of today’s resolution is that it will not do that, and I see it as simply wrong-headed to make reference, in a resolution on a matter of urgent importance, to a World Cup that is to be held in 2010.
With effect from 13 September – which really does make this a matter of urgency – widespread, indeed nationwide, demonstrations are to be held, organised by the trade unions and other organisations, to draw attention to the mounting misery of the people and demand minimum wages above poverty level and social responsibility on the part of the government.
President Mugabe has already made it known that every one of these demonstrations will be suppressed.
It is important that we should ensure that these peaceful protests, which highlight the dreadful conditions under which the country’s people live, should be allowed to take place without harassment on the part of the police, and I would point out to the Commissioner that we should give some thought to how we, bearing in mind the structures existing in the region, might manage to send observers to guarantee the right to freely express opinions and to demonstrate.
