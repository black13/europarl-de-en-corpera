Mr President, I would like to move a substitute wording, namely:
To replace ‘commission to inquire into recent killings, disappearances and abductions’ by the correct wording ‘independent group of eminent persons as observers of investigations into abductions, disappearances and extrajudicial killings’.
I believe that is the correct technical term that should be used at this point.
