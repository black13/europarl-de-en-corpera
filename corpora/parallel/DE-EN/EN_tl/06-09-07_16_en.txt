Mr President, Mr Vice-President, it needs to be said loud and clear that this House was right to appeal against the agreement on the personal data of flight passengers; the European Court of Justice has already ruled that the legal basis on which it reposed was false, and it is only regrettable that it has not therefore had anything to say about its substance.
I might add that I think that the directive on data retention might well end up suffering the same fate.
What is meant – or required – to happen now, following the judges’ ruling, is the conclusion, in a very short space of time, of a new agreement absolving all twenty-five Member States of the need to conclude bilateral agreements with the USA on an individual basis, which would certainly not be in the interests of a high – and above all else uniform – level of protection for the European public.
It will not, of course, be possible, in so short a time, to hammer out a whole new agreement, but there are things that have to be done if we are to have, as intended, a short-term agreement for one year.
I believe, then, that the EU must make it its priority to insist on the USA at last doing what it has repeatedly undertaken to do and allow its engagements to be incorporated into the body of the treaty.
After all, the practice adopted over the past two years has shown that the Americans do not take these engagements particularly seriously and, indeed, simply disregard them.
That is particularly the case when it comes to the principle that data be used only for a specific purpose, and it is very much in the interests of European citizens that their personal data should not be allowed to be passed on indiscriminately as the American customs and immigration authorities think fit.
