– Mr President, it has just come to my notice that, although the Chairman of the Executive Council of the African Union – in other words, the executive or governmental side – is listed among those to whom the resolution on Zimbabwe is addressed, we have omitted to include the Pan-African Parliament among them.
Since we are currently seeking to establish contact with them, I would like to move an oral amendment to the effect that the Pan-African Parliament be added to the list.
