– Mr President, Commissioner, the issue of the onward transmission of flight passengers’ personal details is one of the most tricky that we in the European Union have to face up to, for how do we protect people from terrorist violence without jeopardising their fundamental rights or their private lives?
What that means in this specific case is that if the EU concludes an agreement on the forwarding of air travellers’ personal details, any such agreement must include adequate protection for those details as an essential component.
The agreement we reached did not do this, and it appears to me that the new version does not do so either.
That information has to be exchanged as part of the fight against crime and terrorism is not, of course, a matter of doubt, but there need to be binding legal provisions governing who may have access to the data, where they may do so, and in what manner.
That is why this agreement with the USA needs to be completely renegotiated over the coming year.
Something else that is plain to see is that if the forwarding of passengers’ personal details really is intended to result in better protection against terrorist attacks, this measure cannot be restricted to flights to the United States, Canada or Australia.
An international agreement will be needed to improve air transport safety worldwide and, in so doing, regulate the protection of data; this is where the European Union can be a front runner.
Only in this way can we secure freedom to travel as an outstanding characteristic of our society without imposing needless restrictions on it.
I will conclude with another observation for the Council’s benefit.
Following the Council’s, and the Commission’s, embarrassing performances before our Committee on Monday, I think it highly lamentable that the Council should not be present today, for it is under its presidency that these things are meant to be negotiated.
For this, the Council is in disgrace.
