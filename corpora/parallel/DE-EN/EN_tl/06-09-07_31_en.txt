. – Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, will begin by saying that I see it as fundamental that European cultural policy means not only protecting our cultural heritage and emphasising our cultural diversity, but, of course, also promoting – and in a pro-active manner too – the cause of contemporary art, and that the strength of European cultural policy must inevitably lie in considering all these things as a whole.
I do nevertheless regard this report as important, in that it attempts to raise awareness of the diversity of European culture and of Europe’s cultural heritage.
Anyone who has had the opportunity to travel through Europe, whether to islands such as Madeira, the Canaries, Cyprus or Malta, or to visit rural areas in Tuscany, Scotland, Latvia, Finland, Poland or Provence, knows the beauty and diversity of this European cultural heritage and how readily people can be persuaded to take a stand in its defence.
That is why the defence of this cultural treasure is a matter of political obligation – and I am talking here not only about the making of policy at European level, with its various programmes, but about the national level too.
I also think it very important that we should, in working for the cultural diversity of Europe, consider more than just the 2007 culture programme and understand this as a real horizontal task and as a network policy including also agricultural policy and structural policy, that we should make use of the various programmes such as URBAN, LEADER, and INTERREG, since it has to be made clear that this is not only an important task in terms of cultural policy, it also has to do with preparing people to do jobs – as restaurateurs, for example – and with new developments in rural areas.
It is, then, in the best sense, a truly multifaceted policy for the various European programmes.
