Mr President, before we proceed to vote, I should like to make a point on the basis of Rule 150(6) and to couple it with a question to Mr Poettering.
The point I would like to make is that Mr Hatzidakis tabled an amendment – Amendment 5 – in which, as is generally agreed, it mentions the need for us to send a delegation to the areas particularly affected.
We are now talking only about the particularly badly affected regions in Spain, although there were fires in Portugal, Greece, France and other countries too.
The question arises of whether this is a mistake, for if it is, we ought to do as we have suggested and delete reference to Spain, so that it then reads ‘Delegation to the areas particularly affected’, or, alternatively, one ought to add to Spain ‘Portugal, Greece, France’.
This is on the assumption that there is no underlying political motive, although that possibility cannot be entirely excluded.
I would ask, though, that we should not use the plight of the victims in Greece, Portugal and other countries as an occasion for playing party politics, and so either we delete the reference to Spain or we include all those countries that were hit by fires.
I would be grateful if the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats could clarify this before we move to the vote.
