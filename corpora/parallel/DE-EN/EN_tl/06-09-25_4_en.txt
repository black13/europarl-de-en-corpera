Mr President, we have taken on board one idea from among your proposed reforms, that being that this House should be more up-to-date, and should not wait to discuss certain events as late as four years after they happen.
Two crucial things have happened in Europe over the last few weeks.
One of them is summed up in Germany by the term ‘old meat’, referring to the fact that meat no longer fit for consumption was found in various German regions and now in other countries too, and we would very much like to hear, from both the Commission and the Council, what is actually being done to check that the same thing is not going on all over Europe.
This appears to be something that becomes so widespread so fast that the authorities responsible for dealing with it cannot even begin to get to the bottom of it.
Secondly, we have to deal with the very disturbing fact that genetically modified rice has been found all over Europe, even though it is prohibited.
We would like to hear from the Commission what it is doing about this, too, and not have to wait a few months before being able to debate what it is going to do in three or four years’ time.
We want to know what is being done right now to deal with these two disgraceful occurrences, and that is why we have tabled a written question and want a statement from the Commission and the Council that we can discuss – here in this House, during this part-session here in Strasbourg.
