The vote on the report on the discharge of the budget for 2004 (European Parliament) was postponed in order to look into the circumstances surrounding the lease of the Strasbourg building.
Subsequently, the European Parliament has paid the City of Strasbourg up to EUR 60 million in additional payments, and there is no possibility of compensation for the losses it has suffered.
In addition, a lack of honesty, transparency and decisiveness has been noted.
Despite these facts, we should make a decision on purchasing the Strasbourg building.
The FDP in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is wrong for Parliament to purchase the building in Strasbourg, because it would be irresponsible for it to tie itself to Strasbourg for the long term.
We have therefore rejected the corresponding amendments.
The FDP supports the establishment of the European Technology Institute in Strasbourg, and advocates a single seat for Parliament in Brussels.
