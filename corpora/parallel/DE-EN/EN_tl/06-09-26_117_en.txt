We voted in favour of the Ferber report today, even though it forms a basis for the purchase of the Parliament building in Strasbourg.
However, our approval does not constitute a prior decision regarding the seat of the European Parliament.
Along with more than a million other Europeans, we have supported the OneSeat.eu initiative, and, together with the citizens, we will also continue to advocate relocating Parliament's activities from Strasbourg to Brussels.
