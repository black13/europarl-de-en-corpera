â€“ Mr President, study abroad and distance learning are becoming increasingly popular, not least thanks to millions of Euro worth of EU subsidies.
On the one hand, this is of great benefit to the students themselves, who gain the opportunity to develop their personal skills in addition to obtaining a specialist qualification, but, on the other hand, domestic universities have increasing numbers of foreign students.
However, I find it quite astounding that, in Austria for example, despite the low percentage of the population with degrees, they form such a high proportion of the unemployed.
In this connection, it would be worth considering whether we should provide greater support for practical internships abroad, and also extend opportunities for in-service training and distance learning.
That is why I voted in favour of the Prets report.
