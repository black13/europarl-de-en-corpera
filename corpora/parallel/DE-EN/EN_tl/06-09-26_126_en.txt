– Mr President, I abstained on the Trüpel report, because the acquisition of so-called key competences presupposes basic skills such as reading, writing, arithmetic and logical, critical thinking.
As the PISA study shows, though, we have problems in this area.
A high proportion of foreigners in school classes causes major problems in the acquisition of these basic skills.
If we do not soon lay down upper limits for the proportion of foreigners in classes, then those classes will not only continue to suffer from preconditioned conflicts between the various groups and cultures, but also find it increasingly difficult to acquire key competences.
