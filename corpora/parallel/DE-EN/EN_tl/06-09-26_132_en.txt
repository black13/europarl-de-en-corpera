â€“ Mr President, I support the strategy elaborated by the rapporteur, but I would make two criticisms: first of all, the European strategy on air pollution has no mandatory targets, and it should do; and secondly, the Community should allow the Member States and regions to decide for themselves how to achieve those targets.
This freedom of choice is restricted by a huge number of Community provisions: think, for example, of the Infrastructure Costs Directive, which does not allow tolls to be charged for heavy road vehicles in areas where there is serious environmental and air pollution.
