As the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the report on the thematic strategy on the urban environment, I called on the members of my group to abstain from the final vote today.
The report tries to destroy the subsidiarity principle.
Nevertheless, I considered it unjustified to completely reject the report, because the majority of it describes existing regulations, calls for the sharing of experience between cities and simply calls on the European Commission to issue guidelines.
Particularly in the new Member States, it is absolutely vital to improve the urban environment by means of such measures.
