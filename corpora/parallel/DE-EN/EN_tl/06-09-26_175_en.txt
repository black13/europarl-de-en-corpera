– Mr President, we are now paying the price for the fact that, in Turkey’s case, the Commission has been turning not just one, but often two blind eyes.
Turkey’s reforms need only exist on paper for us to celebrate supposed progress.
For example, the implementation of an obligation to adopt international human rights conventions that has been incumbent on Turkey for more than 50 years by virtue of its membership of the Council of Europe was celebrated as a great success in 2004.
In 1999, the European Council decided that the Copenhagen criteria had to be met before the start of negotiations.
In addition, further political conditions have been laid down in connection with the Greece/Cyprus conflict.
As if it were not enough that the Commission has been very generous in its interpretation with regard to Turkey thus far, now the deadline for the recognition of Cyprus is to be extended once again, in the vague hope that Turkey may yet meet it.
Turkey is dismissing the demand that has now been made for it to actually meet the criteria as politically motivated and unrealistic, and seems to regard Parliament’s decision as non-binding.
As is typical of Turkey, it is even asking MEPs to kindly show political sense and thus to continue to paper over the cracks.
Reality looks rather different, however, namely that Turkey is simply still not ready to join Europe.
There is no real recognition of Cyprus, no real sense of any wrongdoing with regard to the Armenian genocide and no real willingness to treat the Kurdish people properly.
There can be only one answer to this – which, incidentally, citizens across Europe have been giving for a long time – we should give every possible support to the forces for reform in Turkey, but say a clear ‘no’ to the accession of Turkey to the EU.
