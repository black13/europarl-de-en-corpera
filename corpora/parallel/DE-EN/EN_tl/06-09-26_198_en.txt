– Mr President, Turkey is not a European country.
Its accession would overstretch, overstrain, weaken, perhaps even endanger the EU.
Anyone who says so exposes himself to the accusation of refusing to support the process of reform and push the criteria through.
Yet even a privileged partnership requires that the Copenhagen criteria be met and the reforms be driven forward, particularly in the interests of the Turkish population itself.
We must ask ourselves critical questions.
Those who want Turkey to have full membership are perhaps looking for a different Turkey, but will find only a different EU – a free-trade area garnished with political elements.
As far as Turkey itself is concerned, we must ask ourselves the following questions.
Is secularism really compatible with democracy if it is just a minority, an elite project?
Is freedom of religion really compatible with state-controlled Islam in the guise of secularism?
Are minority rights really compatible with Kemalism, which is a kind of Turkish Jacobinism?
These are all serious, well-founded questions that we need to ask ourselves.
We must stop running down a blind alley at whose end may lie a rejection of Turkey’s accession by the Member States and peoples of the EU, with dire consequences for Turkey’s inner stability.
We owe it to Turkey – particularly because it is an important partner – to be honest and to draw up decent criteria for a sound, tailor-made partnership that accords with the interests of both Turkey and the EU, instead of constantly painting our own picture of Turkey, which bears not the slightest resemblance to reality.
For this reason, we must take care not to fall below the line taken in the Eurlings report, which I rejected in committee as I did not believe it went far enough.
This line should represent our consensus, however, otherwise the signal sent to Turkey would be disastrous.
