– Mr President, in December 2004, with 402 votes in favour, this Parliament took a clear decision to open accession negotiations with Turkey.
This sent out a clear signal.
Today we are debating the report on Turkey’s progress towards accession, a report whose intention should actually be constructive monitoring of negotiations with Turkey and of its accession process.
It strikes me, however, that this Eurlings report tends to lose sight of our objective – Turkey’s membership of the EU.
I ask myself what we want, therefore.
Is it for Turkey to continue on its reform path – in which case we should treat it fairly – or are we saying that whatever it does it will never become a member of the EU?
Our Turkish partners are confronted with an assortment of bad examples.
The progress achieved and good examples are almost completely ignored.
This is not fair treatment.
It is true that Turkey needs to do further work on its process of reform.
It is also true that it needs to comply with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol: human rights, democracy and protection of minorities are preconditions for EU accession.
If Turkey meets the criteria already laid down and continues to drive forward its process of reform, we, too, must hold to the goal of EU membership.
That should be upheld in our report.
I would consider this a very clear signal.
If the rapporteur or Parliament disagrees, that must be stated in a report on Turkey, otherwise half-truths such as these will diminish Parliament’s credibility.
We took a decision in Strasbourg in October 2005 to open accession negotiations with Turkey, and we must hold to it today.
I have always said that Turkey was not yet ready for accession, but was ready to start negotiations.
Europe should show understanding and solidarity in acknowledging and supporting this.
