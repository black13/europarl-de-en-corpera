– Mr President, I am really surprised at this discussion.
Anyone would think that there had been only a very narrow majority in favour of the Eurlings report in committee.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament endorsed the report, however.
It was adopted in committee with 54 votes in favour.
The same Socialist Group – Mrs De Keyser, Mr Wiersma, both highly respected Members – is now completely opposing what it supported recently in committee.
That surprises me greatly.
I should like to say to Mrs De Keyser that this is not what I understand by ‘clarity’.
We must ask ourselves some critical questions, the most important of which is whether we have taken the people with us on this enlargement tour, this negotiating tour of Turkey.
The answer is a clear ‘no’.
The people are very critical of it.
I am addressing this explicitly to the Commission and the Council, too.
Where do we think this discussion on the EU’s capacity to cope with enlargement has come from?
Where do we think this change of attitude in Parliament has come from?
All of us here discuss this issue with citizens fairly frequently, and we sense the scepticism, reticence, and in some cases even large-scale rejection of Turkey’s accession.
This is also the reason for my warning to the Council and Commission that no new commitments should be made, no new prospects extended, until the EU has been reformed.
We all agree on one thing: we need institutional progress.
I should like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
