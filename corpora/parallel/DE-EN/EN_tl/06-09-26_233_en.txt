– Mr President, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks for the commitment the Commissioner has shown in connection with the realisation of Schengen.
I have two questions.
It has been discussed that ‘Schengen plus’ is supposedly to be implemented before Schengen II, in a transitional period.
Is ‘Schengen plus’ a necessary requirement for the implementation of Schengen II?
I am thinking here of Slovenia, which has apparently already implemented Schengen II.
My second question is this.
What additional interlinking of files is envisaged with Schengen II?
