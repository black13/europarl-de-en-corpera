â€“ I am obliged to the Commissioner for her answer.
The interpretation disappeared from time to time, as the interpreter could not follow what the Commissioner was saying.
I have tried to follow the Commissioner and have realised that she has not answered one of my questions, namely the one regarding the 377 extrabudgetary accounts I listed in my question of 2 July.
This is the second time that the question as to the total sum concerned has gone unanswered.
To this I would add that there is an account of the Economat supermarket for EUR 7 million.
I would ask the Commissioner to tell us what these EUR 7 million were spent on.
