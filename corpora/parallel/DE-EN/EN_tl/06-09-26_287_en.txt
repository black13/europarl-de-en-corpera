. – Mr President, we, too, welcome this report on PROGRESS.
We hope that it is the urgently needed tail wind for EU gender equality policy.
In the wake of the Commission’s disappointing gender equality roadmap, it is all the more important that as much money as possible be made available for carrying out analyses and public-relations activities relating to EU gender equality policy in the EU Member States.
I am pleased that my fellow Members have put the brakes on the Commission’s rationalisation pressure, or are set to do so, and have insisted on an increase in funding for PROGRESS.
It is thanks to Parliament’s persistence that the resources for employment and social solidarity have been increased.
As we all know, politicians are powerless to act without money.
The objective of gender equality policy must be to provide the necessary resources, therefore, because it is impossible to continue this policy without money.
It was a success for Parliament that it managed to push through obligatory gender mainstreaming in all programme areas.
Admittedly we did not succeed in pushing through an independent action programme, but we did push through a cross-cutting task.
