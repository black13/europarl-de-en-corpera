. – Mr President, Commissioner, in the euro, we have one of the safest currencies in the world, and that is the way it should remain.
It should not be taken for granted, however, as permanent measures are needed to keep it that way.
By this I mean the technical measures that have been taken and are still being taken in the case of renewal, on the one hand, and training and exchanges on the other.
Pericles as a supporting action programme – which has been extremely successful to date, with 64 projects and over 3 000 participants from 76 countries – shows the great interest there has in fact been in this action programme.
Counterfeiting and losses have been reduced.
I can give an example for my country, Austria, namely that, in the last year, seizures have been down by more than 40% and losses have been reduced by more than 50%.
The programme can take some of the credit for this.
Evaluation by OLAF has also revealed certain weaknesses, however.
I am obliged to the Commission and the rapporteur for taking the opportunity this presents to set in motion the new Pericles programme, which runs until 2013.
I consider it particularly important that new priorities are being set, for example in the field of practical training and of personnel exchanges and, looking ahead to the new generation of euro notes, specific training in the new technical aspects.
I also welcome the extension to countries wishing to introduce the euro, that is to say, to the partner countries in which counterfeiting is in fact taking place, and also specifically to groups of people who have not been covered up to now to the same extent as by the first part, when the programme was used particularly for law-enforcement authorities.
We must now appeal to the Member States to make optimum use of the programme, so that we can look to the future with optimism and make the euro the safest currency in the world.
