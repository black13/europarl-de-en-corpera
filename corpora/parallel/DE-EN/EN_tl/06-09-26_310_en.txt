– Mr President, the extension of the Pericles programme is undoubtedly important.
It is no good praising the euro as unforgeable and giving it various security features, however, if our citizens and cashiers are unfamiliar with these features or unable to use them properly.
It is true that there is greater awareness now and EUR 100 and higher denomination notes are tested, but, since counterfeit EUR 20 and EUR 50 notes now make up approximately 80% of fakes, we must increase awareness of the problems still further.
Unfortunately, the large size of the area using the euro, in particular, makes the production of high-quality counterfeit coins attractive to counterfeiters.
In addition, the progress made in the field of printing technology has made it increasingly difficult for the lay person to distinguish genuine from counterfeit notes.
With approximately 600 000 counterfeit notes withdrawn from circulation each year, much work certainly remains to be done, all the more so because, in addition to the rising figures for these, coins are increasingly arousing the interest of counterfeiters.
The only way to tackle the increase in counterfeiting is by raising awareness, which was the idea behind organising more workshops on the subject, including by, or in, the EU information outlets.
It would make particular sense to increase the provision of information in each of the regions in which increasing numbers of fakes – counterfeit money – have been found.
It may also make sense to extend the search project by means of text-messaging business people to enable the perpetrators to be arrested, which is already being done in Austria with some success.
At all events, making the eurozone an area with an unforgeable currency should be an important preoccupation of all of ours.
