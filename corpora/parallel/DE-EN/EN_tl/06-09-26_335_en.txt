– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by expressing my appreciation and congratulations to Mrs Krehl for this, an important component of cohesion policy for the coming years.
After all, it is the task of the strategic guidelines to supplement the Regulation governing the Structural Funds and to support the national and regional authorities in programme planning.
Consequently, these guidelines contain the political priorities for the investments to be made.
The new strategic guidelines rightly focus more than before on growth and jobs, with the emphasis on knowledge and information society, entrepreneurship and employment.
In other words, the priority here is the Lisbon Strategy, but I should like to emphasise that this is pursued never as an end in itself, but rather – within the framework of cohesion policy – always with a view to achieving the objective of strengthening economic cohesion and of pan-European competitiveness.
In so doing, these guidelines must also take account of the promotion of investment in individual businesses by means of subsidies designed especially for SMEs.
Concern must still be expressed about the considerable administrative burden in the field of European structural policy, which, unfortunately, is not significantly reduced by the requirements set out in these guidelines.
I should also like to emphasise that we must not only make intelligent, efficient, targeted use of the scant resources at our disposal, but also attach great importance to private cofinancing at project level.
Unfortunately, public–private partnerships are still used much too rarely in connection with the Structural Funds, particularly because of a large number of unresolved legal issues.
We must now do our utmost, as quickly as possible, to enable countries to submit their operational programmes soon, and particularly to afford them a smooth transition to the new aid period.
