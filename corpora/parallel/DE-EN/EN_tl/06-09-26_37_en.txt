– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we, in this debate, are indulging in too much shadow boxing and not showing enough respect to the law and the public.
Let us take our own laws seriously; according to the constitutional treaty, the European Union is united in diversity, and one expression of this diversity is to be found in the many forms that services of general interest take.
We are united in the internal market, so let us not cause diversity and the single market to be mutually contradictory.
Secondly, in that we do not see the market as an end in itself, we are in favour of the social market economy.
The market possesses sustainability and its own social responsibility; precisely where its boundaries lie is a matter for those with political responsibilities to decide.
Where the market cannot do all the things that the common good requires, or guarantee that they will be done, services of general interest must be allowed to play their part.
They do not operate in opposition to the market; many general interest organisations compete with one another and comply with market criteria.
Thirdly, we affirm our belief in subsidiarity.
Far from running counter to the European Union, subsidiarity is an essential element of the model for it.
The reason services of general interest are not included in the services directive is that the definition of them is delegated to others by subsidiarity, and now we are debating whether this issue is soluble only by saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a framework directive.
We are in favour of social security, security of supply and quality being guaranteed to the public at affordable prices, and of policymakers shouldering responsibility for relations between the market and the private sphere, between which there needs to be a new partnership, expressed in the form of services of general interest.
