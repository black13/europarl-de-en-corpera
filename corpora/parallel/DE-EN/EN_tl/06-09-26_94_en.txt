– Mr President, it is no doubt true that clean air is a crucial issue for all of us, and we also have to bear in mind the certainty of the expense resulting from poor air quality in Europe being higher than the implementation costs incurred by business and industry, but the derogations and potential extensions contained in the compromise document are too complex and likely to present serious administrative problems, and it is for that reason that the delegation of the Austrian People’s Party has largely rejected these compromises.
They also need to be considered in the light of ‘better regulation’, something that they cannot be said to achieve.
It is for that reason that the whole package was largely worthy of rejection; we would prefer the Council position.
