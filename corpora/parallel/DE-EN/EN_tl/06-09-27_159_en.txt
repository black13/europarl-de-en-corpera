– Mr President, I, too, should like to make a statement of vote in relation to the Eurlings report.
Although the report contains many statements that I can endorse, I eventually voted against its adoption on the grounds that I am fundamentally opposed to Turkish membership of the European Union, whilst the report – although it does impose many conditions – does not exclude full Member States status as an objective.
Another reason why I rejected it was that the report does not call for the accession negotiations with Turkey to be suspended with immediate effect.
It is intolerable that we should still be negotiating with a Turkish Government, members of which have recently compared Pope Benedict with Hitler and Mussolini.
It was politicians of Turkish origin who made the most odious statements in response to Pope Benedict’s speech in my own country.
On this issue, though, I shall put my trust in the people of France, assuming as I do that the majority of them will vote against Turkish accession, so that it will not come to pass.
