I voted in favour of the report despite the endorsement contained therein of full Member States status as the ultimate objective, and, in a roll-call vote, together with the other CDU/CSU MEPs, expressed our repudiation of the idea that Turkey should be a full Member State.
The realistic and critical view taken by the report of the situation in Turkey makes it appropriate that it should be adopted.
It notes that, from the very outset of accession negotiations, Turkey has not by a long way met the Copenhagen criteria in such core areas as human rights and freedom of religion.
It also speaks in plain terms of the failure to come to terms with what happened to the Armenians in Turkey.
It is inconceivable that Turkey should become a Member State of the EU without facing up to the facts of history.
The report also calls for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue; if Turkey continues to deny Cyprus recognition, the EU must suspend the accession talks.
Turkish accession would overstretch, and therefore weaken, the EU.
European unification has been a success story so far, and can continue to be one only if the EU remains strong.
A Europe without political or geographical contours is a Europe that the public reject.
Enlargement must not be seen as an automatic process.
We want Turkey to be an important partner alongside the EU, and it is for that reason that we advocate a privileged partnership as an alternative to full membership.
