. – Mr President, those people who have managed to survive in Darfur are in a desperate situation, with Janjaweed militias continuing to attack and destroy villages, torturing, raping, and compelling new recruits to join them on a daily basis.
There are parts of Darfur that international aid organisations can no longer reach.
The Sudanese Government ought to be discharging its obligation to protect its own people, but its intentions are the very opposite, and its latest military offensive constitutes a breach of the Darfur peace agreement.
I would like to give voice to my fear that what the government probably wishes to do is to pursue its strategy of destruction and expulsion to the very end.
In this situation, it is absolutely vital that the international community should implement UN Security Council resolution 1706, which opened the way to the deployment of up to 25 000 UN troops.
The African Union, which has done everything it possibly can, is also in favour of a relief by UN troops, but it is of course important that it should be given every possible support – as it has been to date – until that happens.
I have to say that that is, quite frankly, in my view, no more than the second-best solution, for the UN troops really need to be there right now.
A particular responsibility rests not only on the members of the Security Council, but also, and primarily, on those powers that can exercise a veto in it, for their responsibility is to the world at large, and they must not be guided solely by their own national interests.
It is with this in mind that I would like to make a particular appeal to China, which, on 11 September, together with the EU, confirmed that – and this I shall quote in English:
‘Leaders emphasised that transition from EU to United Nation operations would be conducive to peace in Darfur.’
– We therefore call on China to bring its influence to bear in Sudan in order that the stationing of UN troops in Darfur may be agreed to without delay.
