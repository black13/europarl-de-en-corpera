– Mr President, there is no doubt about it: the Darfur crisis is the result of the government’s policy of Arabisation, as well as of its willingness to arm the militias engaged in the civil war in southern Sudan.
The results of that policy are to be seen – as already emphasised in this debate – in innumerable deaths and millions driven from their homes, leaving swathes of land unpopulated.
Despite that, President Omar al-Bashir denounces it as a lie that Sudanese Arabs are attacking Sudanese black Africans, and claims that human rights organisations that decry the present state of affairs are doing so only in the hope of attracting more donations.
It is evident, then, that what Sudan would prefer is to be left to itself and its civil war.
The best hope is that it will agree to the extension of the mandate for a peace mission by the African Union, although those with inside knowledge describe this as not only badly equipped and under-motivated, but also – quite simply – as completely out of its depth.
Although the deployment of the UN’s 'blue helmets' promises to bring much greater success, this is rejected as neo-colonialism.
Perhaps, then, this genocide might be halted if there were an agreement to send a multinational peace-keeping force composed of Africans and Muslims, in other words a joint intervention by African Union and UN troops.
