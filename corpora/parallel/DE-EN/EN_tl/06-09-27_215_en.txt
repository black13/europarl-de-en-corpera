– Mr President, the Darfur peace agreement was concluded in May 2006, and not one single deadline in this treaty has been met since then.
There is no less fighting, no less violence against the civilian population; indeed, both are on the increase.
Rape, carried out systematically, is still being used as a means of waging war, and a sharp increase in the number of rapes was recorded over the last three months.
The Sudanese Government is still opposed to a UN mission, which would have significantly more resources, troops and powers than the present African Union peace mission, which is largely ineffective.
Much as the expansion of the African peace mission to 11 000 police officers and soldiers in the Western Sudan is to be welcomed, the African Union’s continuing and collective support for UN troops shows that this can be seen as no more than a transitional measure.
It is evident that the Sudanese Government is already planning to send its own troops to protect the region.
Amnesty International warns that ‘the prospect of soon being “protected” by the same government soldiers that had driven them from their homes and mistreated them, is spreading panic among the people’.
Aid organisations active in the region fear that they would have to close their operations down completely if the government troops were again to come up against the bands of secessionist rebels that have not yet signed the Abuja peace treaty.
We therefore call on the Sudanese Government to comply with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and accept the presence in Darfur of a UN peacekeeping force of the kind provided for in Security Council Resolution 1706.
Sudan is standing on the brink of disaster.
Every attempt must be made to prevent another genocide on the continent of Africa.
