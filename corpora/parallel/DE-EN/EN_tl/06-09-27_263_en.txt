– Madam President, not very long ago now, a report on trade and poverty put in an appearance in this House, and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality tabled a number of very good amendments to it, all of which were adopted.
It is with that in mind that I would like to thank Mrs Breyer for this own-initiative report, which is the logical response to the imperative need for the issue of the relative roles of trade and women to be once more addressed.
Nothing will be done about the problem of the unequal treatment of women for as long as there is no radical rethinking of economic and trade policies.
Do you remember trade agreements?
There was the Agnoletto report, which stated that human rights clauses should be incorporated in all international treaties.
Since there are both individual and social human rights, it follows that it is justified – to say the least – that all trade agreements should include clauses on human beings’ social rights, namely the right to education, the right to training, and the right to free health care.
If you want those things – and we do – then you cannot, of course, want to implement a European services directive that makes them into market commodities and hence dependent on people’s ability to pay for them.
It is quite clear that that approach is eventually going to be taken to GATS, so that women in certain countries will be denied what opportunities they currently have, for those countries will not have the financial resources.
Turning to the subject of quotas, these are always crutches, but they can be bridges.
That I can tell you from my own experience as a member of the left-wing PDS party in the Federal Republic of Germany, which applies a 50% quota to all its parliamentarians, and that is something that should be brought in everywhere, for if it were, we and our society would have achieved a major advance.
