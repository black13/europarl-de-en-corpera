– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even in his absence, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report, which really is a very good one.
For many farmers, organic farming represents an alternative mode of production.
The advent of genetic engineering is prompting a constant increase in demand for organic products from monitored and certified farms.
Organic foods account for some 5% in terms of quantity of the turnover of the retail trade in food, with consumers opting for organic products not only because of their richer flavour, but also out of a sense of responsibility for the environment and for animals and in order to make a real contribution towards keeping the countryside intact and diverse.
If strategy is to be based on quantity, then countries like Austria – from which I come – can never succeed in tough competition with the big agricultural countries; we must instead go all out for quality – the highest possible quality – products from a high-quality environment.
A high proportion of Austrian agriculture is organic – organic farms accounting for 11.2% of the total – and we are very pleased about that.
The total organic food turnover in Austria amounts to some EUR 450 million per annum.
Confidence in organic products can be maintained only if stringent checks are carried out in all areas, in other words on all products, whether originating from the EU or from third countries.
Only then is there any guarantee that consumers will be willing to pay the higher prices demanded for these products.
