â€“ Mr President, immigration goes on whether we want it to or not; the only thing that matters is how we handle it.
Europe needs immigrants, and the idea of Europe as a fortress with wealth within and poverty without is unsustainable.
This proposal may well be well-intentioned, but it is nevertheless not a good one; it is a party-political compromise lacking sufficient vision.
The current practice of sending foreigners back from southern Europe and northern Africa is brutal, inhumane and ethically indefensible; we have forgotten how to act in accordance with the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity.
Our approach to human rights is highly hypocritical, and we are disregarding the Geneva Convention on Refugees.
