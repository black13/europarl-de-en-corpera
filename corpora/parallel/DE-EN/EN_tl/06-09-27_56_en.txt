– Mr President, migration into Europe, whether by legal or illegal means, is a Community task In an age of open borders, problems with immigration can no longer be dealt with by nation-states acting on their own; there is a shared responsibility that no Member State – not even Germany – can wriggle out of.
Looking forward to the German Council Presidency, one thing is clear, namely that we cannot act as if legal and illegal immigration were absolutely unconnected, for the opposite is the case; each is conditional upon the other.
The fact is that migration is a complex phenomenon and is as old as the human race itself; deportations and border guards will be ineffective in dealing with it.
That is why the Council of the European Union must at length face up to this problem, not only in Europe’s interests, but also and above all in the interests of the desperate people who go in search of what they are told will be a better future only, alas, often to lose their lives in the attempt.
The utterances that Mr Beckstein of the Bavarian CSU came out with in Tampere are shameful to say the least, and reveal once more what this man and substantial elements in his party actually believe.
