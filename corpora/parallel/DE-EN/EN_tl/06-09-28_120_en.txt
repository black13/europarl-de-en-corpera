â€“ Mr President, it is not even 4 p.m. and this week's topical and urgent debate, which would only have lasted an hour, has been cancelled.
In other words, we would have been finished at 5 p.m.
There were important matters to discuss, such as the coup in Thailand and the situation in Moldova, but the Conference of Presidents arbitrarily decided that there would be no topical and urgent debate.
I should like once again, at the close of the sitting, to protest strongly against this.
We were told that this was the second sitting in September, but that is incorrect: we held the August plenary session at the beginning of September, and this is now the September plenary session, so to speak.
As such, it is our right to hold a topical and urgent debate at each regular sitting in Strasbourg.
I would ask to you pass this protest on to the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents.
