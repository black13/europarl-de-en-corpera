I voted in favour of Mr Karim's report on the EU's economic and trade relations with India.
As I see it, the very important social aspects have been included, and there is also a focus on the social chasm between rich and poor, and between the south and west and the north and east.
I should particularly like to emphasise the importance of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for all Indian workers.
Although the report calls on foreign investors to discharge their political responsibilities, by applying the International Labour Organization's core labour standards, I should like to stress that this should, of course, also apply to Indian employers, in order to create consistent structures within India so that inequalities can be addressed and work quality can be improved.
