Mr President, we are, in principle, happy with these alterations, and particularly happy that Mr Solana has found ways and means of getting here.
We are, however, very far from happy with the fact that the Council's willingness to agree to be present only to a very limited extent means that a great deal of today's agenda has had to be put off to another day.
Although this also happened under the Austrian Presidency, we did manage to come to an arrangement.
I ask that the Presidencies of the Council be reminded that a provisional agenda is not final, and that it can of course happen - as it has on this occasion - that we have to respond to events as they happen.
I would also ask the governments of which the Council is composed to ensure that they are able to be present for the sittings in Brussels at least until the evening.
That is absolutely vital, for if they cannot, we cannot get through all the things that are - and indeed have to be - on the agenda.
I would ask that this be communicated to the Council and that it be urged to be more visibly and more frequently present in this House.
(Applause)
