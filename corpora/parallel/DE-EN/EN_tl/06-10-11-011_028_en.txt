Mr President, we have no objection to a change of title, nor, indeed, to a resolution, but we do think it premature to adopt a resolution within the space of a day before matters have been clarified, so I would ask that consideration be given to such a resolution being adopted at the next plenary session, when there will be a sound basis for it.
We will of course be stating our own position on it, and by then we will have more detailed information.
For that reason, then, I would keep the two separate.
