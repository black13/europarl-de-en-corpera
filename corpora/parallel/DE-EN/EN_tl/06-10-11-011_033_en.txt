Mr President, it sometimes happens that unfortunate events make things take a turn that we would not have wished.
One example is this sad case of the murder of a journalist, which we will be debating.
This sad murder is not something about which we should be at odds with each other.
We will have the debate, but I would echo what Mr Cohn-Bendit said and recommend that we agree to wait until the next part-session before adopting a resolution; that will be a fitting response to this sad event.
