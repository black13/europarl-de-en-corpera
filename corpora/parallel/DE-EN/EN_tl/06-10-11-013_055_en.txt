Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enough has been said about North Korea, but too little, I think, about how it can be an object lesson for us in Europe and for the world at large.
When North Korea, in 1962, embarked on its nuclear programme, it was of course described as 'civil', with talk of 'atoms for peace', 'we do not want bombs' and 'we do not want weapons'.
Not long afterwards, just as also happened with many other countries, it came to be suspected that this was not the case.
When Pyongyang, in 2003, after a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing, admitted that it was reprocessing for military purposes, it was established that what was described as a civil nuclear programme was being misused for military ends.
In 2005, it was reported from Pyongyang that the country was in possession of nuclear weapons, and the test was carried out at the beginning of this week.
The only thing I can say right now is that all those who argue in favour of more widespread civil use of nuclear energy are, at the same time, ensuring that it is also used for military purposes, and repeatedly paving the way for, among other things, the war in Iraq, which was claimed to be justified by the suspicion of misuse.
And what was the background to that?
The stuff had been exported to Iraq - for civilian purposes - from Europe.
Why, then, does Iran possess the technology, allegedly for civilian use?
There are those who represent Europe and claim that new reactor technologies could make it possible to clamp down on the military use of nuclear energy: they are lying, they know they are lying, and they should desist from further undermining the Non-Proliferation Treaty by making civil atomic technology more widely available.
