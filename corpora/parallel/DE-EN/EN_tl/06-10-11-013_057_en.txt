Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, by carrying out this test, North Korea has demonstrated that it cares not a whit for the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty; its political leadership has thereby presented the international community with a serious and deliberate provocation, quite heedless of the fact that it would, by carrying out this test, be imperilling the peace and security of the region and of regions beyond it, and, finally, accepting the possibility of a new nuclear arms race being triggered within and beyond Asia.
It has also - and without any regard for its own people - taken on board the inevitability of the country being completely isolated.
We in this European Parliament must make our position abundantly and forcefully clear.
We must denounce in the most vigorous terms the carrying-out of this test; we must call upon North Korea's political leadership to return to the negotiating table in order to discuss the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in order to resume the six-country talks, and, ultimately, to bring about a peaceful solution to this temporary crisis.
This House must also call upon the international community and the Security Council to respond with greater firmness than they have to date.
It is quite simply unacceptable that the government of North Korea should use its own money and money sent to it from elsewhere to develop nuclear weapons at the same time as it relies on the world community to supply its starving population with food.
Further to what you said earlier, Mr President, I ask you to put out a written statement setting out this House's protest to the government of North Korea, to the international community, and to the Security Council, along with the demands that it makes of them.
We cannot accept that a second test should be carried out, thereby repeating something that was deserving of the most forthright condemnation the first time it occurred.
