Mr President, further to Mr Brok's statement, in which he implied that I had laid responsibility for North Korea's nuclear test at the door of the USA, any such insinuation is utterly false.
On the contrary, the issue - and Mrs Napoletano raised something similar - of those governments - the USA, but also, and to an increasing degree, the EU, among them - that believe they have to use nuclear weapons to defend themselves against attack is something that calls for serious discussion in this House.
For that reason, Mr Brok is quite wrong to make that insinuation.
Atomic warfare is threatened not only by the USA, but also by Jacques Chirac, and that is why this issue has to receive serious consideration, and why Mr Brok is wrong to imply what he did.
