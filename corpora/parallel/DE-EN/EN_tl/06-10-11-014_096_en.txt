Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find today's debate on the one hand a sobering experience, but am also, on the other, refreshed and reinvigorated by it.
Many of those who have spoken in it have put forward factual analyses, have set the right goals and have told hard-hitting truths, but what comes next?
What action shall we now take?
Confidence is built not by analysis on its own, but only by action.
There are three messages I want to give the President of the Council to take with him to the Summit.
The first is that, if he has listened to us, he will have heard us telling him not to treat his talks with Vladimir Putin as just 'business as usual', not to reduce the summit to a meeting about energy policy, but instead, also to talk about all the things that have been mentioned today.
Secondly, we urge him to put before us a timetable detailing when we can expect to have the EU internal market in energy of which President Barroso spoke, and thirdly, we want him to give us a timetable for when the European Union will become a research area.
Turning to energy policy, the partnership with Russia is only a part of the energy policy that Europe needs.
Our priority is greater independence where energy is concerned.
We favour above all the prioritisation of research on the reduction of energy consumption and the creation of sources of renewable energy, and that is our great contribution to more innovation.
We urge you to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in innovation and enable their representatives to take part in the tripartite dialogue.
Do not forgot how this year started with the reduction of gas supplies to Ukraine, nor that the most recent major event in Russia was the murder of a critical journalist, which attracted far more public attention than the many similar murders that preceded it.
