Mr President, I must admit that I see some aspects quite differently from the previous speaker, but Mr Cashman and I have a relationship of friendly disagreement, and it actually works quite well.
Nonetheless, I think it most regrettable that the Council is no longer present, as it is clear from the speech on its behalf that neither was it present at the negotiations nor does it know the substance of this agreement.
It is not possible to speak of any gain in data protection if we have adopted the same amount in this regard as before, namely nothing - as twice nothing is still nothing.
We still do not know where the data retrieved will end up.
We do not know which authority in the United States has access to them, and thus where they will be stored in the end, let alone where they will be transmitted.
We do not know when they will be deleted.
European citizens are not entitled to enquire where these data are.
They are not entitled to require that the data be corrected.
It is not true, therefore, that we have achieved more in essence.
I am not accusing the Commissioner personally, as I know the pressure the United States has exerted, but I should have liked us to have put up more resistance to this pressure and, for example, taken up my colleague Mr Cavada's suggestion in saying that, if the US expects data from us, it has to hand its own over too.
Who says there cannot be any threat to the EU from the USA?
Who says that we do not also have the right to learn who is travelling into our territory?
We must be able to pay the US back in the same coin in this case instead of just yielding to its pressure.
