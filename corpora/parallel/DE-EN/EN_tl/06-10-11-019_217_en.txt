Mr President, I should like to express my respect to Mrs Jeggle for her work.
It was not a straightforward job, and there are still some inconsistencies to be found, but, on the whole, the line it takes is the right one - Mrs Jeggle is not to blame for the inconsistencies.
I agree with her that our high animal-protection standards must be an example to the world.
This is particularly applicable since we have not made a particularly good impression as a cultural area in recent years.
I am thinking here of BSE, of dioxins, of the culls as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, of the millions of animals destroyed and burned on pyres - that was not a glorious chapter to show the world.
For this reason, it is important that we adopt a new line in this regard.
There is also a sales argument that needs to be taken into account when dealing directly with consumers.
If there is someone who objects to chickens being kept in cages, you can say anything you like, but what he wants is a free-range egg - he has no appetite for the alternative when he thinks about the chicken.
There must be market orientation according to considerations of animal protection, therefore; but we must also realise that animal protection entails costs.
When we are dealing with anonymous markets - which is usually the case with imports from third countries - we must have qualified external protection to ensure that our standards are not circumvented, because this will be expressed in the price.
I would say to Mrs Jeggle that the same applies within Europe, of course.
If we do not ensure the implementation of animal protection standards in production, distortions of competition will occur within Europe, too.
Consequently, we must consider including animal protection in cross-compliance, so that there are disincentives for businesses to violate animal protection standards in the form of not only certain penalties, but also financial losses - for example, deductions from premiums.
