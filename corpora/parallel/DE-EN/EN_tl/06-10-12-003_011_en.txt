draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, let me remind the House that the origins of today's debate can be traced back to a Council decision of December 2004.
It is because of that that we are discussing the Agency for Fundamental Rights today, so the Council cannot slink out of the back door to escape a debate on the subject, acting all the while as if Members of this House had gone mad with desire for European bureaucracy and as if this had nothing do with what matters to the people of the European Union.
It also needs to be stressed that the Fundamental Rights Agency is something about which Parliament is engaged in talks with both the Commission and the Council, and in these we have endeavoured to get the agency a clearly delineated mandate.
I would like again to highlight what this is all about.
Nobody here in this House wants to see operational structures duplicated, and we have all reached a compromise to the effect that the agency's mandate should require it to concentrate on the protection of fundamental rights in the Member States, in candidate countries, and, finally, in countries with which we have stabilisation and association agreements.
Appropriate arrangements have been made for consultation with the Member States.
What I would like again to make clear is that the draft we have produced takes proper account of the interests of the Council of Europe.
I would like, finally, to avail myself of this opportunity to thank Mrs Gál and Mrs Kovács once more for the work they have done.
Now it is the Council's turn to do something.
