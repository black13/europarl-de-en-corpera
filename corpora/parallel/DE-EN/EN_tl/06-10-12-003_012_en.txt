draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, which always means that one has to concentrate more on money than on what a report is actually about, and so that - rather than the report's subject-matter, about which Members have already said everything that needs to be said - is what my opinion is about.
We do indeed have a problem with the funding for the European Union's Agency for Fundamental Rights, which will be a whole new agency, similar to the Chemicals Agency or the Institute for Gender Equality, and will be in place from 2007 onwards, provided that it is agreed to by the time we assume it will be.
Now we all know that the Council and Parliament agreed, in paragraph 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May of this year and relating to budgetary discipline and sound financial management agreed by them and the Commission, that the Council and Parliament would be required to discuss the funding arrangements of the new agencies and then come to an agreement on them.
As long ago as this July, before the summer recess, the Budget Committee invited the Council to enter negotiations with us - we did so, indeed, on repeated occasions.
Since the Council has not, as yet, responded to our invitation, the Committee on Budgets has now, in the course of its deliberations on the coming financial year, renamed the budget line to which the Commission had appended the description 'Human Rights Agency' as the budget line for the 'European Union's Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia' and created a new one with the annotation 'for information'.
We hope that we will soon have a legal basis and will then be able to come to an agreement with the Council as to how the new agency should be funded.
