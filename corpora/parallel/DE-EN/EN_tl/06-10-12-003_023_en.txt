Mr President, let me make it perfectly clear, for Mrs Roure's benefit, that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats certainly does value and endorse the work Mrs Gál has done, and she is well aware of that fact, so nothing has changed in that respect.
We have an equally high regard for the work the Commissioner is doing, but, as I said at the very outset, we do have to do some fundamental and general thinking about agencies.
We see human rights as indivisible; compliance with them is not merely optional.
In my view, it goes without saying that they must be complied with within the European Union and in the states that are set to accede to it.
That is why some fundamental thinking about agencies and the shape they take is to be recommended.
I am right behind Mrs Gál and the Commissioner, but all my other remarks still stand - and underlined several times over.
