Mr President, Mr Goebbels, we made it quite plain at the Conference of Presidents that we are very definitely in favour of this issue being discussed, but not during this part-session, since we have already had to move Question Time around within the agenda for lack of sufficient time with the Council.
We will certainly back the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - or whoever it is who ends up asking for a debate - in getting this problem put on the agenda at a proper time.
We are well aware of the problem, but our position is that it does not need to be debated this week.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
