Mr President, I wish to inform the House that the Ethiopian authorities, last Thursday, expelled two diplomats belonging to the EU delegation.
This is in connection with the arrest of Yalemzewd Bekele, an Ethiopian member of the delegation's staff, who is accused by the authorities of active opposition to the Ethiopian Government, and who had therefore attempted to flee to Kenya.
A fortnight ago, in Addis Ababa, Glenys Kinnock and I met the two diplomats and Mrs Bekele, who is currently held in the Moyale prison, and we entertain the gravest concerns about the treatment she is receiving there.
This case has also been brought to the attention of the UN's special rapporteur on torture.
I urge the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to take seriously its duty of care as an employer and provide Mrs Bekele with legal counsel.
The troika should also travel from Addis Ababa to Moyale, assure themselves that Mrs Bekele is physically unharmed, and demand of the Ethiopian authorities that they clarify the accusations they are levelling against her.
Our President should also write a letter to his Ethiopian counterpart.
