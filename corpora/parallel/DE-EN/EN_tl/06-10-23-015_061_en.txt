Mr President, I would like to draw the House's attention to an occurrence several days ago involving Polish border guards and a German cruise ship, the Adler Dania, which entered the Polish port of Swinem√ºnde, whereupon three Polish customs officers, in civilian clothing and without any written authorisation, sought to confiscate all the vessel's stocks of spirits.
The captain responded to this by turning the vessel round and speeding back to Germany, with a Polish border protection force speedboat in hot pursuit and, moreover, firing off signal flares in the Adler Dania's direction.
It defies belief that this sort of thing can happen, but it appears from the letters I have received from those with personal experience of these things that this is not, regrettably, an isolated incident.
There are recurrent problems at the borders within Europe with many new Member States and also with other neighbouring countries, involving such things as the arbitrary levying of charges and attempts at coercing travellers into paying them or else being denied entry to the country they wish to enter.
I demand that action be taken to deal with this.
