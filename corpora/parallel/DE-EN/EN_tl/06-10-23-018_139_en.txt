Mr President, it is evident that many regard the squandering of EU funds as a minor offence, for there seems to be no other explanation for the fact that, over the past thirty years or so, irregular payments were made amounting to EUR 3.1 billion, only 17% of which has been recovered.
Inadequate monitoring procedures and non-compliance with EU rules and regulations appear to be the order of the day.
It is bad enough that billions of euros in EU funds should disappear into fictitious accounts, but when, even in the rare cases where irregular payments are brought to light, the recovery of them is bungled or proceeded with so slowly that the culprits go to ground and the money disappears, it becomes clear that the European Union is suffering from something very like organised negligence.
It is intolerable that there should be repeated instances of the negligent use of EU funds - and, moreover, in the same Member States - without someone having to take the consequences.
Where Member States fail to do everything possible to recover missing funds within a maximum of two years, I believe that those Member States should themselves make good the loss.
