Mr President, Commissioner, the number of globally-active enterprises is on the increase; their need for comparable and globally recognised group accounts in order to gain access to international capital markets has been an agent of change in accountancy at the international level, and the headlong progress of globalisation is making the harmonisation of accounting procedures across borders a matter of positive necessity.
The adoption of the International Accounting Standards Regulation was an important milestone in the creation of an integrated single financial market and in the harmonisation of accountancy in Europe.
A developed capital market puts national economies in a better competitive position, and studies have demonstrated that Member States with a high degree of share capitalisation and high stock exchange turnovers relative to their gross domestic product also achieve more growth and create more jobs.
That being so, it is certainly desirable that the IFRS and American GAAP accounting regulations, together with the accounting principles generally accepted in third countries, should be made more closely approximate as an essential contribution to the development of standardised and internationally recognised accounting standards and hence to the integration of capital markets.
Rather than aiming simply to do away with the existing difference in the accounting systems of the United States, Canada or Japan, the primary object of convergence must be the creation of high-quality accounting standards, which alone will be of lasting value and meet with unconditional acceptance.
It is of vital importance to European businesses that the SEC, the USA's stock exchange supervisory body, should recognise year-end accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The one-sidedness in the recognition of accounting standards should become a thing of the past by January 2009 at the latest; that is the only way in which European businesses will become more competitive.
