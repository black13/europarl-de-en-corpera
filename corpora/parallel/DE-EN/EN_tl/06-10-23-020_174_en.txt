Mr President, Commissioner, you have now often enough heard it said that all of us are opposed to this European programme being handed back to the Member States.
It should remain European.
Here in this House, we talk about environmental programmes and how to fund them, but we should consider well the way in which we do this.
It is not acceptable that the habitat programme or the Birds Directive should be used in the Member States to do things that actually go against this House's normal understanding of things.
Environmental policy should indeed be treated as having the value it does, but frogs are not meant to enjoy more protection than do human beings, and one function of the Commission and of its offices is to maintain the proper sense of proportion in this respect.
What matters is that we, here in this House, should join with you in the Commission in putting into effect programmes that add European value.
This must not be about a mere transfer of funds, that is to say giving Member States back their money and leaving it to them what becomes of it.
Nor is it acceptable that these funds should be used to finance NGOs with whose background and connections we are not familiar.
We must, then, take care that European taxpayers' money is used properly.
