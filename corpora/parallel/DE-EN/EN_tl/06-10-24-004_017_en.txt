on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, there are a number of red threads running through history, and it is one of those red threads that we are taking hold of here.
It started on 17 June 1953 in Germany, then ran through Poland and Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, until Communism was finally defeated.
The Hungarian uprising was an uprising for democracy; it was a national uprising, but also a political one.
I would remind you of the Pet≈ëfi group - the Hungarian intellectuals who founded the Workers' Councils together with the workers, first in Budapest and then throughout Hungary.
They had the hope to try to reinvent democracy.
That is what happened in Hungary in 1956.
As we remember this uprising now, 50 years on, we can also add to that memory another one, namely the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hannah Arendt.
She was one of those intellectuals who had the courage to name two totalitarian regimes in a single breath - communism and fascism.
This is precisely what history teaches us: we have never had a permanent hold on democracy.
We will only keep hold of it if we fight for it every day.
Poland and Hungary are showing us that today, as are the dangerous developments in France, where there are fascist, far-right forces at work.
We must continue to stand up and fight for democracy.
The people of Hungary and Poland 50 years ago and those of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and also the people in this country who fought against fascism, have shown us that it is sometimes necessary to give one's life for democracy and freedom.
We should take this lesson to heart, and not be afraid to say that totalitarianism - whether fascist or communist - is and always will be totalitarianism.
(Applause)
