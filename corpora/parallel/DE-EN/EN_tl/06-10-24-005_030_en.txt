author. - Madam President, I am grateful to you, Mrs Jöns, for allowing me to co-author this question with you.
I was delighted to do so, because I was struck during the debate by just how little I had heard on this topic up until now.
As I followed the debate, I thought about how faint-hearted we really are in Europe, how stupidly we have acted in the past, and how many questions we have left open for this continent.
I will try to add my political weight to the balance in this matter, because in terms of content I have nothing to add to what Mrs Jöns and others have said.
I call on both Commissioners to summon up all their courage to deal with this topic, and to combat the faint-heartedness of the Council.
The Council has often - and I have experienced this all too often - weakly said: that is subsidiarity, a national matter.
Information and communication are the main tasks for the future, including with regard to this terrible disease, and I would therefore ask both Commissioners to exert all their political influence to convince the Council and to establish guidelines.
Just think about it for a minute: we even have guidelines for drawing up guidelines, but we do not have any guidelines on how we should combat breast cancer, the most important disease on this continent, in the future.
I think the idea of developing a job description for highly qualified nurses is an excellent and interesting one, and I pledge you my full support.
(Applause)
