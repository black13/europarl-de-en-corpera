on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, we have before us an excellent motion for resolution, which talks a great deal about better prevention and treatment for breast cancer.
As several of you have already pointed out, it submits proposals for, for example, better screening.
Quite right too, and we should build on that.
However, I would like to stress once again that it is also a matter of prevention.
It is an old wives' tale that genetic factors and lifestyle are the only causes of this illness.
New studies have confirmed that harmful environmental factors in the form of toxic chemicals or increased radiation are responsible for half of all cases of breast cancer.
That is something to which we must pay attention.
Alongside comprehensive research into the causes, health protection must be at the forefront of European chemicals legislation.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we initiated a move towards greater health and environmental protection in Europe.
However, today's vote on breast cancer also provides clear support for a strong REACH, because it is clear that the changes in women's hormonal systems make them particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of chemicals.
Studies from the USA show that female farmers who use certain pesticides on their fields are more prone to breast cancer.
Women who live within a mile of a special waste site for herbicides and pesticides are also at greater risk, and we know that many of the softening agents previously used in cosmetics contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells.
Prevention should have an even higher priority in our fight against breast cancer.
