Madam President, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations and thanks to Mrs JÃ¶ns, who is not only the main initiator of today's motion for resolution and of the question, but also works tirelessly to raise awareness of the issue of breast cancer.
That of course means that there will be huge support for this motion for resolution tomorrow.
Breast cancer is the number one cause of death amongst women aged between 35 and 59, amongst both mothers and women without children.
Every year, 88 000 women and 1 000 men in the European Union die of breast cancer.
Breast screening can considerably reduce mortality from breast cancer amongst women aged between 50 and 69.
There have been EU guidelines on this subject since 1992, but so far they have been implemented in only 11 Member States, and there are huge differences in women's mortality rates.
That is why we are eagerly awaiting the progress report that Commissioner Kyprianou announced for 2007.
However, today the European Parliament is not just discussing the early detection of breast cancer and the best way to treat it, but also prevention.
The causes of breast cancer need to be investigated in more detail, in particular the role of toxic chemicals, environmental pollution, diet, lifestyle and genetic factors, and also the question of how these factors interact.
In a few weeks, when Parliament votes on the new European chemicals policy, we will have an opportunity to send a clear signal that we take the prevention of cancer seriously.
