on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start with warm thanks to Mrs Hieronymi for her work and to Commissioner Reding for her good cooperation.
What our media policy is in fact about is the further development of the specific aesthetic language of European films.
At the heart of our cultural self-image is the desire to fight against Hollywood's dominance, to show our own films, characterised as they are by European diversity, and to facilitate their production and distribution.
Although we know that the audio-visual industry is also of enormous importance in terms of the Lisbon Strategy and of Europe's economic development, this is not just about the economy; it is also, in a profound sense, about cultural policy and about cultural identity and cultural diversity.
I agree with the previous speakers who have highlighted under-capitalisation and the need for a rapid start to be made, and for our media programme to be better funded.
