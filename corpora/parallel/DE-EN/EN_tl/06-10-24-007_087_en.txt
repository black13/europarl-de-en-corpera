on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking Mr Gra√ßa Moura for his work on this important aspect of our European policy.
People like to quote, whenever we discuss the significance of cultural policy for Europe, the saying to the effect that 'You do not fall in love with the internal market', for Europe adds up to more than just the internal market, even though it is something we cannot do without.
Europe has a great deal to do with the cultural identity and our cultural riches, which we want to preserve and develop.
Culture can divide people from one another, particularly when it emphasises differences, but our cultural policy is aimed at bringing the people of Europe together through culture, establishing contacts between them, making it possible for them to establish contact with, and feel a sense of belonging in, the world, indeed, with different, and in diverse, worlds.
The smoothing away of differences is not something that we should be in fear of; it is something to be encouraged, something that is at the heart of our European cultural policy.
That is why the three objectives - the encouragement of cultural exchange, the mobility of artists and cultural dialogue - are the right ones, but the amount of money voted earlier will not enable them to be achieved.
If we want to do more for Europe on the cultural front, we will have to muster the courage to set a bigger cultural budget over the coming years.
