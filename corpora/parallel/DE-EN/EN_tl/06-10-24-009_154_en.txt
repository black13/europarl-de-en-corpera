Mr President, speaking also on behalf of the Austrian People's Party delegation, let me say that there are several reasons why I voted against this report.
One is the demand contained in it for persons who have entered the European Union illegally to be accorded equal rights with - or, indeed, more rights than - legal immigrants as regards such things as the right to accommodation, family benefits, health care and access to educational institutions.
The report also presses for new grounds for the grant of asylum, for example to a person who has been forced into marriage or has agreed to what is termed an arranged marriage.
Giving in to these demands will do nothing to solve problems, but will instead create new ones, for measures like these do in fact exert a suction effect, attracting even more illegal immigrants.
