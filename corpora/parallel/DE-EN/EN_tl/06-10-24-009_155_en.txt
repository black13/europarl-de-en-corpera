Mr President, I, too, voted against the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report, and I shall now proceed to explain why.
If one is talking solely in terms of women who have migrated legally, then one must certainly help them to become familiar with our system of standards and values, to become integrated and also to help their families to do so.
It is particularly when one comes to the second or third generation of immigrants that conflicts can arise, which - as we have had to learn from the French experience - can result in acts of violence that may even be unavoidable.
We must, however, come what may, prevent culturally and religiously motivated problems such as forced marriages, honour killings and genital mutilation from occurring in the first place.
Family reunifications involving second, third or fourth wives - which go against the prohibition, customary in Europe, of bigamy - must be brought to an end without delay.
It is because the report makes no such requirement that I have voted against it.
