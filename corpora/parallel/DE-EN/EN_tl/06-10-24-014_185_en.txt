draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, perhaps I might be permitted to start by congratulating my colleague Mr Elles on his strategic thinking, particularly with regard to China and India.
This is a new thing and something we should take very seriously.
We in the Committee on Development have managed to get the funds from the preliminary draft budget reinstated, to keep the budget transparent, and to produce a report that is already in line with our colleague Mr Mitchell's on development cooperation instruments, but I have nevertheless tabled two amendments in the plenary, which were not, however, adopted by the Committee on Budgets.
One of these was Amendment 250, which was intended to set up a pilot project for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, which were, I would remind the House, the subject of a report we adopted earlier this year.
If we want to build up the self-employed and small business sector in developing countries, we need to give SMEs an enhanced role.
It really would be vexatious if we were to fail to put in place a pilot project that underlined our own call for stronger SMEs in developing countries.
The other amendment to which I referred was Amendment 253, which has to do with exchanges with other parliaments.
It refers to our own House's Budget and to the possibility of maintaining links with other legislatures, such as the Pan-African Parliament or the Parliament of Afghanistan, which would enable this House to have a real and positive influence on the democratisation process around the world, and so I urge you, on Thursday, to vote to adopt this amendment too.
