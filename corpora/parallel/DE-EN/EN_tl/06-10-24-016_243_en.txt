Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I am glad that the number of complaints appears to be relatively low, but I have myself had the experience - for we are relatively frequent flyers - of the last three flights I was on being overbooked.
I would now be interested to know whether this is a more frequent occurrence on any airlines in particular.
Can it be said that there are certain airlines that make overbooking a matter of professional practice?
Might it not, under certain circumstances, be possible to consider taking action - quite apart from proceedings for breach of contract - against these companies, not only in order to obtain compensation, but against those companies themselves.
What is the likelihood of an improved public relations effort to make passengers aware of the possibility of compensation payments?
(The President cut off the speaker)
