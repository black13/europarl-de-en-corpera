Mr President, fair trade is an issue not only in textiles, but also in energy.
Russia's energy-intensive industries are currently being supplied with oil at 8 dollars per barrel, and gas is available at a very competitive price.
With this in mind, how do you rate the chances for survival of our own energy-intensive industries, and what effect do you think this will have on Russia's accession to the WTO?
