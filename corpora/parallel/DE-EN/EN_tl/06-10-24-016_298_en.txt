Mr President, there are two more, and quite specific, items of information that I would welcome.
The first is that I should like to know whether the Commission, when a Member State such as Sweden, without any arrangement being made for it in the Treaties, fails, for a period of years, to introduce the euro, will take legal action against it by, for example, taking it to the ECJ, or whether it will let the matter rest for another twenty years.
Secondly, I would like to know what is happening about Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.
Is there any sign of any of them - Hungary in particular - actually doing anything?
