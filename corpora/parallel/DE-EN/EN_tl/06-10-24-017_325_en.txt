on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Gr√∂ner for the work she has done on this report.
All of us are convinced that Europe is meant to be an opportunity for young people to be able to move around freely within it, broadening their horizons and learning several languages, improving their education and training and, all in all, becoming trustworthy and responsible people in an open European society.
It is, of course, also important that Europe should gain acceptance among young people.
We need to remind ourselves that it will be the young people who will build Europe up and ensure its future development, in other words that what matters above all is that they should find out for themselves what they want Europe to become in future.
This task of improving opportunities for young people will not be capable of being performed in isolation from other policy areas, among which economic policy is quite central, as also are educational and social policy, together with the Lisbon Strategy issues to which reference has just been made.
I would very much like to see us taking this policy area seriously rather than neglecting it, for young people are the key to Europe's future.
