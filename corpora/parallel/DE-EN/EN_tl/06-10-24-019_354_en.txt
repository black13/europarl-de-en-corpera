Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for this very fine report on 'Europe for Citizens'.
Now that the overall amount has been reduced to EUR 190 million from the EUR 235 million that this House and the Commission originally agreed on, that is the amount with which, for lack of any understanding on the Council's part, we are obliged to manage.
We support the rapporteur's two amendments, one of which aims for a 2% decrease, and the other at an increase by the same amount.
We are particularly glad to see that the new Action 4, which has to do with memorials, keeps alive the memory not only of the crimes committed by the Nazi regime but also of those committed under Stalin.
I would, however, Commissioner, like to address one other problem, one that has been raised by those who benefit from the programmes and by those who run them.
This House wishes to point out that its resolution of 5 April 2006 referred to both conferences and seminars, and the bilateral seminars - working parties and meetings of experts - are essential components of the partnership effort in terms of qualifying the programmes and those who work on them, and grants should be available for them in the same way that they are for multilateral conferences.
Furthermore, this House takes it as read that the Commission will, in the course of the applications procedure, accord equal treatment to local authorities and civil society organisations, and the object of that is that the Commission should be prevented from doing as had originally been planned and imposing additional requirements - such as guarantees and special bank sureties - on too many other social organisations, which they would find it difficult, indeed impossible, to meet.
