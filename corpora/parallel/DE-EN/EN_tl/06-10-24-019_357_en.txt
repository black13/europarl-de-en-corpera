on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I, too, should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Takkula.
I am delighted that there has been a rethink in the naming of the programme, originally called 'Citizens for Europe', and that it is now called 'Europe for Citizens'.
This means that the onus is on Europe, too, and that it must reach out to the public.
The aim is to reach and involve citizens, to meet them locally, to take them seriously, to listen to their concerns and to win them over to Europe and the debate on its future.
Town-twinning activities are a good means of contributing to this.
A general discussion on European globalisation blues will also form part of the debates within this programme, however, as will the question as to how we can strike a balance between excessive neoliberalism on the one hand, and statism or excessive protectionism on the other.
I should like to mention a further point, namely the inclusion of extermination camps - be they Stalinist or Nazi - in this programme.
I believe that a further reappraisal of the history of this particular European totalitarianism, which destroyed Europe and brought great unhappiness to the whole world, is politically appropriate.
Learning the appropriate lessons from this and building a genuinely open and democratic Europe remains one of our challenges for the future.
The programme is also intended to make a contribution to this.
