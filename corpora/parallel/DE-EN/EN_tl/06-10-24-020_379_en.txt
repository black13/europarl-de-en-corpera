Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to Mr Schlyter for his report, which shows great commitment.
PFOS, a halogenated hydrocarbon, is toxic to humans, and also both carcinogenic and mutagenic.
There are no scientific limit values for this category of substances, only empirical threshold values.
These substances are not biodegradable, they are fat soluble and, once produced, they persist almost indefinitely.
In addition, once they have been absorbed by the human body, it is virtually impossible for it to eliminate them.
It is highly likely that PFOA has a very similar or identical effect in medical and toxicological terms, even though the body of scientific data on this does not yet have any conclusive evidential value.
REACH will probably apply to this, and the substitution principle will play a decisive role, although, personally, I always have reservations about this.
For all my enthusiasm for the economy and for value added, as a Christian I do not want to balance value added against human life.
I am alarmed by the values of these chemicals measured in both marine and freshwater fish.
Now - rightly and with a clear conscience - we are going further than the original proposal of the Commission and the Council.
The threshold value has been lowered massively by almost two powers of ten.
The number of derogations for chromium plating has been reduced significantly.
Logically, the derogation for fire-fighting foams has been deleted, as unlimited quantities of these can be released into the environment.
The derogation for closed systems has been deleted, as it is scarcely possible to prove that these are sealed.
On the whole, I should like to express my thanks for the constructive cooperation I have enjoyed, and above all for the speed at which this issue has been dealt with, since we were able to reach a workable compromise in less than three months.
