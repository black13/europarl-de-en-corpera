Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Muscardini on this successful report.
Freedom of access to foreign markets is vital to large numbers of European enterprises.
This freedom of access does not exist in many cases today, with third countries hindering European enterprises' market access in downright breach of agreements or in contravention of the WTO rules.
In so doing, these third countries exploit the whole spectrum of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade skilfully to their advantage and our disadvantage.
The competitiveness of the European economy, and thus of the EU labour market, suffers tremendously as a result of these problems.
These actions on the part of some of our trade partners are unacceptable.
Commissioner, the EU cannot allow other countries to treat us like this.
All participants in world trade must abide by the rules.
It also applies that the EU should not treat third countries like this.
We, too, must abide by all the rules in order to take credible action against rule-breakers without any open flanks.
Fair, free world trade is possible only if rules are in place that are binding and are observed by all parties without exception.
What is to be done, therefore?
I would call on the Commission to do everything possible to ensure that we Europeans abide by the rules.
I call on the Commission to take measures to protect our enterprises if it is established that individual trade partners have failed to abide by the rules.
I call on the Commission to make consistent use of the existing - or even an improved - dispute-settlement procedure here if, in specific cases, no amicable settlement has been reached in the short term.
We must focus our future efforts on ensuring that all trade partners abide by the rules.
Only if all parties, without exception, abide by the rules, can people draw long-term benefit from world trade.
