Mr President, it may be difficult to combine European energy security with our fundamental European values, but are we willing to fail because of that?
In Russia, contract killings are as much a part of life as the suppression of non-governmental organisations and the restriction of fundamental democratic rights.
The Yukos case, the detention of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, and the war in Chechnya are still, with regard to energy policy and human rights, current examples of the despotism of Mr Putin's Government.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya once again made it tragically clear that, when it comes to crimes against critical journalists, Russia is second only to Colombia.
Russia is currently standing at a crossroads between small steps towards democracy and authoritarian structures.
Criticism alone is no longer enough: energy policy and human rights must be negotiated jointly, and must not be played off against each other.
According to Mr Putin, there can be no reliable guarantees in energy security.
Despite that, we must ensure reliable guarantees for our European system of values.
