Mr President, it is quite true that we need a partnership with Russia, and it would be nice to have a community of values too, but what is the reality of the situation?
In Russia, the vertical of power is organised down to the last detail, the Duma has been domesticated, governors are appointed, not elected, freedom of the press is restricted, and the work of non-governmental organisations, including political foundations for democracy and human rights, is getting harder and harder.
Therefore, we cannot currently have a community of values with the Russian Government - it might be possible with the Russian people, but they were not in Lahti.
That, Mr Vanhanen, is why Mr Barroso is right when he says that we should agree on specific principles for stable relations: transparency, legal certainty, national treatment, and mutual opening up of and access to markets.
On the basis of these principles, we can build a partnership and cooperation agreement, and also hope for and work towards the conclusion, one day, of a strategic partnership with Russia based on shared values.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
