Mr President, I think you have said all that needs to be said.
The organisation of the agenda, particularly in terms of the order and conduct of votes, is the responsibility of the President.
My impression is that you conducted the votes perfectly properly.
However, my political experience has also taught me one thing - we are all politicians, and that includes you, ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: when no more progress can be made politically, then the agenda has to take the blame.
We know that, but I would ask, Mr President, that we vote now.
(Applause from the left)
