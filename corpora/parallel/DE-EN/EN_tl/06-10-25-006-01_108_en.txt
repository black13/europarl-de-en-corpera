Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of one's opinion on this vote, I have one comment, and I would like the chairmen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to respond to this: what has been said here is a gross impertinence that the whole of Parliament should condemn.
This President was elected by a large majority, and he has the right to lead every vote, whether you like it or not.
Anything else is impertinent and obscene!
(Applause from the left)
