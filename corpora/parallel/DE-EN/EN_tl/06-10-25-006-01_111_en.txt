Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, this morning, in the difficult situation in which we find ourselves, we had a debate that was very definitely worthy of this House.
Now is the time for all of us to take action, and I would like to make it clear that the integrity of the President of this House is not being questioned.
(Applause)
Having said that, I would also ask that we now find a process that will enable us to come to a decision.
It would have been right if the first vote had been by show of hands, since that is the normal way of going about it.
I then assumed you had called an immediate electronic vote on the grounds that you thought the results were so close together, but the normal way of voting would have been by show of hands.
This voting process then had the regrettable result that some Members ended up voting a different way than they had intended.
There is also the question as to whether the common text on which the groups agreed was put together properly and whether translations are available.
Taken together, all this adds up to a whole bundle of problems, and so I would like to appeal to your goodwill in order that we may repeat the votes before moving on to vote on the groups' joint motion for a resolution.
This House will then have spoken, and its political will will then have been made manifest.
I ask you now to show the goodwill of which I have spoken.
(Applause)
