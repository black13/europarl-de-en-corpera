Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the German Free Democratic Party did not participate in the vote on the motion for a resolution.
The motion for a resolution bears the legend 'European Parliament resolution on the peace process in Spain'.
This we regard as a matter to be resolved at the national level, and believe that the European Union should not concern itself with matters over which it has no power and for which it has no responsibility.
We are particularly critical, in this context, of paragraph 3 of the resolution, in which the Council and the Commission are urged to take appropriate action, something that we regard as going against the subsidiarity principle.
It is for this reason that we have refrained from participation in the vote.
