The adoption of the Coelho reports created the legal basis for the practical implementation of the second-generation Schengen Information System.
By means of its new electronic interception network on the new eastern borders, SIS II makes the EU a safer place.
Among the new characteristics of SIS II, its storage capacity has been enlarged to accommodate 27 Member States; it facilitates the storage of biometric data and the European Arrest Warrant, the correlation of data and persons, together with, moreover, the improvement of data protection standards.
SIS II opens up new options for the police and the justice system when it comes to searching for wanted persons and also creates the conditions for the free movement of European citizens in a larger area of freedom, security and justice.
For all these reasons, I have voted in favour of the adoption of Mr Coelho's reports.
