on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, what is required above all else, when the security and stability of a country or region are at issue, is that all the parties concerned, with their various interests, should do nothing that might make the situation worse, and if the Moldovan constitution makes no provision for referendums, it goes without saying that any referendum that actually is carried out cannot be recognised.
That much is abundantly clear.
Since Transnistria has always been a part of the Republic of Moldova, it follows that it is absolutely justified to demand of our Russian partners - with whom relations are far from poor - that their troops should be withdrawn from the region.
If we do not want matters to get worse, it naturally follows that we must promote trade - and with trade, change - rather than imposing bans on exports or imports.
The Commission and the European Union have taken the line that we insist on the 5+2 negotiations being continued in full, or, indeed, on their resumption, and from this line we must not deviate.
Fair partnership - and I am talking here about ours with Russia - also involves being able to tell one's partner, to their face, with what one is happy and with what one is not.
It may well be that, in the past, thinking of certain of the European Union's own interests, we did not always do that with the necessary firmness.
