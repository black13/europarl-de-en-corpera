Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as a member of this House's EU/Moldova group, I would like to return to that problem and make it very plain that this conflict is not about minorities.
The social system in the Republic of Moldova is open both politically and socially, and characterised by co-existence and tolerance.
If conflicts with minorities are advanced as an explanation, then that is done only with the intention of legitimising support for a Stalinist regime, something that is - and I want to impress this on the Russian Government and on President Putin - both politically problematic and highly dubious.
The conflict over Transnistria is a conflict between Russia and the EU.
I do not believe that peace will return to the region unless the troops are withdrawn, and so the Commission and the Council must exert much more pressure on the Russian Government to get it to do precisely that.
The conflict in Moldova must not be sacrificed for the sake of our dealings with Russia over energy.
