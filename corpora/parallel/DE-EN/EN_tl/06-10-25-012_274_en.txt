Mr President, Africa has for decades been undergoing a process of transformation into a hazardous waste dump as a result of the export of toxic laboratory chemicals, solvents, superannuated pesticides and sewage sludge.
There are a few people in Europe and Africa for whom the criminal trade in toxic waste is a very profitable business.
Knowing though we do, that the actions of this Dutch firm in Abidjan were quite manifestly contrary not only to the Basle Convention but also to EU law, we have to ask ourselves how quickly our European institutions can respond if this is not to happen again in future.
We take a favourable view of Commissioner Dimas' announcements, and we hope that this time the Member States and the Council will see how serious the situation is and realise the necessity of taking real action on this front instead of always merely regretting these things after they have occurred.
What is really required of the Member States of the European Union is some evidence of their willingness to do something about them.
