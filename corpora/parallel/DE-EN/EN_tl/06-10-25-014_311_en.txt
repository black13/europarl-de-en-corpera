Madam President, I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that this is a problem not only in Greece, but also in Austria, where it is positively prevalent, and where hotels count it as one of their main selling points that they allow no children, or will not accommodate families with them.
What I would like to know is whether something can be done about this, at any rate as regards advertising.
There are, after all, other areas in which advertising can be restricted, and that might be one possibility.
