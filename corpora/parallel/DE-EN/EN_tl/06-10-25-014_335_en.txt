Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like - in my capacity as rapporteur on the extension of the powers of the European Air Safety Agency - to report to you that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has, with reference to this subject, also discussed the possibility of entrusting the EASA with security functions.
I would be interested to know what the Presidency of the Council thinks about that idea.
Now for my second question.
Something that has struck me personally is that the privatisation of security checks at airports has had the consequence that these are less able to deal with extreme situations than, for example, the police.
Would it not make sense to reverse this privatisation and have security checks carried out once more by state agencies?
