Madam President, my criticism is not directed at you, for I hold the way you run Question Time in high regard, but I really would like you to cast your mind back to Monday, when we determined the order in which business was to be conducted this week.
The Conference of Presidents envisaged that Question Time would last one and a half hours; then the President reduced it to an hour.
Several Members protested at this, and there was no vote on it, and so I have worked on the assumption that we have available to us for Question Time the hour and a half that we are rightly due.
I would like to ask whether the Council might remain for another quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, or is there a trade union for Council presidencies that forbids them from answering questions after seven in the evening?
Questions to the Council used to begin after 9 p.m, and that worked like a dream, with the Council staying until the following day.
To sum up, I think there is something wrong with this way of going about things.
