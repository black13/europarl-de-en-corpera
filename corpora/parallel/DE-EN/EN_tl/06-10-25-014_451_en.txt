Mr Posselt, much as I am delighted by your compliment, you are wrong about our debate on Monday, since it concerned the agenda rather than the Rules of Procedure, and it was the agenda that was the subject of a vote.
You can check that again in the Minutes.
We should all take Question Time seriously - or more seriously than we do - as an important prerogative of Members, and we should all work together to ensure that it is not dropped from the agenda too frequently.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
