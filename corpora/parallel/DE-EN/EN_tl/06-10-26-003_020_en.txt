Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Trichet and his colleagues for their solid cooperation thus far.
The ECB annual report is a very important document for this House.
It forms the basis of the debate on fundamental monetary policy issues.
Not for nothing has the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs taken personal responsibility as rapporteur for this issue.
There is, however, always controversy when we debate appointments to the ECB and the primary task of the Bank.
We have just experienced this once again.
It is therefore no surprise that it was only through innumerable compromise proposals that it was possible to achieve something like a common view in the committee.
Personally speaking, I find it regrettable that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament abstained from the final vote in committee, despite all these compromises.
Their decision shows the difficulties the Socialist Group still has with a handful of points in the report.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supported the independence of the ECB without ifs and buts.
The primary function of the Bank is, and remains, to ensure the stability of the euro.
Thus far, it has performed this job admirably.
We cannot go soft on independence or on price stability under any circumstances.
There must thus continue to be an absence of political pressure in future, and the members of the Executive Board must be chosen purely on the basis of their expertise and not according to nationality.
