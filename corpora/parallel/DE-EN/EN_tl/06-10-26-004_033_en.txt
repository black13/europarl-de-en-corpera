Mr President, according to the agenda, we were supposed to be able to have, and conclude, a debate about both Mr Mulder's report and my own this morning, before having the opportunity to vote on them.
We now have exactly 18 minutes until voting time.
It is completely unfair to our farmers and agriculturalists to begin a debate of this nature and then perhaps conclude such an important subject as the 20% voluntary modulation - in other words, a policy whereby one-fifth of the existing direct payments to farmers are to be transferred or reduced - with some form of contingency vote this afternoon.
I request that this debate be postponed until November.
(Applause)
