Mr President, when are we to have this debate?
Surely not now, in the 15 minutes that remain?
On behalf of my group and of my fellow MEPs, I would like to bring forward a motion for the postponement of the debate.
I do realise that under the rules of procedure such a motion must be brought forward at least 24 hours before the debate, but 24 hours before the debate I was unaware that Parliament would not be keeping to its agenda.
(Applause)
