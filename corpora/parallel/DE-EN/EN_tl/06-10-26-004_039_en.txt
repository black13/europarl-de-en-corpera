Mr President, on behalf of my group, too, I would like to support the rapporteur's motion.
Looking at the report, even the uninitiated would be able to tell that what we are dealing with here is rather a formal matter.
Behind this facade, however, as Mr Parish has already pointed out, lies the fundamental consideration of the funding of agricultural policy in the coming years and the position of Parliament on this issue.
For this reason, we must debate this issue at a proper time when there is sufficient time available so to do.
We cannot dismember this issue in this way.
I therefore support this motion and ask that you agree to it and that you inform the Bureau of the significance of this dispute.
Perhaps the Bureau was not already aware of it.
