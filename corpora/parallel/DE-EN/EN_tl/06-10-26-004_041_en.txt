Mr President, firstly, I would ask that we simply vote on this motion so that you then also have the recommendation of this House.
Furthermore, we could vote solely about postponement.
The decision as to when this subject is put on the agenda again is of course a matter for the Conference of Presidents and ultimately for the entire House.
Personally speaking, however, I would be in favour of postponing both.
Perhaps we could vote, and then you would see the clear will of the House.
