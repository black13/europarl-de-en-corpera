Mr President, I would like to endorse the rapporteur's motion as well as what Mr Swoboda has said.
As rapporteur on financial planning, I would also point out that this ill-starred proposal is based on the conclusions of the European Council and that the Commission was obliged to come up with a proposal for this so-called voluntary modulation.
In the course of the financial planning negotiations we explicitly reserved our position for the legislative process.
That is exactly what the rapporteur is now observing.
Given the significance of this matter, I find it reasonable to ask the Council to be represented at the next debate after any postponement and to confirm to us that this will be the case.
