Mr President, since I wish to repudiate the utterances made by the group back there, perhaps I might be permitted to make a comment.
The rights of all Members of this House are being safeguarded, all in the same way.
If we are to undertake a journey to a region like this one, balance is essential, and every aspect of the trip must be organised professionally.
That it was not possible, on this occasion, to go at the time planned, was attributable to technical considerations.
We should, however, be making the journey at a later date.
We should not allow the Le Pen group to read something secret and mysterious into this that is not there, and I would like to repudiate what they say in the strongest possible terms.
