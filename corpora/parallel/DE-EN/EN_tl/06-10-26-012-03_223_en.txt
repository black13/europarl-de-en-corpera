author. - Mr President, 'Reporters without borders', in their report, now rank Uzbekistan at number 158 - interestingly enough, below such countries as Belarus and Russia.
The state of human rights in Uzbekistan has been a frequent topic of debate in this House, particularly after what happened in Andijan.
The really hot question now is 'what will the European Union's response be?'
We have said that, if there are to be sanctions, they have to apply especially to the movement of weapons and troops.
It is vitally important that the German military base, at Termes in Uzbekistan, should be closed down, for, if sanctions are not actually to be complied with, a major exception must be made, and so it is for that reason that we see this as the litmus test for our human rights policy, not least here in this House.
It is for that reason that we have tabled this amendment to the effect that the German military base in Termes must be closed down.
The base is used by all NATO Member States, not least by those that are also Member States of the EU, and must therefore be closed down.
