Mr President, it is a matter of common knowledge that, on Thursday afternoons, we impose absolutely nothing.
All this House does in response to the various human rights issues around the world is to make demands of one sort or another.
By means of this resolution today, we are demanding of the Council that it extend the policy of sanctions and broaden it to include certain areas that have already been discussed.
The Government of Uzbekistan still refuses to allow an independent investigation of the deaths in Andijan of the kind repeatedly demanded in the past by several international institutions and still called for by them now.
What Uzbekistan should be doing is working towards that sort of independent investigation, together with the OSCE and the UN.
The EU's relations with Uzbekistan are a matter of great importance to us, but they must be founded on respect for democracy, for the rule of law and for human rights.
