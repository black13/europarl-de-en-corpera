Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year, and for the tenth time, the Europa Centre in Graz organised a European youth meeting with participants drawn from all over Europe, devoted to the theme of 'European future objectives' and with the participants giving their attention to the future development of the European Union.
Following an information session on the European Union and its institutions, the participants - over sixty of them - moved to a role-play exercise in which they imagined themselves as representatives of these institutions and worked through a large number of items, producing a twenty-point resolution to the effect that, inter alia, the powers of the Union should be extended, that the budget should be topped up and that there should be no further enlargement before the treaty on a constitution for Europe has entered into force.
Young people are Europe's future, and we should be very strong advocates for their education and further education, for that, too, is where our future lies.
