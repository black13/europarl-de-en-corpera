on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this report; not only is there no dispute about that, but we also say 'yes' to its demands, its analysis and its substance.
By way of elaboration, I would like to say something about six fundamentals.
The first is that the euro is the EU's most potent response to globalisation.
The second is that it may be the most important instrument for a successful internal market, but it is not the only one; it must go hand-in-hand with the accelerated implementation of the four freedoms in the internal market by means of pro-active innovation, the removal of structural weaknesses and the stabilisation of the social security, pensions and health systems.
Thirdly, all EU Member States need to join the euro zone.
Any EU Member State that resists the euro and sets itself in opposition to the euro zone, that fails to make every effort to become part of the European currency area, weakens the internal market and lessens the European Union's resistance to the effects of globalisation.
Fourthly, the Maastricht criteria are the entry ticket, and I am glad that the Commission, in its decisions over recent months, has held fast to them.
Fifthly, the Stability and Growth Pact is the necessary framework for budget policy.
We demand that cyclical increases in revenue be used to reduce deficits and states' debts.
Sixthly, according to today's newspapers, the French interior minister, Mr Sarkozy, is calling for the euro zone to be under European economic government.
Those who want to strengthen the European economy need to ratify the constitution and endow the Commission with the necessary powers; that is why we favour a strong euro on world markets and a single voice in the IMF, along with a European foreign minister to enable the European Union to carry some global clout.
