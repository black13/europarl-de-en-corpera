Mr President, we can all, in fact, take pride in the euro.
Much of what was predicted before its introduction has not come to pass, but there are three things that need constant emphasis.
One is that the tax revenues that are now coming in must actually be used to reduce deficits, and we demand this in paragraph 5 of the report.
Another is the urgent demand that the Maastricht criteria be rigorously applied.
Relaxing them again, in the way they have been in the past, will surely get us nowhere.
Thirdly, there is transparency.
The ECB lags a long way behind global standards.
The ongoing failure to produce anything like adequate minutes of decisions - or indeed any at all - defies comprehension, and this state of affairs is in urgent need of improvement.
