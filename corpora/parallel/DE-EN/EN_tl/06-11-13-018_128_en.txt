Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we must first do is ensure that the grid is well divided up between large and smaller suppliers, between strong central units and regional ones that will enable us to build up a strong structure.
For that, of course, trans-European networks are needed, as is a regulator or coordinator to handle these matters, but what is needed above all is the fiscal incentives that will get the profits that will be made used for investment allowances or shorter-term rates of depreciation.
The most important thing, as I see it, is to draw up emergency plans that will give us a chance of shutting down the network quickly and efficiently in the event of a crisis and then restabilising it and restoring the power supply as quickly as possible.
We also have to introduce a qualitative dimension into the security of energy supply, meaning that those who are willing to have themselves removed from the network at short notice should also be able to benefit from price reductions, or, conversely, that those who want to remain on the grid as long as possible and be put back on it with the minimum possible delay, should also pay higher charges.
Where energy is concerned, we must get away from debating it only in terms of quantity; there is a need, in energy supply, for qualitative factors that will make it possible for the price schedules to demand that a user who wants absolute security of supply would also pay more.
If, though, a user is flexible by reason - for example - of being able to draw on the energy for his warm water requirements either by night or by day, then he should be charged at a correspondingly more favourable rate.
Everyone should be able to choose their own energy supplier, and everyone should be able to get their electricity from the generator of their choice; if they could do that, it would give us a real chance of reshaping the European market.
