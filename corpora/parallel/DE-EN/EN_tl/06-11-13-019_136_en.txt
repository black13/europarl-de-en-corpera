on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks to you for what you have said, but I also want to extend warm thanks to my colleague Mr Freitas for taking the initiative and putting this oral question.
As you have already, and repeatedly, pointed out, Commissioner, the current state of affairs - that is to say, the decision to retain the quota until 31 March 2015 - and the question as to what will succeed it, is a cause of vigorous debate, particularly in certain regions that are, or believe themselves to be, dependent on milk and on the quotas.
It is good to hear a clear statement from you - as we indeed just have done - in which you give us the facts - namely, that the quota has been agreed on up to this point - and also tell us that we should have a debate in good time on what we propose to do about the situation.
If we want to carry on having a quota, then the farmers must be aware of that and supportive of it, exactly in the same way as they have to be of the decision to abandon the system, as is in fact currently being envisaged.
The question then arises as to what instruments might be feasible in the current financial situation as a means of preparing for its abandonment; it may well be, for example, that an increase in the milk quota is under discussion, but I would venture to express doubt as to whether this is the right way of going about it.
How are we dealing with the option for young farmers who need the security to plan ahead and who very probably ought not to be investing a great deal more money in quotas, but rather in restructuring for the sake of their own competitiveness?
How, too, are we to deal with areas that are nothing more than green spaces and need dairy farming if they are to be maintained as such?
These are, in the main, areas with very beautiful and very interesting landscape, in which there are, as a rule, very few other ways available of earning a living, and so we must support them in this way.
