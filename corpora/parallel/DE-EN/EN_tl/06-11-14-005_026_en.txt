Madam President, I want to congratulate the Court of Auditors on a good report, which holds up a mirror to quite a few things; the only thing is that certain people do not want to look at it.
I have to tell Commissioner Kallas that it is not acceptable that the new Commission, acting on the 'shoot the messenger' principle, should close its ears to the bad news from Luxembourg.
If we re-read the treaties, we will find that they state that the Commission - and nobody else - is responsible for the implementation of the European budget.
Yet I, Commissioner Kallas, read everywhere references to things for which you are not responsible, for the agencies, as you yourself say - and we will have more to say about that - or, for example, for Greece's failure to implement an integrated administration and control system (IACS); everywhere, the Commission is disappearing from the scene, and that is something that - since we have to deal with the new Commission for the first time - we will have to have serious discussions about.
Commissioner Kallas, you must start taking on responsibility, or else you are in the wrong job.
