Mr President, my apologies for not having been paying enough attention earlier on.
What I wanted to say was that I very much approve of Mr Goepel's - our rapporteur's - approach and the line he has taken, and that I do not quite understand why the Commission is being so stubborn in holding to its own.
I hope that we will, over the next two months, which the new timetabling arrangements have now made available to us, be able to find ways and means of preventing any renationalisation of agricultural policy at a time when money is needed right across the Community, and I will endeavour to work towards that end.
I believe there should be room to negotiate, and I hope that the Commission will have a more sensible attitude to that.
