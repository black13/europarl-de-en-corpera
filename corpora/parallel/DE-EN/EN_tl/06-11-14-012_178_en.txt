The joint project for a new generation European air traffic management system gets my vote.
It is particularly in my capacity as rapporteur on the extended powers of the European Air Safety Agency (EASA) that I wholeheartedly endorse the Community's declared objective of guaranteeing a high-performing air safety infrastructure that will make possible the safe, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly development of air travel while making use of the technical advances of such programmes as GALILEO.
According to current predictions, the volume of air traffic in Europe is set to double by 2025, and this makes it necessary that communications between pilots and air traffic controllers, which are still transmitted via radio, should be brought up to the latest state of the art.
I also advocate a public-private partnership, in which the European Community would participate, in order that SESAR's long-term success be secured.
