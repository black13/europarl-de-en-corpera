Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by following the chairman of my group, Mr Schulz, and highlighting something Mr Barroso said to the effect that, 'without solidarity, the internal market will not come into being'.
He got that absolutely right, and it comes up again in the text of the work programme, in which the Commission commits itself - and I quote: to 'the delivery of an active policy agenda focusing on citizens' expectations and needs'.
That is precisely what is needed.
It is not, however, enough simply to keep on saying that; it also has to be brought to life.
It is evident to me, from looking at the measures, that the ones that really matter in the internal market are not there, particularly those needed for the protection of consumers.
The term 'consumer protection' is nowhere to be found.
Now you are looking to appoint a new Commissioner to handle it.
Does that mean that you want to have a rethink or a closer look and see to it that consumer protection really is put centre stage in policy?
If you do, that is something that really will get across to the European public.
I also note the lack of any progress towards harmonisation in European policy that might point to the Member States sharing in it, that might indicate an opening-up of borders in the services market and elsewhere, for these things need to be tackled with much more vigour than they have been, and there is plenty left to do on those fronts.
Finally, the most important thing is that the primary competence should be political.
You are always talking about impact assessments, but what sort of impact assessment should be carried out?
Any impact assessment should also take into account social life, gender policy and other areas as well.
- Cohesion - protection of natural resources
