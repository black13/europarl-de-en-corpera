Madam President, I have taken the liberty of carrying out a brief statistical analysis of the Commission work and legislative programme, and have counted 57 non-legislative acts and only 37 of a legislative nature, so it would appear that the vast majority are non-legislative, and that strikes me as confirming a trend that has made itself clearly visible in recent times, that being that the Commission is more inclined to take refuge in non-legislative acts such as Green Papers, White Papers, communications, and so on, thereby in part circumventing its own legislature.
It is clear to me that soft law instruments appear - at first sight, at any rate - to fit better into the 'better regulation' agenda, but it has to be said that such instruments are neither enforceable nor binding and will end up as sources of even more disappointment for the public and for businesses.
I would like to highlight on the basis of my own working experience a number of things that I find lacking in the work and legislative programme, namely initiatives that the Commission has promised in other contexts, but are not to be found here, such as the standardisation of the consumer protection acquis, the term of protection of copyright, further developments in patent law and the applicability of EU law in sport.
The ECJ has produced a new ruling that fundamentally changes the position in this area and makes for greater legal uncertainty in it.
Together with the first batch of initiatives to be withdrawn, the statute for mutual societies and the statute for a European law governing associations went back as well, and, in the debate at that time, Vice-President Verheugen promised us that this would be reviewed and consideration given to the possibility of improved initiatives in this area, but I cannot see them here; perhaps they are not regarded as having high priority.
It is a matter of complete indifference to me whether they are or not; what matters to us is that we should know whether or not to expect their appearance.
