Madam President, 2007 will certainly be an important year in terms of whether citizens are won over to Europe or whether they continue to distance themselves from it.
I should like to make three comments on this.
The first is that the Berlin declaration represents a good opportunity for us to demonstrate the idea of Europe and the European project.
I hope that this declaration concentrates on the future rather than focusing too much on the past.
Europe has its origins in the field of energy, and this same field may also present a vision for the future - if, for example, a large-scale energy project were proposed that met all the criteria we are aiming at.
I am thinking here of the solar-hydrogen economy, which would be a real challenge for this continent and even for the international community.
The second is that we need to make progress with the constitutional process.
This is the responsibility of the Presidencies, of course, but also of the other institutions.
I hope that the Commission does indeed provide input to show citizens what they stand to lose if the Constitution is not ratified, and that it also makes proposals for overcoming the crisis.
The June Summit spoke of 'additional elements' that need to be developed, and I hope that 2007 sees the Commission, too, proffering some thoughts about what that means in practice.
The third, Madam Vice-President, concerns democratic infrastructures.
We have European citizens' initiatives.
One million signatures must not go to waste.
I think that we need a framework for how the institution receives mass petitions such as this.
These are important tasks for 2007.
