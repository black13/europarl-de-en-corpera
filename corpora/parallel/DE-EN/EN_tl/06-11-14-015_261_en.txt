on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as foreign and security policy coordinator for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to make a number of critical remarks.
A few points have been raised.
Mrs De Keyser expressed exactly what I feel when she questioned where we stand.
We can see the arc of crisis over Iraq, Iran, Libya - the Middle East.
Europe, a global player, makes professions yet comes up with a static work programme consisting of, on the one hand, a banal statement of the problems devoid of political substance and, on the other, instruments that - those of them that are actually new - the Commission does not even acknowledge as a quantum leap.
At this point I should like to express our disappointment that the five new external-policy instruments that are due to enter into force as of 1 January, and that will support the Commission's external policy, civil conflict prevention, crisis management and reconstruction work for the first time, are not given due attention, but instead constitute just a single indent in the work programme.
Then there is the Commission's concept of 'neighbourhood policy'.
The Commission must clarify in political terms what it means when people now talk of 'neighbourhood policy light'.
A political definition is no longer being given for this.
Any old words are being used, and I have the impression that a political definition is virtually being avoided.
I should like to finish with a positive comment.
I welcome the fact that the Commission is tackling the defence-equipment market at long last; it is just that what the programme has to say about this it has been saying for years.
Parliament has given the green light, and awaits results at long last.
Consequently, I am afraid we are not satisfied in this regard.
