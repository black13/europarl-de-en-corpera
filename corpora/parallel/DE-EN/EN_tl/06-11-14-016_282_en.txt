I should like to start by responding to Mr Davies' assessment of the European motor-vehicle market.
One of the reasons for the failure to meet the targets - but only one of them - is indeed the fact that European market habits have changed, with one market segment undergoing particularly rapid growth, one that is not exactly helpful with regard to CO2.
This is the segment of SUVs: the large, supposedly off-road vehicles with very heavy fuel consumption.
Astonishingly, these heavy, particularly high-emission vehicles have enjoyed favourable treatment in regulations up to now.
The Commission's proposal for the 'Euro 5' standard plans to put an end to the preferential treatment of these particularly large, particularly polluting vehicles.
That is a very important point.
This issue is currently being discussed in Parliament.
As far as the timing is concerned, for reasons of fairness and trustworthiness, the industry has to be given the time we have granted it: that is, until 2008.
If, however, it becomes apparent - as it is doing - that the targets are not being met, the Commission will have to start preparing legislation next year, so that it can be presented in 2008.
