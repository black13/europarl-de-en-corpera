Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, particulate-matter emissions from diesel vehicles are a topical issue.
Parliament, together with the Council, lays down high values for pollution.
What is planned with regard to emissions?
Is there any relevant legislation that relates to diesel vehicles and is aimed at the motor-vehicle industry?
