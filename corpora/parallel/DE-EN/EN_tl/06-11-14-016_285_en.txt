Commissioner, these CO2 emissions have a global impact, and of course global CO2 emissions also have an impact on Europe.
For this reason, I should like to ask whether the Commission knows of any figures from other industrial centres as to the situation there regarding the reduction of emissions and, secondly, whether the Commission is attempting to influence this.
