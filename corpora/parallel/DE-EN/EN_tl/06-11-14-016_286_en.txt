Vice-President of the Commission.
I am much obliged to the honourable Member for asking this question, as it gives me the opportunity to dispel a relatively widespread misconception.
Of course we have access to such figures, and it is pleasing - in my view - that levels of emissions from new European passenger cars are far, far below the average for passenger cars in other parts of the world.
They are significantly below those in the oil-producing countries - the USA and Japan included.
It is interesting to note here that such countries with poorer emissions levels than ours have legally binding regulations in place for all fields.
