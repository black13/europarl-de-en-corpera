Did the Commissioner know that, when Bavaria joined the German Reich in 1871, it did so only on condition that beer be recognised as a basic foodstuff whose consumption was permitted even during military service?
In Bavaria, therefore, beer is a basic foodstuff.
In addition, should a sharper distinction perhaps be drawn between beer and alcopops - that is to say, between a healthy natural product and a load of rubbish?
My second question for the Commissioner is whether greater account should perhaps be taken of regional and national traditions.
In particular, I should like to ask him whether a better idea might be to reduce VAT and beer taxation for the catering trade, in order to ensure the survival of our high-quality catering establishments - which are essential for health.
The healthier the catering trade, the healthier the people.
