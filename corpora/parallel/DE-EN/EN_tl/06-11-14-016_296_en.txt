Madam President, Commissioner, although Europeans traditionally like a drink, alcohol consumption has been declining for years even without taxes and health warnings.
Indeed, the US example demonstrates what happens when the consumption of alcohol is criminalised: young people turn to designer drugs.
Perhaps the Commission would do better to step up the fight against illegal drugs instead of demonising and ever increasing the tax on alcohol, the preferred drug of European culture?
