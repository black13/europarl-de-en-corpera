Commissioner McCreevy has also had an extremely tiring day today, and so he will understand our desire to present the matter to him with the necessary clarity and brevity.
In my personal opinion, gambling and the abundance of lotteries have two different elements.
On the one hand, there is the truly cross-border market for online providers that can only be regulated at European level.
As Mr Medina-Ortega pointed out, the US has already managed to regulate its market.
Europe, too, can resolve the issue of the online market only by joining with the Member States and introducing Europe-wide regulation.
On the other hand, there is the market in traditional games of chance and traditional sports betting, which tend to take place in written form.
In contrast to the infringement proceedings opened by the Commission - Commissioner McCreevy, in other words - we should proceed according to the principle that, if the Member States are succeeding in preventing addiction effectively by orienting their national monopolies towards a range of services that is as limited as possible and offers the greatest possible consumer protection, they should be given the chance to retain these monopolies in future - under the control and auspices of European law and the European Commission.
It must be ensured, however, that the monopolies that the Member States already have truly pursue just one objective, namely the prevention of addiction, and that Member States do not use them to pursue other objectives, such as aiding the recovery of public finances or promoting sport.
In this context, I would be delighted if Parliament and the Commission together could agree on a regime that, on the one hand, establishes European regulation of the online market and, on the other, maintains the national regulations in the field of monopolies for traditional sports betting, provided these are compatible with the internal market.
