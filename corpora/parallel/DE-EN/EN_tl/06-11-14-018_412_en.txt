Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, for regulatory reasons, we have exempted games of chance and casinos from the Services Directive.
I say this despite being a firm supporter of strengthening the internal market.
We did not want to throw the baby out with the bath water, however.
Secondly, there are many risks associated with games of chance, and so the argument regarding competition law and the internal market should not be the only one used by the Commission in support of infringement proceedings.
Thirdly, a clear definition is needed.
When we talk about 'games of chance', what is covered by the term?
Given the differences in the treatment of online markets, sports betting, machines, casinos and lotteries, a single definition is needed to ensure these are dealt with the same way everywhere, and a single legal framework is probably also required.
Fourthly, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that there are other important fields, too, to be taken into consideration, such as consumer protection, health, taxation, international trade, the problem of money laundering, the prevention of addiction and the fight against crime, including organised crime.
Fifthly, almost all Member States regulate the field of games of chance.
Eleven have special legislative models, and four use the limited-licence model.
Sixthly, in 2004, state lotteries achieved sales of EUR 63 billion, which is an average per capita net expenditure of EUR 140.
Seventhly, that means that approximately 33% of all takings go on good causes and tax.
In the event of liberalisation of the private sector this would be just 3%.
Eighthly, it is estimated that the industry generates approximately 13 billion jobs in the EU.
Ninthly, the sale of lottery tickets accounts for 195 000 jobs within the EU.
I would ask the Commissioner to consider these arguments when making his assessment.
