on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Generalised System of Preferences has proved its worth, as it actively supports countries in their efforts towards sustainable development and good governance.
We trade with these countries and also negotiate with them on equal terms.
We open up our markets to them, which also gives rise to competition - only in the medium term, if need be.
In other words, it is in our own interests, too, to ensure compliance with the rules and conventions of the United Nations and the International Labour Organization.
In this respect, we fully support the Commission's endeavours.
We also ask, however - and the Commissioner has already indicated that he is prepared to do this - that the Commission keep us informed on a regular basis.
This relates to, firstly, its observations on the implementation of the various regulations in the beneficiary countries, secondly, any sanctions pursuant to Article 16 and, thirdly, a mid-term review of the effectiveness of the GSP+ rules.
GSP+ should put us in a position to provide support whilst also benefiting from trade with these countries.
At the same time, we should take account of the legitimate interests of our economy and labour market and strike a balance between these two objectives.
