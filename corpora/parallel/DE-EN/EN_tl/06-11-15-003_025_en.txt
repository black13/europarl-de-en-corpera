Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the word go, the Services Directive has been the project of those wanting to see capitalism without any social safeguards prevail in Europe.
The Directive will goad liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation and also wage and social dumping on an unprecedented scale.
Companies will be pleased, but for the majority of people it will be a disaster.
In spite of all the protests and all the opposition, Parliament is to pass this Directive today, and those who stand to gain from it owe particular thanks to those in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament who have done their best to throw dust in people's eyes with lies and deceit.
The compromise due to be adopted today is not one that keeps alive the remains of a social Europe.
It is a neoliberal hammer designed to obliterate all social aspects.
Those who support it have to do so with their eyes open.
We shall continue to oppose this neoliberal onslaught.
