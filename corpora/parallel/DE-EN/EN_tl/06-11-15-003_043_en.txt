- Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year began with demonstrations against the Directive, and is ending with a triumph for parliamentarianism.
We have not stood in each other's way, we have not allowed ourselves to be used; instead, most of us have surpassed ourselves and taken on responsibility for the European public.
This European law is a triumph for Parliament and for dialogue, and should encourage all parliaments.
We are legislators, not governments.
We have shown leadership and cut the Gordian knot.
Long may this continue.
Freedom to provide services is a fundamental right; today's decision represents an important step in dealing with this freedom.
This decision has also dispelled many prejudices about the EU.
First of all, the Directive is a triumph for the European system of social market economy, in which the market is not played off against social security.
We must realise the four freedoms consistently but, equally, we should involve the public to an increasing degree.
Secondly, we have held dialogue with the social partners.
We have made ourselves part of the negotiations in the Council.
In this connection, I am obliged to Minister Bartenstein and Chancellor Sch√ºssel for taking our side.
This has enabled us to achieve more market, a stronger internal market, and also growth and employment, and to ensure social security.
I should also like to thank all my fellow Members, however, especially those who refused from the outset to support efforts to achieve a qualified majority at first reading, because a compromise is always harder to champion than an individual position.
We have simplified many things, provided legal certainty and presented a model of parliamentary work to the public.
(Applause from the right)
