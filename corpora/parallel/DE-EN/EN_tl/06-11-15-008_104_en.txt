Mr President, on the subject of multilingualism, I welcome the adoption of this report by Mr Joan i Mar√≠.
Indeed, I voted in favour of it, albeit with a number of reservations, which I still have.
I believe that neither the European Commission nor Members during the vote in this House - the majority, at least - showed sufficient courage on a number of amendments.
Multilingualism is a precondition for tolerance and acceptance, and, in the interests of understanding within the EU, more must be done in this field.
It is a fact that Parliament decided the Commission should study the issue of the creation of an agency and present a report to Parliament on this, and it is equally true that the Commission has been found wanting in this regard.
This omission must be rectified.
The procedure in this House is that a report is presented before the relevant debates are held and decisions taken.
