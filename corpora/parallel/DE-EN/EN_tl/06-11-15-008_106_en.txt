Mr President, I voted in favour of this report.
Amid all the euphoria about multilingualism, we must not forget the deficits that ever declining results of PISA studies have revealed.
The number of non-nationals in school classes should be limited to 30% as a matter of course, however, in order to facilitate integration, maintain quality standards and reduce the potential for cultural conflict.
In my opinion, therefore, sufficient command of the local language before the start of normal education and, if necessary, increased linguistic support, for example in the form of an additional year in kindergarten or pre-school, should become the norm in the EU.
