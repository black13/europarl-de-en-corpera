Mr President, I am convinced that the proposal for a Services Directive on which we have voted represents the achievement of a good compromise between freedom to provide services on the one hand, and the need to impose restrictions in the interests of workers and of small and medium-sized enterprises on the other.
Indeed, that is why I have voted in favour of this report.
It is now up to Member States to monitor compliance with the provisions.
Only then will we be able to count this Services Directive a complete success.
I would appeal to the Council Presidency, to the Council - which is now absent - to put pressure on Member States to indeed prepare the appropriate monitoring mechanisms for the implementation of the Services Directive.
