The Council common position largely takes account of the fundamental amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading.
The exclusions are clearly explained and relate in particular to fields such as healthcare services and audiovisual services.
The country of origin principle has been deleted, and labour legislation and social agreements in the countries concerned have been respected.
Market access for our enterprises has also been facilitated by the dismantling of many arbitrary barriers.
In addition, Commission opinions have provided greater clarity.
Consequently, the overall result of the negotiations can be considered a success for Parliament, but also for economic and social policy.
Of course, every compromise has its weaknesses, and some of the Council's amendments are not quite clear, but it would be wrong to question the overall result - which is on the whole very positive - by reopening the debate in the Council.
