Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to say how much I appreciate the Vice-President's presence here today, which demonstrates the importance that the Commission attaches to security and defence policy, while the Council's absence from a debate on it can - if one puts a favourable gloss on it - be interpreted to mean that the Finnish Presidency is, now that the pillar structure has been put in abeyance, on the way to accepting that security and defence policy, too, has become a matter for the Community.
Were it not for the fact that I subscribe to this favourable interpretation, I would be very angry at their absence.
This foreign, security and defence policy is becoming increasingly important, and I would like to thank Mr von Wogau for this report and also the Security and Defence Sub-Committee for the work that it has done, which highlights the truly decisive field into which developments are leading us.
When one considers the effort we put into securing our energy supplies, or the situation around Iran, the changes that may well occur in American policy in Iraq and Afghanistan following their elections, or the debate we had this afternoon on Gaza; not to mention the things that are going on in Darfur and in other regions, where some are buying raw materials while others campaign for human rights and then hold great summits in Beijing and Shanghai, it is not difficult to realise that this issue is going to be of increasing importance to Europe, and that is why it is necessary that some efforts be made.
It is only if we Europeans become more credible in terms of our military capacity that we will be able to get the trans-Atlantic alliance to seek to rely not merely on military might, but on the threefold chord of prevention - which takes precedence - combined with civilian crisis management and military capacity.
We will be able to achieve that only through our strong position within what is termed the West, and that is why we must also make it our concern to strengthen our links with NATO.
I would be glad if, instead of a multiplicity of individual operations with national headquarters, there were to be political agreement that these would run more on the basis of 'Berlin plus', for that would mean not only a more Community-based approach, but also, at the same time, more common purpose and cooperation with NATO.
