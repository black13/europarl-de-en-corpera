Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr von Wogau for this report, which is comprehensive, pragmatic and also courageous.
I share the view - one held by 70% of Europe's population and most of the people in this House - that the only response to the major threats facing us, from terrorism to failed states, that ultimately promises any success is that of a European Security Strategy.
I also share the rapporteur's view that such a strategy must be constantly adapted if Europe wants to remain in future an area of security, freedom and prosperity.
Since there is hardly likely to be, in future, much support for increased military expenditure, we need to make more efficient use than hitherto of the means and resources at our disposal, and that is why the European Security and Defence Policy needs common standards, shared research and development and a single system of procurement.
There is a need for a single system of air and space reconnaissance and shared telecommunication standards.
There is a need for strategic cooperation between the forces deployed in the fields of external and internal security.
What is evident from present-day deployments of troops in the Congo is that, although their dedication has yielded successes, there are just as many deficits to be dealt with.
We all know that the EU, although an economic giant, continues to be a dwarf in security policy terms, but if it wants to become a political union, it must stop being a security dwarf and abandon national animosities in favour of something holistic and bigger.
It is for that reason that the Community needs a security policy that is also to be funded by the Community, with Parliament sharing in the decision-making and monitoring it, and with a political head in the person of a deputy foreign minister.
It is to this road that this report points, and that is why it is not only courageous, but also forward-looking in the interests of a secure Europe for its citizens.
