Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Bauer's report not only affords us an in-depth analysis of this ghastly state of affairs, but also very wide-ranging proposals as to how strategies to combat people-trafficking - one of the cruellest branches of organised crime - may be successfully implemented.
These proposals range from the improvement of the legal framework to improved coordination of the most diverse measures at national and European level, taking in also the action needed in order to reduce demand and to protect the victims.
While I support them, I would also suggest that corrections be made at a few points, with it being prescribed in detail to the Member States what measures they are to take in order to protect victims, with regard to such things as access to the labour market, to accommodation, to education and so on, irrespective of whether or not the said victim is willing to cooperate with the authorities.
It is in these respects that the Member States should take appropriate action to protect the victims, albeit not of such a nature as to drive more of them into the clutches of the people-traffickers.
I am particularly grateful to Commission Frattini for taking very definite action that will have a lasting effect, and am very supportive of his action in now threatening that those Member States that have not hitherto been willing to implement and transpose the relevant directives, regulations and international conventions will have to face the consequences.
Their attitude is simply unacceptable, and the Member States must now do something in response to the requirements imposed by the UN and the European Union.
