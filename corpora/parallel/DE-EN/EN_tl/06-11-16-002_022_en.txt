Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to comment on what my esteemed colleague Mrs McGuinness said.
The Rottweiler dogs to which she referred come from the town in which I was born, and so I regard myself as a Rottweiler.
If I can assist you, Mr Diamandouros, in Rottweiler-like fashion, I shall be very happy to do so.
