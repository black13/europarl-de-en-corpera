Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has asked me if I might make a small amendment, and I shall be happy to do so, since it would not in any way alter the political thrust.
The last line would then read:
'would welcome the willingness of the United States to join in such negotiations with Iran'.
I am therefore happy to do as the Liberals have suggested and amend the text accordingly.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
