Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is, in European terms, intolerable that Varosha should be in the state it is: a ghost town, a town sealed off by barbed wire, yet, having formerly been home to some 30 000 people, it has been empty for 32 years.
The people who once lived there can, from a distance, see their houses behind the fence; the desire to go back to them has never left them, and I believe they have a right to do that.
I know, Commissioner, that we in this House and you in the Commission cannot sort out the Cyprus problem on our own.
If things had gone the way this House, or the Commission, had wanted, a solution based on the Annan plan would be in place today, but, disappointed though we are by the Greek Cypriots' overwhelming 'no', we do have to respect it, and - let me make this quite plain - we actually have done so.
We nevertheless hope for a solution soon.
What really could create trust and encourage further positive developments would be for Varosha to be returned to its original inhabitants and governed by representatives of both communities, and for Cypriots of both ethnicities to live together in Famagusta.
You have indicated, Commissioner, that the Finnish Presidency of the Council is currently endeavouring to facilitate the direct trade between the EU and Northern Cyprus that has been promised for over two years.
We have given the Turkish Cypriots our word that this would be done.
Opening up Varosha in line with the petitioners' request, though, could help people who have been waiting for thirty-two years to return there and would also make it possible for them to coexist in a new way, one that can open up the prospect of an overall solution.
I hope that the Finnish Presidency will rethink its proposal in this regard.
