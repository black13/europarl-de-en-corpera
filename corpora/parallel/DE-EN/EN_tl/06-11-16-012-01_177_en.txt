on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the outcome of the parliamentary elections on 15 May 2005 saw an atmosphere of political repression fall over Ethiopia once more, and once more too, then, we find ourselves gathered here in this House discussing that country.
Its manipulation of the elections and its repressive response to popular unrest have cost the Ethiopian Government respect at home and abroad and have cost the country itself its stability.
The only way to counteract this is to resume the process of democratisation and involve the opposition parties in it.
A year ago, the Ethiopian parliament set up a commission to investigate the murders committed in June and November 2005, and we call on the Ethiopian Government to publish that commission's final report without delay, without alteration and at full length.
The findings must be put before the competent courts and used as the basis for fair proceedings in them.
We also call on the Ethiopian Government to release all political prisoners without delay and unconditionally.
