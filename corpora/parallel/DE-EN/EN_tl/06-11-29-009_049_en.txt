Mr President, I congratulate the Prime Minister on his speech to this House, and am also grateful for his clear line on the constitutional treaty - no new negotiations, no cherry-picking, no residual stump of a treaty, no mini-treaty regulating just a few institutional matters - for such a thing, as has already been said here, really would rob the new treaty of its heart and soul.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, the popular participation aspects, the democratic aspects - all these things belong together.
The whole thing was a package deal, an all-embracing compromise, and it must not be torn asunder.
That is why our watchword must be that we will not yield on the substance that the new treaty can have, but we will be flexible about the form it can take.
I fully agree with you that such a treaty must not be a book, but must instead be compact, precise and brief.
All the things we might consider cutting out of the treaty are to be found in its third part.
You also made reference to additional elements; it is by these that we may be enabled to address the concerns and fears of people in the Netherlands and in France, but we also need these two countries to give us a clear idea of what they want to see changed.
There are Members in this House who seem to know what the people wanted; I found their 'no' utterly vague, with no clear indication of where it was actually coming from.
That is why we will have to wait for the French election and for the new Dutch Government if we want to know exactly what additional elements will be needed.
I would like to see you deliver this speech not only in this House, but also in many of the capitals in the EU.
It was under your presidency of the Council that agreement was achieved, and so you have a responsibility to seek out those who are friends of the Constitution and get this project completed after all.
