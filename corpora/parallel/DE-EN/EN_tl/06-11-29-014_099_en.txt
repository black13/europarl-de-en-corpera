on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, we are not entirely happy with these reports.
All I will say at the moment is that our group has tabled two amendments to the Van Orden report, one on compliance with the Copenhagen criteria in respect of the protection of minorities and another on the nuclear power station at Kosloduj.
It is not a matter of doubt that what is called flexibility on the closure of the nuclear power station goes against Article 30 of the accession treaty; even Commissioner Piebalgs, who is responsible for energy matters, is against the provisions of the treaty being nullified in this way.
It is at this point that the nuclear lobby creeps surreptitiously through the back door.
Is the delay in the decommissioning of both blocks to be a test case for other agreements on nuclear plants' active life and the watering down of them?
Kosloduj is one of the most unsafe and most dangerous plants in Europe.
The decommissioning of Blocks 3 and 4 by the end of this year was and is a condition for accession; the Bulgarian Government must, in this regard, adhere to the treaties and Europe must not give the impression that Parliament is expressing opposition to treaties currently in force.
That would put Parliament in a difficult - indeed embarrassing - position vis-Ã -vis the Council and the Commission, and the impression that Member States would not be required, following their accession, to abide by agreements already made would be fatal to future accessions.
