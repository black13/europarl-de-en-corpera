Mr President, I had the opportunity, as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, to lead a delegation to Romania, the object of which was to find out more about the use to which European funds are put.
Like the rest of the delegation, I got the impression that Romania is trying very hard to use the money it gets from the EU to the benefit of all of us.
Work is being done on dealing with corruption, they are cooperating in matters relating to the justice system and with OLAF too.
It is particularly heartening to see how European funds are being used to really reduce the suffering of many children, and that is splendid evidence of how well European funds can be used.
Problems arise only when - as sometimes happens - a country such as this one is deluged with too much money.
That is, of course, a problem for the Commission, and this is where we need to remind ourselves that we should be willing - as Mr Brok mentioned earlier - to actually make use of the safeguard clauses that we introduced for the sake of a well-ordered accession process.
I believe that Romania in particular, but Bulgaria as well, are - so far as we can judge - on the right track, and we should do our best to accompany them along it.
