Mr President, I would like to say something about the transmission of our sittings.
I think it is intolerable, when this House meets together in plenary session, as it is doing now, when we have various things to discuss, such as - as we are about to do - the Seventh Research Framework Programme, that, for those who run this place, everything is more important than having this meeting transmitted via a proper system of cameras to the Internet and then to the media by way of the relevant interfaces.
I would be much obliged to you if you were to give your attention to this matter, which affects the work done in this House.
