Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the Commissioner and the Commission, for increasing the budget by 63% over against what it was for the sixth programme is a momentous achievement, and shows that the Lisbon agenda, through which we focused, is right.
It got the full support of this House and of the Council.
We have now spent many years working to make improvements to it; the compromises we have arrived at are quite crucial in encouraging job creation and growth.
Today, I am already thinking about the eighth programme.
Having managed a 63% increase this time round, I hope we will achieve a comparable one in the eighth programme.
What is much more important, though, is that the technical work has only just been completed, and now the real work is beginning.
In 2009, we have elections to the European Parliament again, and there will be a new Commission; we still have time before then to sell our successes.
I would ask you to get together with Commissioner Wallstr√∂m and the President of the Commission to put together a design for how we can best get the message across to the interested parties for which we drafted this programme - in the universities, in factories, in every branch and sector - that what we have done with this programme we have done for the sake of Europe's future, and that new products and services will enable us to hold our own in global competition.
Since we are spending over EUR 50 billion on product policy, I would ask that we should agree on a budget for marketing and public relations, so that the simplification that has been achieved - this mammoth task that we have accomplished for Europe - may also be got across to its people.
