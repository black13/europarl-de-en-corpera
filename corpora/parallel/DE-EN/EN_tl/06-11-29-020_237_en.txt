Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for this debate and to thank Mrs Parvanova, without whose question this debate would not have been possible.
Commissioner, you have instituted a public consultation process on the issues surrounding patient mobility.
That is the perfect way to clear up questions such as: what gaps in the legislation are there in an internal market for health services that is, in fact, not a real internal market at all?
What shape could common standards on patient rights in Europe take?
What access do patients have to information, and not just information in relation to their rights, but also in relation to their medication?
At present, information of this nature is restricted in Europe, as we all know, and represents a fundamental obstacle to good health.
What arrangements would health tourism bring about when correctly implemented, and what aid opportunities and productivity would it bring the European Union?
We should think of Europe as a single health area.
That should be our vision.
Perhaps the public consultation process could be the first step in the right direction.
