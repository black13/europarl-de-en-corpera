on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we keep on reminding ourselves, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of Europe's economy, employing most of Europe's workers, yet still not without their problems.
I want to point out that the first communication from the Commission in which many problems were addressed reached us in July 1994, followed by recommendations in December of the same year, a second communication in 1998, and then, in 2000, experts found out that not even half of the measures were being put into effect in the Member States.
It is necessary to note that, even today, only 55% of them have been, so the Member States have to back up their words with actions.
I would like to say something about the transfer of undertakings, which is an important matter to which too little attention is given when considering the problem as a whole, not only on the part of the authorities responsible for Member States' tax laws but also by the enterprises themselves, which have to start work in good time on the business of transferring their enterprise to a new owner.
There is work to be done by all parties involved.
Not least in the Seventh Research Programme, this House has taken action in the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises; enough words have been bandied back and forth, so now is the time for some action.
