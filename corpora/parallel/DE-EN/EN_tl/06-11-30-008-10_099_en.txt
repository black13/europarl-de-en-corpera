Mr President, now that Mr Busquin has spoken, we really do have a problem.
Yesterday, the Commission took up a clear position; Mr Casini and Mr Prodi have commented on it, and Mr Busquin has just now cast doubt on it.
Mr Prodi and Mr Casini have hinted that they are going to withdraw their amendments, but we do appear to need another confirmation before this vote goes ahead, and so I would ask that Mr Potoƒçnik be again given the floor in order to repeat the statement he made yesterday.
(Protest)
We are being told different things, and yet we must be in a position to proceed with the vote with it being clear to everyone what we are voting on.
