The EU's enlargement policy was and is an important means whereby stability may be brought to Central and Eastern Europe and to the Balkans.
It was and is the incentive of membership that made it possible - and still does - to persuade these countries to include in their state constitutions the fundamental principles of democracy, the rule of law and the market economy and to actually put them into practice.
It is of the utmost importance that premature promises and adherence to fixed dates for accession should be allowed to lessen the pressure for reform exerted on candidate states by the EU.
I still take the view that the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria are happening too soon.
This is the sort of thing whereby precedents are created, since in neither case do the fundamental conditions for accession appear to have been met, even though they are required to be even before any accession negotiations are started, and not only on paper either.
That makes it all the more important that all institutions really do keep up their pressure on Bulgaria and Romania and that the implementation of those reforms that are still needed is monitored most closely.
