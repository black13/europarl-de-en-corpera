Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a European citizen and a European politician, there are two things that bother me.
The first is the fact of structural deficiencies in the European Union's energy policy, of the consequences of which we were once more reminded as recently as the beginning of November.
Secondly, there is the quality of Europe's relations with Russia.
It is quite obviously negligent to deny our current dependence on energy providers that are not merely foreign but owned by foreign states.
The sad fact is that the next thing to happen is that economic and political interests merge and start to influence what happens on the political level playing field.
We make the claim to adhere, in all our dealings, to the principle that European values must never take second place to economic interests, and that principle is a core element in our Community.
In our dealings with Russia, the expectation of our dialogues on energy being fruitful must not be contingent on our keeping silent about our misgivings concerning the violations of human rights and of freedom of the press.
What must be quite clear to us is that either there will be a Europe founded upon values, or there will soon be no Europe left.
