Mr President, I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to Mr Sacconi for his excellent work.
Without doubt, REACH is by far the most difficult dossier in this parliamentary term.
I am convinced that our rapporteur achieved the best possible result in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission.
The negotiations within Parliament, too, were a very difficult task.
Anyone who has been listening closely will have noticed that hardly any of the political groupings share the same opinion within their own ranks or represent a clear line.
One can tell from the criticism that has been expressed how difficult it must be to push a compromise through, even within Parliament.
Like Mr Sacconi and many other Members of this House, I have always advocated strong worker protection and also strong environmental and consumer protection.
I would prefer a stricter compromise - incidentally, I made the same comment after the first reading and during the discussion at first reading.
We now have to decide, however, whether to endorse the compromise - as my group and I shall be doing - or to adopt the Common Position.
I do not believe that the amendments tabled with the aim of tightening up the Common Position stand a chance of achieving a qualified majority.
We launched an attempt to go beyond Mr Sacconi's compromise back at first reading, and did not even achieve a simple majority.
Looking at the positions of many Member States, I wonder what those MEPs are expecting who say that this compromise is a gift to the German chemicals industry.
Looking at which camp is in the majority in the Council and knowing that, on 1 January 2007, Germany will be taking over the Council Presidency, I ask myself what expectations, if any, we can have of mediation under the leadership of the German Council Presidency.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament once more on this result; and I believe that this compromise is a small step in the right direction.
