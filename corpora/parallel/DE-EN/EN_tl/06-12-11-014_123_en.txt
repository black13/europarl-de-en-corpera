Mr President, the French philosopher Voltaire once said that all fanaticism is dangerous.
I believe that this debate is a good example of the truth of this statement.
The words of my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, of those from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group or even of the extreme left give me the impression that only losers could endorse a package such as this.
Yet let us compare the advantages of REACH with the disadvantages.
It must be made clear in this regard that REACH represents a step in the right direction for us all: greater environmental and consumer protection, but also greater competitiveness.
Rejecting REACH would undoubtedly be detrimental to all sides, therefore.
For this reason, it will now be up to us to communicate this properly.
Indeed, to look at the media, one would think that there were no winners.
Our skill will now be judged on how effectively we can change this impression.
After all, in the final analysis, human beings, animals and even the environment are the big winners from this legislation.
We should continue to work on it, therefore.
In this regard, I must also remind the media of their duty, which is to communicate a true image of this new legislation, particularly at the present stage.
The second stage will consist of getting the implementation of this image right - which will also be very difficult, as we know the scenario: the EU is always to blame.
From the point of view of legal form, however, this legislation is a directive and therefore needs to be implemented by the Member States, who will have to implement and also apply it correctly.
All parties really face great challenges in this regard.
The appeal goes out to us, too: let us create a strong Agency for all this, so that we have uniform rules rather than another patchwork of 25 or 27 different regimes.
We have considerable work to do, therefore, and hopes for a REACH-free year in 2007 are unlikely to be fulfilled.
