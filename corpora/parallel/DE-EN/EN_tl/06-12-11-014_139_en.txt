Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make just two brief comments.
Some of the participants in this debate, who I can no longer see here at the moment, have expressed the criticism that the REACH project would reduce the level of protection for employees in the chemicals industry.
I can state conclusively that that is pure nonsense.
REACH cannot reduce the level of protection in the chemicals industry.
The relevant provisions on worker protection remain in full force.
REACH does not permit anything that was previously prohibited.
Quite on the contrary, employees will no longer be expected to deal with a whole string of substances for which they were previously responsible.
At all events, therefore, REACH brings about a clear improvement in the safety of employees in the workplace.
Therefore, I must reject unambiguously this argument on the part of Members of Parliament who are acting as though they are representatives of workers' interests.
My second point is that many speakers have rightly pointed out that the important thing now is to implement REACH fully as well as transparently, resolutely and with the avoidance of unnecessary red tape.
This requires an endless number of initiatives, projects and measures - I could list them all to the House, but there is not enough time.
I have already spoken to the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and offered to visit the committee in February and present a detailed report on the measures the Commission has either already taken or plans to take with regard to the implementation of REACH.
At the same time, I should like to attach particular importance to answering all the questions that have been asked here about support for European SMEs and a relaxation of the requirements imposed on them, and about the many hundreds of thousands of employees affected.
