Mr President, the present Commission proposal does not make any change to the existing rules on the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses, but rather aims to update some of the instruments that accompany Community policy on animal health.
We welcome this, but we welcome in particular the Commission's announcement that it will shortly be submitting a full report on European animal health policy.
That would be a good time and opportunity to discuss further-reaching changes to the present rules and, if necessary, to set up a new legal framework.
We agree with the objectives of the proposal as set out in the Commission's explanatory statement, and also with the rapporteur.
We support the proposed amendments to Council Decision 90/424/EEC, and we also support the critical comments and notes by the rapporteur on the financing of the system for monitoring the movement of animals, and also on the system for financing unforeseeable diseases and outbreaks of epidemics, or animal diseases causing lasting harm.
Measures for combating animal diseases always require large amounts of funding, and providing this at short notice is often the problem.
The rapporteur's suggestion that certain funds be set aside in a reserve should of course be considered.
Our secret hope is that the proposed amendments improve the implementation of the cofinanced programmes on the eradication of animal diseases.
