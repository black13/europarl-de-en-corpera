Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur for her very well-balanced report.
As previous speakers, particularly Dr Kindermann, have already said, this is a technical report that introduces urgently needed amendments.
Flexibility is essential in crisis situations.
Assistance provided swiftly is worth double in such circumstances.
The reaction and measures taken must be prudent, however, and preventive action is better than reaction.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has been calling for monitoring of imports of live animals from non-EU countries to be as intensive as EU monitoring for many years.
As we all know, animal health has a direct impact on products of animal origin and thus, ultimately, on public health.
For this reason, special attention should be paid to ensuring that negative effects of the kind seen in the past no longer arise, where public confidence in products of animal origin is seriously dented, with damaging consequences for the economy.
