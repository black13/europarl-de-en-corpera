Mr President, my group supports the rapporteur's call for clarity and transparency with regard to the circulation of compound feedingstuffs.
We also pay tribute to his considerable efforts to find a compromise solution.
The discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have revealed a great variety of opinions, especially on the open declaration for compound feedingstuffs.
Views differed not only on the pros and cons of individual amendments, but particularly on their legal admissibility.
The reason for this was not necessarily the controversial nature of the subject alone, but chiefly the exceptionally complicated legal preliminaries to the procedure.
At this point, I should like to remind the House that we are talking about a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council correcting a 2002 directive amending a 1979 directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs that is based on a ruling by the European Court of Justice of 6 December 2005.
The codecision procedure has been applied, although, as a rule, the Committee on Agriculture has only the right to be consulted.
Following much to-ing and fro-ing, advance talks with the Council produced a line that my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, can support.
The Commission has promised to present a revised version of the whole feedingstuffs declaration next year.
I hope this will indeed bring clarity and transparency for farmers, for consumers, for the industry and, most of all, for us politicians.
