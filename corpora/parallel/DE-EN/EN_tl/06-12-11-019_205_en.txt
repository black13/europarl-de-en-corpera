Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank our rapporteur, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has made real efforts to reach a consensus with all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I support two substantive amendments, as I believe that text that is excessively detailed and excessively well meaning often confuses rather than enlightens.
I am in full agreement that, in case of calamities, the competent authorities need to obtain precise details of the feed materials contained in the feedingstuff concerned, and that these details must be disclosed.
Naturally, the definition of 'calamities' is open to debate but, in my opinion, common sense will determine this in the end.
Secondly, it is important that, as part of the simplification programme, the proposals to overhaul feed legislation be drawn up by mid-2007.
I believe that we have all learnt from the mistakes of the past.
We hope that the BSE crisis in the late 1990s was a one-off, an extreme situation, that will never happen again.
I would say to the Commissioner that transparency is essential when it comes to the production of foodstuffs, in particular.
The simplification programme for food and feed legislation is along the same lines.
Now, more than ever, transparency and confidence in a product are unbeatable advantages in international competition for consumers; but we do have to permit international competition in Europe, too.
