Commissioner, today, on the basis of a ruling by the European Court of Justice, we are discussing the correction of Directive 2002/2/EC regarding the circulation of compound feedingstuffs, or the compound feedingstuffs declaration.
The aim of this Directive is not the protection of health; in this respect, the ruling by the European Court of Justice was acceptable.
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development held a broad debate followed by the presentation of amendments calling for provisions on giving feedingstuff ingredients by weight and detailing these in percentages.
I should like to express my particular thanks to the rapporteur.
I also support the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, particularly my amendment - which has been adopted - calling for no further-reaching amendments to be made to the legal act from now on, to enable swift action.
The Commission has announced its intention to draw up proposals by mid-2007 to overhaul feed legislation, and it should do so.
That would be a good time to discuss the proposals, which should take into account not only consumer issues, but also the interests of farmers in being provided with precise, detailed information on the feed materials contained in feedingstuffs, and the interest of the industry in ensuring that business secrets are adequately protected.
It could also be a suitable time to reconsider the possibility, in future, of using high-quality animal proteins or protein components, which was of course banned following BSE and is still not accepted now.
As we all know, only feedingstuffs containing the best, high-quality ingredients guarantee animal welfare, optimum performance and high-quality foodstuffs.
