Mr President, Commissioner, the goal we have set ourselves - of increasing official development assistance and halving global poverty by 2015 - is an ambitious one, but it has to be said that we are a long way away from achieving it.
My view is that development assistance has to be a short-term measure, provided where people have nothing, in regions full of refugees or countries in crisis, for example.
In the long term, though, it cannot be a substitute for systems that actually work.
What matters, then, is that recipients of aid be given more power over their own affairs, and that some sort of accountability be required as a means of dealing with corruption and so on.
Africa is an example of how the way development cooperation works is not always ideal, and no wonder, when it was often used to promote the donor countries' exports, to shore up dictatorships or to drive states into debt and dependency, so it is not acceptable that China, for example, should encourage states to get back into the indebtedness from which they have only just escaped and become dependent in new ways, merely in order to secure supplies of raw materials.
Nor, however, is it acceptable that states should be so keen to hold out their hands to receive development funds when they are unwilling to take back any of those of their own citizens who have, in droves, sought refuge elsewhere.
