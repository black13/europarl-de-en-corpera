on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I am, quite honestly, surprised at being called on to speak right now, but life is always full of surprises.
I was very glad to hear what the President of the Commission had to say: the hearings have been held, and the result is that both Mrs Kunewa and Mr Orban have met with the approval of the relevant committees.
It is for me an honour and a joy to be able to affirm these two Commissioners; we, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will endeavour to work very well with both of them.
We have the goodwill to do so, and we say 'yes' to the appointment of both of them.
(Applause)
