Mr President, this morning's sitting was yet another that ended half an hour early, and Mrs Kaufmann, who was in the chair, deserves thanks for having apologised for this to the visitors who were pouring in at the time.
I would ask that the person in the chair at any given time be given a bit more speaking time if it is in any case clear that the sitting is going to end earlier.
It is not good for visitors to come into the Chamber in the expectation of hearing a reasonably interesting debate, and then to find the place empty.
It would be possible to be a bit more flexible in this respect, and it would keep the Members happy too.
(Applause)
