I shall be happy to enlighten you, Mrs RÃ¼hle.
The fact is that you will, later on, have another minute when you speak on behalf of your group, but, as spokeswoman for a committee, you are entitled to only one minute.
I shall leave it to you to sort that out within your group to your own satisfaction.
You will, of course, be able to recapitulate the essential points when you speak later on on behalf of your group.
