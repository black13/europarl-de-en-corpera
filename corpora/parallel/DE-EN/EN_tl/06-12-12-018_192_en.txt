draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Madam President, the Committee on Women's Rights, too, is grateful for the good cooperation and willingness of the Commission's rapporteur.
We do of course seek to maintain European quality television, which means securing the diversity and independence of the media.
The revision of the directive must not, however, be allowed to open up new grey areas, which is what we fear where product placement - formerly scorned as advertising by stealth - is concerned.
Product placement will now, in principle, be banned, yet numerous derogations make it possible for the Member States to blur the clear dividing line that separates editorial independence from the influences exerted by commercial advertising.
We, in the Women's Committee, have firmly repudiated product placement, and also want better protection for the young, with pornography, gratuitous violence and images derogatory to human dignity banned from audiovisual programming.
We also want to see restrictions on advertising.
Advertising must not be free to do as it likes.
We must ensure that advertising periods are not extended.
I am in favour of retaining the 45-minute rule, and also of alcohol not appearing in programmes broadcast during the day, in the interests of better protection for children and young people.
