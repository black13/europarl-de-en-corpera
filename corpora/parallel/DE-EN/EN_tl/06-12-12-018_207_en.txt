Madam President, Commissioner, it was a year ago, Commissioner, that you presented us with this document, and I think that a lot has happened in that time.
The report has undergone a lot of development, and we have been presented with plenty of acceptable compromises.
It is evident from the debate that one great central concern is advertising, and, as this is something with which a lot of us have a problem, we will have to discuss it; the question is: how must we control the amount of advertising in order to protect consumers while at the same time enabling creative artists to bring good, high-quality products onto the market without charging even more?
Advertising is something we are not going to be able to get away from.
We have spent a lot of time considering product placement, and have - albeit with certain exceptions - banned it.
We will have to keep an eye on what the Member States do with this, and how this ban is handled; under no circumstances must we end up with a situation in which content is determined by the product advertised.
Clear boundaries have to be drawn, and I think that characters in Bavarian crime programmes have been driving around in BMWs for quite some time without anyone so far being bothered by it.
I would also like - very briefly - to say something about the country of origin principle, for that too is very important and must not be allowed to result in media service providers deliberately moving their production operations to other countries in search of less onerous requirements, and that is something else that we have to deal with.
