Mr President, before I deliver my speech, I would just like to say to Mr Garriga Polledo that I, too, can look back on 12 years of budget debates in this House and in those 12 years I have never before seen a rapporteur on the Budget, once his own speech was over, simply get up and not listen to what the Members of this House had to say.
In the course of a Budget procedure, the European Parliament, being an assembly of politically thinking heads, engages in a certain number of internal debates, but, when it came to the subject of agencies, there were no differences between the various groups; we agreed that cooperation with the agencies had been improved over the last three years, although that does not mean that the good cannot be made better.
It is for that reason that we gave the agencies some homework to do before they could make use of all the money allocated to them.
They have to send us their work programme with a list of tasks and information as to what has changed since the previous year and why.
They are also required to implement the personnel policy guidelines already agreed to.
Such are the tasks for the agencies, which they are able to deal with themselves.
Others, too, however, need to take action, the Commission for a start, whose function is to promptly - and I emphasise 'promptly' - coordinate their personnel plans and put them before us, but also those of us who sit on the specialised committees, who are called upon to evaluate the work of each individual agency by reference to the work programmes, and that has to be done in pretty short order too if the agencies are not to be penalised for something for which they are not responsible, so please let there be no cliquery, and when I say 'prompt', I mean that everything has to be sorted out in the first quarter of the following year.
