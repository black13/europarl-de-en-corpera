Mr President, I can go along entirely with what Mr Virrankoski has just said, in that I see the Budget Regulation as a really important matter, and would also like to reiterate my thanks to the Finnish Presidency of the Council for having picked up a really live issue by at least proposing that we might take a look at what posts might be saved in the Brussels institutions by reason of the changes this European Union of ours has undergone.
Your inability to get this through is a lamentable sign of just how resistant to change everything here is, but you are passing on the baton to the German Presidency of the Council, and so one can indeed hope that it may be enabled to make headway against the red tape that it has announced its intention of doing something about - 'red tape' being understood to mean bureaucracy, unnecessary regulations and the difficulty of getting one's hands on grants - while at the same time reducing the numbers of civil servants.
That would be a way of saving a lot of money, and would also do something to restore the credibility of the institutions.
