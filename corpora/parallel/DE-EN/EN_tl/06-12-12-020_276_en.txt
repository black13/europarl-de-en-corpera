rapporteur. - Madam President, I must now, so to speak, 'avenge' our Mr Elles, and so I am happy to accept the speaking time and would like, speaking on my behalf and his, to thank the House for its praise and its suggestions.
As regards the Financial Regulation, and the completion of reforms, I would ask that we should present every bit as united a front as we have done to date.
Mr Casaca has bidden me keep to the subject, and that I am happy to do.
There is, in fact, a homepage - set up by me - on the subject of our experience with the Financial Regulation, on which the EU institutions or their advisors can provide us with information on how things are working out with the changed Financial Regulation.
I believe that we have, for the first time with this Budget, succeeded - and this is Mr Elles' great achievement as rapporteur - in bringing planning, implementation and monitoring closer together, and these are tasks that we will have to take very seriously in future.
