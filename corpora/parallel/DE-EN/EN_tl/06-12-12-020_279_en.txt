Madam President, since the Finnish Presidency has shown that the Budget Regulation can work with the seventh research programme, I would like to ask our Commissioner to again enlarge upon the rules applicable to the Budget, which we regard as being of particular importance.
The European Union comes in for much justified criticism, and this is where we want to see really visible progress within a short period of time, so I ask that these issues be taken seriously, particularly as regards their technical aspects, for they strike us as particularly urgent in political terms.
