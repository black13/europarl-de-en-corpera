Madam President, Commissioner, I know that flight safety matters are not within your direct remit, but you will probably have no trouble answering this supplementary question.
Day in and day out, we get innumerable complaints from airline passengers, and have ourselves had personal experience of all these things.
A very large number of us regard the action taken as no more than diversionary measures that do nothing to add to passengers' security, but make things considerably more difficult for them; in particular, they add up to more business for the manufacturers of toothpaste and contact lens solutions, while, in reality, doing nothing for security.
