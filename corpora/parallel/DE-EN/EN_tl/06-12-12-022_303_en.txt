Madam President, I have a supplementary question which leads me on to a matter related to the original question, since whisky is made from water, and it is with water that my question has to do.
I live in a country where water is universally available, and people are not accustomed to paying high prices for it, but, if you look around European airports, the tiniest quantities of water are on sale there at incredible expense, with a small bottle of it costing between EUR 3 and EUR 4.
That is something I do not regard as acceptable, but it is a consequence of the security system that is currently in force.
What, Commissioner, is the Commission contemplating doing about this specific matter in order to protect European consumers?
