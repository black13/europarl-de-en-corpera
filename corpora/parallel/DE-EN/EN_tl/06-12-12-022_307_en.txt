There are two things I would like to point out.
The compensation rules in international law, to which you refer, represent precisely the sort of compensation that we are not willing to allow our citizens to have, in that they should not have to take upon themselves the burden of major court proceedings in order to get what is rightfully theirs, and so I have to ask whether there can be changes in this area, and whether we can come to a clearer definition of the concept of 'force majeure'.
According to the airlines, an aircraft's breakdown is 'force majeure', but the fact of the matter is that the aircraft breaks down because the airlines, increasingly, use old machines on their flights.
