on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too would like to give many thanks to the rapporteurs.
When this Institute for Gender Equality becomes a reality, as it soon will, it will be a gigantic step forward.
Europe needs an independent, autonomous Gender Institute in order to ensure that the objective of equal opportunities for men and women does not get ranked lower than other anti-discrimination measures.
It is therefore very important that we have made it clear that we want a strong woman at the head of this Institute.
An independent Gender Institute is necessary, since discrimination against women is unfortunately still a reality in Europe.
There are many areas in which we do not just need more statistics, but also innovative suggestions for problem-solving.
I hope that this Institute will be more than just a place where data is collected, but will also be able to make an innovative contribution to solving the problem of gender discrimination.
Finally, however, I would like to raise another point which is very important to me.
The European Gender Institute cannot be a substitute for practical policies and real laws, and it must not become an excuse for the failure to implement legislative initiatives.
