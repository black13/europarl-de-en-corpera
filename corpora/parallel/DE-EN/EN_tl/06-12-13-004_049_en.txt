Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Brok and Mr Stubb for their reports and highlight the problems around the possible accession of Croatia, a country that has made considerable progress in recent years and can therefore meet the political and economic challenge of the Copenhagen criteria.
Since its integration capacity would not thereby be put to the test, the EU should devise a clear and purposeful strategy for Croatia's speedy integration.
We cannot make the country a hostage to the EU's internal problems, and should take a flexible line on its accession.
If it happens, it will mean relatively little for the EU, but a great deal for Croatia in terms of its democratic future.
