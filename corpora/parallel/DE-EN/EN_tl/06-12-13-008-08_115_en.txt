rapporteur. - Mr President, I shall speak very briefly, since I have only a point about the translation to make.
In order to avoid misunderstandings in the translation of the term 'production aid' and to relate it explicitly to the German original term Produktionshilfen, I ask for a linguistic clarification to the effect that, where the words 'production aid' are used in the text, they should, in the English version, be replaced by the term 'production props', and rendered in the French one by aide matérielle à la production, and in German by Produktionshilfen.
(The oral amendment was adopted)
