Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, REACH is in fact an example of how not to do it.
It is not an example of better lawmaking in the EU, and it is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of our new legislation on chemicals.
Much will now be dependent on the management of the new Chemicals Agency, but, whatever happens, things look set to get bureaucratic, with over 5 000 pages of rules and regulations putting Europe's small and medium-sized businesses in particular at a disadvantage.
REACH is no answer to the demand - repeated paternoster fashion in the EU - for better, in other words simpler, legislation.
It is dubious whether it actually does anything to protect the consumer, but certain that it will impose additional burdens on European businesses.
This is a fundamental problem, and we would be well advised to steer clear of this sort of legislative project in future.
