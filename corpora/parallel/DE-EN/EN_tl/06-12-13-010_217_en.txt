Mr President, globalisation - which is what this is all about - is happening whether we want it to or not, and it goes hand in hand with the opening-up of markets, with international competition, with economic growth, with the creation of new jobs, but, unfortunately also with the loss of jobs in those sectors that are less competitive.
In the light, though, of the need to seize the opportunities presented by globalisation, and to support those workers who are adversely affected by it, the establishment of this 'European Adjustment Fund' is a very good thing.
The delegation of the Austrian People's Party, however, with its knowledge of the structure and size of Austrian businesses, has demanded an amendment to the effect that the Fund would become active as soon as 500 - rather than 1 000 - workers were laid off, and should give out a commensurate amount in funds.
We see all the other measures - ranging from microloans to training - in a positive light - and the report as a whole therefore enjoys our support.
