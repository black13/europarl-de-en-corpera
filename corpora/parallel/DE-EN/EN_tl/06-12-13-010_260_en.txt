Mr President, since our debate, which, regrettably, took place in the context of a mini-plenary, the situation in Russia has continued to get dramatically worse.
All I can do is appeal to President Putin to take good care of the prisoners - the so-called Yukos managers and other political detainees - and to take care that they are not killed in mysterious ways as others have been.
The standards of the rule of law apply in Russia, on paper at any rate, and it is a matter of urgency that they should be maintained.
World public opinion will be watching President Putin vigilantly in the expectation that they will be.
I want to thank Mr Horáček for having inserted into this fine resolution the reference to the Yukos managers, which insists on their being at last set at liberty or at least treated in accordance with Russian law and imprisoned nearer to their homes.
I would like to use the opportunity presented by this statement of vote to make a personal statement.
As I do not know whether I will again have the honour to speak when you are in the chair, I would like to thank you for exercising the office of Vice-President in such an outstanding way.
