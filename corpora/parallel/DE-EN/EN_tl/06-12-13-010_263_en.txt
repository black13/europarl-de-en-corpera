The motion for a resolution gets my vote, since I feel that the jointly drafted text is very balanced and takes account of my two principal concerns, namely the European Union's structural deficiencies in energy policy and the quality of Europe's relations with Russia.
We must not be in denial about our current dependence on foreign nationalised energy providers, any more than we must allow European values to take second place to business interests.
Business and political interests must not be confused, nor must our misgivings about violations of human rights and of the freedom of the press be suppressed in the hope of making talks about energy more fruitful.
What is now needed is for priority to be given to a single European energy policy, so that the European core values of our Community, among them the upholding of human rights, may not be undermined by economic dependency on others.
