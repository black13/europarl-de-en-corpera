Mr President, it will come as no surprise to you that I have voted in favour of this report, and I have done so on the grounds that it takes a very realistic view of the European project and sets clear objectives for its future development.
What matters now is that integration be moved forward, so that real use may be made of every opportunity and that the European Union may remain stable.
If that is to happen, then new rules will be needed for labour, for the interplay of the institutions and for financing.
Our hope is that this work of regulation will be complete by 2008.
With so many states seeking to join the European Union, new strategies are needed.
Full membership cannot be the only goal; alternative perspectives for cooperation with the countries in our neighbourhood must be developed, and this is something to which the Heads of Government should give some thought, not least with reference to Turkey, particularly considering the possibility of a privileged partnership.
The idea of Turkey acceding as a full Member State is unrealistic, since there cannot be 71 unanimous votes at EU level, any more than all the national referendums - or, indeed, the vote in this House - can produce favourable results; that makes it all the more important that negotiations should begin right now, that they should be aimed at further developing the favourable climate and that they should have the probable eventual result of according this important partner of the European Union a privileged partnership.
