Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief.
First, I would like to extend my special thanks to Mr Grosch for all he has done.
However, we must first make clear to outsiders what he has achieved, because to the public it looks as though all he has done is to make three applications for the comitology procedure and that otherwise the Council has had its way.
It was, however, Mr Grosch who, in cooperation with his shadow rapporteurs, spent weeks and months negotiating to get a proper, acceptable Council common position together at all.
We must draw express attention to that, or else people will think that all we are doing is approving the common position.
No, we thank Mr Grosch and his colleagues for negotiating for weeks on end to get the Council to present a common position that had been agreed with us.
Two further brief remarks: I am one of the Members who were against mandatory exchange and against limited validity for licences.
We then nevertheless agreed that in the interests of road safety and preventing the forging of licences it is acceptable for citizens to have to exchange their driving licences after 26 years.
Many of us will perhaps not have to do that, if we are wise.
In that regard, 26 years is probably a good compromise and we can readily accept it.
My final remark, Commissioner, is that you were right to say that we hope many Member States will bring all these measures into force earlier.
Please see to it that the Member States act on their promise to put into effect quickly the exchange of data on driving licences, for we will be able to prevent driving licence tourism only if Member States exchange the relevant data and know that they must not issue this or that citizen with a driving licence because he is still banned.
So let us make sure the Member States build the information network quickly.
