Mr President, we really should congratulate ourselves this evening!
If we have a European legal text that really does matter to the man and woman in the street, we hide it in the night sitting.
That way no one can see or hear what we are actually doing for European concerns in European legislation.
A lot might be said about the European added value that could be obtained with the single European driving licence.
We have to thank Mr Grosch for bringing this flea circus together.
He has already mentioned a few things.
We are simplifying, we are making one European driving licence out of 110 national driving licences - and with the new Member States it is already appreciably more than 110.
We are making things safer.
Progressive access has already been mentioned, and many more details might also be mentioned.
We are trying to prevent driving licence tourism, and I can only add my support to those who have called on the Commission to pin the nation states down on this as quickly as possible.
We have also ensured that older drivers will not be discriminated against by permanent medical examinations.
Older drivers may indeed be dangerous in certain driving situations, but the real dangers on the roads are frequently caused by the younger ones.
I am glad - as Mr Grosch has also said - that the Austrian Council Presidency has contributed to today's success.
It fits the picture that that government was then voted out of office by the citizens at home.
