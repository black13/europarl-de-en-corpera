Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with tomorrow's vote the European driving licence will at last be cut and dried.
It has taken a long time, it is a compromise, but with effective and significant steps forward.
The most important advance is perhaps that it will put an end to the unspeakable driving licence tourism.
If, for example, someone's licence is withdrawn for drunken driving in Germany today, they can easily, and quite cheaply, get a new one in a neighbouring country and then drive on Europe's roads again completely legally.
This scandal will be put to an end.
This trick has been played one last time; it will now be laid to rest, and a good job too.
Freedom of movement for drivers in Europe is a plus.
With more than 110 different driving licences, however, controls are more than problematic.
The so-called 'grey rag' in Germany, that was issued in the fifties or sixties with a nice, youthful photograph, and which has been in the washing machine at least four times, is certainly a fine piece of nostalgia, but it is no longer any use as identification at police checks.
Personally - and many other honourable Members obviously agree with me - I think the 26 year deadline that has now been negotiated for exchanging licences is much too long; it is more of a biological solution than a real practical one.
It has been pointed out that Member States can do it earlier.
We shall see.
All the accident statistics clearly show that most road deaths occur among young men between the ages of 18 and 25 on motorcycles.
Progressive access to a motorcycle licence is therefore sensible.
It will save human lives and improve road safety.
On behalf of my Group, sincere thanks are due to Mr Grosch, the rapporteur, who has negotiated well, and so there will be no transitional periods, no exemptions and no restrictions in tomorrow's vote: we shall back you wholeheartedly and unanimously, together taking the matter to a successful conclusion.
Thank you for your work!
