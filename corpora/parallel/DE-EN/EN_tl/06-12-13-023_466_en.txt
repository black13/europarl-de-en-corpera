Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats thanks the rapporteur for producing his report promptly, quickly, clearly and precisely, and we are able to support it.
I also hope that the Council will, as promised, accept our amendment, so that we can bring this dossier to a conclusion at first reading.
Mr Vice-President, you are absolutely right.
We must abolish the exemption that still exists regarding the non-use of double-hull tankers.
I find the last sentence, which we are taking over from the rapporteur as an amendment, quite classic; it says quite plainly that oil tankers carrying heavy grades of oil, irrespective of their flags - not only Member State flags - will not be allowed to enter ports or offshore terminals or to anchor in areas under the jurisdiction of a Member State unless they are double-hull tankers.
That is important; we have already had some very difficult situations in the Baltic, and I hope that what we said in 2003 - namely that heavy-grade oils may only be carried in double-hull tankers - will now at last be enforced.
If we are indeed concluding the Commission proposal with the amendment quickly at first reading, then we should remind the Council that next year we have to deal with seven separate proposals in the Erika 3 package.
I hope the Council will work with us on them just as quickly so as to improve flag state controls, port state control and liability.
I am eager to see whether the Council will pluck up the same courage as the Commission and Parliament next year to take active measures to prevent environmental pollution at sea.
