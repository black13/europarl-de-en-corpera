Mr President, if we want to know about the consequences and repercussions of bad and old single-hull tankers, we must go to the Breton or Galician coast and talk to the people who live there.
The names Erika and Prestige bring back terrible memories for them.
The Commission's Erika packages were a sensible response to those disasters.
They include Regulation 417/2002 with the more rapid introduction of double-hull tankers and the ban on carrying heavy-grade oil to and from European ports in single-hull tankers.
The Commission's proposal that tankers carrying heavy-grade oil under European flags must now be double-hull tankers is consistent and brings a little more safety for shipping and the sea.
You see, Commissioner, Parliament is able to accept and commend proposals from yourself without more ado.
Now, as Christmas approaches, the Commission should again be complimented for such good proposals, to which no one can object!
Parliament need not be perturbed if the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, Intertanko, is not exactly pleased at the Commission's proposal.
Mr Le Rachinel, the rapporteur, was well advised to give priority to maritime safety and not to Intertanko, and at this point I want to say a sincere thank you to him on behalf of my Group.
I therefore expect that we shall have a good vote in Parliament tomorrow over all, thereby making our seas a little safer.
