draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, the comments of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are naturally of a structural nature.
We have seven points to make.
Firstly, we want an energy-policy approach that ensures energy is affordable.
Secondly, we support an integrated energy-policy approach that takes equal account of the objectives of security of energy supply, security of competition and care of the environment.
Thirdly, dependence on energy imports leaves no room for ideological blinkers.
We want a non-discriminatory energy mix.
Fourthly, we believe the completion of the internal market is central to security of supply and affordable energy prices.
Fifthly, investment in networks and capacities and investment in CO2 or energies that produce little CO2 must be facilitated and accelerated.
Sixthly, we support the Commission in acting consistently against anti-competitive behaviour to ensure that competition is fair.
Seventhly, we do not want to encumber our energy policy with unnecessary bureaucracy.
New European agencies and authorities are at present just as unnecessary as new internal market rules.
The existing machinery needs to be used more efficiently and existing European law must be fully transposed into national law.
