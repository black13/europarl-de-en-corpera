Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have read in the Austrian media that the Temelin nuclear power station will soon have had its one hundredth emergency.
The Commission relies for information on the good will of the Member States' authorities.
Nevertheless, my sincere thanks go to Commissioner Piebalgs for promising to send an official letter to enquire how dangerous the Temelin power plant actually is.
I also welcome Amendment 5 to the Seppänen report, which has to do with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the area of safeguards and safety of nuclear power plants.
The Community should in future draft a code of conduct for an international nuclear incident warning system under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Seppänen report makes an excellent proposal there.
We need peer review by experts who are empowered to make inspections not only in the Member States but at European level so that if risks arise a nuclear power station can be taken off line, by court order if necessary.
We owe that to the safety and health of Europe's citizens and population.
The Council must abandon the obstructive attitude it has taken in the past and agree to such a peer review group in the interests of safety.
We know that the safety regulations differ greatly, in the area of decommissioning and final storage in particular.
The result is a crass difference in costs and those with the laxest safeguards and safety measures and who do not bother about decommissioning and final storage will stand to gain.
We cannot have that.
I thank you for your support, Mr Piebalgs, and hope that the Commission will act resolutely in this matter.
