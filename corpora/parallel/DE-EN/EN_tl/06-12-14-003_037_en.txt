Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have some very different reports on the table about energy strategies.
In my opinion, the Morgan report and the Langen report really deal with a positive future and a paradigm change in the energy industry as it has existed up until now, while the Seppänen report is actually about clearing up waste and contamination.
As I fully agree with Mrs Morgan, I would like to concentrate on the Seppänen report now and say that I find what this report suggests to be completely unacceptable.
Nuclear safety is and remains more fiction than reality.
If we look back over the past year and review the greatest events that made us sit up and take notice, then it has to be said that the European Union in general really ought to be aware of this.
We have had a helpless argument with Iran, which is threatening to build the atom bomb.
We have been shaken by the nuclear test in North Korea and we can only say that the non-proliferation pact is a dead letter.
In the European Union we have the Forsmark atomic power plant in Sweden.
Sweden is a country that says it has the safest atomic power stations.
The Swedish supervisory authorities confront us with the fact that this reactor was only 18 minutes from runaway.
That emergency was not even discussed, let alone addressed, at European level.
We have taken on a great responsibility with clearing up the consequences of the Chernobyl reactor accident, but what do we find?
Incompetence, corruption in connection with the Shelter Implementation Plan, and nobody really knows what is the way forward there.
We also have a polonium scandal.
Large quantities of polonium, a highly radioactive substance from the Russian nuclear cities, are misappropriated, transported all over Europe, and no one knows how it can have happened.
So do not tell me anything about nuclear safety; it would be better to talk about nuclear insecurity.
