Mr President, the various reports in the field of energy are actually quite typical of this European Parliament.
There is a lot in them and a lot of it is right.
At the heart of it, however, these reports are problematical.
They talk repeatedly about the energy mix.
That means of course that they are still looking to atomic energy and atomic energy is and remains wrong and dangerous.
When will the various people in authority at last learn the lessons of Chernobyl and the recent near-accidents in Sweden?
The only correct response is to get out of atomic energy immediately!
The EU is failing to encourage research, it is failing on energy efficiency and renewable energies.
It is a scandal that twice as much money, EUR 1.6 billion, is being spent on the arms research race in space as on a change of direction in energy.
The German foreign minister is always talking about 'energy foreign policy'.
This shows that the EU has global political ambitions, at other people's expense.
Instead of that, we need to get out of atomic energy immediately and invest massively in renewable energies, energy research instead of armaments research and cooperation in the field of energy foreign policy.
