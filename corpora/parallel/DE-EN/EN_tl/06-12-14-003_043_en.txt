Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the three rapporteurs for their fine work.
However, I hope the other rapporteurs will forgive me if I concentrate on the report of my colleague, Mrs Morgan.
Hers is an excellent report which demonstrates the productive cooperation between the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs.
I am assuming that here today in Parliament, we will send a very clear signal to the Commission, a signal which the Commission, in the interests of continuing the truly sound cooperation hitherto in the energy policy field, should not ignore when it presents its energy package in January.
Hence the report, for instance, is calling for a compulsory 25% target for renewable energies by the year 2020.
The Commission is obviously thoroughly open-minded when it comes to a binding, general target.
This is good, but not enough.
The Morgan report also calls for binding sectoral targets.
We have targets for electricity and biofuels.
However, we must set these targets beyond 2010.
We have not had any negative experiences thus far.
In 2001, we saw with the Electricity Directive, which contained clear targets, that we had achieved a new breakthrough in the Member States.
On the one hand, this should not be jeopardised.
On the other, however, you, Commissioner Piebalgs, declared in this House in February of this year that you would present a Directive concerned with heating and cooling this year.
We would be happy to give you until January.
This is not at all the point, however.
Both we here in Parliament and industry and commerce in this area, which has truly supported your words, are expecting presentation of a Directive, as stated in both the Langen and Morgan reports.
I call on the Commission to fulfil its obligations and take action accordingly.
