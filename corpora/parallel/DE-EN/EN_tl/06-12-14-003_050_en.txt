Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with regard to the strategy for biomass and biofuels, I would like to comment on two points in relation to this report.
Firstly, it is very important that priority be given to the principle of sustainability in all phases when producing biofuels.
In addition, however, we must also define standards in relation to cultivation and processing, in which connection the greenhouse gas balance during the entire production cycle must be the main criterion.
For my second point, I would like to mention the energy efficiency of biomass.
Here, the principal criterion must be how many kilowatt hours can be harvested per hectare per annum without neglecting sustainability.
As a result of the increased demand for fossil energy sources and the rapid price increases associated with this, it is important that the percentage share of renewable energy sources rises rapidly so as to dampen future price increases in fossil energy sources.
