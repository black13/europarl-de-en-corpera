I have voted in favour of the adoption of the European Driving Licence System since this overhaul represents significant progress as far as I am concerned.
The new Driving Licences Directive entails greater security and less criminality in dealings with driving licences, since the possibility of so-called driving licence tourism is substantially reduced.
The establishment of a database of traffic offenders who have had their driving licences taken away in their home countries is particularly important in this connection.
As a result, drunk drivers can be clearly prevented from simply undertaking new driver training abroad.
However, I sense that the 26 year period during which all driving licences which are valid today have to be withdrawn from service, is overly long.
