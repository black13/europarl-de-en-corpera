author. - Mr President, the military coup in Fiji has brought a country which is undergoing a tragic development to the attention of worldwide public opinion.
The economic situation in Fiji has also been worsened as a result of the EU's policy regarding sugar.
In the meantime, according to German radio, credit transfers from Iraq for the Fijian economy are no longer conceivable.
These ensure the survival of entire families and rural communities and, in the meantime, more money is arriving in Fiji from Iraq than is being generated by the local sugar industry.
How has this situation come about?
In Iraq, there are very many mercenaries from Fiji who make their money there and then return as individuals, some of whom have been heavily traumatised.
The military, which has become independent after a fashion, has played a role.
The talk is always of how the conflict in Fiji runs along ethnic lines.
Whilst, superficially, it may perhaps be considered an ethnic conflict, essentially, it is a question of power.
Which chieftains have a say?
Moreover, this conflict between the various clans is happening as we speak.
This coup d'état essentially points to the fact that conditions there are unstable.
It is also to do with the fact that the conflict is a post-colonial one.
Here is a brief recap: since 1879, the British colonial administration has been bringing Indians from the subcontinent to work in Fiji, primarily in the cotton and sugar cane industries.
Consequently, this is one of the prevailing conflicts between the various ethnic groups.
When the EU now talks about condemning this military coup d'état, something I wish to emphasise, we must also concede at the same time that the EU has made a not insignificant contribution to the causes of the conflict in Fiji.
We should also bear this in mind.
