on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, my home province of Bavaria has maintained close ties with Fiji for decades.
The Hanns-Seidel Foundation has been supporting democratic-related projects there for many years and a former Member of this House, the sadly now deceased Minister of State, Mr Fritz Pirkl, supported the cause of democracy in Fiji more than almost anyone else.
It is therefore truly distressing to see that barely six months after the democratic elections in May, such a brutal military coup d'état has taken place, a coup d'état which we are unable to condemn with sufficient force.
Nevertheless, we must be clear on one point, however.
The overwhelming majority of the parliament elected in May, as well as all the major democratic forces, with the deplorable exceptions indicated by my fellow Member, Mr Szent-Iványi, are on the side of democracy there.
Likewise church groups, the different religions, the National Council of Chiefs, that is, representatives of the traditional structures, are quite clearly on the side of the democratically-elected Prime Minister.
We, as the European Union, must use all of our authority to restore freedom and rule of law in Fiji.
Therefore, no leniency whatsoever should be shown towards these tyrants and dictators.
That is why funds, right down to humanitarian aid, must be frozen.
However, we must also exert all the political pressure at our disposal to restore democracy and freedom on this beautiful group of islands immediately.
