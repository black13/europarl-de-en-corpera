on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the UN is an organisation which enjoys a high degree of credibility worldwide on the subject of maintaining peace.
It is extremely important that this good reputation is preserved.
If all we receive is shocking reports of rape and sexual abuse, we must also assume, unfortunately, that a high number of incidents have gone unreported, also in view of the fact that reports are circulating of a culture of silence within the UN missions themselves.
I am convinced that only a strategy of zero tolerance will succeed.
This means that the commanders on site must be able to send the persons in question home immediately, in which connection the country responsible for sending the individual in question is under an obligation to prosecute said party at home under criminal and disciplinary law.
For the individual soldiers, many of whom are from developing countries, such deployment is also of financial interest.
If it gets about that examples are actually to be made by sending people home, meaning that money is no longer paid, this would presumably be the most effective way of reducing such incidents in future.
However, it must also be made clear that superiors who tolerate such conduct will no longer be available for deployments of this nature in future.
