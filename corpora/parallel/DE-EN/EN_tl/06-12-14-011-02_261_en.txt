on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the references to the sexual abuse of children in Haiti and Liberia by UN personnel is just the most recent in a long list of similar scandals.
These human rights violations contrast starkly with the humanitarian task of the United Nations to preserve peace.
In many parts of the world, UN troops assist in overseeing the transitions from dictatorships to democracies and transformation processes.
Time and again, however, individual UN soldiers have committed serious misdemeanours, damaging the reputation of the peacekeepers.
Since troop training and discipline is ultimately also the responsibility of the Member States, we call on those countries which provide UN contingents to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the parties accused.
We call on the United Nations to create a working environment in which the culture of silence does not stand a chance, for this is inconsistent with the zero tolerance policy of the United Nations.
It should not be the case that sexual abuse goes unreported for fear of reprisals.
Reference has also already been made today to the importance of strengthening the role of women.
In connection with this, I would like to appeal to the Council, the Commission and also to the UN, that Resolution 1325, which was adopted by the UN Security Council in 2000, be implemented in practice.
