on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, a brutal, totalitarian military dictatorship, corrupt rulers, the opium trade, expulsions (at the moment, we have over half a million internal exiles) and the suppression of many peoples, not least the Karen.
All this characterises the sad situation which has existed in Burma for more than 40 years.
There are, however, two new developments to which we must turn our attention.
Firstly, the ASEAN countries have finally decided on following a harder line, which we can only encourage and support.
At last, the ASEAN countries are fulfilling their obligations and starting to exert pressure on Burma.
Secondly, it is regrettable that Indians have allowed themselves to become more and more entangled in bad company with these military rulers.
We are appealing to the world's largest democracy, namely India, to take its democratic responsibility seriously and, together with ASEAN and the European Union, to support democracy and rule of law in Burma and not become chums with one of the world's most evil regimes.
