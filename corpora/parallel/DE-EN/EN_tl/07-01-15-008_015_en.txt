Mr President, I rise to speak further to Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure of this House, according to which it is a fundamental requirement, where a political parliamentary group is to be formed, that those who are to be its members share a political affinity.
I take it as read that the interview given by Mrs Mussolini to the APA news agency - or, at any rate, published by it - on 8 January cannot be seen as other than contrary to Rule 29, for, in it, she described the group - which was, at the time, yet to be set up - as technical rather than political, and indicated that there was much in this group's political programme that was not in line with her own thinking.
It follows, then, that the requirements of Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure have not been met, since technical groups - as we know from this House's history - are not permitted, and I therefore ask that the House's procedural committee be tasked with examining the legitimacy of this group's formation.
(Applause)
