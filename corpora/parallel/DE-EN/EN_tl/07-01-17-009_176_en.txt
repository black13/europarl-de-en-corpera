President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your very open and interesting comments on the railway package.
They show how important the railways are in transport, and how they must become still more important.
Parliament is very united in this, and that strengthens the Commission, the Council and us all.
I firmly believe that the differences between the 27 countries must be taken into consideration, including when it comes to their enthusiasm for opening up access to the market.
If we show sound judgment and enthusiasm in accepting the requirements of the individual countries while at the same time providing options for regulation and deregulation, then we will achieve greater acceptance.
In many Member States, there is a legitimate fear that the opening up of the market in national passenger transport will result in certain companies simply taking over the market.
That is one of the viewpoints that result in the topic of market opening not being approached very energetically, as you made clear in your report, Mr Jarzembowski.
I would like to thank the rapporteurs and those who took part in the discussions for their commitment to transport policy, and in particular to the railways.
I am sure we will meet again at the next opportunity, in order to search out compromises.
