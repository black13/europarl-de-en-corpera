- Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am essentially in favour of the third railway package.
Originally, I took the view that the State should never hand over operation of the railways to private companies, but, provided the infrastructure remains under State ownership, and local, regional and cross-border transport services are transferred to private companies only under very clear conditions, in a socially and environmentally responsible way, I now think that we must accept fair competition.
If, however, a State monopoly were simply to be replaced by a number of private monopolies, as has sometimes been the case with the energy companies, then liberalisation would certainly get us nowhere.
My experience as a frequent rail traveller has shown me that the quality of railway provision depends not on the level of privatisation, but rather on a clear political will to give rail preference over road.
What counts in this respect are the true costs and the attractiveness of the railways in general, including, for example, appealing stations, well-planned timetables, a reliable service, comfortable trains, and so on.
We have a good example in the middle of Europe: Switzerland.
The Swiss Government has not abdicated its responsibilities, even though 45% of the railways are not owned by Swiss Federal Railways.
There are clear requirements, and there is a political will on the part of those responsible.
The railways work, and can compete with the road network.
A bad example is Italy, where the focus has to date been on grand projects and the existing rail network has been seriously neglected for decades.
Perhaps this European initiative will gradually make Italy, too, change its approach.
