Mr President, it may be that we did not inform you in good time, but this report is the latest from Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, and its subject matter, road safety, something in which she has always taken a great interest.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Hedkvist Petersen for the work she has done in this House over recent years.
(Applause)
