Mr President, as I see it, one reason why we should extend this debate on cars is that it highlights the gulf between words and actions.
Mr Gabriel's proposal for combining the admixture of biofuels and the requirement for the efficiency of motor vehicles obscures the issue, for, even if I sell a car that can run on biofuels, I cannot be certain that the customer will use them in it later on, and so it is the very opposite of clear from the system you propose as to how the output is to be measured, and that gives rise to enormous problems.
Although you talk in terms of a CO2 output of 120 grams per kilometre, what you actually want is the same as the German car manufacturers, namely 130 or 140 grams.
That would be a fatal move not only for Europe but also for the world generally, for, as the target of between 60 and 100 grams must be achieved by 2020 at the latest, the figure of 120 grams can represent only an intermediate stage.
I also want to thank you for your clarifications; I hope that Mrs Merkel and Mr Glos take the same view, for it has not been clear from the press over the last few days that they do.
I may well not be a German, but, for me, Germany has always been one of the great leaders, for the German public give the highest priority to the protection of the environment and to dealing with climate change, and for a German Presidency, having set itself to do great things on the climate change front, to fall over the first time the economy comes under even minimal pressure is an appalling disgrace.
