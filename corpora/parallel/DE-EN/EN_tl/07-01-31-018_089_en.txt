Commissioner, Mr Gabriel, I too have only a minute in which to get through to your mind.
The only thing one can say, having heard you, is that the lion has a mighty roar.
We know that President Bush holds the reins of power, and the way you, Minister, roar is reminiscent of the way one of your predecessors - Klaus TÃ¶pfer - roared in 1992, when we were in much the same situation.
It almost seems as if an historic window of opportunity opened up for us somewhere between the fall of the Wall and globalisation, but, as nothing happened that serves as an example of what not to do.
I do, however, want to encourage you to stick with this issue, to sidestep as elegantly as possible the resistance with which you meet on the part of the German motor industry, and to really concentrate on the matter in hand.
You will, of course, have to be aware that this will not happen without some sacrifices.
If you succeed in getting the idea across to the rich Member States that doing without is sexy, your political destiny could be that of the successor to the environment minister whom I have named - and for you, and perhaps for the world, that would be no bad thing.
