Mr President, we need a thorough assessment in the run-up to an agreement.
Central to this will be the issue of the effectiveness not only of the present agreement, but also of the previous one.
This question must be answered before we can make further progress in this matter.
Any future agreement must be based on the push system.
The pull system is no longer acceptable, since, as is well known, the push system ought already to have been introduced in the previous agreement.
The transfer of passenger data needs to be strictly limited in terms of the purposes for which such data is used.
Otherwise, we cannot contemplate such a regulation.
The future agreement must also be given full democratic legitimacy, a process that should involve the European Parliament and, if appropriate, the national parliaments.
We also need an annual evaluation as a necessary component of any agreement, and the evaluation reports must be publicly accessible.
Clearly, the rules governing personal data need urgently to be protected under the third pillar, as do global standards covering all the categories of personal data.
