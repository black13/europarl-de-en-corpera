Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very well remember the statements by Chancellor Merkel in Strasbourg, in which she rightly spoke of European values and also about our need to get across to people, and make it clear to them, what Europe's strong points are.
Mr Gloser, this would appear to be a case in which we should explain to people that the European Union helps them safeguard their rights.
We are not concerned in this instance with the issue of combating terrorism.
There is consensus in this House on that matter, and it does not need to be discussed.
Where, however, do we stand, then, in this debate?
We began by discussing airline passenger data, and now we come on to SWIFT.
In view of the speed with which the Council debate is currently being conducted, it is to be feared that, over the next few years, we may possibly have further SWIFTs to contend with, but we still have not made further progress.
In the meantime, we have a situation in which, under pressure from the United States, a European company signs a memorandum of understanding with the Americans, which Europeans are unable to scrutinise.
Moreover, SWIFT still does not even have a registered office in the United States, but only a data bank.
That is sufficient for American regulators to be able to take SWIFT to task in Belgium.
This is like a running theme.
There is more and more American regulation of European affairs, appropriated by the United States without we Europeans managing to adopt corresponding countermeasures and to monitor the effects of these.
I would therefore, bearing in mind that Germany does not only have the Presidency of the European Council but also chairs the G7, urge the Commission to take an active stance in this area and, as well as investigating matters, to resolve one issue: how, on the basis of our common values and while adhering to data protection requirements and safeguarding human dignity, are we to join together in combating terrorism?
