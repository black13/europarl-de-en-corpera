Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, none us in this House disputes the fact that there needs to be enhanced prevention of terrorism in the future.
However, the issue inevitably arises of the means to be used in this connection, as well as the issue of the strategies to be adopted.
Undoubtedly, international cooperation and the exchange of data are just as much a part of the process as, on the other hand, legal certainty and the necessary data protection.
As all of us do in this House, I support transatlantic cooperation in this connection.
We must, however, attach importance to seeing a balance maintained between security and the combating of terrorism, on the one hand, and data protection, on the other.
If, moreover, it is now a question of negotiating a new agreement, then this new agreement needs to fulfil certain basic preconditions.
Firstly, personal data needs to be given the same level of protection as has already been achieved in the interim agreement.
Secondly, the airlines must be afforded legal certainty so that the promise to switch over to a push system, enabling us to control which data is delivered to whom and at which juncture, is kept.
The purpose for which the data can be used must also, of course, be laid down so that the data can only, and is only allowed to, be used for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism.
There should also in future be a duty to provide travellers with information in this connection.
I would make one last point, which I do think is important.
In negotiating the new agreement, added value should also be created.
As soon as an act of terrorism is suspected, the US authorities should be obliged to notify the corresponding judicial and police authorities in the Member States, as well as the corresponding EU institutions, namely Europol or Eurojust.
If all this is guaranteed, we shall have available to us a further instrument designed to make EU citizens more secure.
