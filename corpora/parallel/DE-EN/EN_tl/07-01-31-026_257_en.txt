on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I, too, should like to join in congratulating the rapporteur.
The idea prevailed for a long time that protection of the environment and sustainable development were luxury items that could not be discussed, let alone achieved, until a society had developed to a certain level.
Sustainable development has since then become one of the millennium development goals, since the effects of poor environmental conditions impact poorer people far more directly.
Their living conditions are largely dependent on access to natural resources - for example, 90% of people living in absolute poverty are dependent on woods for a living.
It is also the case that the developing countries are harder hit by the consequences of climate change than the industrial nations that are largely responsible for it, and so the Commission's proposal for a Europe-wide reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars by 2012 is to be welcomed.
In this report, we are again calling on the United States, but also on India and China, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and to join with the European Union in taking responsibility for sustainable development worldwide.
While the building of infrastructure can be an important factor in sustainable development, it is also important that social and environmental considerations be borne in mind, and so we urge the Commission to have an environmental impact assessment carried out on every project receiving financial support from the EU and made available to the public.
We are again and again shocked by reports of the inhuman conditions under which people in developing countries have to work, and the code of practice for European businesses operating in such countries really must be made more effective.
We must also play our part in ensuring that the International Labour Organisation's core labour standards are applied.
