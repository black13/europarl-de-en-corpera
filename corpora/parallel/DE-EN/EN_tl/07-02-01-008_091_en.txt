in writing.
I cast my vote for the recommendation on the approval of partitioning systems to protect passengers against displaced luggage, supplied as non-original vehicle equipment, since this, firstly, makes easier trade in motor vehicles between one contracting party and another and, secondly, also guarantees a high standard of safety and environmental protection.
With these considerations in mind, I can do no other than support the harmonisation of the rules applicable to motor vehicles.
