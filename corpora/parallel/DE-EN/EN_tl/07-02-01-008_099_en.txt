Over the past fifteen years we have made progress in combating poverty, albeit far from to the extent we had hoped, for even if we manage to drive a country's economic development forward, this does not mean by a long chalk that poverty has thereby been reduced.
Funds intended for those in disadvantaged circumstances must not be allowed to seep away into corrupt systems or be able to be used even for such things as the purchase of weaponry or the shoring up of dictatorial regimes.
It is here that effectiveness needs to be better monitored if development funds are to be applied in the right place and for the right purposes.
It might also be worth considering concentrating them on what are termed 'anchor countries', which are capable of fast-forwarding a whole region's development, and we should also be open to new approaches, including the use of microcredit as a means of getting the poor permanently back on their own feet.
