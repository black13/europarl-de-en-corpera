on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, it is repeatedly made clear to us by the various discussions in the media that this is an important subject; it is one that we should not simply let pass on the nod, and I hope that the rapporteur, too, can agree with us on that.
As you mentioned, there are two possibilities: Thursday afternoon might well be one of them, but, as there are - or so I gather - fewer Members pressing to speak on Thursday morning, that might be another option, and then the vote could be held at Thursday lunchtime.
Both are workable options.
We would prefer Thursday morning, but have no objection to the afternoon.
