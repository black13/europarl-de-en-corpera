rapporteur. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not, of course, have any objection to this subject being debated; I am happy to see one.
I would only ask, though, that the vote on it should be held this week, since the committees have come to an amicable agreement on this and the Council intends to agree to whatever we adopt in this House relatively rapidly and promptly.
If we are to take this legislative report on Thursday afternoon, it would probably not be advisable to vote on it at the same time, and hence my request that the debate be scheduled either on Thursday morning or on Wednesday evening, since there are windows left on both days.
If we do that, we could vote on Thursday at midday.
