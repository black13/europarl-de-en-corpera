Mr President, yes, of course, we can have the vote on Thursday afternoon.
There is a reason why I find Wednesday problematic, and it is that I gather that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would like to have Darfur put on the agenda, the plan being, I believe, for this to be discussed on Wednesday evening, but we would like to have the Gahler report moved to Wednesday, on the grounds that a large number of Members have indicated their desire to speak to the reports by Mrs Batzeli, Mr Goepel and Mrs Hall, so we are not going to manage with the time available.
We would be very satisfied if it were possible to discuss Mr Lehne's report on Thursday morning and to vote on it at noon.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
