on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, as I have just explained, I am working on the assumption that Darfur - which also has to do with development issues - is going to be debated on Wednesday evening.
We would like the Gahler report to be debated that evening as well.
We have informed our group of this, but I do not know whether the rapporteur is aware of this or whether he can manage that time.
The fact is that we will be having a lot of speakers to the other reports, particularly to Mrs Batzeli's, wine being such an important subject, especially in terms of Europe's agricultural development, and so, if that were possible, we would be very much in favour of it.
