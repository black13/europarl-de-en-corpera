on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mrs Bozkurt for her report, which described the situation of women in Turkey very well.
Even two years on from its first publication, and despite the small amount of progress that has been made, I see that there are still serious deficits as regards the equality of women and men in Turkey.
The problem lies mainly in the high level of illiteracy, which stands at 25%, rising as far as 40% in some regions - and the still very small number of women in decision-making positions at local and national level.
What I find even more appalling, though, is the continuing violence against women.
Mrs Bozkurt rightly takes a critical line in her report on the regrettable and continuing lack of exact data on this, and what I find disconcerting in this regard is the fact that, in Turkey, which has a population of 70 million people, there are no more than thirty women's refuges, even though Turkish law requires that a refuge for victims of violence be set up in communities with over 50 000 residents.
As regards honour killings, one gets the impression that the number of them has decreased since the penalty was made tougher, but I cannot dispel my own concern that the increased incidence of suicide in some regions might well conceal honour killings.
The Turkish Government cannot - it must not - stand idly by and let these things happen.
It must compile reliable data and set up women's centres offering women facing the threat of violence not only protection but also emotional support.
That is the only way to offer women and girls, from the very outset, the prospect, most of all, of coming out unscathed from a situation that appears to be hopeless.
