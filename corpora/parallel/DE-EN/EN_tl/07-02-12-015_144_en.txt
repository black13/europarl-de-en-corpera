on behalf of the ITS Group. - Mr President, although the legal situation of women in Turkey has improved to some degree, we are a long way from being able to talk in terms of success.
If one considers how things work in practice and the attitudes of the broad majority of the population, it is at once clear that most of these improvements have been accomplished only on paper.
In theory, for example, domestic violence - which statistics show is frequently resorted to - now constitutes grounds for divorce, yet the incidence of divorce is lower in Turkey than in many other developing countries.
In what sense can the rule of law be said to apply when the state discontinues prosecutions when the suspect objects to them, and when women under threat only very rarely get protection from the police?
What is the point of making improvements to laws, when court rulings take them to absurd conclusions?
I also believe that the high level of illiteracy among women, and the high incidence of forced marriage, not to mention the increasing number of honour killings disguised as suicide, speak volumes, and, in the event of the poorly educated women losing their jobs - in which they may well work under conditions analogous to those of slavery - they do not even appear in the official statistics.
This falsification of the unemployment rate and the consequent threat of large-scale migration is reason enough for the EU to step on the emergency brake, for the way women are treated in Turkish society and their position in it constitute, as I see it, yet more proof that Turkey is not a European country and will never become one.
