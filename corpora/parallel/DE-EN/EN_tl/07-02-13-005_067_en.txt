Mr President, two things were of particular importance to us Austrians when it came to the revision of this framework directive on waste.
One was the special rule for organic waste, since both we and Germany have systems for dealing with this, which work very well and need to be maintained.
At the same time, though, we urge the Commission to keep working on this in order to establish a Europe-wide system for it.
The second thing we were concerned about was catering waste and waste from guesthouses, which can, after appropriate treatment, be reused in the husbandry of pigs.
That is quite essential if those and similar food flows are to be properly reprocessed.
