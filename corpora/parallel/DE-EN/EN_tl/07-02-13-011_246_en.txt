on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, the rapporteur really is a staunch champion of European wine.
I disagree with her in many regards, but one really has to give her credit for her commitment.
Even though I am inclined to welcome the Commission's proposals, I must point out that many regions perceive the liberalisation carefully implemented by these proposals as a rather unfeeling policy from Brussels.
This is something that should be taken seriously - the rapporteur also points it out.
When she invited us to a Greek wine evening, I fully agreed with her - and I hope I was not alone in this - that it would not occur to anyone to make the wine proffered to us there into pure spirit.
That is exactly the problem.
We must market wine as a quality product, and we must also give vintners the opportunity to do so.
On the subject of grubbing-up - which, it must be emphasised time and again, should not be compulsory, but should instead consist in offering vintners the chance of ceasing operations if they see no future in the wine market - the Commission should take measures to shape a better future for the market.
That is, vintners should first be made an offer, and then told that, if nothing can be done, they may leave viniculture with the help of public funds.
Then there is the matter of the regions.
Commissioner, this is a question of money.
The regions have been receiving money, and to discontinue a given measure now will deprive them of this money.
The fight is for purely material things, therefore.
The regions should be assured here, too, that these funds will remain at their disposal - according to specific social and environmental criteria and with regard to the market - so that these regions can continue to be wine-producing regions.
Taking this course would remove a great deal of the tension and also enable agreement with the rapporteur.
