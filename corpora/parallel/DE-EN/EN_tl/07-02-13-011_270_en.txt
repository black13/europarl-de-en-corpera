Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in thanking the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs for their work.
This is the third reform of the wine sector in 12 years, and I am glad that a Commission Communication has now made it possible to reconcile the very different positions and objectives.
The reason our points of view started out so divergent is that wine is a very emotional subject.
I always say that wine is among the most elegant of agricultural products.
This divergence is also evidenced by the tabling of almost 600 amendments.
In my opinion, a great deal of this report can be seen in a very positive light.
It contains many compromises.
I should like to emphasise in particular that traditional oenological practices really have been taken into account.
It must be made quite clear, however, that there is no option whatsoever for duplicate compensation or support for the regions, as we could not justify that to the European taxpayer.
One problem remains that is of significance to Austria.
Proper account has yet to be taken of the issue of the labelling of table wines.
At all events, we want to see table wines labelled differently from quality wines.
There must be a clear distinction for consumers.
Finally, I would ask the Commissioner to read this own-initiative report carefully.
I am convinced that she and all her staff will do so.
It contains some good proposals, which the Commission will hopefully incorporate into its proposal on the new common organisation of the market in wine that it is due to present to us in the summer.
