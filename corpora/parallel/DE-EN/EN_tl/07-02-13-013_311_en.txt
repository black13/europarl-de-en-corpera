Madam President, I shall be brief.
From the point of view of my group, which welcomes the Commission's approach in principle, there are five important points.
We want to ensure that the new approach proposed by the Commission does not result in the formation of oligopolies.
Germany has had bad experiences with the auctioning of UMTS licences.
Our group wants services ensuring diversity to take priority at all times.
I agree with Mrs Trautmann that broadcasters should always enjoy particular respect for the job they do, for our societies and the public.
We want to see technical neutrality and interoperability.
We want to really see blanket coverage.
This is important to the Commissioner, too, since she bears co-responsibility for rural affairs.
We in rural areas do not want to be disadvantaged any more, and we, too, want access to high-speed Internet connections.
In addition, the procedures for auctions should be fully transparent and comprehensible in future.
