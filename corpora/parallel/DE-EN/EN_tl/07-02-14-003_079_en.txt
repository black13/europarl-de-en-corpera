Mr President, much as I would like to make the vote a shorter business, I do have to point out that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has submitted to the Tabling Office a list of the votes that we want to split, and this list - which has also been endorsed by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group - must be followed in the voting process.
Everything else can be voted on en bloc.
We can agree to things being handled in this way, but, if they are not, we will have to take everything one thing at a time.
