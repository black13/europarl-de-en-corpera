Mr President, the oral amendment has been agreed with Mr Fava, so it enjoys the rapporteur's support.
It is an addition to paragraph 82 and I shall now proceed to read it out.
'Deplores the inquiry by the prosecutors of Hamburg North against three journalists of Stern magazine and one collaborator of the Financial Times Deutschland on the basis of complicity in betrayal of secrets'.
(The oral amendment was not accepted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 31
