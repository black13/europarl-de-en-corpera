Mr President, I rejoiced to learn that the report made it unequivocally clear that neither the Austrian Government nor any official entity or authority in Austria had any kind of improper part in this.
I have nevertheless voted against the report on the grounds that the assertions in it are made without the backing of any kind of proof, yet they have not been removed from it, and, above all that the factual error concerning Europol has not been deleted either.
What that means is that the report continues to contain a misrepresentation of the facts in which it is insinuated that Europol had employed members of the American secret services, something that is without any substance whatever and the very opposite of the truth.
A report containing errors such as these does damage to Parliament's credibility and is a contributory factor in so many of its Members having voted against the report as a whole.
