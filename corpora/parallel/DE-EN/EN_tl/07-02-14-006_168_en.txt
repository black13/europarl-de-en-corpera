The German Federal Government bears a great deal of shared responsibility for the CIA's torture flights; such is the verdict of the report of the committee investigating the CIA's activities, which was adopted in the European Parliament today.
The German Federal Government - a coalition composed of conservatives and social democrats - can no longer avoid facing up to the consequences, even though it is obvious that it has been in response to pressure from it that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament have watered down some of the report's language.
The European Parliament has come to the conclusion that, 'according to information given by Murat Kurnaz's lawyer and information provided by the German authorities, there was a prospect of the release of Murat Kurnaz from Guant√°namo in 2002 but this was not accepted by the German authorities' and that 'Murat Kurnaz's lawyer was told by the German Government that it was impossible to open negotiations with the US Government on his release because Murat Kurnaz was a Turkish citizen' even though 'all investigations had established, by as early as at the end of October 2002, that Murat Kurnaz posed no terrorist threat'.
My colleagues and I are agreed that this gross misconduct on the part of the representatives of the former Social Democrat/Green Federal Government needs to be investigated.
The foreign minister, Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who formerly coordinated Germany's secret services, should desist from deceiving the public and at last face up to his responsibility for what happened back then.
