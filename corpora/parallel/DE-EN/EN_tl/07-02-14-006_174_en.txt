in writing.
I reject the CIA report on the grounds that it does not do even the most basic of the things that I expect of a report from a committee of inquiry, whether in terms of its methodology or of its analytical processes.
The conclusions differ in no way from those reached by the Council of Europe's investigator Dick Marty, some of whose former witnesses have since changed their minds.
Although this should not be taken to mean that I approve of what the USA has done, I have to say that, in this report, truth, facts and honesty have given way to suppositions and accusations.
