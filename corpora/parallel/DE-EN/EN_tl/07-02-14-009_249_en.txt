on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, I have to say, Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García, that your speech was markedly better than your report, a certain amount of material in which was, I am aware, whispered in your ear, and it is regrettable that the Committee on Development's opinion was not also adopted.
Terrorism, of any kind, is utterly unacceptable, but it is unfortunate that the report provides us with no concrete definition of what terrorism is, although it always talks in terms of 'international terrorism'.
There exists the widest possible variety of groups, which, for the most diverse reasons, believe that they have to commit terrorist acts.
We have to consider each of them individually and establish just why they come to the erroneous conclusion that terrorist acts are necessary.
It also appears to me that whole subjects have been left out completely - state-sponsored terrorism, for example.
What about France's past attack on the Greenpeace ship?
As a number of Members have already said, we have to address the causes of terrorism.
At the moment, the Western states are engaged in a war on terror - in Afghanistan and Iraq - that is proving to be completely counter-productive, for while this war is being waged, terrorism is on the increase rather than declining.
We read in the report that measures are to be made more stringent in all manner of ways, and that fundamental rights are to be more and more eroded, and it is for that reason that we cannot endorse it.
We have therefore submitted a minority report on the subject.
