on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing I have to say is that the 'Lisbon Strategy' label now gets stuck on everything, irrespective of how little it has to do with the Strategy's original objective.
Although it was employment policy that first prompted the Lisbon Strategy and constituted its primary goal, that is now becoming no more than an appendix to it.
This redefinition has been accomplished as a matter of policy, as a means of obfuscation and avoiding the admission that, while the EU's economic data may be taking a turn for the better, no comparable upward trend is to be found in the employment figures.
Secondly, I would like to remind the House that the EU's Heads of State or Government, at every spring summit, undertake to apply the growth and employment guidelines to their own national policies.
Thirdly, when they do so, the core concern is to combat the social exclusion of people, for that is the only way to effectively reduce long-term unemployment and poverty, and, in so doing, particular attention needs to be given to groups who, by reason of their personal characteristics, are especially subject to discrimination in trying to get into the labour market, such as, for example, people with disabilities and migrant women.
This year, though, the Council and the Commission have simply allowed this core concern to be forgotten about, even though there is no cause for them to do so, for exclusion is as much a problem as it ever was.
We cannot accept that employment policy should be biased towards those who are already in work.
The guideline currently in force must be taken as seriously as it ever has been, and the great coalition must not be allowed to get away with giving it a different priority and simply looking away when social need is most pressing.
