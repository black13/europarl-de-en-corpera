Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the broad economic policy guidelines could be described as a moral, or regulatory, framework for the Member States, since economic policy is a matter for the Member States but our objectives are pan-European.
This tension characterises all our debates.
Those failing to comply with the broad economic policy guidelines undermine and endanger European economic policy objectives.
Secondly, we are seeing a welcome development in economic policy, one that will provide the scope and tailwind for us to apply ourselves to our policy objectives and the necessary reform measures more actively, proactively and courageously than without the economic upswing.
Thirdly, there is no contradiction between the tasks of utilising the internal market, pursuing the Lisbon objectives, complying with the Stability and Growth Pact and meeting the challenge of the consequences of demographic developments.
On the contrary, all these measures must be taken if we are to realise the EU's broad economic policy guidelines and their objectives.
That is why I say that it is not true what is often bandied about in election campaigns: that the independence of the European Central Bank - as the French believe - or the objectives of the EU are the cause of national problems.
Instead, it is the failure to meet these objectives that is causing growth and employment problems at national level.
Let us use the time at our disposal to apply ourselves more actively to our objectives and our agreed policy reforms.
Let us reform our social security systems so that we are able to meet the challenge of globalisation.
Let us make energy efficiency and the strengthening of innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises the model for the European Economic Area, and let us improve economic policy structures - let us make savings to give ourselves scope for the investment needed - to make ourselves sustainably competitive at global level.
