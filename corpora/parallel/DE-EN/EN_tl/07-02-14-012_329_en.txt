President-in-Office of the Council.
The EU-Africa Ministerial Conference held on 22-23 November 2006 in Tripoli was an important event, bringing together for the first time all the Member States of the EU and - I should like to underline this very clearly - all African countries, namely the members of the African Union plus Morocco, to discuss migration and development issues.
The purpose of the Conference was to strengthen cooperation in the spirit of partnership in these fields, which are of vital importance to both sides, and also to decide on joint action.
The Ministerial Conference closed by adopting a political declaration listing a series of fields in which action is needed, from development issues through to legal channels for immigration and the fight against illegal immigration.
In addition, an Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and Children was adopted.
The implementation of these two instruments is expected to begin in the next few months.
