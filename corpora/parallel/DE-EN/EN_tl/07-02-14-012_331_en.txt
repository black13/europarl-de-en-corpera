Mr Medina Ortega, a whole package of measures was discussed at the Conference in Tripoli, since we take the view that the migration problem cannot be solved by a single proposal or solution, and that a series of measures is needed.
The issue of legal migration was also discussed, including various points relating to the feasibility of addressing this aspect.
Equally, however, the Conference addressed the feasibility of Africans who live in Europe - in the Diaspora, as they see it - returning to their home countries for a given period to help with the development of education systems and with job creation, for example.
It also discussed the possibility of reducing the cost of money transfers to these countries.
For example, it could happen that, out of EUR 1 000 remitted to a country, only EUR 800 reaches the recipient since the charges are so high.
A whole package of measures was discussed with the countries of the African Union plus Morocco, therefore.
Furthermore, discussions are continuing on what possibilities the EU and the African countries could open up for temporary employment in Europe, for example.
