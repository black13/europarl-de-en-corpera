Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, another of the objectives of this Conference was undoubtedly to discuss ways of reducing the causes of migration; that is, to take the relevant preventive action.
There are good examples of where such action has been very effective, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo.
There, European police units have provided assistance in the field of legal education and the military field, resulting in the development of the rule of law, with a view to achieving greater stability and enabling economic investment.
Are we prepared to extend this model to other African countries, too, since we know that migration flows come not only from North Africa but also from Central and Southern Africa, where there is instability?
