President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Pirker, back in July, a Conference was held in Rabat: not one entitled 'EU-Africa', but one initiated by Morocco, Spain and France.
This addressed the West African migration route.
It became clear at the Tripoli Conference, however, that there is a further African route, the East-West route, that should also be the focus of our attention.
To return to your specific question, however, there are indeed examples of successful action.
Another important thing that this Conference needed to make clear was that one way of tackling the causes is through 'best governance', by the Government choosing a form of governance that gives its citizens the chance to become involved in the generation and sale of raw materials and in education.
The obligation of the EU - the Member States - to offer assistance in the field of administration and of police and judiciary systems, where this is requested, was also emphasised.
A few years ago, in the course of various debates in Europe, 'best practices' were discussed - that is, looking at what one's neighbours are doing successfully - and this concept could certainly be transferred to certain African countries.
This kind of comprehensive approach was discussed, and it is now up to us to decide what action to take in the various fields - although I have to say that not all measures are needed in all cases, as some countries have already made very great progress thanks to domestic developments.
However, the EU did give assurances of its support and solidarity on this.
