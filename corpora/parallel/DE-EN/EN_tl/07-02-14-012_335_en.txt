President-in-Office of the Council.
The important thing - as Mr Pirker has just mentioned - is to address the causes of this migration.
Solutions must be found to these.
There will always be migration, for various reasons, but, in many regions, the reason is the lack of prospects there.
That is why we have to address the first point; that is, to eliminate the causes of migration in these countries.
There are various other fields in addition to this, which have just been mentioned: such as exploring how to enable those wanting to work in Europe for a fixed period to do so legally, and how they can start work.
Finally, we must look into how to integrate people seeking employment or trying to make a living here.
The most important point, however, is the first approach, namely obviating the need for flight on account of economic pressures or, as is sometimes the case, of human rights violations.
