President-in-Office of the Council.
In the course of our debate a little while ago, we discussed the employment issue and the fact that different countries have different structures and developments.
There are overlaps, where we see the same trends in different Member States.
Here, too, it is primarily a matter of taking stock and of seeing what specific answers can be found.
In my answer just now, I mentioned several fields that we wish to develop in order to bring this issue into even sharper focus, several of which concern young people.
In the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the following questions arise.
How do we ensure that young people find a vocational training place or job?
What prejudices are there in society, for example against young people from migrant backgrounds?
These are all issues we hope to discuss at various conferences this year.
