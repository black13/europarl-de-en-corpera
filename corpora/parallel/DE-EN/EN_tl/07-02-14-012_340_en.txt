Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if we want to see a sensible demographic trend in Europe, we must at any rate stop clinging to our ideologically skewed, hypocritical blinkers and dreaming of a model of life that existed perhaps 200 years ago.
Children are brought to life not only within traditional families, but also within other models of life.
We have an example of favourable demographic trends here in the EU - in France - as childcare places there are sufficient and affordable.
I should be interested to hear what the President-in-Office is planning in this connection.
