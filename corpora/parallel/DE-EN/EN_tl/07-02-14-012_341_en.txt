President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Leichtfried, many thanks for your supplementary question.
Here, too, we can pick up the thread of previous discussions at Spring Summits, where the generation of investment in the Member States to enable the reconciliation of family and career has been mentioned.
A number of aspects should certainly be considered in this regard.
A key point, however, is that people have been singling out France and other Member States that are enjoying certain successes.
I hail from one country where the situation is unsatisfactory, but where attempts are being made to find a solution.
It is important not to offer a centralised solution, but instead to be guided by the principle of looking at neighbours who are doing things successfully and seeing how we can implement these accordingly at home.
That is the way to finally achieve an outcome different from the one we are seeing now.
