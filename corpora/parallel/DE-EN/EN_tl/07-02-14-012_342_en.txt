My question concerns the common measures that could help us.
What does the President-in-Office think of the suggestion that the German Presidency - together with the European Commission, of course - select and recommend the best examples in Europe?
He has mentioned France, but there are other good examples, too.
This would be of particular value to the new Member States.
