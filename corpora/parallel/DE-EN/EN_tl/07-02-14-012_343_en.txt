President-in-Office of the Council.
I shall gladly take up that suggestion again.
It is a valuable idea: rather than keeping quiet, as it were, about the positive developments in the EU, the things that have had positive results, we should find out whether they might also work in our own country on account of our similar structures.
I shall be happy to take this idea away with me and present it to my country's Minister, Mrs von der Leyen, who is of course the current Council President responsible for family affairs, women, youth and senior citizens.
