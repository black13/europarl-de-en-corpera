President-in-Office of the Council.
The decision to designate 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All was approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2006.
The Council agreed that all the types of discrimination stated in Article 13 of the EC Treaty should be covered and addressed equally, including all the groups concerned, by the various measures to be carried out at European and national level.
In the negotiations with Parliament, the Council gave its agreement to including an express mention of the Roma population in the Decision establishing the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
The text contains a recital detailing the situation of the Roma in Europe, in which Parliament draws attention to the prevalence of anti-Roma sentiment and its discriminatory effect on the opportunities in terms of employment, education and social services for the European Union's most disadvantaged ethnic-minority group.
It must be borne in mind, however, that the work as part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All 2007 is based on the principles of personal responsibility and subsidiarity.
Each Member State is therefore responsible for deciding what measures to carry out in the coming months.
