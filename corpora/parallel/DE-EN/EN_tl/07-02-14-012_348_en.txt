President-in-Office of the Council.
Baroness Ludford, on the subject of subsidiarity, Member States do indeed bear responsibility.
The large number of progress reports drawn up in the course of the accession of the Eastern European Member States included an examination of the minorities issue from many angles, particularly concerning all aspects of the situation of the Roma.
It is always important to bear that in mind.
On the other hand, there is also scope for establishing programmes to promote the integration of the Roma population, including with the involvement of the World Bank.
I believe that this is an issue that cannot be solved by the respective Member States alone, and that the integration of these sections of the population requires assistance from others.
