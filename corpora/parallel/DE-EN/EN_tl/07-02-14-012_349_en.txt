Mr President-in-Office, I have a question on this subject.
We agree that non-discrimination is a question of time.
In my home country, authorities operating not at national but at lower level are currently endeavouring to impose bans on begging, for example.
They believe that this will offer a solution to the occurrence of at least some phenomena.
In my view, this is the wrong approach.
What is the Council's opinion?
