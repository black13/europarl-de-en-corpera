President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Leichtfried, all the measures taken locally fall within the competence of the Member State concerned; the Council does not have any scope for imposing any requirements.
There are certain fields, of course - for example with regard to the anti-discrimination Directive - where certain measures may be taken, but this is ultimately a decision for the Member State concerned and not something on which an opinion can be expressed at European level.
Subject: Environmental emissions trading scheme
What is the view of the Council on current progress in achieving the aims of the European emissions trading scheme?
Are Member States making genuine progress in cutting carbon emissions?
What measures will the current Presidency take to encourage action by Member States?
