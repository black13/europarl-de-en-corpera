President-in-Office of the Council.
The EU emissions trading scheme is one of the most important policy instruments at the disposal of the European Community and its Member States for achieving their Kyoto objectives in the most cost-effective way.
As the honourable Member will be aware, Directive 2003/87/EC obliges Member States to publish their national allocation plans.
They have to notify these to the Commission and to the other Member States at least 18 months before the beginning of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, namely 2008-2012.
The Commission has evaluated the Member States' national allocation plans.
The Presidency will continue reviewing this EU emissions trading scheme on the basis of the Commission Communication, which identifies the priority issues.
The Presidency will also follow up the proposal to bring aviation into this scheme.
The Presidency is working towards ensuring that the emissions trading scheme makes the expected contribution to the achievement of the Kyoto objectives, and is working to improve and extend this EU scheme with a view to establishing a global carbon market that leads to the emission reductions needed to tackle climate change.
