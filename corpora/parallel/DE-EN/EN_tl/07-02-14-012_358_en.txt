President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Martin, it would indeed be insufficient to confine our action to the EU.
As we know, Germany also holds the Presidency of the G8, and it is becoming clear that the fields of energy, environmental protection and the fight against climate change will also be important topics for discussion there, for example with the major consumer countries China and the United States.
This does not mean, however, that we are waiting for the eventuality that an agreement is reached there.
We must set a good example to the newly industrialised countries whilst also conducting negotiations with the consumer countries.
Subject: Internet broadcasting of Council deliberations
What assessment has been made of the effects of internet broadcasting of legislative discussions of the Council in accordance with the desire to make EU proceedings more open and transparent?
