President-in-Office of the Council.
The Presidency would like to answer Mr Davis's question with reference to its report on the implementation of its overall policy on transparency and the assessment of its impact on the effectiveness of the Council's work - I am afraid it is a very long title - that the Presidency presented to the Council on 11 December 2006.
In addition to a preliminary assessment of the impact of the rising number of public debates and deliberations on the effectiveness of the Council's work, the report contains data on the number of visits to the new Council video streaming website and to the website providing access to Council documents relating to public deliberations or debates.
In the first four-and-a-half months of the new transparency measures alone, over 28 000 visits to these new features of the Council website were recorded.
These figures document the positive response of the public and the media to the new transparency measures.
The webcast and the online availability of documents relating to public sessions have thus considerably improved opportunities for following the debates and decision-making processes in the Council.
The Council is constantly striving to improve these features.
Concerning the impact of these transparency measures on the effectiveness of the Council's work, it should be borne in mind that, at the time of the initial evaluation, which the European Council had called for in June 2006, the new rules had been in operation for less than six months, including the month of August.
This means that it was, and still is, too early to issue a definitive evaluation.
