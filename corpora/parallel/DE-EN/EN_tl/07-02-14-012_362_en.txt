President-in-Office of the Council.
As I have already explained, this has been in operation for only a few months, which is not enough time to enable a final analysis at this stage.
I do believe, however, that the figures indicate the interest there has been.
We have talked a good deal about transparency and communicating European policy today, and also about taking decisions close to the citizen.
It remains the ongoing task of many actors in the EU to seek ways of making these policies more transparent.
After a while, when we have reliable data at our disposal, we shall consider where further improvements can be made, and how to attract a broader population of users.
I would appeal for a little patience until we have more reliable figures.
