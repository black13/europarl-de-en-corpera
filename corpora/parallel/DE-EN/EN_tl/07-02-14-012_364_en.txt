President-in-Office of the Council.
I do not know what impression the honourable Member's work as a civil servant in the EU gave him in general, but I should just like to say that the idea was to create more transparency.
It depends on the subject - the topics that have to be discussed can seem very technocratic to the outside observer.
I shall reiterate that what we are concerned with here is improving transparency, and we have already taken a step forward in this regard.
I am well aware that it is not enough; I am sure there are further possibilities.
As for the assistants you mention, however: there are really not that many of them.
Subject: Status of Kosovo
How does the German Council Presidency rate the prospects of the forthcoming decisions on the status of Kosovo, and is it preparing the ground for the EU to increase its involvement with the governance and security of this country?
