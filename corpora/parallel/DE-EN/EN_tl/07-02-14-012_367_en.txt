Mr President-in-Office, many thanks for that very good, precise reply.
The longer the settlement of the status issue is delayed, the greater the risk of instability in Kosovo - and this, in turn, could be used to effect the partition of Kosovo after all, even through the back door.
My question is a specific one: could a more intensive international and EU presence - in terms of both civilian and military forces - perhaps be envisaged for, say, potential crisis regions such as Mitrovica; one far exceeding the present dimensions and along the lines of what was seen in Vukovar?
