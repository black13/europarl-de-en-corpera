President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Posselt, you speak of delays and the potential risks these entail.
It is very important that we have stated that a solution is needed - and the General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed this very intensively on Monday.
There is nothing in the Council Conclusions to indicate that things are being put off indefinitely.
On the contrary, we have used the opinions voiced - including on the occasion of the EU Troika meeting in Belgrade - as an opportunity to say that a new parliament is indeed emerging from the democratic forces, that a new government will also be formed; and that we have to give these a while longer to enable the appointment of the new negotiating team so that it can join the negotiations.
The Council has been conscious that we cannot let the whole process start again from scratch, however, as the timing is indeed important if we are to avoid the instability you mention.
For this reason, I do not wish to speculate at this time on other things that may or may not happen.
