President-in-Office of the Council.
I should like to reiterate once more that we are currently at a very important stage of the status process.
Account must always be taken of developments in Serbia, too, however.
The tight deadline that has now been set is important to enable the process to continue.
As we know, it is not the EU alone that decides; the Special Representative of the Secretary-General must of course present proposals to the United Nations to enable the necessary steps to be taken.
