President-in-Office of the Council.
In any case, the latter staff figures you mention will not be of that magnitude; instead, this will be the largest civilian mission in the field of judicial and police matters.
I am happy to share with you the specific figures proposed with regard to this mission, however, and to explain what this ultimately means.
The resources necessary for this mission are considerable and will constitute a large part of our budget.
Subject: House of Lords, 50th Report, 'Financial Management and Fraud in the European Union: Perceptions, Facts and Proposals' (published on 13 November 2006)
On page 47 (para.
172) of its above-mentioned report, the United Kingdom House of Lords states the following: 'We consider that the Budget Council should be at least as concerned with the Union's accounts as it is with drawing up the Budget.
We therefore consider that the Budget Council should prepare a report on the annual audit and Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors.
This would be debated by the European Parliament at the same time as the Court of Auditor's report.'
How does the Council view this House of Lords proposal that there should be a report?
