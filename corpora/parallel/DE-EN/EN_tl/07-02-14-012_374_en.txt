President-in-Office of the Council.
The Council attaches very great importance to the annual audit and Statement of Assurance of the Court of Auditors and has repeatedly affirmed its unwavering support for sound financial management in the EU.
Following a detailed examination of the annual report of the European Court of Auditors by the appropriate Council bodies, the Council sends Parliament a recommendation on discharge pursuant to Article 276(1) of the EC Treaty for each financial year.
This recommendation on discharge contains the extensive conclusions of the Council on the Court of Auditors' annual report, in which the Council addresses, in detail, the observations of the Court of Auditors and the Commission's opinions on these.
The conclusions also contain recommendations to the Commission and the Member States for eliminating any shortcomings or weaknesses discovered.
These Council conclusions are debated by Parliament at the same time as the Court of Auditors' annual report as part of the discharge procedure.
It does not seem appropriate to introduce another Council report - which would of necessity have largely the same content - in addition to these detailed conclusions.
