This issue is not a new one and is being addressed by many experts.
I should like to emphasise once more, however, that, where there is budgetary control, this is not necessarily a matter of a request by the Court of Auditors, but rather of the following question.
How can we make the rules, including budgetary rules, more efficient, more transparent, more uniform, so that the necessary control can be achieved?
There is not the necessary majority support for a change among the Member States.
