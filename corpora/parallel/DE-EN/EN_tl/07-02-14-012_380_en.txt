President-in-Office of the Council.
I do not actually know at the moment which Member States we are talking about.
I can assure the honourable Member, however, that it is the vast majority.
There is no point in cherry-picking at this time.
Other proposals have been put forward, however, including by the Commission, such as the creation of an integrated control framework.
The national declaration of assurance is also excluded here, however.
There are many other elements, including in the context of personal responsibility, that could help ensure that budgetary control is exercised properly at the end of the day.
In addition, irrespective of the question of political will, the EC Treaty does not provide for the field mentioned by the honourable Member.
I do believe, however, that the other possibilities I have just mentioned for simplifying procedures represent key elements.
