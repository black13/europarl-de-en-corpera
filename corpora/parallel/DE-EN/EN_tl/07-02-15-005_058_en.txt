Madam President, I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to and supported this very difficult project.
Not everything has been resolved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, but that is inevitable with such a difficult compromise.
Nevertheless, we have taken a significant step towards making it easier for European shareholders to exercise their ownership rights.
In Europe, there are no large strides towards our ultimate goal, but only accumulations of small steps - and the issue of shareholders' rights is no exception.
I wish to conclude on this note, express my thanks and forgo the remainder of my speaking time.
