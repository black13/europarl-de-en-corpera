Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all of you for attending this debate on Tibet - particularly now that we have reached an important point, with solutions to a problem that has been smouldering away for decades within reach.
This is only the case, however, if the Chinese Government, too, stops deliberately raising certain issues as stumbling blocks.
For example, it is unacceptable to put the spotlight on the history issue; that is, to ask whether or not Tibet was ever part of China.
This is completely the wrong question to ask.
Instead we must look to the future.
We have to keep repeating that the Dalai Lama and the Tibetans themselves are striving for autonomy - and not just on paper - allowing them cultural and religious freedom and access to education.
They are not questioning the 'one China' policy.
This must be emphasised time and again, even if the solicitations from the Chinese Embassy that many of my fellow Members have no doubt received in recent days tell a quite different story.
I can tell you that we know how things stand.
We need dialogue, and we want this dialogue.
Europe must support it - I fully agree with the previous speaker on this.
Europe must bring this dialogue into much sharper focus and also conduct it at official level.
