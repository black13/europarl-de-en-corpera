on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, on 8 January, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) issued an urgent call for funding to the donor states for a new USD 60 million aid programme.
The object is to help hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the conflict in Iraq, irrespective of their faith.
Such massive movements of fleeing people are the results of a war that was begun against the will of the international community, yet it is the international community that now has to bear, and pay for, the terrible consequences.
We are currently witnessing the largest long-term exodus since the displacement of the Palestinians in 1948.
One in eight Iraqis is a refugee.
In 2006 alone, half a million Iraqis fled their country.
Every month, another 50 000 join them.
There may now be 1.7 million deracinated Iraqis in Iraq.
By the end of 2007, the UNHCR estimates this number could be 2.3 million.
The longer the conflict goes on, the worse will be the plight of these displaced persons and the communities that help them and that want to help them.
We call on the Member States and the Commission to support the UNHCR, politically and financially, in its work protecting the refugees, irrespective of their faith.
