author. - Mr President, as has been said already, Guinea's fishing, farming and raw material resources make it, potentially, a very prosperous country.
The fact that, despite this, the country is languishing in miserable poverty is a result of the terrible mismanagement, the dictatorship and the abysmal administration by the state that have obtained there for decades and I am most grateful to Mr Matsakis for having pointed out that Sékou Touré, to whom Mr Meijer referred, was one of worst dictators ever to rule over it.
Today too, unfortunately, the prevailing state of affairs is anything but acceptable, for which reason we must call on the current transitional president - for he cannot be any more than this - to use the short period that remains to him to bring about an ordered transition to democracy and the rule of law.
He can only do this, however, if he does not name a puppet as prime minister, as he now has, but only if he truly commits to the demands of the trade unions and the democracy movement and constitutes a broad-based transitional government, including the forces of opposition, which then does nothing other than set about creating public order and preparing free elections so that the past terror and dictatorship can finally give place to democracy and prosperity.
