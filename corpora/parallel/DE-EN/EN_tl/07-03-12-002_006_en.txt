Mr President, I have a couple of questions to put to you and to the Secretary-General of this House.
I learned as early as last Thursday that a ceremony commemorating the victims of terrorism was to be held here this afternoon before this plenary sitting began.
I take it as read that it was of an appropriately dignified character, and do not indeed doubt that it was, for I see the occasion, and the need for such a ceremony, as important.
What I am not willing to accept, however, is the way in which this was prepared and staged, and I would also like to tell the Secretary-General, Mr RÃ¸mer, that I intend to energetically follow up what he said in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, so I will tell the plenary that I, the chairman of my group, had no advance notice of this event whatever.
I do not know whether the members or chairmen of other groups were informed of it, but I, in any case, was not.
When I, last Thursday, asked the Secretary-General and you how this had been prepared, I was told - for you left the answer to the Secretary-General - that it had been done in close cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and, that appearing to be to be an acceptable explanation, I declared myself content with it.
Since then, I have learned that neither the deputy chairman of that committee, Mr Lambrinidis - who is a member of my group - nor my group's coordinator, Mrs Roure, had had any word whatever of this event.
I think this House has earned the right to be allowed to take part in an event of this kind, and I would have been happy to be present in my capacity as a group chairman.
I do not think it helpful that Parliamentary business or initiatives of this kind should be staged in this building without Members of this House being present, and so I ask that, the next time events of this kind - which are, as I have said, useful - are prepared and held, a better job should be made of it.
