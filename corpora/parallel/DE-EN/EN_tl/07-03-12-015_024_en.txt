Mr President, I can, in fact, do no more than repeat what my colleague Mr Goebbels has already said.
We, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, are currently drafting a comprehensive report, which will also include opinions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It would, of course, be good if our committee's ongoing work were not to be prejudiced by the adoption of a resolution that had to be cobbled together within the space of three days, whereas we have been spending many weeks preparing a good document that, it is to be hoped, will enjoy broad support.
I think the sensible thing to do would be to have a debate on this - that is something we can certainly accept - while not adopting a resolution on it.
