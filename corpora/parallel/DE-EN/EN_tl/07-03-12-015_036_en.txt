Mr President, we have seen that World Women's Day was marked in Iran by demonstrations by women, which were then violently suppressed.
Over recent weeks, pressure on women's organisations in Iran generally has increased, and it is for that reason that we think it more relevant and more a matter of urgency that this be debated rather than the subject in relation to Nigeria.
