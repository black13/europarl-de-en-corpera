on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not just about lofty conceptions of competition or the free choice of artists, or about the inadequacies of the rights management company system; this is quite clearly about diversity, about the reduction of the market to mass production, or about the upholding of the European quality of diversity.
Yes, there are inadequacies, and they do have to be done away with, but I do not believe it is at all possible to do that in the way the Commission has tried to.
This report has occasioned a great deal of activity on the part of the lobbyists.
We got loads of letters; I am sure you got some too, perhaps from 'Writers and Composers for Choice', but, if you read that letter and look at the signatures, you cannot be sure that all the artists actually know what they are supposed to have signed.
I know people whose names appear on this list, but had not the least idea that their names were being used by an organisation in a letter of this sort.
That shows the efforts of a number of rights management companies that want to create a monopoly for themselves in a poor light.
