on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to start by thanking Mr El Khadraoui.
Whilst the agreement currently under discussion does reduce - at long last - some of the economic injustices suffered by Europe in the past, in a way it ignores the challenges of the future.
Unfortunately, the issue of air-transport emissions has been largely omitted, even though we must be aware in view of climate change that air transport, too, has to make a contribution to reducing atmospheric pollution.
I still see the unfortunate fact that complete reciprocity is yet to be achieved as a great problem.
We have to trust in a step-by-step plan for this.
If the United States should fail to adhere to this plan, Parliament must ensure that Europe shows backbone.
This goes for investment, and it should and must also go for the issue of the security of data transmission and, in particular, the issue of emission limits.
We must ensure that European interests are not sacrificed to certain sentimentalities, or individual economic interests put above the common interest.
Finally, I wanted to thank the Commissioner, too, for declaring that he supports opening the skies for all - which will please theologians: a very democratic approach that includes sinners.
