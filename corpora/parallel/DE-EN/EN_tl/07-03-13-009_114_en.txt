My reason for rejecting the Howitt report is that the most essential characteristic of Corporate Social Responsibility is voluntarism rather than dirigisme.
Mandatory social and environmental reporting goes against the Lisbon Strategy and militates against the reduction of bureaucracy to such an extent that I find myself unable to support it.
Such dirigisme handicaps and endangers most of all small and medium-sized businesses, which were and still are the backbone of the German economy.
It is out of concern at this approach that I firmly repudiate the report.
