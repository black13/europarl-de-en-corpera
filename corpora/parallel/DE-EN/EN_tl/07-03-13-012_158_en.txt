on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty faces dangers on many fronts, or so it appears from the latest reports.
According to the 3 March edition of the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, the Americans are planning new nuclear warheads, and that is something on which we take a critical line.
In the UK - an EU Member State - Mr Blair, the Prime Minister, wants to spend EUR 30 billion on modernising the British armed forces' nuclear weaponry.
The British House of Commons is due to vote on it tomorrow.
That is nuclear rearmament and puts the non-proliferation treaty at risk; a critical statement from the German Presidency of the Council is called for.
We endorse the protests against the nuclear programme whereby the USA plans a missile defence system in the Czech Republic, Poland and in the Caucasus, with NATO - according to Mr de Hoop Scheffer as reported yesterday - wanting to take part with one of its own.
The German Minister for the Armed Forces, Mr Jung, wants to put the whole system under NATO control.
It is about time the Council and the Commission got round to expressing forthright criticism of these anti-missile schemes, and, together with two colleagues, I have tabled a declaration expressing opposition to this system.
At the same time, according to the former NATO commander-in-chief Wesley Clark, preparations are in hand for a war against Iran.
It is hypocrisy to criticise Iran if we ourselves possess nuclear weapons and are engaged in updating them.
The nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty requires that all nuclear weapons be disposed of.
The fact is that there are no good nuclear weapons, and what is needed, and right now, is disarmament.
