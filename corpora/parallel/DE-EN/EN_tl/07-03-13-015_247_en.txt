Madam President, Commissioner, while it is important that the Member States should reinforce passengers' rights under this Regulation, it is also evident that, in the former text, we made a number of things too easy for the airlines.
For a start, we made no provision for financial compensation for delays, and, secondly, we are faced with the problem that the rules relating to force majeure are framed in such a way that the airlines all too often fob off passengers by saying that they cannot do anything about it, that it was a case of force majeure, whereas the simple fact of the matter is that something went wrong with the booking system.
Can we make any changes here?
