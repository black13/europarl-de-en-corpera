I, too, would also like to say something on the same subject, having recently received a very large number of letters and emails, the particular burden of which is that implementation is currently not working very well at all.
I would like to endorse what Mr Rack has said about the evident need for certain things not only to be better implemented but instead actually changed.
There is, I believe, a need not only for implementation, but also for more stringent legislation, to deal with the problem of aircraft that are not fully booked being dropped from the schedule simply on the grounds of force majeure, and I should be interested to learn what you are contemplating doing about this.
