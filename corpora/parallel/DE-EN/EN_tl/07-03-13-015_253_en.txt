Thank you very much, Commissioner, and not only for the outstandingly good reply, for the fact is that, without you and Mr Balazs, no such splendid progress could have been made on this matter, which has been dormant for decades, and it is you who have really got things on the move.
I have a brief supplementary question, which has to do with the MÃ¼hldorf Link to Salzburg and to the progress made with the work between Munich and Salzburg.
The second thing I wanted to touch on has to do with the timetables, in that, for example, there is now an early morning InterCity train from Vienna to Munich, but when you arrive on it in Munich, the train to Strasbourg has already gone.
I am aware that timetables are not your responsibility, but I would ask you to have a word with the railway companies and get a stop put to this sort of craziness for good.
