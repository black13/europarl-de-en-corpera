My question on this subject is a rather general one.
Now that the routes of the Trans-European Network have been laid down for some considerable time, one does get the feeling that, while some are certainly in operation, others are being - if not completely neglected by the Member States - at any rate not being built, and so I would be interested to know whether there might in future be a system that would reward those route operators that are actually building and doing so efficiently, so that they might, under certain circumstances, be more likely to benefit from subsidies than those that, while belonging to the TEN, are not doing anything at all.
For this reason, I should like to ask what is going to be done in future about the laying down of TEN routes?
