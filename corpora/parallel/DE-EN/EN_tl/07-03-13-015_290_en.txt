Mrs Ludford, I can do no other than agree with all that you have said.
The intention is that the project of which I spoke should supplement the ongoing international measures already taken by the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe, and devise a TeleMed-style solution for Europe, whilst the parallel trading project will address specifically those aspects relating to the safety of patients.
If we are to really sort out the problem, we first have to know exactly how the land lies, and so we have asked the Member States for the necessary information.
I think we will have collated all the information we need by the end of the year and will then be able to take some decisions.
I take the same view as you do of the situation in developing countries, which is scandalous in the extreme.
During a debate about it in this House last year, I said that we would do everything in our power to help the developing countries to put in place the structures to ensure that the medicinal products finding their way onto their markets were in line with international standards.
The problem is, quite simply, that, in many developing countries, the administrative structures required to exercise proper control are not in place, and that is why I agree with my fellow-Commissioner Mr Michel that it is vitally important in terms of development that we step up our efforts at supporting the developing countries in this task.
Subject: Measures to boost European entrepreneurship
As part of the Lisbon Strategy, the European Strategy for Growth and Employment and the European Agenda for Entrepreneurship, which measures does the Commission intend to take to boost private entrepreneurship, in particular among young people, and to create the right environment for risk-taking so as to modernise, develop and promote the competitiveness of Europe's economy?
