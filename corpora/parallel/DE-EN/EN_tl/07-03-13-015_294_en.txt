Vice-President of the Commission.
That is a very important question, honourable Member, but I am unable to answer it because the Commission does not give money to individual firms.
It is a question for the banks.
How do the banks behave towards people who come to them with a good idea, a good education and entrepreneurial talent?
Do they recognise such talent, do they acknowledge the courage of wanting to do something and do they encourage it, or do they act like bureaucrats?
I think European financial institutions are well-advised to take what you have said, the qualifications of a person who wants to start a business, his talent, his knowledge and his ability, into account when assessing his creditworthiness.
We can only encourage the banks to do that.
We cannot force them to do so.
