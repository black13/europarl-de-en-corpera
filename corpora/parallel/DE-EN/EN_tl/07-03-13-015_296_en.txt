Anyone who satisfies the legal requirements can become an entrepreneur.
In theory, one can imagine a society with 100% entrepreneurs, because there are no restrictions.
As I said, the restrictions come about because in some countries in Europe the culture is such that people would rather be employees than take on themselves the risk of independence.
I could name the Member States where that is the case.
But there are also the obstacles that I have mentioned.
Becoming an entrepreneur is a decision everyone must take for himself.
We cannot oblige anyone to do it.
The only thing we can do - and we really are doing it in a way that has not been done in Europe before - is to encourage people to take the step to entrepreneurship and to make that step easier for them, as well as we can.
I am pretty sure that our efforts will be successful, but it is not a short-term project; it is a project that needs great staying power.
Subject: Engineering in the EU
As part of the Lisbon Agenda we talk about unlocking European potential and focusing on creating more growth and employment.
Yet the engineering sector, a sector which could provide both these things, is all too often neglected here in Europe.
China produces 1 million engineering graduates each year and rising.
If we compare this with the EU, the EU produces around 170 000 and falling.
In the UK alone it has been estimated that by 2012 UK manufacturing and engineering will not be able to meet its requirements for graduates and apprentices by new or young entrants alone.
How does the EU propose to counterbalance the competition posed by the new emerging economies and to recruit and train the necessary workforce here in Europe?
