Vice-President of the Commission.
The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that the engineering disciplines are particularly important for the European economy as a whole, especially with regard to our strategy for greater growth and employment.
Engineering work is essential for many sectors of the economy and therefore deserves our full attention.
A high-level working group, the 'Mechanical Engineering Dialogue', was set up at the end of 2005 to make a comprehensive analysis of the sector's competitiveness.
This initiative follows similar action in other manufacturing sectors, and further initiatives will follow shortly.
The working group's initial findings show that questions of training and qualification are a serious challenge for manufacturing.
Not only are the absolute numbers of young technical staff entering working life inadequate, but there are also problems with retaining skilled personnel in the industry and with the public image of engineering.
There are also problems with the necessary adaptation to various changes that are currently taking place.
The Commission is looking at these matters together with industry and the Member States.
Since the Commission has only a very limited mandate in the field of vocational training, it is particularly important that other groups and affected parties make their contribution.
In particular, the Commission is comparing the different approaches taken by the Member States in order to find the best possible solutions and to define the right framework for innovation to develop.
Member States need to do more, especially as regards course contents, lifelong learning and worker mobility, while it is up to industry to define future requirements accurately and to make technical occupations more attractive.
All this is part of the Commission's approach to industrial policy, and we will this year be informing Parliament and the Council of the extent to which our industrial policy proposals have resulted in progress.
