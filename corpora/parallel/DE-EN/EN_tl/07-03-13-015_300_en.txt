Vice-President of the Commission.
Honourable Member, I think these are measures that are financed out of the European Structural Funds, for which - as you know - I am not competent.
I do not want to tell the competent commissioners, Mrs Hübner and Mr Špidla, what to do.
I do think they both recognise the importance of this project, however.
I will take your question as an opportunity to speak to Mrs Hübner and Mr Špidla, ask them what the experience has been and also ask them to continue to support such initiatives when that proves useful.
Subject: Carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles
Commissioner Verheugen appears to be opposed to proposals from Commissioner Dimas regarding binding provisions concerning the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for all categories of automobile, calling for a more 'integrated approach'.
One of the factors under discussion concerns the use of biofuels which is related to a very important and sensitive issue in the Greek farming sector, that is to say the problems faced by sugar producers.
Could the Commissioner indicate whether his position does in fact differ from that of Mr Dimas and, if so, how?
Regarding biofuels in particular, is he able to make any specific proposals?
