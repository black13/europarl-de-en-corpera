Vice-President of the Commission.
Honourable Member, I must admit that I have no idea on what assumption your question is based or where the impression that comes over in your question can have come from.
The assumption underlying your question is completely wrong.
There has not been and is not the slightest difference between Mr Dimas and myself in the matter of binding upper limits for CO2 emissions - quite the opposite.
The two of us were the first to say, in December of last year, that legislative measures are necessary.
In November last year I announced here in Parliament that we would be laying down statutory measures with binding limits.
In so doing, we are basing ourselves on the recommendations of the High Level Group CARS 21, about which I have reported to Parliament.
That group recommended the 'integrated approach', and the Commission included it in its decision, which was adopted with the agreement of both Mr Dimas and myself.
The integrated approach means that greater use will also be made of biofuels to meet the reduced emission target of an average of 120g CO2 per km for the European automobile fleet.
I have given a large number of interviews on this very subject both before and after the Commission's decision, pointing out how important it is to increase the proportion of biofuels now.
I am therefore very pleased that last week the European Council decided to follow the Commission's and my proposal to increase the proportion of biofuels to as much as 10% of European fuel consumption in the next few years.
I can therefore assure you that not only are there no differences of opinion between Mr Dimas and myself on this issue, but we are working together to do all we can to reach these targets that the Commission has decided.
