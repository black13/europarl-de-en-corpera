I think it is perfectly understandable that there are differences of opinion in lively and very productive bodies like the Commission.
I would, however, like you to throw more light on the parameters for use of biofuels.
That is the core point of my question, especially after the sudden changes to European agricultural policy concerning the sugar regime, changes which had adverse repercussions on beet producers, especially in the area from which I come.
I should like information from you Commissioner on the potential for producing biofuels.
I should like you to focus on this in your reply to my supplementary question.
