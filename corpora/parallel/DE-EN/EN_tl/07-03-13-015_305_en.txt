Vice-President of the Commission.
Honourable Member, as you know, the Commission only set benchmarks in its decision on vehicle CO2 emissions.
One of those benchmarks is the increase in the proportion of biofuels.
There is as yet no specific programme for how this increase in biofuel content is to be achieved, especially as the European Council only accepted the Commission proposal on Friday of last week.
The Commission will now be making the relevant proposals very quickly.
I can however tell you that the general opinion is that we in Europe will be able to solve the problem by mixing biofuels with the conventional fuels produced in refineries.
We are convinced that we should concentrate on second-generation biofuels in order to avoid harmful ecological side effects.
The common agricultural policy supports biofuels through the single area payment.
As you know, farmers are not allowed to grow food plants on land that has been set aside, but they can grow non-food plants, including plants for the production of biofuels.
The growing of such crops, including sugar beet, can be supported by the granting of energy plant premiums of EUR 45 per hectare.
This rule has now been extended to all Member States.
The new EU policy for rural and regional development also provides support measures for renewable energies.
The same applies for the research framework programme, which concentrates primarily on second-generation biofuels.
