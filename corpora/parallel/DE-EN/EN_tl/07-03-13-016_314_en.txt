Mr President, Commissioner, that is a step in the right direction.
In the past, there was veal when the farmer's wife was in her confinement.
We used to call that 'fasted veal'.
It was distinguished by being white meat, because the calf had only ever drunk milk.
Then some people got the idea of penning the animals in and depriving them of natural food because the meat produced that way was considered good and expensive.
They were then fattened up to 170 to 200 kg.
Those calves still had white meat because they did not get any feed containing iron.
That is not changed by this directive.
However, because that meat fetched a particularly good price on the market, the practice was in that way indirectly supported.
If you ever saw how calves locked in their stalls started to gnaw at the gates to get something of what they really needed, then you will know what I am talking about.
Incorporating the time factor has not put an end to that, but it does now indirectly support species-appropriate animal husbandry.
Mother cows are kept at pasture, and the calves drink milk for several months but are also already eating grass, which contains iron, making their meat pink or red.
What the directive still does not contain, although it may encourage it indirectly, is the quality of animal husbandry and the process of the animals' growth.
An end - or at any rate the beginning of an end - is now put to the practice of paying a high price for meat that comes from animals that have been tortured, and we will soon have nice pink veal from happy animals.
That does not mean that the farmer's wife will no longer get white meat in her confinement, but that meat really will be from calves that have 'fasted'.
