Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to say how surprised I am at the intensity and high level of many of the discussions on achieving real CO2-emission reductions.
In my Member State I am given the impression that the climate catastrophe could be brought under control if we drove a little more slowly, replaced our light bulbs and planted three trees every time we went on holiday to Africa.
Giving people this impression is to deceive them.
We certainly need to consider very carefully when most CO2 is emitted.
It is when electricity is generated.
That is why it is important for us also to reflect on how reductions can be achieved where the greatest amount of CO2 is emitted.
It is interesting to see that the Chairman of the German SPD is now also travelling round the country as a scientific expert calculating how much CO2 is emitted by nuclear generation.
He should leave this to a physicist like the German Chancellor.
Then we would be on the right track.
The first matter that we will have to consider is therefore how we can also set targets for energy production in car transport.
How many grams of CO2 should be allowed to be emitted per kilowatt-hour?
Then we will be on the right track and only then can consideration be given to further measures.
I stress that we will have to reflect on the role that nuclear energy should play in the next years and decades.
Here it is important for us as Europeans to debate nuclear energy objectively and free of ideology, bearing in mind the responsibility that we have to bear here, and in so doing also to help to enable this debate to be conducted objectively in the Member States.
