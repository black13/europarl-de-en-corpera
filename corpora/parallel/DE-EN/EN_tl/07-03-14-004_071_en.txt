Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the first step has been taken in the right direction towards a common energy and climate protection policy and no hot air has been produced: we welcome this.
The context for political decisions has improved, but we are still a long way from our objective.
Most of the hurdles are still to come.
The first is fully integrating the agreed targets into the growth, employment and competition policy programmes and if necessary amending them.
Climate and energy policy must strengthen the Lisbon Strategy; they should not detract from it.
Secondly, it will take time for the specific European programmes, projects and measures to be tabled and for the necessary action plans, which should be open to scrutiny, to be drafted.
Everyone needs to know who is doing what by when and how so that we can achieve our joint targets.
This is crucial because, although targets set at summits raise hopes, it is only tangible results that build confidence.
I would therefore call for a report to be produced annually by the Member States to the national parliaments and by the Commission to the European Parliament about the results of implementation.
Thirdly, when will we receive the necessary research programme, the necessary support initiatives and the energy savings road map from the Commission and the national governments?
We still have to prove ourselves both internally and internationally.
We have not yet done so.
As St Catherine of Siena once said, it is not the starting out that is rewarded but solely the persevering.
