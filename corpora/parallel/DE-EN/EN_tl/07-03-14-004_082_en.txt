Vice-President of the Commission.
Mr President, I should like to express just one single thought, indeed more of a request.
There is a tension between economic competitiveness, high social standards and protecting our environment and in this area we should stop regarding the past in such a confrontational and polarising manner, playing the economy off against ecology and ecology off against the economy.
It is simply not true that people are against protecting the climate and the environment if they say that we also have a responsibility for jobs.
It is simply not true that if people say we need to do more to protect our environment they are also saying that they are not interested in jobs.
The truth is that we have surely learnt by now that we can link the two together.
The truth is that a European industry that is a world leader in this field - not only in environmental technology, but also as far as environmentally friendly products and services are concerned - will be most likely to create jobs for people and give them a future.
That is what this is all about - and that is the belief on which this Commission's policy is based: solidarity with the generation that is alive today, which wants to live today and have jobs today, and solidarity with the generations that will follow, which want to find a planet on which they can live, is not contradictory.
This is precisely what we want to demonstrate with this policy!
