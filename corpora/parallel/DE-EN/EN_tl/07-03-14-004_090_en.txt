in writing. - It is certainly right to describe the outcome of the EU Summit as an important step in the right direction.
For our future and particularly for that of our children it is of the greatest importance that we vehemently counteract an average temperature increase of more than two degrees Celsius.
For this reason I consider the decision to set targets of generating 20% of our energy from renewable sources and achieving a 20%-reduction in CO2 emissions in the EU by 2020 as imperative.
I therefore particularly welcome the fact that our Heads of State or Government have now also finally managed to reach such a decision.
I am aware, and I think that my colleagues will agree with me, that these steps are just a beginning and that further efforts will need to follow to guarantee lasting and sustainable climate protection.
Obviously in so doing care needs to be taken to ensure that the overall approach adopted is a balanced one.
I am, however, convinced that new and strict environmental standards will not put Europe at an economic disadvantage, but that on the contrary Europe will be a world leader in new technologies.
In this way we will both help our environment and secure high-quality jobs in Europe for the long term.
Furthermore, I would call for renewed efforts to be made to convince the major polluters, such as for example the United States and China, of the importance of protecting the climate, because it is only together that sustainable success is attainable.
