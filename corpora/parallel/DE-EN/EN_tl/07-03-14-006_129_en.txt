Mr President, although I voted in favour of the report, I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the situation as regards the agencies, of which the European Union now possesses 33, with a 34th having just been announced by the Commission, and the costs of which are now running at over a billion euros per annum.
They employ 2 700 staff, and between 60 and 70% of their costs relate solely to administration.
Something seems to be going wrong here, and it is to that that I wish to draw attention.
I demand that the work actually done by all the agencies, their efficiency and their usefulness, be reviewed, and that consideration then be given to closing down those that yield no added value for the services of the European Union.
Only then can consideration be given to the opening of another agency, should it appear that there is a need for one.
