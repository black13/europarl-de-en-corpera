Mr President, I am in the fortunate position of not having to use all my five minutes.
I get the feeling that there is broad consensus on this point - consensus on the need to received Mr Arif's report with a great deal of respect and gratitude - together with a firm understanding that, while there is no alternative to the Barcelona process as a means of striving to build an area of peace and stability, it cannot, alone, do everything that has to be done in the region where peace policy is concerned, and that that is not, indeed, what it exists to do.
I would also point out just how much work the Presidency of the Council has put into getting the formal peace process resumed and to bring forward negotiations within the Quartet framework.
There was also general agreement on the need for us not to abandon the goal of having a 'free trade zone' in place by 2010, but it is precisely because that can be achieved only if such a free trade framework is ultimately founded upon the ability to compete, that it must be plain to us just how important the European Neighbourhood Policy, with its concrete plans of action, can be, and just how valuable can be the transfer of the experience gained through it to the Barcelona process.
That is the point I wanted to make by way of a conclusion.
There is, indeed, close cooperation between the present Presidency of the Council and the next one, the Portuguese, and, far from in any way wanting to play off these different regions against one another, we want, in dealing with the South, to draw on the experience we have gained - and will continue to gain - in Eastern Europe, for it is in this that lies the great opportunity for the Barcelona process to make good progress.
