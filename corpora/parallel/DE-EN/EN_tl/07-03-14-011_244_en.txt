on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this item was put on the agenda under the very neutral heading of 'future of European aircraft construction', but the main thing we are talking about today is the Airbus crisis.
The 'Power 8' reform programme devised by the management in order to plug the hole in the company's funds, envisages mass redundancies and the sale of plant.
Airbus is a jewel in the European industrial landscape, with highly-skilled workers, full order books, plant working at full capacity and good products.
The selling off of plant would appear to indicate the opposite; it is the wrong message to send when you are trying to plug a financial hole.
As we see from the example of BenQ in Germany, selling off a factory generally indicates the slow but sure death of an industrial location and leads to the destruction of jobs and know-how.
I would ask you, Mr Hintze to speak up, as a representative of the Council and the German Federal Government's coordinator of aerospace policy, for the retention of the Airbus sites in Europe, and against the implementation of the 'Power 8' restructuring concept.
It is not Airbus' workforce who should bear the brunt of the company's crisis and the misjudgments of its management and not Europe's position as an industrial location that should lose out as a result of them.
