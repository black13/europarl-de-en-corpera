Mr President, full order books and its position as Boeing's competitor for the number one spot on the global market testify to the high level of skills of Airbus' employees and to their identification with their product.
It is not the workers who are responsible for the mistakes that have been made; they have done a very good job, and are continuing to do so.
The European aerospace industry will not, in the future, be able to do without this know-how - derived from France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany - any more than it has been able to in the past.
Developing and assembling the wings for high-tech aircraft - which is what Airbus does in Bremen, where I live - calls for special skills.
You cannot simply speed ahead regardless in an aeroplane.
What we are dealing with here is grave failures of management.
The failure of highly-paid managers to look far ahead cannot be a reason for sites to be played off against each other, which is what is happening now.
Nor is it acceptable that Airbus should fail to give either its workers or the European Works Council plausible explanations of its decisions.
To me, this makes it plain yet again just how urgent is the need for a revision of the directive on European Works Councils; it is overdue, to say the very least.
I will also say once more to Mr Hintze that it is not acceptable that development times for new air technology be cut arbitrarily, and those who rely on market considerations alone will pay a bitter price for it.
