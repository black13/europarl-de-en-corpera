Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission shares the concern expressed today that it cannot be good for the future of the European air and space industry if skills and experience are being lost as a result of the biggest company in this sector cutting back jobs.
As we have already said, of course, the Commission will deploy the instruments available to it at European level in order to help the persons affected to cope with the consequences of restructuring.
Members of your House have been quite right to say, as they have done today, that this company's problems do not in fact have anything to do with the workers' skills; that much is not in any way a matter of doubt.
Over and above the steps we are able to take - and will take should it prove necessary to do so - we are currently engaged in taking very decisive action to create equal and fair competitive condition for the European air industry.
On 22 March, the Commission will be making, in writing, a complaint against the USA to the World Trade Organisation, which will serve as a protest against the American state's open-ended subsidy of Boeing, which amounts to numberless billions.
That, too, is a major indication of our desire to secure the future of the European air and space industry.
