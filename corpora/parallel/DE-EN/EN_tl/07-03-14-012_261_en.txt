The only possible way in which I can answer your question, Mrs AndrikienÄ—, is by reference to the procedure.
We have been mandated to produce this report on the basis of in-depth consultations with all the Member States.
This process has not yet been completed.
The report will be presented to the June summit and it is only in June that it will be possible to put the finishing touches to it.
It really would diminish our chances of real progress if I were to make known to the House today any details of the ideas that we might be putting into the report.
All I can say is that we are engaged in a process of consultation, that we will continue to be so until June, and that we will, then, produce a comprehensive report, which will, of course, indicate what further steps might be taken, but it goes without saying that that must be a decision for the European Council.
