I wish to raise a rather practical question that has emerged in the course of our discussions on this subject.
It has to do with the collision between two philosophies.
On the one hand, as in Austria and in Germany too, there are laws that make certain statements subject to penal sanctions, while, on the other, in other European countries, the principle of free expression of opinion can be said to take precedence over such regulations.
What stage have the Council's discussions on this issue reached?
