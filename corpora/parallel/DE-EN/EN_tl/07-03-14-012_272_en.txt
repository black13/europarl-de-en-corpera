I do believe, Mr Leichtfried, that you are right.
There is no contradicting your contention that there is here a conflict between these two interests, and that it is difficult to reconcile them.
It is for that reason that the framework decision will leave the individual Member States a great deal of leeway in taking their practical decisions in line with their own country's legal culture.
For example, the framework decision will refrain from making statements concerning specific historical events, the denial of which might then be made subject to penalties.
That will be a matter on which each country must decide for itself, although the framework decision must certainly make some statement to the effect that the public approval, denial or minimisation of genocides, war crimes or crimes against humanity is to be made punishable.
The precise expression and justification of what constitutes such an offence and whatever must be added to that in the view of an individual country, will certainly remain a matter for the Member States, and this framework decision will not be able to make specific enactments on the subject.
