I think, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, that you have a perfect understanding of what we want to do, namely to achieve a single common standard of protection across the EU.
At the moment, however, I am able only to describe how we are going to do that.
What we are going to do, basically, is to look for best practice.
Regulations in the EU, have, indeed, been very diverse up to now, and our idea is that this questionnaire should be used to ascertain what works, and how, as well as what experience has been gained - and where - in order to achieve a uniform standard of protection across the EU by simply comparing and see what common ground emerges.
In view of the great differences between practice in the various countries, we really do not think there is any practical way of doing this other than by, in the first instance, conducting such an inquiry and then looking for examples of best practice.
