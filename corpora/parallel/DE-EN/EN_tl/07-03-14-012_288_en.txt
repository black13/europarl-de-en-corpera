Mr Davies, we have to consider very carefully what rights the Council possesses in this regard.
So far as we are informed, the BAE Systems case, to which you refer, has to do with the possible bribery of foreign officials, but it is precisely this that is not regulated; although there are rules applicable to bribery in the private sector, there are none applicable to the bribery of officials, and certainly not to that of foreign officials.
That being so, the Council is not bound to do anything about this.
