I should like to ask you, Minister, whether the Presidency takes the view that it might be appropriate to discuss with the Commission new measures whereby more might be done in the fight against corruption.
We know that the level of corruption in the various EU countries varies widely, and it would be good if we could do something together to bring it down in all of them.
