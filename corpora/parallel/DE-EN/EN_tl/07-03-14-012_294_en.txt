President-in-Office of the Council.
The honourable Member is right: the licensing of this vaccine to protect against human papillomavirus does indeed represent important progress in the prevention of cervical cancer.
After all, it is claimed that the vaccine affords protection from this cancer in 96-100% of cases.
This vaccine is still very new, however, and - as the honourable Member also mentioned - any vaccination and information strategies are still in the early stages of development.
Therefore, the emphasis is still on the exchange of know-how and experience at the moment.
Nevertheless, we also believe that protection can be significantly improved by means of information campaigns and the implementation of the existing screening guidelines on the subject.
