President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Posselt, at the very least, you can be assured that Croatia will receive absolutely fair treatment.
If you are thinking of the framework conditions for the negotiations with Turkey, for example, you are right, of course, that the instrument of negotiations has changed over time; and, if you are thinking of the newly introduced benchmarks, for example, it is indeed true that the framework and the instruments have evolved.
This is not something that is peculiar to Croatia, however, but will of course apply to all future accession negotiations, including those with the Western Balkan countries - who also hope to see their negotiations opened at some stage.
This is not a case of applying a special law to Croatia, therefore, but instead reflects the evolution of the instruments for European enlargement as a whole.
Regarding the honourable Member's request for predictions, I have to say that predictions are hard to make.
I can only tell you in general terms that we have found Croatia, on the whole, to be a very conscientious, very committed negotiating partner, and that, regardless of any other ideas as to political framework or timing, we are endeavouring to make swift progress with the negotiations.
I have of course mentioned the state of play in the negotiations - which is excellent.
If you consider that Croatia made its application for membership as recently as 2003, attained the status of candidate country in 2004, and started negotiating last October, this is quite astonishingly rapid progress - even compared to the latest negotiation processes with the 12 countries that have now joined the EU.
We are assuming that both sides are interested in continuing this rapid progress.
