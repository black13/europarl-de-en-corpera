President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Rack, as you know, there was a specific background to the suspension of the negotiations on certain chapters.
Solving this problem so that we can return to a normal rhythm is in the hands of the Republic of Turkey.
Of course, one thing is true.
The whole strategy of negotiations with Turkey is governed by different rules again from those for the other negotiations to date - including those now being conducted in parallel - in that a consensus decision must be taken every time a chapter is opened or closed.
The decision of October 2005 enables all Member States to play a particularly strong, even controlling, role themselves in the negotiations - which was indeed the basis for the consensus on opening negotiations in the first place.
Turkey, too, understands this and has approved this approach and procedure.
It cannot be said, therefore, that Turkey is receiving unfair treatment; it is more a case that a consensus could not have been reached otherwise.
Both sides have approved this consensus.
