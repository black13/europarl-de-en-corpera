I would prefer to avoid apportioning blame, Mr Paleckis.
This has been our policy for all the other accession processes.
We have always said that there is a Copenhagen criterion that states that good neighbourly relations must be organised.
A precondition for this is that any problems with a country's neighbours must be resolved.
As long as a country does not ask us to intervene in any way, we assume that the country is attempting to solve these problems itself, as this is a precondition for the enlargement process and the accession process itself.
We should not, at this stage, be pursuing a different policy with Croatia from the one we pursued in the past with the other 12 countries, who all resolved their neighbourhood and border problems on their own responsibility.
This also goes for the Baltic States, even though there are unfortunately some additional things to be regulated there now.
This is good practice, however, and should not be avoided.
