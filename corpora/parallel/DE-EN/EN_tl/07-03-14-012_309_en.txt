President-in-Office of the Council.
I have just addressed this subject in some detail, admittedly in a rather descriptive form, by explaining the relevant sensitivities in the realm of African countries, particularly within the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which has competence in the region.
We are conducting a dialogue with the SADC countries on the subject, which we shall continue.
In our experience, however, simply increasing the pressure is not conducive to improving the way African countries deal with Zimbabwe - almost the reverse is the case: it gives rise to instinctive African solidarity.
We have not yet found an answer to how to deal with this, but we shall of course continue our intensive dialogue with the SADC countries - including with South Africa, of course - as we have no idea as yet what the reaction to these recent occurrences will be.
This is against the background of Robert Mugabe's announcement that he may now run for office again.
No responses to this have been forthcoming from Africa as yet, but these responses will be very important in aiding a decision on how to react.
