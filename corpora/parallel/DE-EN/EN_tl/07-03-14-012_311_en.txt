President-in-Office of the Council.
The European Union reacted immediately to the tragic news of the murder of Hrant Dink.
In its statement, the Presidency expressed its conviction that the Turkish authorities will identify and arrest the persons responsible for this abominable murder as quickly as possible, and that Turkey will steadfastly continue along the path towards fully realising freedom of expression.
As the author is no doubt aware, the Council has emphasised repeatedly how important it considers freedom of expression.
Further continuous efforts are required to ensure that there is freedom of expression in Turkey in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights.
The EU has raised the particular issue of Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code and other imprecisely worded articles systematically at all levels within the framework of the ongoing reform process in Turkey.
At the most recent meeting of the EU-Turkey Association Council, the EU made it clear that Turkey must alter the imprecisely worded articles in line with the relevant EU standards in case judges and public prosecutors adhere to a restrictive interpretation of these provisions.
We expect the tragic murder of Hrant Dink to mark a turning point that brings substantial changes in the Criminal Code.
The author can also rest assured that the Union will continue to monitor developments in this field attentively and if necessary raise the issue at all levels.
Progress in this key area is of prime importance for the general progress of the accession negotiations.
