President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Triantaphyllides, you will understand that I cannot go into detail here today on something that happened yesterday; although the things you say do unfortunately confirm the continued necessity of the things I have mentioned.
There is a clear need to conduct this dialogue at all levels - and I have explained that we are doing so - and also to put pressure on Turkey to adapt its standards and legislation on this to European standards.
This is crucial for the chances of success of the accession negotiations.
At present, this is the most important instrument at the Council's disposal, and we are using it.
