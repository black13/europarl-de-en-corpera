President-in-Office of the Council.
The honourable Member's words further illustrate the problem of the imprecision of Turkish legislation.
This goes for not only Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code, but also the anti-terror legislation.
This imprecision is not just a legal, but also a political problem, because it can suddenly be put to a different use depending on the prevailing mood or on political developments.
For this reason, we are urging our Turkish counterparts to make changes in these very areas, in order to establish some degree of legal certainty and to avoid a situation in which certain agitation or certain trends in Turkish politics lead to changes in people's legal certainty.
This is our important objective.
The honourable Member can rest assured that we shall continue to work towards this objective with great commitment.
