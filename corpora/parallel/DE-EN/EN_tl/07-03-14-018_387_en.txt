Mr President, Commissioner, not all the missing persons are Greek Cypriots; there are also missing persons from the Turkish Cypriot community.
Parliament's high-level contact group for relations with the Turkish Cypriot community has seen with its own eyes the exemplary cooperation taking place within the Committee on Missing Persons.
This is the only bi-communal initiative in Cyprus that is functioning smoothly.
It is very much in the interests of the Cypriot people on both sides to reappraise what is indeed a dark chapter in their common history.
Contemporary witnesses are advising the scientists on possible sites.
We have seen with our own eyes the professionalism with which the international team, headed by an Argentine, has been working on identifying the human remains.
It is good that we are now giving this committee our attention, and hopefully also additional funding.
I would caution against abusing this issue for political ends, however, as it would be all too easy for this to disturb the laborious, careful process of rapprochement between the two communities and do a great deal more damage.
It would not be the first time, as the urgently needed technical committees that were supposed to be set up long ago to ensure smooth cooperation between the two communities on essential everyday matters such as health, crime-fighting and trade facilitation have yet to show any success in three years.
Why is this?
The citizens of Cyprus are certainly not unwilling.
The reason lies in the spirit of the negative power politics, the obstructionist politics, that have been standing in the way of teamwork on both sides for decades.
