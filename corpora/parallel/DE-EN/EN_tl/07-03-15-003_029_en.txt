Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take just one important area from my colleague Francesco Musotto's very good report, an area whose importance not only for the islands concerned but for the EU as a whole should not be underestimated, namely the problem of illegal immigration.
This problem of illegal immigration must in my opinion be tackled more effectively, having as it does a highly disproportionate effect on the EU's islands in the Mediterranean.
Even though progress has already been made with the measures the EU has taken - with the development of an integrated border management system and the establishment of a community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across any kind of borders, for example - the immigration figures nevertheless show that those measures are still not enough.
Even though the competence for measures clearly lies with the Member States and will have to remain with them in future, the islands cannot be made to carry the excessive burden alone simply because of their geographical position, because what is at first sight a Spanish, Italian or Greek problem subsequently becomes a problem for the whole of Europe and therefore also calls for a response at Community level.
Solidarity in action is what is required here and must be made reality.
In this connection, the creation of a European coastguard to monitor the EU's external borders would certainly be no panacea for this island problem, but this proposal of Mr Musotto's does deserve to be examined to see whether it could be one of many measures to combat illegal immigration and protect the islands and the EU as a whole.
