Mr President, unlike the previous speaker, I believe this resolution on bird hunting in Malta is a very important resolution.
The European Parliament has already shown on many occasions that animal conservation and compliance with the animal conservation laws we have in the European Union are very important to us.
That is why this resolution is very important, even if we have faced quite a strong headwind from the other side of this Chamber.
