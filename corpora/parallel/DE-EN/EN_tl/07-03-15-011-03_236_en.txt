author. - Mr President, quite honestly I think a debate about the developing situation in Zimbabwe would be more urgent than all three topics we are debating this week.
The detailed reports I am receiving are deeply distressing.
That is not possible today, however, because we have limited ourselves to three topics in the urgent debate.
I hope that we in the Working Group on Parliamentary Reform will abolish this self-imposed restriction for the urgent debate.
So far as the situation in Nigeria is concerned, we believe it is reasonable to look at the human rights deficits as a whole, especially in the light of the forthcoming elections, and not to confine ourselves to one topic.
We also believe, and have said as much, that the present Bill in Nigeria contains violations of fundamental human rights.
We are against any form of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, and we also believe that a person's private life is an exclusively private matter, which must not be criminalised by the state.
We consider it a violation of the freedom of opinion if a person is sent to prison for advocating more liberal legislation.
We believe, however, that a resolution on Nigeria must also take a stance on the other problems affecting people there as a whole, namely the widespread violence, the corruption, the immunity of those who violate human rights, the political intimidation in the run-up to the elections, possibly involving the security forces, the threat to the independence of the national electoral commission, the fact that the death penalty is still in force there, that there are still - especially in the parts of the country where sharia is practised - degrading physical punishments, and also that the problem of child labour is very much alive.
Because we want to consider these points as a whole, we prefer to vote for our own resolution and not for the joint text.
