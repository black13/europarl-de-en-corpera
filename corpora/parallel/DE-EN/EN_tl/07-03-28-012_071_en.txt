Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Federal Chancellor, I feel very honoured to be able to speak under your Presidency.
There are a few comments I should like to make.
The first is that - as the Berlin Declaration made clear - Europe has, by means of integration, been able to achieve a degree of peace, freedom and prosperity such as it has never done in all its history heretofore, the like of which is probably unique in the history of the human race.
Secondly, it has also become plain that we face challenges that, in many areas, such as terrorism, globalisation, foreign and security policy and energy security, the nation states are no longer able to master on their own, and that list makes evident that the European Union has been a success wherever and whenever we have availed ourselves of the Community method, worked with a common body of law and applied the Monnet method.
It is for this reason - or so I believe - that the constitutional process should be conducted on this same basis, for we are weakened wherever the governments work together.
That also means - if we are now to embark upon the next, the post-Berlin declaration stage, and if the constitutional process is to be resumed - that it is important that these principles of the Community method be adhered to.
The constitutional treaty already contains much that we need if we are to meet the challenges that await us.
While the Constitution does not, in itself, solve any problems, it does provide us with the framework of legitimacy and decision-making competence that enable us to do so for ourselves, and I hope that it is, for this reason, clear to all twenty-seven Member States - and I am following the Commission in saying this - that they have to have very good reasons for not going along with that process, and so we have to ensure the European Union, as a community of twenty-seven, faces up to this challenge rather than disintegrating into the little blocks that would result if it could not, as a whole, succeed in doing so.
