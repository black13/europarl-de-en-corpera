on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, there is no simple solution for the future of the remainder of the former Yugoslavia, including Kosovo.
It does not make the solution any easier, however, if we just put off dealing with the problems; the reverse is the case.
For this reason, I am glad that, after eight years of international administration, there is a tangible proposal on the table at the UN Security Council.
I would appeal to the House to vote in favour of this proposal, as it largely corresponds to Mr Lagendijk's report.
There must be an end to the state of uncertainty in which the Kosovars of all ethnic origins and the Serbs find themselves.
Only then will the urgently needed economic development, as a step towards integration into the EU, be possible.
Any delay in taking the current decision and in Kosovo's subsequent integration into the EU will cost the region, and the EU, dear.
