Madam President, tomorrow, this House will be voting in favour of the Lagendijk report - I assume by a very substantial majority - but this will primarily reflect support for the work of Mr Ahtisaari and his staff.
I believe that the position proposed by Mr Ahtisaari is, in essence, the path we should take.
The question asked time and again is: independence - yes or no?
This decision will be taken by the United Nations, and I hope their decision, following all the necessary deliberations, will be the right one.
This decision will have our full support.
What is really important, however, is what will happen after the resolution of the status issue.
The status issue will not be an easy one to resolve as far as Serbia is concerned - no one likes losing a significant part of their territory - let us just imagine that from the point of view of our own country.
Nor will the resolution of the status issue solve the problems that Kosovo itself faces, as the difficulty of constructing its own, independent economic and social system is only just beginning.
The people of Kosovo will then ask: what about my job, how am I supposed to earn money, afford a house, and so on - and this will also be difficult in their own country.
Europe's task - and this is also supported and highlighted by the report on which we shall be voting tomorrow - is to help both parties cooperate on supporting this difficult process sensibly and in a way that shows decency and mutual respect.
This is the most important thing as far as we are concerned, including with regard to tomorrow's decision.
We declare our support for a clear-cut decision on the status issue, but we also affirm that Europe - and particularly this House - must support both parties, so that both Kosovo and Serbia can look forward to a bright future.
