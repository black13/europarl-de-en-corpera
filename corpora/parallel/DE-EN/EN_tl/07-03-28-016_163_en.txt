Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Beer very much for her very committed report.
Organic farming is of great interest to the public; its manifestations are very diverse and its significance varies greatly across the Member States.
Consequently this is a controversial and emotive issue to debate.
In this context, genetically modified organisms always constitute a major problem in organic farming.
That is why I support the limit value of 0.0% for organic farming, because what we identify as GM-free must also be GM-free.
Coexistence and liability are fundamental issues here, issues that also still need to be resolved, Commissioner, and I know that you are on our side in this respect.
The future of organic farming lies above all in the hands of consumers.
They decide whether they are prepared to pay more for food that is natural and GM-free.
The increase in sales of organic products in recent years clearly confirms that the public values this quality.
But it is precisely in this respect that it is important for the purchaser to know where the food comes from.
We have to ensure that the European organic labels are only used for products from the Member States that meet these criteria.
The future use of logos, the intention to label products more precisely and the related possibility of tracing are measures that I very much welcome, because they will also enable more effective checks to be carried out.
We need to ensure that equal account is taken of the interests of producers and consumers.
Joint, coordinated measures will bring additional gains both for European farming and for consumers, while still safeguarding subsidiarity.
The 197 amendments that have been tabled prove, however, that we are actually not yet able to vote on the report at the present time.
I therefore support the rapporteur on Amendments 37 and 39.
(The President cut off the speaker)
