Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur has tabled a good report and Parliament must insist that the Commission and the Council do actually use this good report.
In other words we need codecision, particularly as all of the new substance of this regulation is related to the internal market.
The agricultural issues were of course already legislated on previously and could essentially be imported into the new regulation.
That is one reason for the dual legal base; the other, as you rightly established, is that many of the details should be resolved in the implementing provisions.
Parliament, just like the Council, must reserve the right to be consulted on these implementing provisions.
As you are aware, we now have a ruling.
If we had the constitution this issue would be resolved anyway.
In the coming months we will have to fight this out.
On the issue of GMOs, I am pleased that you have established that 0.9% is not a contamination threshold.
It is a labelling threshold; there is no right to contaminate.
Our group is concerned, however, that the technical means that we have at our disposal to prevent contamination are not being fully utilised and that as a result the 0.9%-threshold is being set too high.
We would like it to be lowered, because we say that for organic products any contamination must be completely ruled out.
I hope that you understand this and will take the necessary measures.
