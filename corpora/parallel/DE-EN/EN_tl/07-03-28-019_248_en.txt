Mr President, Commissioner, I should also like to thank Mr Belet for his initiative and cooperation.
I hope that we can keep the compromises that we have worked out and that we are not going to change a great deal at the last minute and then have to go to certain people on bended knee after all.
In this report we have considered and properly addressed the problems facing football today.
What we do not want is more regulation at EU level.
Instead we want legal clarification of the existing rules to prevent sensible football regulations being annulled.
The idea that henceforth it will only be possible to settle any problems before the European Court of Justice, for example, is absurd.
We did not want to do battle with the big clubs either, or attack the traditional clubs, but rather fight for a fair balance between small and big clubs.
The award of licences might be an example here.
In addition, considerably more attention needs to be paid to young players than has been the case thus far.
