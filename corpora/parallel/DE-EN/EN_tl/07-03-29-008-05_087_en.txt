Mr President, although we can agree to voting en bloc, the next time, the committee needs to discuss and decide the matter before the plenary, so that we can then do the business in a matter of a minute.
I ask that this be communicated to the chairmen of committees.
(Parliament agreed to Mr Rack's request)
(Applause)
