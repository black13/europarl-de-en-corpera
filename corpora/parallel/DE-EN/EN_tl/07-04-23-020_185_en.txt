draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Mr President, one of the headings of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs states that we need to provide sufficient funding for the increasing number of common foreign and security policy (CFSP) activities.
I am hopeful that the Commissioner will apply the plans she has just announced for the coming week to the CFSP, too.
We have emphasised a number of policies in particular, for example the neighbourhood policy towards eastern and southern countries, a policy that must also serve to promote democracy and human rights there.
We have said that we regard the policy towards the Western Balkans as a priority.
In Kosovo, in that region, we are likely to have to make a significant financial effort in 2008 to support the civilian ESDP mission and the office of the International Civilian Representative.
We call for a clarification, as soon as possible, of the implications of that mission for the sustainability of the present CFSP budget.
A further topic is external energy policy.
We call for the gradual building of a common external energy policy.
On the subject of Afghanistan, parallel to improving the security situation, we need to provide adequate funding for the civilian reconstruction effort - this is the only way to win the hearts and minds of the people there in the long term.
Regarding Africa, the major EU-Africa Summit is due to be held in Lisbon in December 2007, and it is likely that the decisions we take there will have to be followed by action - which is very important also in terms of helping African forces settle African conflicts using African means.
We must also send out political signals in this spirit.
