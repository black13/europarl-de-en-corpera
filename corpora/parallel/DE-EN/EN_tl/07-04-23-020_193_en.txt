Mr President, when so few people gather together so late in the evening and everyone actually knows everyone else's arguments quite well already, I think one of us could take the liberty of giving a word of encouragement.
I believe that things are already starting to happen in the Commission's quarters - although we should like to see a little more.
I agree with the previous speaker that result orientation is a nice idea, but it is possible to be much more modest and yet almost revolutionary as far as you are concerned.
More specifically: it is still very hard for citizens to understand who in the Commission is doing what with how much money.
Which bodies are actually working for whom?
Just try to do a quick search on the Internet for the net contribution made by Germany last year or in 2005, for example.
It will take you a long time to find any information on this anywhere.
This also goes for information on, for example, what projects where are receiving what support.
I click on the country in an attempt to see what is receiving support in my region, but find no information.
This is unthinkable!
I am convinced that, if the relevant transparency were already a reality, whether good or bad, we would see a significantly better, higher-quality debate than we are seeing now.
I hope, of course, that we succeed in making a start, if this is prescribed at European level in the field of agricultural subsidies, for example.
There, too, however, there will be problems with practical implementation.
For the rest, I would refer to those after me who are going to speak about the agencies - this is another area in which we could show by example how to put transparency into practice.
