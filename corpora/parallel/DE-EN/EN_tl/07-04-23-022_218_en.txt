on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the quotas for potato starch were not laid down arbitrarily by the Commission, but were negotiated and undersigned by the Polish Government in the course of its accession - so there is an agreement that must be kept to.
I believe that, just as other nations have their sensitivities, the Polish soul likes to complain.
In my estimation, this amendment and the balancing-out arrangement will be adopted tomorrow.
As you will remember, the amendment has been adopted once before, but the Commission invoked technical difficulties with implementation.
That was the case again just now in committee.
I would ask that, when it comes to tomorrow's vote on the amendment - which does not concern an increase in the overall quota, but instead a balancing-out - you tell the people you have dealing with it not how it will not work but how it will work, and thus take a rather more positive approach.
This does not necessarily mean that the whole quantity to be balanced out will be made available; but showing goodwill on this - and possibly doing so within an appropriate timeframe - would still represent a reasonable offer on the part of the Commission.
