draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, this evaluation is not a simple matter, for we have already, and repeatedly, urged that gender-specific data are needed if the expenditure is to be assessed, and, to our regret, such data is still not available, and so there are still limits on the amount of gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming that it is possible to include in the assessment.
We ask that these data be submitted in the next Budget discharge reports.
It is particularly in Structural Funds programmes and the like that precise data is vital if we are to see how much, in the final analysis, is allocated to the equal support of women.
It has turned out that the flow of funds in the Daphne programme has been blocked, and that is a major problem, for we know that violence is going on against women, children and young people on an enormous scale.
We know that the projects proposed were very good ones, yet even so the money has not been flowing, and that means that help is needed here.
In the actual case I am thinking of, a range of trans-European projects was rejected.
We are in the course of preparing a European Year against Violence, and the Council of Europe has started up a campaign.
There is massive need in this area, and the Commission must get a move on.
