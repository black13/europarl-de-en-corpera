Mr President, I am not quite certain of this, but I do fear that you have not had paragraph 75 voted on.
You said you would have us vote on paragraph 76, but the display indicated paragraph 75.
You then said you would have us vote on paragraph 77, but the display indicated paragraph 76.
I would ask you to dispel this uncertainty.
