Mr President, believing the Pieper report to be a good one, I did actually want to vote in favour of it, but, since both my amendments were rejected, I have ended up voting against.
My view is that the accession of Turkey would overstretch the EU's capacity to integrate by means of its cohesion policy, and I am astonished that a majority in this House does not share it.
My second amendment reads as follows: 'believes that it is not possible, for financial and political reasons, to apply the principles of the EU's structural policy to Turkey'.
The majority may well have voted against this amendment today, but I am nonetheless convinced that my view will, in the longer term, be proved to be right.
