Mr President, Commissioner, the revised version of Regulation 2320/2002 is good and should be applied as quickly as possible.
First of all, let me make two points about the sunset clause.
We are confronted here with a dilemma.
No politician, and indeed no civil servant, will take responsibility for rolling back inefficient security structures.
Accordingly, the burden of proof must lie with those who seek to extend an implementing regulation and not with those who want to let it expire.
That is the main argument.
Secondly, there is sometimes a need to respond very quickly, as you did in the case of the liquids, but the fact is that the risk assessment and cost analysis must follow, so that the process takes its right and proper course.
The sunset clause is also a good means to this end.
Now to the main issue, the dispute about funding.
We should refocus on the problem that exercised us at the beginning, namely how we can eliminate distortions of competition and obtain transparent and, as far as possible, uniform funding models in Europe.
The Commission must intervene here in a mediating role.
We should not focus so sharply on the question whether taxpayers or passengers should foot the bill.
That discussion, I believe, has become unproductive and no longer addresses the real issue.
We need proposals on ways to achieve transparent funding models in Europe that are as uniform as possible.
