Mr President, we all want the highest possible standards.
The only question is who should decide what will guarantee the highest possible level of security.
To a certain extent, all of us here can regard ourselves as experts, simply because we are almost daily air travellers.
One thing we do know is that every single one of us can easily circumvent the new rules on liquids at any checkpoint.
What is on the table here is a placebo, designed to ensure that people feel safe but certainly not increasing security.
That is the real problem.
We have to tackle it, which is the purpose of the two amendments tabled by Mr Stockmann and myself, through which we seek to ensure that this House debates what constitutes a genuine security-building measure and what is merely a placebo.
On this point we can truly regard ourselves as experts, and so we say in all clarity that, six months after the introduction of this provision, we have no need of special rules; what we need is a more rational consideration of this issue than it has previously been given.
In actual fact, what we have here is a kind of extraterritorial US law, enacted jointly with Britain.
That is how we see it.
The British or even the American tail is wagging the European dog.
That will not do.
We therefore call for the most rapid possible review, and if that review does not result in a real increase in security, the measures must be allowed to expire.
That would compel us all to think seriously again about real potential remedies to the present problem.
