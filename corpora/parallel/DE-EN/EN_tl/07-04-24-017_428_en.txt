Mr President, in the wake of climate change, inadequate river management and building activities in flood-prone areas, floods are set to become an increasingly frequent occurrence.
Population growth and the accompanying increase in the number of economic assets in these areas give rise to higher risks and more costly damage.
Besides their economic and social impact, floods can have serious environmental consequences, for example if they hit industrial plants where large volumes of toxic chemicals are stored.
Our rapporteur has fully explained all of this.
The compromise package that our rapporteur has negotiated will enable us to pursue the aims of this Directive more successfully.
I would like to offer him my warmest congratulations.
Major points in his report have already been incorporated into the common position and can be put into even sharper focus through this compromise package.
It is important to the European Parliament that the impact of climate change is to be taken into account in the assessment of flood risks.
It would have been very difficult to explain the decision to leave climate change out of the equation when assessing flood risks.
One very important demand is that, in each of the three steps prescribed by this Directive, namely the flood-risk assessment, the production of maps and the formulation of management plans, best practices and the best available technology should be used.
