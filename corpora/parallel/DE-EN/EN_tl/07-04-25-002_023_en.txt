Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, partnership is based on mutual respect, which itself begins with respect for one another's laws and for the values that both parties have in common.
Not a few of the invocations of trans-Atlantic harmony in this debate today would, no doubt, cause Austrians to be greatly astonished and seriously disconcerted.
Public opinion in Austria is occupied and perturbed by two things.
A major bank was bought by an American fund and was, overnight, compelled to get rid of its Cuban clients - without notice and for no cause other than their nationality, which is contrary to international law, European law, and Austrian criminal law.
Now a major minerals company is to be forced to stop doing business with Iran - and that is against Austrian law, European law, and international law too.
I am quite astonished that this crucial matter has gone unmentioned in this debate.
If our partners recognise our legal order and values, then a partnership is what we have; if they do not, then the relationship is one of master and servant.
The Commission's response to these two events in Austria, which have received a great deal of publicity and been the occasion of great disquiet, does nothing to build public confidence in its ability and willingness to defend and enforce European law, yet it is on that that partnership is founded.
(Applause)
