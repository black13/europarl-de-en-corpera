Mr President, before Iraq was invaded, Europe had had the chance to let go of the USA's dubious coat-tails and carve out for itself an independent role as a mediator motivated by reason, and, even as late as the business with the CIA's rendition flights and secret torture prisons, we should have put clear blue water between ourselves and the activities of the George Bush Gang, which were inhumane and contrary to international law, and ought to have denounced them instead of trying to get Europe's taxpayers to cough up for the Americans' belligerent policies.
Were we, as is planned, to impose more stringent sanctions on Iran, we would once more be blindly obeying Washington's orders, and it could not fail to cause us to be perceived, by the Islamic world, even more as its enemies than we already are; that much is made clear by previous terrorist acts and by the latest threats against Germany and Austria.
No doubt in the hope of making the USA/EU summit go well, the position of mediator, which we have worked so hard to keep in our sights, is being abandoned without further thought; so much, then, for our independent and assertive foreign policy.
Time and time again, the Americans have shown that they have but little interest in the EU as a partner, and would rather see it weakened by over-extension, internal problems and crisis hotspots on its borders, which is precisely what would result from Turkish accession.
The idea is that disputes should make the EU impotent, and that is precisely where the planned anti-missile systems fit in.
Political powers have no friends, but only interests.
The Americans are trying to secure their interests, ruthlessly, and even at the cost of the Europeans who are supposed to be their friends.
