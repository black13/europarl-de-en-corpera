rapporteur. - Mr President, something else I have to clarify, with the agreement of the shadow rapporteurs, is that this provision is intended to apply to all problems with borders, and so I ask that 'with neighbouring countries' be inserted.
This rule that recourse be had to the services of a third party should, then, apply in principle to all border problems that are as yet unresolved.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
