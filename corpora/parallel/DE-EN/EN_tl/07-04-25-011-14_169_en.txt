Mr President, might I ask why it is that, since we always have relatively few votes on a Tuesday and always a very large number of them on Wednesdays, why it is that formal sittings are always on Wednesdays?
Could we not move them to a Tuesday?
That would work every bit as well, and we would be able to organise our timetable far better.
