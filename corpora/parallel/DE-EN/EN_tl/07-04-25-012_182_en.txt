When it comes to us in floods, water is a force of nature, endangering our health, the environment, infrastructure and our property.
Water takes no account of borders.
It is important that the EU should use this proposal for a 'directive on the assessment and management of flood risks' to promote more cooperation across borders, which must be founded on the existing plans and designs held by the Member States, which themselves ought to draw on the best available data, procedures and technologies in the field of flood risk management.
I am glad that agreement has been reached on the last outstanding issues, so that the new directive can rapidly come into effect.
Flooding is a constant risk for people who live in river valleys; they can, to some degree, make their properties proof against it.
My neighbouring village in the Moselle valley found its salvation in the building of a protective flood dam, but preventive measures that involve all members of the public are much better and more effective.
In the report, we make reference to the principle of solidarity, which comes into play in villages when the floods come, with everyone helping everyone else, and the volunteers from the fire brigade showing admirable dedication in setting out.
It is this solidarity principle that must be developed and supported, not only in the villages affected by flooding, but across every border too.
