Not only does the Communists', Socialists' and Liberals' so-called 'compromise package' reject important demands for common ethical standards, but it also makes the Member States impotent as regards their responsibility for national health care provision.
The compromise, as adopted, is not at all suitable to the task in hand.
Small and medium-sized enterprises working together at national level with hospitals, are exempted from the requirement for national licensing, while others are compelled to go to the agency in London.
The compromise has been taken down at the dictation of large-scale industry, in the teeth of the interests of the self-employed and the small and medium-sized business sector.
Not only that, but the Member States are also losing their independence in matters of public health, since it is now to be an agency in England that decides on the licensing of medicines.
This goes against the concept of subsidiarity and national responsibility for such fundamental areas as public health and consumer protection.
The opportunity to lay down fundamental ethical principles for the whole of Europe has been missed.
It was formerly the case that interference in human genetic identity was not supported in Europe and that the commercialisation of the human body and its parts was ipso facto outlawed.
Although the compromise as achieved rejects these principles of respect for human life, there are certain things that are essential and inimical to shabby political compromises, and the manipulation of human life is one of them.
It is for that reason that I have voted against the report.
