Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make clear - perhaps rather more calmly than before - that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stand fully behind the European Parliament's resolutions and behind the directives that have been adopted here and which the Commission has described.
Europe is an area of the rule of law and we have to defend that.
However, the occasion for today's discussion, namely the statement by this Polish minister, which is unacceptable and which the Group of the European People's Party rejects, is no reason for such a debate.
As Commissioner Å pidla pointed out, when we discussed discrimination against homosexuals only a few weeks ago we saw that unfortunately some of Europe's politicians say things that are unacceptable and we must fight them by political means.
I would like to say that it should make us stop and think when Polish Members of all groups - and I am thinking in particular of the discussion among the Liberals - have said that what happened in Poland is unacceptable, but that the debate must be conducted primarily in Poland itself and that Poland itself is dealing with the unacceptable things that were said there.
It has been said that Poland does not need a Big Brother interfering in its affairs and that they will deal with the matter themselves.
That should give us pause for thought.
We will do those who are fighting discrimination in Poland as we would wish no favours by making a big issue of it here.
Please therefore accept - and it is a procedural matter we are raising here - that we consider it inappropriate to debate this matter today, because we have enough decisions and directives about it.
No to discrimination, No to homophobia in Europe!
We therefore propose that our agency should continue to monitor the situation and keep an eye on it.
The Group of the European People's Party will act accordingly tomorrow.
