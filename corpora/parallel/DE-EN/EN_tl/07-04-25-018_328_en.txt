In the first instance, the protection of external borders is of course the responsibility of the respective Member States.
In special situations, however, Frontex can be called in.
That is why it was created.
That means there may be cases where Frontex does not need to act because the Member State concerned can cope on its own.

Only it cannot be a permanent deployment.
Really, Frontex should only act in particular cases.
