I cannot give any definite figures at present, honourable Member.
We have set this agency up and we must now see what demands are made of it, what tasks the Member States are able to assume and what tasks can be performed by Frontex.
But in the talks on the matter that is still undecided.
At any rate, if I have understood the honourable Member correctly, we must also send out a signal that we have not merely created a pseudo institution, so that the public can see that here the European Union has recognised that it is necessary to have an agency to take effective action.
Then of course we must also be able to make the necessary resources available.
