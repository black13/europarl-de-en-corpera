President-in-Office of the Council.
There is no proposal for improving the institutional infrastructure of the European network of contact points under discussion at the moment.
Up until now, the meetings of this network that have been held have been prepared in cooperation with the Council Presidency and General Secretariat.
Neither is there any proposal before the Council to set up a secretariat for the network within Eurojust.
If such an initiative is put forward, the Council will discuss it.
The Presidency can inform you, honourable Member, that the next meeting of the European network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes will be held on 7 and 8 May.
In accordance with existing practice, that meeting's conclusions will be passed to the Article 36 Committee for further discussion.
Under the Council decision of 2003, the establishment of specialised war crimes units is a matter for the Member States.
All the Member States have already designated contact points for the investigation of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity.
