President-in-Office of the Council.
On the first point, as I have already said, it is important that Parliament should be properly informed about this meeting in accordance with Article 36.
In the end, I am not yet in a position to say what conclusions will be drawn from it and how they will be incorporated into what processes.
But we will be able to tell that when this first meeting has been held on 7 May.
Subject: Type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes, a condition most commonly found in children, is a disease which predominantly affects European populations, more so than the much talked about type 2 diabetes.
Finland has the highest registered number of sufferers in the world, with the UK ranked fourth on the list.
There is little understanding of what causes type 1 diabetes and attention needs to be turned towards ensuring that sufferers can enjoy the best quality of life possible.
A timely and accurate diagnosis and effective control is essential for this.
What measures does the Council intend to take to ensure not only that all diabetes sufferers have access to a minimum standard of care across Member States but also to ensure that the insulin pump, widely believed to be the best tool currently available to help well-motivated diabetes sufferers to achieve improved control and quality of life, is available to all those who need it?
