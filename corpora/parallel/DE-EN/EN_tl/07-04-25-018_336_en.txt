President-in-Office of the Council.
On this question I would like to say that the right of initiative in the area of public health lies exclusively with the Commission.
There is at present no legislative proposal concerning diabetes before the Council.
May I point out that under Article 152(4) in conjunction with Article 251 of the EC Treaty such a proposal would fall under the codecision procedure?
I would also like to draw your attention to the Council's answer to the written question from 2006.
