President-in-Office of the Council.
You are quite right to raise the issue of the consequences of type 1 diabetes, especially in children.
I would like to point out, however - please do not misunderstand me - that this is primarily a matter for the Member States.
It is, however, important to do research and make discoveries and then to exchange those findings at European level, even if the responsibility for health matters does lie with the Member States.
We are talking about the wellbeing and future of children and the right thing to do is to exchange findings promptly and effectively.
