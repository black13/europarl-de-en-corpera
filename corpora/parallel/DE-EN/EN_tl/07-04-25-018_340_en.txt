President-in-Office of the Council.
I entirely agree with you, Mrs Ludford, that we must of course investigate the causes and that requires research.
As you say, it is quite possible to investigate and carry out research into this disease under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
It is of course up to the Member States to take the first initiative, but this instrument, which is certainly necessary, can be used to start such initiatives under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
Subject: Provision of child care
Following the Barcelona European Council in 2002, when Member States agreed that by 2010 child care should be available to at least 90% of children between 3 and 6 years old, and at least 33% of children under 3 years of age, and in light of the new Commission communication on demographic changes within Europe, can the Council report on how close different Member States are to achieving these targets?
