In its 2007 Spring Report, the Commission noted that the availability of affordable child care is a problem in some Member States, making it difficult to reconcile work and family life.
The 2006-2007 Joint Employment Report expressly points out that some Member States have set national targets for child care.
These efforts should be recognised.
At the same time, however, we should keep an eye on further developments in the Member States to see that the Barcelona Process obligations are complied with.
