President-in-Office of the Council.
A few weeks ago we had a debate against the background of the Alliance for Families and the objectives we set ourselves in Barcelona.
In that debate I proposed, on behalf of the Presidency, that a report should be presented next year on how far those objectives had been achieved in the individual Member States.
In the meantime, we have also produced a list of criteria on the basis of which this report will be produced in 2008.
That is an important point.
I am also pleased to say that child care has featured prominently at a number of conferences in the last few weeks, including in the debate about the Alliance for Families.
As you know, I am from Germany and I am familiar with the debate that is currently taking place in our country.
We have also found that the problem is not confined to Germany, however.
What can we do, then?
So far as best practice is concerned, the experiences and results in achieving those objectives must be set out in the report I mentioned next year.
We will send you the information you require in due course.
