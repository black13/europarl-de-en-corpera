We are not trying to tell parents that they must put their children in child care facilities; we have simply found that parents - and in some Member States predominantly women - need to have the option of deciding whether they want to pursue an occupation, possibly out of economic necessity.
They should then also be provided with suitable child care facilities.
It is not for the Presidency to judge the quality of those facilities or how well they are equipped.
Each Member State will itself ensure that the staff are properly trained for the task.
Subject: Updating the Directive on 'Television Without Frontiers' and combating violence and discrimination
In the context of updating the Community Directive on audiovisual media, known by the title 'Television Without Frontiers', does the Council intend to adopt a common policy against the use of violence and material offensive to human dignity, in particular when the media target children and young people or the content of their programmes concerns women's issues and disadvantaged social groups?
Is it possible that heightening the awareness of members of the Council in regard to the above matters is of more crucial importance than rules relating to the free market, competition and the international obligations of the Union?
