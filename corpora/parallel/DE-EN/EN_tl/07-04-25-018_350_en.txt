President-in-Office of the Council.
First, I would like to point out that the amendment to the Television Without Frontiers Directive will be adopted under the codecision procedure.
As co-legislator, the European Parliament is just as entitled as the Council to bring influence to bear on the content of the legislation.
The Council has taken account of the particular concerns you raise in revising the directive.
In particular, the Council is considering extending the scope of the directive so that appropriate provisions for the protection of minors and a ban on incitement to hatred will also apply to new no-demand services and to services offered over new platforms such as mobile networks and the Internet.
The Council envisages that the revised directive will recognise that instruments for co- and self-regulation can make an important contribution to this.
As you know, the final scope of the revision will have to be agreed together with Parliament.
I also made clear at yesterday's meeting of Presidents that the Presidency is very keen to work together with the European Parliament to reach a decision quickly.
