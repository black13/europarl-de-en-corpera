President-in-Office of the Council.
I am not sure that a directive can prevent everything, but in the talks between the Presidency and the European Parliament we are seeking to find ways of reducing the danger to a minimum.
I repeat: we will certainly have to find a balance between so-called freedom of information on the one hand and the protection of children and young people on the other.
Of course children must be protected.
We will see what the talks can achieve in the next few days.
