President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Posselt, the European Council's decision of 15 and 16 December 2005 to give the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the status of a candidate country stands in recognition of the country's reform effort so far.
The European Council stressed that further steps to bring Macedonia closer to the EU will be considered if the conditions and requirements laid down in the Conclusions are satisfied.
The Commission will keep you informed of these developments in its progress reports.
After examining the developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as set out in the Commission's progress reports, at its meeting on 11 and 12 December last year the Council expressed its regret at the slowing of the pace of reform in 2006.
On 14 and 15 December last year, the European Council reiterated that the individual countries' progress along the road to the European Union depends on the efforts each of them makes to satisfy the Copenhagen Criteria and the conditions of the stabilisation and association process.
So far as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, it urged the country to step up the pace of reform in the key areas and to implement the priorities laid down in the European partnership in order to make further progress in the accession process.
The country's government faces great challenges, especially in the areas of police and judicial reform and the fight against corruption.
As I stressed here back in March in answer to a question from Ryszard Czarnecki, the questions that remain open must now be tackled quickly.
The pace of the accession process therefore depends primarily on the efforts and achievements of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia itself.
The Commission's next progress report will shed light on this.
The European Union will continue to actively support the country in making this objective a reality.
