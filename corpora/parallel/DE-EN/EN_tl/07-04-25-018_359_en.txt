Three brief comments on that excellent reply.
Firstly, I would like to ask you what the position is with regard to the implementation of the Ohrid Agreement, in particular local government reform.
Are you satisfied with the developments in home affairs?
Secondly, what do you think of the future Slovenian Council Presidency's announcement that it will work towards a date?
Thirdly, has there been any easing of tension over the tricky question of the name?
