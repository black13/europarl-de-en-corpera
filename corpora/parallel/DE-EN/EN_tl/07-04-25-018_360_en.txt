President-in-Office of the Council.
I will begin with the last point, because I know it is very controversial.
It would be best if the two countries concerned could settle the matter between themselves, but they have not yet been able to agree on anything.
Regarding the date, if I have understood you correctly, it was about the Slovenian Presidency.
What I said before shows that while the European Council has sent out a signal by giving the country candidate status, we are however still not conducting accession negotiations, hoping that further progress will be made after this debate.
I do not think it is right to set a date at this point.
If the conditions are satisfied, if the necessary pace of reform is reached, if the results are there, then the European Council is ready to set definite dates so that the next steps can be started.
So far as the Ohrid Agreement is concerned, Mr Posselt, I am unable to give you a precise assessment of the situation at present, but I will gladly send you the answer later.
