President-in-Office of the Council.
At the Thessaloniki summit the European Union unanimously said that, in view of previous events in the countries of the western Balkans, it is necessary to offer those countries the prospect of accession.
That decision was motivated by the desire to bring stability to the region.
All the things you have just raised in connection with the diversity of languages will not have been considered from the outset.
The important thing, however, is that we help to bring stability to the region, and the problem you raise is therefore a subordinate point for the time being.
In any case, the European Union has already solved quite different problems.
