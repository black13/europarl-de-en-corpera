President-in-Office of the Council.
The Council has reacted strongly to the Sudanese Government's refusal to issue visas for the United Nations Human Rights Council's assessment mission to Sudan and it deeply regrets the lack of cooperation on the Sudanese Government's part.
The European Union had already made repeated approaches to the Sudanese Foreign Minister and appealed to Sudan to cooperate with this mission.
The Council welcomes the fact that, at its fourth session, the UN Human Rights Council noted the Mission's report and unanimously adopted a resolution on the human rights situation in Darfur, charging a team of special rapporteurs with reviewing all existing recommendations for improving the human rights situation in Darfur and pressing ahead with their implementation.
On 15 March 2007, the Council reaffirmed its support for urgent consideration of further measures against Sudan by the UN Security Council, pointing out that under UN Security Council Resolution 1591 anyone hindering the peace process must be called to account and appropriate measures taken.
The Council also expressed its resolve to consider further measures, especially in the context of the UN, against any party to the conflict who obstructs UN support for the African Union mission in the Darfur region of Sudan, including the carrying out of the agreed hybrid AU-UN operation.
The Darfur conflict has been discussed regularly in talks with both China and Russia, including at political dialogue meetings, for example.
We have consistently taken the view that the Sudanese Government must work towards a political settlement of the conflict and give its unequivocal agreement to the implementation of the full UN support package for the AMIS mission.
