President-in-Office of the Council.
The Council of Foreign Ministers discussed Sudan and Darfur again last Monday in Luxembourg.
As you may know, the United Nations special envoy, Jan Eliasson, took part.
The situation in the region, which was difficult in any case, has not been improved by the fact that, in addition to the existing conflicts between the different parties in Sudan, various tribes are suddenly making war on each other.
At the special envoy's express request, however, the Council has not taken any further measures for the time being.
The special envoy asked that we should again seek by political and diplomatic means to secure agreement for a UN-backed mission, perhaps with a change of attitude on the part of China.
The foreign ministers stated, however, that the European Union is considering further effective measures against Sudan if there are no signs of that in the foreseeable future.
It cannot be put off for ever, we cannot postpone things for weeks and months on end and simply wait.
