President-in-Office of the Council.
I have tried to make clear - it was what the Foreign Ministers Council before last wanted - that we want to get a fresh picture and to do that through the United Nations special envoy this time, but also by getting information from the African Union's special envoy.
I readily acknowledge that it really is a sore point, but I must ask you to take this special envoy's request seriously and try to see whether certain movements that have taken place in the last few days might not be conducive to a solution after all, making a joint mission possible.
I do repeat, however, that this is not a project where we will wait week after week without seeing results.
The European Union should start taking appropriate measures if this process, which Mr Eliasson wants and which we also want, fails to start.
