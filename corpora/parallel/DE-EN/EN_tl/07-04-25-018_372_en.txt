President-in-Office of the Council.
The European soldiers have a very narrow remit.
Essentially, it is the African Union's job.
That is why, last Monday, we also again made clear that the money for maintaining this mission is slowly running out and the European Union will then of course have to support the African action financially beyond that time.
The Council Presidency has also expressly asked that thought be given to how far the Member States might again be able to give money bilaterally to support this African Union action in Sudan, in Darfur, if the money it not sufficient at European level.
Subject: Extrajudicial executions in the Philippines
What is the Council's assessment of the political situation in the Philippines, where more than 830 left-wing political activists, journalists, lawyers, judges, human rights activists, priests and trade unionists have been killed in extrajudicial executions since Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's government took office in 2001, a situation which has recently been strongly criticised by the UN special rapporteur Philip Alston?
What is the Council's assessment of the Arroyo government's evident failure to act and reports that the Philippines army is behind these killings?
