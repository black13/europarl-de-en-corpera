Mr Pfl√ºger, as has already been explained in the answer to question 619/2007, the Council is aware of the extrajudicial executions in the Philippines.
The European Union regularly expresses its deep concern about these occurrences, urging the authorities to tackle the problem quickly and also to allow independent investigations so that the perpetrators can be brought to court and preventive measures taken.
As already stated in the answer to which I referred, the European Union is willing to assist the Philippines in developing its judicial system.
The EU is perfectly clear that what is needed in order to put an end to extrajudicial executions in the Philippines is not just specialist expertise but that political will on the part of the top leadership is also crucial.
The EU will continue to press for such will to be shown.
We hope that the proper investigation and prosecution of these crimes will also have a preventive effect.
In April, the EU Member States and the Commission will be making preparations to send a fact-finding mission to Manila in the near future to assess the need for specialist assistance.
This comes in answer to a request from Foreign Minister Romulo, who has asked for help in implementing the recommendations of the Melo Commission, which was charged with investigating the unexplained killings.
