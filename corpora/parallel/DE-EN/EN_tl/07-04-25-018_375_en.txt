Is the Council aware of the following extrajudicial executions: Cipriano Ligaspo, murdered on 14 March; Carlito Getrosa, murdered on 11 March; Che Che Gandinao, murdered on 10 March; Felisa Timog Ocampo and Renato 'Atong' Torrecampo Pacaide, murdered on 2 March?
My question is, are sanctions in fact being considered?
You have just said that the Philippines Government has asked for assistance and will be given it.
But the essential part of the problem is that the government is involved.
In view of that, is this the right approach?
