I know there have been many regrettable extrajudicial executions.
I do not know the individual names, but this could be looked into.
In the process between the EU and the Philippines, I believe it is necessary to get through to the political address, which I am sure is able to influence particular developments.
It is also right and important that the European Union should provide appropriate assistance and hopefully also help to clear these cases up if the country itself sees shortcomings in its judicial system.
Subject: Attacks on anti-war activists in Sri Lanka
On 9 January 2007, members of Sri Lanka's United People's Movement (UPM) were attacked and chased by an armed mob before a public rally.
According to reports in the media, a deputy minister, Mervyn Silva, was involved in the attacks.
What view does the Council take of direct attacks on peace activists in Sri Lanka by members of the Sri Lankan Government?
How will this incident affect the Council's support for the Government in future?
