President-in-Office of the Council.
The Council has no evidence that the Sri Lankan Government was connected with this incident.
No conclusions can therefore be drawn regarding the incident's consequences for relations between the EU and the Sri Lankan Government.
Looking at the situation more generally, however, the Council is deeply concerned about developments in Sri Lanka.
The European Union is urging both sides to end the violence immediately and to return to the negotiating table without delay so that a workable solution to the conflict can be found based on constructive proposals.
Despite the obvious difficulties, as one of the co-chairs of the Tokyo Conference of donor countries the European Union is continuing to examine every possible way of supporting the peace process in Sri Lanka.
