President-in-Office of the Council.
On the last point, I know nothing about this, but we will look into it and see whether there is any information available.
On the question of the measures the Council is thinking of taking, I can tell you that the Council is supporting the work of the Monitoring Mission in Sri Lanka and the Norwegian mediator.
We have repeatedly called on the warring parties to observe the 2002 armistice agreement and to respect human rights.
The European Union has also submitted its own draft resolution on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka to the Geneva Human Rights Council.
This draft expresses the EU's concern at the recent escalation of violence in Sri Lanka and calls for an immediate end to the violence and the violations of human rights and basic humanitarian rights it entails.
I hope that will lead to a next step.
We will look again at the question you raise and let you have information on the subject.
