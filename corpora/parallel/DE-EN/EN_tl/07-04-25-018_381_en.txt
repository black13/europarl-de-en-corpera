When the present escalation of the conflict in Sri Lanka began, this House debated whether the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) should be placed on the EU terror list.
What is your present view of the LTTE having been placed on the terror list now that the conflict has escalated enormously?
Was it in retrospect the right thing to do?
In particular, was it right at that point in time?
A second question: Norway is playing a very positive role in this conflict, especially in negotiations, and Norway has criticised the EU through diplomatic channels, saying that the EU's role has been rather biased towards the government.
What do you say to that?
