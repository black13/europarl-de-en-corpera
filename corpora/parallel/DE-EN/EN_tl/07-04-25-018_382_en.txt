President-in-Office of the Council.
I cannot agree with the last statement.
As I said before, in view of the conflicts and the problems they also bring for the civilian population, it is necessary for both parties to be involved in resolving the conflict.
For that reason, the European Union has not placed greater confidence in any of the parties, not even the government.
The EU's measures, and those of other organisations active there, must be geared to a permanent end to the conflict.
I cannot comment personally on the first question, but I will have it examined again.
Subject: Ecological consequences of the northern oil pipeline
The Northern Dimension policy, of which the Baltic Sea Strategy is a constituent part, places particular emphasis on the environment and climate change.
The Baltic Sea is one of the world's most contaminated seas.
Furthermore, 282 000 tonnes of dangerous weapons have lain on its bed since the Second World War.
Economic activities, and in particular the planned construction of the northern oil pipeline, may lead to an ecological disaster whose consequences are difficult to predict.
Does not the country that holds the Presidency and which is a participant in the project consider that, before it starts to implement projects of this kind, the EU should obtain independent expertise on the possible ecological consequences of the construction of a gas pipeline?
Clearly, expertise provided by the authors of the project and relating to their own interests will not convince the Community's citizens of the safety of the project.
