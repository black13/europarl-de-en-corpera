President-in-Office of the Council.
So far as I know, no Council would give an assessment here.
Firstly, it is a commercial decision by private companies.
It is not being built by the Federal Republic of Germany.
The people who are building it or want to build it are consortia from Germany with Dutch participation.
If procedures are initiated and Member States have to check whether the project complies with the rules in their particular area or if the applicant does not agree with their decision, then it will of course first be a matter for the national courts.
Subject: EU territorial agenda
One of the priority objectives of the EU German Presidency is the adoption of an EU territorial agenda.
What measures does the Council intend to take in practice towards an integrated urban and rural development policy?
Will the projected Leipzig Charter effectively combine this policy with regional development policy and, if so, how?
