The Council as such is not involved in the initiatives relating to the Leipzig Charter for Sustainable European Cities and the EU territorial agenda.
These initiatives are taken by the Member States on an informal basis.
The Leipzig Charter and the EU territorial agenda are offers by the European ministers for regional and urban development to take better account of urban and territorial matters in the implementation of EU policies, for example in the question of how an integrated regional and urban development policy can contribute to the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives of more sustainable economic growth and strengthening the European social model.
The results of the informal ministers' meeting will therefore be passed on to all European institutions.
These can then examine independently to what extent taking account of urban and territorial matters will be helpful in achieving their political objectives.
