President-in-Office of the Council.
Particular results must first be evaluated, and then they can be passed on to the appropriate institutions, at least where topics have been identified.
The approach was that opportunities for integrated urban or regional development also exist in cross-border areas.
Our presidency has only slightly more than two months left to run.
I expect the President-in-Office will be presenting results at the end of his presidency and making them available to the institutions concerned.
