Mr President, Commissioner, recent events in the European Union have shown that information and consultation within the framework of the European Works Council function only in a highly inadequate manner.
We are now at the stage where worker representation bodies in different countries - France, Germany and so on - are being played off one against the other, yet this is not some sort of international sports match.
Consultation and information within the framework of the committee of the European Works Council simply no longer exist.
For that reason there is a need for a change in this regard.
I would point out that the first revision was supposed to have taken place back in 1999.
The subject was brought up again in 2004 and now we are at the stage where we are recognising the need for revision.
I am very pleased that it was Mrs Stauner of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who prepared this subject for us, as it was former German Chancellor Kohl who, when the European Works Council Directive came into the world, was first in line in the delivery room.
At that time, though, our industries were still in a quite different condition to the one they are in today; there have been a lot of changes.
Business organisations have got smaller, methods of communication have changed.
There is much in this sector that has to be changed.
All I can do is call on us to seize the opportunity currently before us to undertake this revision.
Let us bring the European Works Council up to date!
Let us update the regulations and bring them into line with reality!
It is tremendously important, from the point of view of democratic politics, for this to work within companies, because if it does not work there is an enormous potential for conflict, and that is what has to be prevented.
All I can do, then, Commissioner, is to entreat you to get this under way quickly and to push the Council as necessary in order to make this happen.
