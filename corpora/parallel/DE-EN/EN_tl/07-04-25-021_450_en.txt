Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that something bad must always happen before the Commission advances an opinion on a subject as important as strengthening the rights of workers in the area of information and consultation.
Airbus's Power8 restructuring programme and the consequent threat of job losses and sales of factories shook European Airbus employees to the core.
In the discussion with the works councils of the areas affected, Varel and Nordenham, and at a meeting of trade union representatives from all over Europe that took place in Brussels recently, the workers pointed out time and again the inadequate supply of information to and consultation with Airbus employees.
For this reason, the rights of European works councils must, first of all, at long last be fully implemented and then extended and given greater depth.
It is indefensible for workers not to be provided with comprehensive information and consultation if their companies are being restructured or if there are possible job losses.
This indefensible situation can be remedied only by finally getting the long-overdue revision of the European Works Council Directive under way.
So far, I have not heard of a single company anywhere in Europe that has got into difficulties because of its works council.
On the contrary, in fact, consultation and providing early information to workers could definitely have saved large numbers of companies and jobs in Europe and fixed management mistakes.
After 13 years it is time for this legislation to be fully brought to bear in order to ensure social peace in Europe.
