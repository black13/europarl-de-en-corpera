Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, uncertainty is always a bad thing, especially when it relates to the future of jobs.
The sword of Damocles that being laid off represents has been hanging over the heads of thousands of Airbus employees since January.
That is an intolerable situation.
It is no way to treat human beings.
In my constituency there was talk, with the advent of Power8, first of 1 200 job losses, then of 700, then of job losses solely amongst temporary workers and now we hear that Airbus actually wants to start hiring again!
All of this cannot fail to make one dizzy.
The approach taken by the top management at EADS is, as we all know, no longer an isolated incident.
We have heard this a number of times today.
The fact that something like this occurs despite the European Works Council Directive is simply scandalous and makes it glaringly evident that action is needed.
For that reason, there is an urgent need to introduce specific measures to provide a stronger reminder to employers of their obligations in terms of informing and consulting with their employees.
We must ensure, above all, that sanctions against contravention of the directive are rigorously enforced right across the EU and also that employees and their representatives are represented on the supervisory boards.
Commissioner Å pidla, I genuinely expect the Commission finally to get on with the long overdue task of updating this directive, for, as is well known, the EU's competitiveness and productivity stand and fall by good, safe jobs.
