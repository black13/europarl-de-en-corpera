on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for her work.
She worked closely with the shadow rapporteur and produced a sound draft report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
The Commission proposal aims towards systematisation and a uniform model for the directives on worker protection.
In a single implementation report to be submitted every five years and for which we have been waiting quite a long time already, the Member States are to report to the Commission on the practical application of the directives in question.
This plan will certainly provide the single-state authorities - which is the truth of the matter - with a better overview.
Comprehensive and effective worker protection is a basic prerequisite for ensuring and maintaining the health of workers.
4 500 employees die in the EU every year as a result of accidents in the workplace, while over 4 million people are affected by accidents at work each year.
A summary report of this nature can provide us with important information with regard to what preventive measures we need to implement and make a contribution to improving the quality of worker protection in the EU.
