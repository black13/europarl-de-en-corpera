Mr President, I wish to state here in relation to the way I voted that I have not voted against this resolution because I am in favour of discriminating against minority groups.
I also condemn the statement made by the Polish Minister.
I voted against because I believe that there are more important subjects which we should be addressing this week, also in the form of a resolution, namely, the murder of Christians in Turkey.
We should be able to address the theme of Turkish women being forced to marry, including those living in Europe, or the genocide perpetrated by Muslim mounted militias in Darfur, or human rights violations in Venezuela as well.
I therefore voted against because I am of the opinion that we should have been dealing with more important topics.
