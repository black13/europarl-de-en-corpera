Mr President, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the entire Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
The Group of the European People's Party today abstained from voting since it does not agree with the procedure at the present time.
The PPE-DE Group declares its support for the decisions taken by the European Parliament in relation to homophobia, in particular, the decision of 16 January 2006.
In this spirit, the Group of the European People's Party emphatically rejects any form of homophobia as well as all forms of discrimination.
At the same time, the PPE-DE Group has the utmost confidence in the institutions of the European Union, in particular, the Commission as the guardian of the treaties.
Given the existing legal position, key word - 'the anti-discrimination Directive', the Commission will take the necessary steps, as far as there is a need on the part of EU Member States, in order to put a stop to these initiatives which must be rejected in every respect.
In addition, our group wholly supports the bringing in of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to investigate homophobia in Europe and would like to await the results of this investigation before taking further steps.
The PPE-DE Group absolutely trusts in the fact that Polish society will take the appropriate steps against these homophobic trends which have started to appear.
