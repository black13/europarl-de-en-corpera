on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is a land of culture.
Its achievements in the fields of literature, music and the performing arts time and again gain our admiration and respect.
In this respect, Russia is a true member of the European family of nations.
However, Russia also has its shady side.
The measures currently being taken by the Russian Government against human rights and fundamental freedoms are casting very dark shadows.
To act against its own citizens in the manner it did on 14 and 15 April in Moscow and St. Petersburg is unworthy of a genuine member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.
The freedom of speech and freedom of the press are the cornerstones of a democratic State.
The peoples of Europe, including the citizens of Russia, paid for these rights with their blood.
It is therefore a disgrace that Putin's Government, which lays claim to be a world power and offers its services as a mediator in all international conflicts while strutting like a peacock, is acting against its own people in such a cowardly and violent manner.
Such a government cannot negotiate with us at eye level or as a partner having equal rights.
Freedom is always the freedom to dissent.
This should be impressed on the Russian Government.
