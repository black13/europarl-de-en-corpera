Madam President, in 1991, I not only got to know the most senior Estonian fighting for freedom, Tunne Kelam, but also Boris Yeltsin when he came here to Strasbourg to bear witness to a new Russia.
In the meantime, there has been a massive relapse.
Russia is an authoritarian state with an increasingly aggressive foreign policy.
I believe we should emphasise with the utmost clarity that fish always start to stink from the head.
The use of OMON militia against demonstrators and foreign journalists such as the German television correspondents would not have been possible without explicit instructions from the Kremlin.
We must be clear on the fact that President Putin should bear overall responsibility for repressing the first tentative shoots of democracy and freedom in Russia.
We need clear language here and should not simply talk about slip-ups.
Putin is responsible; the Russian leadership is responsible.
This is about our credibility because Russia has signed up to European principles in the Council of Europe's Declaration of human rights, the observance of which we must insist on together, and with clarity.
