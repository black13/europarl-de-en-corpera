Madam President, honourable Members, allow me, at this point, to make a brief comment on behalf of the Council and express how very depressing this topic is for all of us.
The BBC correspondent, Alan Johnston, was abducted in Gaza on 12 March.
A large amount of anxiety was prevalent at last Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers surrounding Mr Johnston, who has already been missing for six weeks.
We call for his immediate and unconditional release.
Mr Johnston is an internationally respected journalist with many friends in Gaza.
It has always been a matter of concern for him that the world should see with its own eyes how things stand there.
His abduction is a criminal act which I can only condemn in the strongest possible terms.
At this point, I would also like to extend my sympathy to his family, which is fighting on his behalf, and which has already been living in fear and uneasy uncertainty for more than one and a half months now.
(Applause)
