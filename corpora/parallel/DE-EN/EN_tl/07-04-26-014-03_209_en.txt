author. - Madam President, by means of this resolution today, we are giving expression to our significant anxiety regarding the increasing number of political assassinations which have been committed over recent years in the Philippines.
The human rights organisation, Karapatan, has recorded 839 cases of summary executions since 2001.
All the victims were individuals who had given their support to matters of concern facing the Filipino people: farmers fighting for their land, workers and trade union leaders who are standing up for fair wages and better working conditions, and committed members of the clergy.
Arbitrary executions, omnipresent political repression, growing militarisation and the fact that perpetrators from paramilitary and military units are exempt from punishment and protected have, unfortunately, become a government trademark.
For a long time, foreign countries have looked away.
As far as the International Court of Justice in The Hague is concerned, ignorance and a misjudgment of the situation are just as responsible for the fact that foreign countries have turned a blind eye for a long time as the approval given by the USA which the government in Manila could, and can continue, to rely on.
We condemn the rough and systematic violations of citizens' rights, the abductions, the disappearances and political assassinations.
We firmly call on the State authorities in the Philippines to carry out the necessary inquiries and to bring those responsible to justice.
We call on the State authorities to ratify the UN Convention on abduction by force and to enact the implementing provisions.
All these steps are required as the first step in de-escalation so that, in a few weeks, halfway democratic elections can be guaranteed.
