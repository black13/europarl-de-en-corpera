author. - Madam President, in two weeks, elections will be held in the Philippines.
The risk is rising that internal political conflicts will escalate.
Since 2006, as has been mentioned by my fellow Members, journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, farmers and priests have been murdered.
What is unclear is who the perpetrators are.
It is clear, however, that the murders always follow the same pattern.
The authorities are incapable of conducting investigations with sufficient thoroughness.
The judicial system is overloaded, under funded and inefficient.
The number of convictions is so low that one can almost already talk about a climate of impunity.
President Arroyo and his government are aware of the seriousness of the situation.
A special police task force and the independent Melo Commission were set up.
Their recommendations resulted in the State President ordering the strengthening of the investigation and prosecution processes, the establishment of special courts and, finally, the creation of witness protection programmes as well.
In February, the UN's special rapporteur, Mr Philip Alston, was able to question those responsible and affected extensively.
I side with his demand that accusations regarding the involvement of elements of the military or individuals in the army should be examined.
The European Union should offer both technical support and support in terms of personnel to enable these murders to be cleared up and the justice system to be improved in a sustainable manner.
