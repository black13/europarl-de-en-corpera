President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Rocard, ladies and gentlemen, the present debate on the position of the Arab world in international politics is timely.
As we see it, one of the issues here is how to further improve cooperation between the West and the Arab states, so that both sides can benefit from it.
I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to Mr Rocard, with whose report the European Parliament, too, underlines the importance of EU-Arab cooperation.
Greater dynamism has been apparent in the Arab League's regional involvement for some years now - the Beirut Peace Initiative of March 2002 being just one example.
Recent weeks, in particular, have seen a massive interest on the part of the Arab world in reaching out beyond the borders of the region for closer coordination and cooperation - including on its own initiative.
On the one hand, this development strikes me as resulting from a return, to a certain extent, by the Arab world to the Arab League as an instrument of cooperation that has been neglected over time.
On the other hand, I see it as representing a response to the quest on the part of non-Arab states and organisations for a reliable regional partner in an unstable region.
The ongoing involvement of the Arab League in Lebanon, which started immediately after last summer's war, is very important; and so we encourage the Arab League to continue its present endeavours.
Nevertheless, I believe that the clearest illustration of the new quality of international involvement by the Arab League, under the powerful leadership of Saudi Arabia, was the confirmation of the Arab Peace Initiative at the Riyadh Summit in late March.
This Initiative shows the prospects of a return to normal for relations between Israel and the Arab States.
The continued debate within the Arab League substantiates the view that the Arab world has the will to make genuine progress.
The EU, too, has increased its involvement in the Middle East in recent years and months; the Quartet remaining its key actor.
Recently, both sides - the Arab world and Europe - have stepped up discussions on their ideas for intensifying political cooperation.
In this regard, I should just like to mention the meeting of the EU Troika with an Arab League delegation in Sharm el-Sheikh, and also to point out that Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in his capacity as President of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, has invited a ministerial delegation of the Arab League to a meeting with all the EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Brussels on 14 May.
This alone does not reduce the internal political, social and cultural challenges facing the Arab world, of course; but I should like to emphasise clearly that Europe offers Arab countries and societies cooperation in all fields.
It is my hope that this cooperation can contribute to greater understanding and tolerance between Europe and the Arab world.
These two values: understanding and tolerance - characteristics that the Council President Angela Merkel described as constituting Europe's soul in Strasbourg at the start of the German Presidency - are the vital ingredients for successful dialogue.
For this reason, I welcome Mr Rocard's inclusion of cultural aspects, too, in his report.
These play a major role in determining the EU's scope for supporting reform processes in the Arab world.
Ignorance, stereotypes and hostility on both sides hinder a productive partnership with prospects.
Dialogue and understanding of the culture of its relevant opposite number are a precondition for the EU's taking the right approach to promoting reform processes.
Last year, in the context of the 'caricature conflict', there was much talk of the need for more 'dialogue between cultures'.
We must use this term with caution, however, as the idea of a dialogue between cultures could accidentally promote cultural relativism.
The idea that standards and values are in principle attributable to an individual's culture runs counter to our understanding of universal human rights.
I fully agree with the report in this respect, emphasising as it does the importance of intercultural dialogue whilst coming out clearly in favour of the universality of human rights.
We must avoid falling into the 'culturism trap' in all respects, not only with regard to human rights.
Human beings have diverse identities.
We are not only Muslim or Christian or atheist, but also member of a profession, student, father, member of an association and much more.
The problem with Islamic fundamentalism, as with any other kind of fundamentalism, is that one element of personal identity - the religious - is placed above all others, and the complexity of the world is ultimately reduced to the idea of an opposition between 'Islam' and 'the West'.
Our policies must avoid everything that promotes this reduction.
We must emphasise what unites us rather than what divides us.
We must select joint EU-Arab forums, particularly the Anna Lindh Foundation, for our discussions and projects.
Political Islamism is an expression of the modernisation crisis of Arab societies, as Mr Rocard's report also points out.
Tackling this is primarily a task for Arab societies themselves.
There, too, there are secular and liberal forces.
What is often missing, however, is dialogue within these societies on the issue of how the relationship between state, religion and society should be shaped in political terms.
Dialogue within society will make clear that the religious neutrality of the state and the enforcement of human rights are not a reform agenda being forced on the Arab world by 'the West', but rather are in the interests of Arab societies themselves.
We can support this process of dialogue within society by providing forums for dialogue.
This is an important task, for example, of the various political foundations found in countries such as Germany.
