Madam President, I should like to inform the public and those responsible of an outrageous case of obstructing the work of an independent Member of the European Parliament.
In Austria, the top candidate of the Liberal Forum at the last student elections, Martin Ehrenhauser, received a letter on 20 April 2007 stating: 'We are offering you a job as a contract agent from 15 May 2007 working for the political group of Non-attached Members in the European Parliament.'
Mr Ehrenhauser travelled here.
Suddenly the letter is no longer valid.
The reason: a political instruction from the very top, from the new Secretary General, Harald RÃ¸mer.
This is unacceptable.
It was a bolt from the blue and in this case it affects me.
You will be aware that every Member has the right to work with at least one member of parliamentary staff in his group in his mother tongue.
I am the only one who is denied this privilege, because there is a desire to make the work of an unpleasant critic more difficult.
At the same time, it is precisely the large groups here that allocate themselves legions of staff who are loyal to their party.
Altogether Parliament employs thousands of staff.
I call on the Bureau and those responsible to investigate this case.
This kind of thing is detrimental to Parliament and it is also detrimental to our understanding of democracy.
