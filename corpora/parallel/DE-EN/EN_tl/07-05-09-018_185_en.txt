on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I too should like firstly to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, for his excellent and very professional work on this dossier.
I can fully support the compromise that has been negotiated with the Presidency.
I should therefore like to comment briefly on just one point, which we have already considered in the debate on Euro 5, and which is particularly important to me, namely access to vehicle repair information for independent garages.
This access to information is of crucial importance for European citizens.
Anyone who is on holiday, travelling in Europe in his car, can break down abroad.
Often, however, the nearest authorised repair garage is hundreds of miles away.
That is why we need to ensure that free, independent garages are also able to repair that motor vehicle.
Furthermore, all drivers in their home countries should also be able to choose the garage where they would like their vehicle to be repaired.
This competition will definitely also benefit consumers.
We will guarantee this with our new rules.
To this end we have included an explicit provision in the new type-approval framework directive stating that vehicle manufacturers have to make all of the necessary information readily available to independent garages to ensure that they are able to repair and maintain a motor vehicle.
This provision is consistent with the wording of the Euro 5 Regulation, which we adopted last year at its first reading.
Our objective is to guarantee access to repair information for independent garages.
This should be ensured for a transitional period by Euro 5, but should ultimately be provided for in the type-approval framework directive.
Finally, I should like to appeal once more to Commissioner Verheugen to ensure that the political will of Parliament and the Council is respected in the negotiations on technical implementation, because the provisions on access to repair information also have to work in practice.
