Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by giving the Commission credit for consulting this House and all the stakeholders at this early stage concerning the new directive, something of which I am sure one could not always be certain.
This makes me confident that the new directive is being planned carefully and will incorporate not only the relevant assessments of impact on society, lawmaking, and subsidiarity, but also European citizens' rights.
Rules on health care across borders have become necessary, and many members of the public expect them to be in place - I am referring to workers in our border regions, to migratory workers, to pensioners in south-eastern Europe and Greece, and, indeed, to Europe's long-distance drivers, about whom I have just been reminded - and not only to all these, but also to all the other workers who were formerly unable to benefit from these things, which were - as has been said a couple of times - reserved to private patients.
It is for that reason that I find it all the more absurd that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left in this House want to further entrench the privileges of those with private health insurance.
If the opening up of the national systems is done with caution and care, it will be something from which we can all benefit.
Constructive competition among service providers, competition between the best methods, the most useful research and the most successful strategies in the health sector - all these things can be useful, subject, of course, to the criteria to which I have already referred and which do not apply in the internal market, namely quality, safety, solidarity and sustainability.
I am sure that this House will not fail under any circumstances in allowing those criteria to prevail.
