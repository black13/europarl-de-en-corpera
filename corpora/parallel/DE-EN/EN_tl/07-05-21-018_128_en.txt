draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Laperrouze for her outstanding cooperation on what is a technical and difficult dossier, albeit one that is of great importance in terms of the 27-Member Europe, since the efforts at harmonisation serve also to prevent distortions of competition within Europe.
As is the way of things with technical dossiers, though, there are also approval procedures and administrative burdens, which need to be constantly reviewed in the light of the need for better regulation, with its present target of a 25% cutback in administrative regulations in Europe.
I believe that considerations of better governance make it necessary to set the right priorities, because, for small and medium-sized firms in particular, technical regulations and reviews involve not always or only costs, but are also associated with burdensome administrative chores.
It is for this reason that I am asking the Commission to keep on reviewing the technical practicability of these rules, to keep them up to date and, of course, to scrutinise their costs as to their proportionality.
That will be a fundamental requirement as time passes and bearing in mind the various stages that are planned.
That brings me to the absolute ban on deterioration, which, in practice, can bring in its train numerous problems in industry and agriculture.
We all know that, when we are dealing with water, we can have floods one day and areas of drought the next.
If this absolute ban on deterioration were brought in in this area, these rules would make for enormous problems in agriculture and industry within a short period of time.
