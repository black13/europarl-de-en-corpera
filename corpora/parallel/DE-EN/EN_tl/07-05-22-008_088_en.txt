in writing. - I should like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for highlighting the great need for action on the part of the European Union in the negotiation of economic partnership agreements.
We ought to start by bearing in mind that we have to work at the efficient inclusion of the ACP states in world trade and at equal success in all regional groups, which can happen, inter alia, through trade concessions and technical aid for the producers, so that the losses they sustain through tariff revenues can be compensated for, yet that alone does not give them what they need.
What they also need in order to actually benefit from easier access to the market is expert instruction and guidance.
I also believe it is likely to be essential that the underlying administrative procedures be simplified if they are to be able to use the resources available to them in a more efficient way.
We, being Members of this House, ought, I think, to be aware of the fact that trade with states such as these is also in Europe's interests, and, moreover, we, being citizens of developed states, owe it to the citizens of the ACP countries to do everything in our power to enable them to put down roots in world trade.
