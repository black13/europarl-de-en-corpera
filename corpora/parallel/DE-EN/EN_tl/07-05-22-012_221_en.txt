Mr President, it is very good to see you, Prime Minister Prodi, in this House, not only, of course, because of your Prime Ministerial position, but also because you are someone who has done a great deal for Europe.
Mr Prodi, you spoke about foreign policy, and I am very grateful to you for that.
There are many in this House who are currently saying that we need to present a united front in our dealings with Russia.
There are others - and there are many of them - who say that we must not be dominated by America.
We need a strong Europe.
We all agree that India, China and Brazil are getting stronger and stronger, and wonder whether we can secure our interests there.
There is the Middle East problem, which we are about to debate, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is already in her seat.
How, then, is there to be European input in all these areas when we do not have a common foreign and security policy, and how are we supposed to have one of those if there is not, in future, one person who can, beyond all doubt, deal with all these foreign issues and be responsible for them?
It is on this issue in particular, Prime Minister, that I urge you to stand firm.
I agree with you entirely that not every treaty is a good one.
What we need is one that goes beyond the minimum required and really moves Europe forward.
Prime Minister, I wish you all the best.
