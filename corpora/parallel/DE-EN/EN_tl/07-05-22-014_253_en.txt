Madam President, the situation is indeed a tragic one.
Groups of Hamas radicals are day by day bombarding Sderot with Qassam rockets, and these attacks, far from being random, are the fifth breach of the cease-fire so far.
What is evident is that the attempt is again being made to distract attention from the in-fighting between the Palestinians themselves, that is to say between Hamas and Fatah, with fighting in which 55 Palestinians have died, killed by Palestinian hands.
It seemed to them that the time was ripe for attention to be diverted to their common foe, Israel, and how did Israel respond?
It responded with the mailed fist.
This Israeli Government, whose approval ratings lie around the 3% mark, is doing Hamas a favour by trying to wipe out the source of the attacks by military means, leading to more Palestinian victims, whose deaths we lament.
Hamas has again won itself time and can put off to another day the political concessions that have to be made.
Yet again, we appear to be paralysed.
Concessions were, after all, made in Mecca; they may not, to be sure, have been sufficient, but, despite the weaknesses of Mecca, these concessions amounted to a major step in the direction of peace.
That agreement has now been stricken to the heart by this resumption of violence.
I do believe, then, that it is for the time being right and proper that the European Union should insist on compliance with all the Quartet's conditions and with what was agreed at Mecca before it resumes making payments to the unity government.
This does not run counter to Mr McMillan-Scott's call for pragmatic and all-round cooperation to be sought where it really is for the people's benefit.
We should not, nevertheless, abandon this vital tool before it is time to do so.
I would encourage the Council, the Commission and the Arab League to make the effort to press ahead, and would very much like to see them achieve success as soon as possible.
