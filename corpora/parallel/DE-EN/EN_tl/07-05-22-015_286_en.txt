Commissioner, you quite rightly said that it makes perfectly good sense to now use fallow land for the cultivation of plants from which fuel can be produced.
This currently makes for a problem as regards the production of barley for brewing purposes, since the subsidies for the production of biofuels make the cultivation of other crops a more attractive proposition for farmers, so, back home, we have had problems that affect our own economy, in cultivating the crops necessary for the brewing of beer, which is not the least important of economic sectors.
