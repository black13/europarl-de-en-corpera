One might well ask which is the more important - food or energy?
In the days when we still had our own supplies of crude oil and natural gas, the situation was quite different; now we have to import everything.
Even though we know that global demand for crude oil and natural gas is on the rise, we still aspire to maintain the same standard of comfort, and consequently, some of our efforts have to be devoted to the production of energy.
As I have said, we currently have so much in the way of reserves and options, that we have to make the fullest possible use of the latter.
We must, however, also be smart enough not to do something for which we will have to pay a high price later on.
The schemes we are devising constitute a first step.
We have every chance of organising them in such a way that no great problems ensue for the food industry.
