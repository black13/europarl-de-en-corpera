Commissioner, I would be interested to know how the financial support for the Trans-European Networks (TENs) is to be secured; is there a planned date for when money will actually be forthcoming for these TEN pipelines - Nabucco or Bluestream, for example - and could you envisage a timetable being prepared in time for the 2008 review?
