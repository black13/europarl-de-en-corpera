The Commission can offer only partial support in this area, since there are fewer resources available to us for it in the Budget.
We do, of course, support those companies and enterprises that are able to invest money in it, for investment in energy transport is economically of very considerable interest.
What I can say right now is that the timetable for Nabucco has been decided on and that the date of 2012 has been set.
The Commission has already given financial support to a limited extent, but political support is important too.
Over the coming months, the coordinator of the project will be announced, and this will of course be done in collaboration with your House.
It is my belief that the adoption of the energy package will enable us to get back to this issue when the Budget perspective is debated; I also take the view that it is necessary to set aside more funds for the trans-European energy networks in views of the directions involved that may well be strategically important, but are not as profitable for the business sector.
It is for that reason that we need more money, but we still have time to analyse all these things and prepare a proposal.
