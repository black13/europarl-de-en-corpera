Commissioner, another aspect of this issue - and one that I think must not be overlooked - is the plethora of websites run by fundamentalist Muslims for the purposes of anti-Western propaganda, which incite people to fight against the Western world and its ideals.
Is the Commission aware of these activities, and are measures in place to counteract them?
