Mr Vice-President of the Commission, my question has to do with the Internet and, indirectly, with terrorism, against which the directive on data retention was intended to be a measure.
Is it the case that it cannot apply to pay-as-you-go mobile phones, to webmail operators such as Hotmail, or to private servers?
That amounts to quite a lot of cover of which terrorist networks, among others, can avail themselves in order to avoid detection.
What, then, does the directive on the retention of data actually provide by way of added value?
