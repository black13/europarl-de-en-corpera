Commissioner, I think that is an excellent initiative to take, but how are the victims to be made aware that they can use this number?
Has the Commission made provision for the funds needed to disseminate this information?
How do you propose to ensure that it actually works in practice?
The victims, who may, for example, be young women from Russia, are, in the main, young women from Russia who do not speak any of the EU's languages.
How will you ensure in practice that these hotlines actually work, for there are generally very considerable timelags, and that people do not get put into a queue and perhaps have to wait all of half an hour before their call is answered?
