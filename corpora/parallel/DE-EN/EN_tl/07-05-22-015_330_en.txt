There are two questions I should like to put to you, Commissioner.
The first is to ascertain how things stand as regards the systematic resettlements of Serbian refugees from Bosnia and Kosovo, which, regrettably, are altering the ethnic composition of areas such as the Hungarian community of Temerin in the vicinity of Novi Sad.
Secondly, I should like to know what is happening as regards the teacher training establishments that are supposed to be being set up, with EU funds, for the Romanians, Slovaks and Ruthenes, but which process seems to have come to a standstill.
Have they now been set up?
