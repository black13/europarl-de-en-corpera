You rightly pointed out, Commissioner, that a great deal of EU grant money is spent on protecting minorities and on matters of special concern to the EU.
Might it not also be possible - or is it perhaps not necessary - to ensure that political pressure is also brought to bear on Serbia to get it to prevent certain abuses from being committed in accordance with its policies or to change those policies in such a way that we do not need to spend EU money on repairing the damage later on?
