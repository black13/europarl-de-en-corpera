Mr President, while I do endorse Mr Mauro's report, I do regret the absence from it, as also from the Commission draft, of any reference to Community grants being tied to measures for protection against noise from rail and road traffic.
However much development work might need to be done, the people living nearby also need to be considered, and not only their health but also their acceptance of the work.
I therefore urge that the rules on protection against noise for rail vehicles be amended as soon as possible to make reference to lower maximum levels and to promote noise abatement measures in exactly the same way as they promote the extension of trans-European networks.
