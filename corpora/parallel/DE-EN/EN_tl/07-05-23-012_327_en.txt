Mr President-in-Office of the Council, while your statements imply that a whole array of positions have been put on record by the Council and by the European Union, the reality is, however, that Cyprus, as a candidate for accession, failed to comply with these criteria in at least an equal number of instances.
While I am on the subject of Cyprus, would it not be possible for the European Union or the Council to become involved in ways more active than those you have announced.
We are keeping a close eye on what is going on there.
