If I may begin with the last question, I can only reiterate that Turkey is perfectly well aware of what it has to do in the course of the negotiations on its accession, although that does not exclude the possibility of our not only observing critical developments, but also commenting on them in the course of dialogue.
The Turks are quite well aware of that, and the Presidency does not at the present time have occasion to cancel the forthcoming talks or accession conferences with them.
In response to the second comment, I would like to say that we are not just observing; how, after all, is the European Union, having laid down the framework, supposed to remind Turkey of the undertakings it has made and of the criteria with which it must comply if not in dialogue?
While the present government does indeed bear ultimate responsibility for the country, it has not changed the criteria; it is rather the case that other groups in the country have threatened to intervene if the result that emerges is not to their liking.
One has to distinguish precisely who is responsible for the country, and, as we see it, that is still its democratically elected government.
Subject: Frontex activity on the Union's maritime borders
Given how effective the Frontex mechanism's activities in protecting the EU's Atlantic waters are proving, can the Council guarantee that Frontext activity along the Union's maritime borders will be ongoing?
