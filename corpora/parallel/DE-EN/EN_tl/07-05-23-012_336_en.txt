We will not be doing enough if we consider the problem of refugees only in terms of how we can best secure our external borders.
Since I have also mentioned the numerous initiatives taken by the European Union, including the African Union/European Union Summit in Tripoli, it would be misguided to consider only Frontex and its role in combating the problem.
The issue is, after all, just how we can pursue our strategy together with the African countries.
We have already discussed with Nigeria how good governance can help keep people in their own countries, while at the same time beginning to enjoy prospects in such areas as education, training, schools, health and job creation where they live.
That is the most important thing.
I hope that this issue will be taken up at the European Union/African Union summit meeting.
Terrible things often happen at sea, but, in the past, where it was aware that people-smugglers were operating, the European Union has helped to supply the boat people, at short notice, with lunch parcels, and, while it has to be said that these were not enough to ensure their safe arrival, they did receive support.
We can agree, then, that it is the Member States that are responsible for the defence of the external borders, while Frontex can be called on to act in a supporting role by - for example - monitoring a stretch of the sea or of a land frontier.
Subject: Security or freedom for European citizens at airports
Has the Council assessed the measures prohibiting the transport of liquids during flights in terms of their effectiveness in thwarting terrorism and in terms of the undesirable consequences for the economy, health and justice, freedom and security for members of the public at large, who are having their personal items confiscated unjustifiably, being deprived of or having to pay dearly for drinking water, and being badly treated by the security services at European airports, with no control over the quality of those services which they provide to the public?
