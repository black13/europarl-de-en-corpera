Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I do believe that it is in everyone's interests, particularly of the travellers themselves, that they should be able to fly with the maximum of safety.
None of this was done on the spur of the moment, and there were concrete reasons why security under these conditions had to be guaranteed.
It is certainly important that the persons involved be asked just what all this achieved.
It is unfortunate that there are at present no other mechanisms for examining things in a more transparent manner and perhaps as simply as was formerly the case, but none of the members of the public who are happy to avail themselves of their freedom of movement and their freedom to travel would understand persons responsible for their safety and freedom not themselves guaranteeing the highest possible standard of security.
If new technical developments make it possible to do this in new ways without such hindrances, then all parties will surely be happy to accept them.
Further to the points that you have made, despite all the information provided as to all the things that may no longer be taken through the checkpoints, there are still far too many members of the public taking their own bottles of mineral water and fruit juice or other items with them.
If people were to take some responsibility for themselves, then, it might well help reduce the amount of rubbish.
