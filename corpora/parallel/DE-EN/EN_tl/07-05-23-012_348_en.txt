Madam President, Baroness Ludford, I am aware of the debates that have been held in your House, in one of which, held recently, we participated, but what I can say is that there was a pro-tolerance demonstration in Poland, a few months ago now, at the end of last year, and that there were opportunities for demonstrations until quite recently.
The presidency will always denounce the things to which you refer when they occur within the European Union.
As for those things over which the European Union has no influence, you may be assured that we will raise them in dialogues, certainly in the human rights dialogue between the European Union and Russia.
I do not at the present time have any information relating to the cases of possible bans to which you refer, in which the equality bus was not permitted to travel further or was not allowed to be received, but I will act on your suggestion and investigate them.
Perhaps you could inform us, the Presidency, as to in which country that actually happened.
Subject: Human rights in Chechnya
President Putin has appointed Mr Kadyrov as Chechen President, although the Chechens were unable to vote, and while aware of the fact that Kadyrov is described by independent human rights organisations as a commander of death squads.
How does the Council assess the situation in Chechnya, and what steps is it taking to restore democracy, the rule of law and human rights in that country?
