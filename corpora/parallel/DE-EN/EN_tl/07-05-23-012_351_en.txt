Mr President-in-Office, just as the Federal Chancellor, at the weekend, demonstrated that it is possible to combine firmness of purpose and faithfulness to principle with diplomatic adroitness, you are doing the same here.
I would like to ask now - and this is a very practical question - just what can be done to improve access to Chechnya.
Are you doing anything to this end?
Secondly, elections in Chechnya are held under the supervision of the OSCE, and the Council of Europe has done a great deal too.
All that has been brought to nothing.
Would it not be possible for the EU, as a community within the Council of Europe and the OSCE, to press for new initiatives for direct action in Chechnya?
