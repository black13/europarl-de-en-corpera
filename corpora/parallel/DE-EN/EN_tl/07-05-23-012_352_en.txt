Mr Posselt, I do not believe that you need me to tell you what the security situation in Chechnya is like, or that it does indeed make access more difficult, but the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights recently ascertained, on a visit there, that a certain amount of progress had been achieved there in terms of economic development, although this must, as you say, be brought home to Russia in frank dialogue.
Where programmes have become operational, the attempt should be made to implement them as fully as possible in order that they may actually have an impact on those whom they are meant to serve.
Subject: Tariffs on light bulbs
Will the Presidency-in-Office be actively seeking agreement to reduce, or ideally remove, the import tariffs on energy-efficient light bulbs from China which come up for review this October?
What is the Council's assessment of the cost-benefit implications for EU consumers if these tariffs were to be withdrawn?
Specifically which Member States currently oppose such tariff withdrawal?
