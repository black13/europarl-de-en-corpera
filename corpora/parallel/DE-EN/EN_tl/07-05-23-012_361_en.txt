I can tell Mrs Isler BÃ©guin that, if the Commission and the Council have given the same answer three times over, that does not mean that they have given a wrong or incomplete one; that is the legal position.
Listening to your question, though, I alighted on the political issue of how one can - in view of the frozen conflicts in these regions - make concessionary arrangements for the citizens in, for example, Georgia or - as Mr Paleckis has just pointed out - in other countries.
These issues are the subjects of negotiations in the context of the specific relationships, and with Georgia, for example, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy.
It is quite clear to me that the special relationship between the EU and Ukraine or Belarus makes it necessary for us, in these specific cases, to keep on trying to bring about such agreements in accordance with the provisions of the EU and with the Schengen regime.
