Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to our rapporteur Mr Busk for the truly constructive, collegial and - in my opinion - very good work he has done in cooperation with the other members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We have all been calling for a simplification of the CAP and the market organisations for a long time.
I am delighted that it is agricultural policy, the only policy really brought within the Community, that is prepared to take this course.
I warmly welcome the fact that these 21 regulations on sector-specific market organisations are being combined into a single Regulation, and thus that the legal framework is being streamlined.
The rapporteur has already specified the benefits of this single common market organisation.
In my opinion, the CAP should be managed by means of the four basic regulations.
I fully agree with the rapporteur that this can only be a matter of technical changes, which are dealt with by the Commission, and not of changes to political decisions.
We, as representatives and Members of the European Parliament, want to, and must, insist on having codecision powers and on participating in dealing with these issues.
I also consider it important that the wine and the fruit and vegetables sectors be exempted, as the process of reform for these is not yet complete.
I am also in favour of the special management committees, as, particularly in very specific matters, things cannot just be lumped together.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and say on behalf of my group that this is a very successful report.
