author. - Mr President, on 6 March and 13 February 2007, respectively, Amouna Abdallah Daldoum, 23 years old, and Sadia Idries Fadul, 22 years old, were convicted of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning.
Both women had been found guilty of adultery by a criminal court in Managil province, Gezira state.
According to reports, the women did not have a lawyer during the trial, and could not even conduct their own defence because they only speak the language of their respective ethnic group.
The trial was conducted in Arabic, but the women were not provided with interpreters.
There was an appeal against the verdict.
According to the Sudanese Embassy in Brussels, the court quashed the death sentence on grounds of lack of legal assistance.
We welcome the quashing of the death sentence if the court really confirms this, and we call on the Sudanese Government to ensure that the two women are not harmed physically or mentally.
On 3 May, two 16-year-olds were sentenced to death for murder and robbery.
The imposition of the death penalty on young offenders is prohibited under international law.
Sudan has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and accordingly committed itself to refraining from executing any persons under 18 years old.
The Sudanese Government is called on to lift the death penalty imposed on the two minors and guarantee they are not harmed physically or mentally.
We call on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to condemn the death penalty, whipping and all other cruel and degrading punishments.
