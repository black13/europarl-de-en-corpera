author. - Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Matsakis, except on one point.
He states that Sudan is a poor country - which is true, but, with its oil wealth and much more, it has the potential to be an extremely rich one.
Yet it is being exploited, and international forces and companies have certainly fanned the flames of the war in Darfur and elsewhere to promote their energy interests.
Sudan, with its defective political system, is also inflicting infinite harm on itself, however, not only as a result of the conflict between north and south, east and west, Christians and Muslims - as the generalisation always goes - but also as a result of a host of individual conflicts.
For this reason, we must insist on respect for fundamental human rights there.
As has just been said, rightly, Europe rejects the death penalty.
The debate in Poland has been mentioned.
As we know, the death penalty is incompatible with membership of the European Union and also of the Council of Europe; but similar standards are having to be developed slowly in Africa, of course.
The still fledgling African Union is particularly called upon in this regard to not only develop, but also implement and enforce politically the relevant human rights standards little by little - we know that this cannot be done overnight.
For this reason, we appeal to the Sudanese Government to not only discontinue the death penalty - particularly its particularly scandalous use on minors - but also to refrain from a) misinterpreting Sharia law as it is doing, as the barbaric customs practised there have nothing to do with real Sharia law, and b) extending Sharia law to non-Islamic communities.
The country must comply with normal civil law that is in line with the human rights standards of the United Nations.
