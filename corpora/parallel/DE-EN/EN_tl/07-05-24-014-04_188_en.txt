Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my group.
Under the Rules of Procedure, three debates on human rights issues are held within one hour on Thursday afternoon - and solely on cases of violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
This is a fourth debate, and it has nothing to do with democracy or human rights.
Therefore, we are of the opinion that this constitutes an infringement of the Rules of Procedure - which not even the Conference of Presidents may disregard.
Thus my group formally proposes that this item be discontinued immediately.
