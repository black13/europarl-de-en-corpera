Mr President, as has already been said, the Rules of Procedure speak of three subjects - no one can disregard this.
As my fellow Member has just mentioned, the matter itself has already been resolved by the resignation of the World Bank President.
There is no reason whatsoever to address this matter, as the man concerned has taken the appropriate action.
The Rules of Procedure state the number three, and we have already discussed three subjects.
Even the Conference of Presidents cannot disregard this.
