on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Paul Wolfowitz is stepping down as President of the World Bank at the end of June.
The impetus for his resignation came primarily from Canada and Europe, as we justifiably feared a loss of confidence in the World Bank.
The principles of democracy, transparency and accountability of public institutions called for time and again by the outgoing World Bank President must also apply to the operations and decision processes of the World Bank itself.
Like many of my fellow Members, I welcome the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz, a leading neoconservative and one of the main proponents of the war in Iraq.
Like many others, I regret that this decision is somewhat belated.
Of course, today's discussion and resolution do not concern only Paul Wolfowitz personally.
What is more important is to avoid making the same mistakes in future and to seek much better selection procedures.
We would ask the German and Portuguese Presidencies to present proposals on behalf of the Union for making the selection of executives of the Bretton Woods Institutions more democratic, more transparent and more responsible in future.
