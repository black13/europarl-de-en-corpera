Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I only intend to sum up briefly, because we are in agreement on the objectives.
I can understand your disappointment, Mr Lambsdorff, about the things you have just enumerated.
You are not the only one who is disappointed either, for all of us had quite different expectations.
I share the view of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who said that the Council had been in existence for a year, that we had imagined everything would be different but that we should not make snap judgments about the Council.
I urge us not to drive a wedge now between parliaments and governments.
That is not helpful - quite the contrary.
Even though there is room for improvement in this or that area, the European Union - and the national parliaments, the European Parliament, the governments and the Commission are all part of the Union - must stand together and send a clear signal that we are too firmly committed to human rights to let anyone sow division among us.
I can only hope that progress can be made in one area or another during the second year, even though a sobering interim assessment is in order after one year.
But I am spreading the word that we shall succeed together with you, who so fervently champion the cause of human rights.
I hope we can draw a more favourable conclusion in next year's report than we were able to do today.
