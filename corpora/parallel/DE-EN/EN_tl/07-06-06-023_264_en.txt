Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me add my thanks to the rapporteur, for the reform of the fruit and vegetable sector was truly not an easy subject.
As the previous speakers have pointed out, fruit and vegetables account for a very large share of our agricultural output.
These reforms will enable us to take a major step towards the modernisation of European agriculture in this sector too.
Particularly in view of the increasingly fierce international competition resulting from globalisation, it must be our prime objective to enhance the competitiveness of European fruit and vegetable growers while safeguarding the availability to consumers of high-quality European produce at reasonable prices.
One means of doing this is the creation of producer organisations, which enable growers to market their products more effectively.
Measures to promote fruit and vegetable consumption are particularly worthy of support, because they are also beneficial to public health.
Mrs Gräßle of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will table an oral amendment tomorrow in which she will ask the Commission not to wait until the scheduled date of 2013 before compiling an initial report on the execution of the title covering producer organisations, the operating fund and the operational programmes.
In fact, we want to have that first report by the end of 2010, followed by progress reports at three-yearly intervals.
We seek transparency, and we would also like to be sure that support is actually reaching our intended targets.
Seven years is too long to wait for that assurance.
It is therefore our responsibility to safeguard the future of Europe's fruit and vegetable growers by creating a safety net with the aid of targeted assistance in order to combine sustainable production with high quality and a healthy environment.
