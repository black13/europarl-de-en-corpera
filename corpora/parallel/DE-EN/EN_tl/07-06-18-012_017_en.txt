on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, this is not an objection, but just a suggestion: perhaps representatives of the Commission and Council could make a brief statement on this very precarious situation.
After all, these two bodies have an overview of the situation.
Since this is an exceptional situation, it should be possible for the Council, too, to make a statement.
Is that the case?
