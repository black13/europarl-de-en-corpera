on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I think that that is very regrettable, to put it mildly.
The Council was asked as long as a month or so ago to be present without fail at this debate, and we were even promised that it would be.
I do not understand why there is no minister or other representative of the government of the country holding the Council Presidency who is able to be present.
In my opinion, you should make it quite clear that we are very disappointed about the situation.
