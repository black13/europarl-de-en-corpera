on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I, too, attended this Conference of Presidents, and the proposal to hold a comprehensive debate on policy on Latin America, in which Cuba is to play a special role, in autumn was my motion on behalf of my group.
Mr Nassauer is an extremely honourable, proper MEP, and what I am about to say does not apply to him, as he joined us in voting in favour of the proposal for an autumn debate at this Conference of Presidents.
Nevertheless, as we know, some members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats took the view - not in response to today's decisions by the General Affairs Council but as early as last Thursday, immediately after the Conference of Presidents - that that was not on; that Cuba was at all events to be discussed immediately under urgent procedure.
We also know who this was: it was chiefly the Spanish delegation in the PPE-DE Group.
We have been wondering for some time whether 'PPE' stands for 'Partido Popular Espa√±ol'.
One thing is completely clear: it is these people in the PPE-DE Group who are responsible for the fact that every opportunity is taken in this House for domestic Spanish idealogisation.
I repeat, therefore: there is absolutely no point in debating Cuba under urgent procedure on Thursday afternoon.
The debate would attract maybe 15 people.
The European Council's decision today to invite a Cuban delegation is a confirmation that it makes perfect sense to await this dialogue before we hold a debate here in autumn, for which we shall then be properly prepared: this is respectable politics.
What we are seeing here now is domestic Spanish manoeuvring; that is what this is.
(Applause)
(Parliament approved the motion by electronic vote.)
