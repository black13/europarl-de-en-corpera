Mr President, I think that was a technical error - I am truly sorry.
During the vote, the lights went out on a large number of machines, for example those of Mr Karas and Mr Nassauer, who then wished to complain to you, albeit unaware of the actual result - which I can understand.
I therefore formally request that you repeat the vote.
(Applause)
