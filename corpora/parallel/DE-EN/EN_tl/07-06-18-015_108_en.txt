on behalf of the ITS Group. - Mr President, I welcome the fact that our discussion here and now on labelling, designations of origin and the production of spirit drinks is based on a workable compromise that is clearly suitable for preserving tradition and the typical national means of producing spirit drinks across Europe.
However, I should like to make a few observations on a related problem.
The age at which people are starting not only to smoke but also to drink alcohol has fallen.
In the case of the former, the EU has already brought itself to undertake common action and also campaigns to strengthen young people's self-confidence.
It is time we did the same in the case of the latter, in my opinion.
What a drink is called is probably of secondary importance as far as young consumers are concerned, and will probably not make any difference to the problem.
For example, the introduction of a special tax on alcopops only led people to switch to beer and to wine-based pre-mixed drinks, which explains why the number of young people drinking themselves into a coma has not gone down.
Young people are probably not drinking any more than before; the reasons for alcohol consumption have not changed.
What are significant, however, are the break-up of social structures such as the traditional family, the increasing isolation of young people in front of the television or computer screen, and often the lack of alternatives.
High-quality production of spirit drinks across Europe is an important matter.
On the other hand, however, there is no doubt that the protection of young people from related problems is just as important.
