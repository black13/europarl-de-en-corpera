Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Schnellhardt for his excellent work.
I think he has really produced a workable compromise that we should all support tomorrow.
We should bear in mind that this discussion is not about old versus new Member States.
Nor is it about good versus bad alcohol, or about capital versus labour.
It is about our producing a new version of the Regulation on spirit drinks to adapt it to the current state of affairs.
This means we want our consumers to be offered good, correctly labelled products.
If the discussion is now reduced to the vodka issue, we must ask ourselves, firstly, if this is justified and, secondly, what is behind this.
It is very presumptuous, however, to assert that, if alcohol is distilled so much that it loses all taste, the starting point of the raw materials is crucial to the product's designation.
Therefore, we would do well to simply adapt to the state of affairs prevailing in Europe - that vodka is already being produced everywhere, even if it may have had its origins in Poland - rather than throwing out the baby with the bath water.
We should bear in mind that we have achieved a great deal.
We have improved consumer protection, and we have also, for example, made it possible for traditional products to be labelled more appropriately.
That is why I am convinced that this is a really good compromise.
My thanks once more to Mr Schnellhardt!
We should all support this tomorrow.
