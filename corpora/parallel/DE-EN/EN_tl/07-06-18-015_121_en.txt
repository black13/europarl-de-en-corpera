Mr President, I, too, wish to congratulate the rapporteur.
The compromise ensures that spirit drinks will be less synthetic in future, which means that we shall see higher quality in the various spirit drinks.
The compromise also takes account of national interests: as an Austrian, 'Jagatee' is of course a particular concern of mine.
No one in this House can escape the discussion on the definition of vodka.
I have yet to grasp why many speakers have been acting as though there had been no definition of vodka up to now, and the term 'vodka' were now too broad.
The opposite is the case.
The European Union does already have a definition of vodka, and Parliament's compromise, for which the rapporteur is primarily responsible, is accommodating towards traditional vodka producers - if just a few countries were concerned, which, as we have heard today, is not the case.
The House should bear that in mind when it comes to tomorrow's vote.
