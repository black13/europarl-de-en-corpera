on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner Kyprianou, ladies and gentlemen.
I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur.
It is thanks to Mrs Svensson's persistence that Parliament will be able to adopt, as early as tomorrow, at first reading, a Regulation banning the trade in and processing of dog and cat fur.
In the trialogue with the Council and the Commission, Mrs Svensson successfully fought for a complete ban on the trade in and processing of this fur and thus said a clear 'no' to the derogations originally proposed by the Commission.
We must now ensure that the Member States implement this Regulation properly.
This represents a great success for animal protection.
This Regulation will eliminate once and for all the situation in which millions of cats and dogs have been kept and killed, sometimes in atrocious conditions, so that their fur can be processed and exported to Europe.
This is also a triumph for democracy in Europe, as numerous citizens have called for this ban in the form of signature campaigns and petitions.
This Regulation is also in the interests of consumers, as many citizens were completely unaware when purchasing products such as soft toys, clothing or keyrings that these contained dog or cat fur.
All too often, traders have circumvented the existing voluntary code of conduct and placed dog or cat fur on the market mislabelled or with no labelling.
It is high time Europe took this important step for international animal protection, and thus followed the example of other countries, such as the USA and Australia, who introduced a similar ban years ago.
Now, by means of tighter customs controls, new methods of analysis and criminal measures, we must ensure that the provisions adopted today are enforced effectively throughout Europe and all legal loopholes eliminated.
