Mr President, I should like to start by thanking once more the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt for negotiating an excellent compromise; one that, thank goodness, has also obtained the necessary majority in plenary.
We Austrians were particularly interested in the issue of 'Jagatee'.
Together with Ministers Pröll and Seehofer in the Council, we succeeded in reaching a compromise that we see as perfectly workable.
Our German friends, too, now have a drink that they are allowed to produce exclusively under the name 'Hüttentee'.
I believe that this issue has been resolved as well as possible and also amicably.
