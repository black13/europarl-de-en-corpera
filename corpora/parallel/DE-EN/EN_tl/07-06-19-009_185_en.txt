Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report, as all countries - including my own, Austria - have developed their own, often regional, specialities and spirit drinks.
The issue of 'Jagatee' has already been mentioned.
It was a very important one as far as we were concerned, as I believe that such traditions, including in the field of spirit drinks, are virtually part of a country's national identity.
Protecting production methods also guarantees high quality and, of course, guarantees that established producers and production methods are protected.
The fact that the 'vodka war', too, has now been ended was a further reason for my voting in favour of this report.
