I voted in favour of banning the import into, and export from, the EU of cat and dog fur (and of products containing such fur) from 31 December 2008.
It is particularly important in this regard that no derogations be allowed and that the Regulation not contribute towards the promotion of the fur trade.
I reject the idea of a labelling requirement as insufficient and too costly.
I also voted in favour of specific criminal measures, such as confiscation or revocation of licences, and I hope that the Member States will lay down and ensure the implementation of such penalties.
There should be a regular exchange of views on the implementation of the Regulation.
