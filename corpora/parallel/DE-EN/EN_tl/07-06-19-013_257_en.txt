on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now conducting a mid-term review of the great efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and the assessment is poor - that much emerges clearly from Mrs Kinnock's report.
My group supports this good report most emphatically.
If the political situation continues like this, many developing countries, particularly in Africa, will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals and most industrialised countries will not keep their promises to provide financial assistance.
Unfortunately, the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm in Germany was one more example of this.
Since 1999, at two-year intervals, the same promises have been made and broken time and again.
This casts doubt on the credibility of the European Union in the eyes of many developing countries.
The promises made in Heiligendamm are now being offset against the promises made in Gleneagles.
Sixty billion US dollars for the Global Fund, but we are being told that that will be offset against the broken promises from Gleneagles.
This is what is known as double-entry book-keeping.
It is an attempt to cause confusion with figures without obligating individual countries.
I thought it was very good that the Commissioner expressed himself very clearly in this connection: that is precisely what is needed.
It is Parliament's responsibility to state things clearly and exert the pressure needed to ensure that at least the European Union keeps to its progressive plan for achieving the 0.7% target for Official Development Assistance by 2015 exactly and without book-keeping tricks.
