on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, we are taking stock of the G8 Summit.
This G8 Summit issued a declaration on climate change that is quite clearly worthless.
I endorse the statements made by environmental organisations; Greenpeace said that it was absolutely insufficient, and Friends of the Earth Germany described the promises given as 'woolly'.
No binding commitments emerged.
I endorse what Commissioner Michel said about there not having been nearly enough discussion on Africa.
Debt relief for the poorest countries is still overdue.
Since this is also a debate on the G8 Summit as a whole, however, I should like to remind the House once more that these G8 countries have no legitimacy whatsoever.
They are self-appointed world leaders.
This G8 Summit cost EUR 100 million, the fence around Heiligendamm alone costing EUR 12.5 million of this.
There was a very successful 80 000-strong demonstration against this Summit, and the rioting - which was wrong and regrettable - was used by the police to subsequently abandon the rule of law.
For example, we now know that undercover police investigators were among the demonstrators and probably also incited them to violence.
Lawyers were hardly able to do their jobs there, and judges became an extension of the police.
The lawyers had a long fight to even be allowed through to the prisoners.
Prison cages were set up, which Amnesty International has criticised in no uncertain terms and described as wrong.
The Summit was surrounded by repression worthy of a police state.
One does not always have to look far to find repression of citizens; human rights are being trodden underfoot in the midst of the European Union, in the context of this G8 Summit.
