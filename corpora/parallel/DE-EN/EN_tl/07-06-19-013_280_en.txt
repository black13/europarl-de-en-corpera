Mr President, Commissioner Michel, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Kinnock for her report.
Because of time constraints, I shall discuss just one point at this juncture, which - regrettably - is given hardly a mention in this report.
In my opinion, the vital importance of decent work as a means of eliminating poverty is a tremendously significant factor in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
Where are we up to now with regard to these goals?
As I see it, the results of the mid-term review of this are disastrous.
Most of the Millennium Development Goals have not even begun to be achieved and, according to realistic estimates, will not have been achieved even by 2015.
This is an indictment of the donor countries.
Newspaper reports of the supposed successes of the G8 Summit do not change this fact.
