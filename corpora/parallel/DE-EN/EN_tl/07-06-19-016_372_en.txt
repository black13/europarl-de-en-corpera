I am much obliged to the Commissioner for that good, exhaustive reply.
I now have two supplementary questions.
Firstly, in the Commissioner's opinion, is enough being done to combat illegal waste tourism?
Secondly, is it true that the phenomenon is only shifting to the new external borders of the EU: for example to Ukraine or South-East Europe?
