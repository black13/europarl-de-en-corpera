Screening is important, but prevention is better.
In recent months, a vaccine against cervical cancer has been developed: a cancer that is always particularly problematic in young women.
Member States have adopted completely different practices: some make it available on the national health service, whilst in others it is only available privately.
This makes it very expensive and it becomes a social issue.
Does the Commission envisage any prospect of putting pressure on Member States to give as many young women and girls as possible access to this vaccine?
