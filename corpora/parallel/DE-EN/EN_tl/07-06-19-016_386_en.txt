Mr President, the Commissioner raised the issue of alcoholism.
In Austria, a rare - or not so rare - phenomenon has emerged among young people, namely that of 'binge drinking'.
The aim seems to be to drink oneself unconscious in as little time as possible.
In the Commissioner's experience, is this an exclusively Austrian phenomenon, or is there a trend towards this throughout Europe?
If it is a European trend, does he already have some measures in mind to counter such extreme drinking and prevent it in the long term?
