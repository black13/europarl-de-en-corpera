on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not only a tricky subject but, astonishingly, also an area in which Member States are persistently infringing European law.
The Green Paper was discussed in 2004, Parliament tabled a motion for a resolution in 2006, and now we have a new interpretation - yet, in reality, hardly anything has changed.
Member States are continuing to do as they please.
Has the CFSP failed in this respect?
I can see no real improvement since 2004.
Member States and members of national parliaments seem to be completely unaware of Article 296 of the EC Treaty - as, indeed, it describes an exceptional situation rather than the rule.
In addition, the European Court of Justice has found once again that this is not a case of a general automatic derogation.
Yet there is no improvement to be seen, even though - and this, too, may still be worth mentioning - the group concerned consists of just six Member States.
There, too, I do not currently see any improvement.
To put it clearly, I do not want any increase in the defence budget; above all, my group wants to see savings by means of cooperation and the use of synergies.
Parliament has made some recommendations in this regard, for example on the components the new Code of Conduct should have.
Perhaps the Commissioner could add something in this regard?
We have also requested better cooperation from the Commission - and not only the Commission, but also the European Defence Agency.
I cannot see much evidence of this in reality.
I should like to reiterate that we have made suggestions on the mechanisms for the competitive award of contracts the Commission still needs to change for us to finally achieve what everyone in this House wants.
After all, we agree with the Commission that a genuine European defence market is necessary to reduce military expenditure costs and to make production more efficient in the interests of the taxpayer and the public.
