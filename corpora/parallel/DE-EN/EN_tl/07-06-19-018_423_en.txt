Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the basis for today's debate is the report by our former colleague Mr WÃ¼rmeling.
It was on this basis that the Commission issued its communication at the end of last year, which was intended to clarify the application of Article 296 but in fact had little effect.
After all, it was initially geared exclusively towards non-military goods, and thus the majority of military procurements inevitably fell within the scope of this derogation.
Therefore, it is really up to the Commission to ensure that, firstly, the rules on public procurement in the defence sector really support the work of the European Defence Agency and, secondly, that they take account of the fact that, as many of the previous speakers have said, this is a sector that exhibits peculiarities.
I have three questions for Commissioner McCreevy, therefore.
Firstly, does a directive in this field not have the flaw from the outset that it is based on a communication that was originally intended to cover only non-military goods, and is consequently unable to achieve what we expect of it as regards the common security policy?
Secondly, would it not be possible to update the 1958 list, which sets out the derogations relatively clearly but is now out of date?
Has the Commission abandoned the task of updating this for good?
Thirdly, the Commissioner rightly said that normal public procurement law is not suited to the defence sector.
Following on from Mr Lambsdorff's question, I would be very interested to hear how the Commissioner intends to take account of the peculiarities of the defence sector in a directive.
