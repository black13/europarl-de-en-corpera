Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, each year, the 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 170 billion on defence.
These 27 Member States have two million soldiers, 10 000 tanks and 3 000 fighter aircraft.
In spite of this, they could not end the bloodshed in the Balkan conflict; we needed our American friends to do it for us.
Why was that?
At that time there were not yet any common decision-making structures in the EU to enable the implementation of such operations.
Another of the main reasons for the inefficiency of European defence is the lack of a common defence market.
One of the reasons for this is Article 296.
I am convinced that this Article will be retained in future.
The reason that no common European defence market has developed is the excessive application of this Article in the past.
First of all, the Commission issued its communication clarifying what is and what is not covered by Article 296: I think this communication is helpful.
Then the European Defence Agency took action: in my opinion, the Code of Conduct it adopted was an important step in the right direction.
We now also need EU legislation in this field, however - which is why I welcome the fact that this Directive is now envisaged.
As MEPs, we keep hearing a great deal of criticism of the EU rules on the award of public contracts, particularly from local authorities.
Therefore, we MEPs shall take very great care that the rules established here are indeed tailored towards the defence field, and that they improve rather than worsen the situation in that field.
Our assent will be conditional on this.
In addition, we keep hearing that we Europeans are spending too little on defence.
If we continue working on this field and create a common market, we shall at least achieve more security for the same money.
