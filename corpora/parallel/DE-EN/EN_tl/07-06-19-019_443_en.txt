Mr President, mercury must be banned comprehensively and quickly.
It is nothing short of cynical to take hazardous products out of circulation here but continue to permit their export to other countries.
We know that mercury spreads worldwide via water and air.
Ultimately, the mercury would also end up and harm people here.
It is nothing short of absurd for us to issue warnings, as the Commission has done, that pregnant women and children should eat no more than 100 grams of tuna per week since it is so contaminated with mercury.
We know - and a study published in The Lancet has demonstrated this once more - that heavy metals cause damage to the nervous system and also lasting, irreparable brain damage, particularly in children.
It must be our primary objective to enforce this export ban, therefore, as we would lose credibility in the eyes of the international community if we were to say: we want to protect ourselves, but exports are allowed.
