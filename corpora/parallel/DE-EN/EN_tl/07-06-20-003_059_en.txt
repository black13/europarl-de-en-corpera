on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both Malta and the Greek part of Cyprus meet the Maastricht criteria.
It is therefore logical to enlarge the euro zone to include both countries.
If it were up to me and my group, more Member States of the European Union would be welcome to join the euro zone, provided that they met the criteria.
That can only be good for the European Union.
This event is, however, tinged with sadness and I should like to explain why: unfortunately, in Cyprus an opportunity has been missed to involve both parts of Cyprus in the euro zone and to blaze the trail for a reunification of the island of Cyprus on the basis of a bicommunal and bizonal solution.
That is very regrettable, because as a result the wall in Cyprus will be reinforced rather than weakened.
