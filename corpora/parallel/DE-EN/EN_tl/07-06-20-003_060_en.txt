on behalf of the ITS Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic experts seem to agree that the euro zone is enjoying a general economic upturn.
They are even talking about a sustained rise in employment.
It is my belief, however, that all too often it is only a rise in part-time employment - or the new forms of work, as they are euphemistically known - that has been recorded, which can hardly compensate for the full-time jobs that have been lost.
Under these conditions the dwindling birth rate should come as no surprise.
You cannot feed a family on a McJob!
Enthusing about an upturn is a slap in the face for every single one of the millions-strong army of jobless in the EU.
It mocks all of those millions of people who are labelled as the working poor.
We are facing a problem that should not be underestimated: the fact that existing differences within the euro zone are widening, for example the southern European countries are seeing a continual worsening of their competitive position.
The fact that the euro is not a universal remedy is proved by the example of the United Kingdom alone.
As we know, the British economy is in good shape, even without the euro.
The United Kingdom has the sixth largest manufacturing sector in the world and the eighth largest services sector.
For this reason alone, no EU Member States should, in my opinion, be forced to introduce the euro.
Fears about, for example, handing over sovereignty to the European Central Bank should be treated just as seriously as the price rises feared by consumers.
Many millions of citizens have in fact found the euro to have inflationary powers, since it has been a decisive factor in the increased price of everyday necessities.
Neither official statistics showing the contrary nor image campaigns will do anything to change that.
Any EU country that is considering introducing the euro should as a general rule, in my view, always let the sovereign power, that is the people, decide.
