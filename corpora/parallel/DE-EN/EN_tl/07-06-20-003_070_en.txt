rapporteur. - Mr President, I must come back to Commissioner Almunia's last remarks.
I am rather disappointed at the way he interpreted rather than faithfully representing what I said.
Firstly, I did not say that the data from Cyprus and Malta were worse than those from the other countries.
Indeed, in the cases of Portugal, Hungary and Greece, the Commission sold us bad data as good.
That is a fact.
Secondly, it is not a matter of us attacking specific countries but of the Commission taking responsibility.
Thirdly, on 3 May 2007, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council document COM(2007)230 - the quality report on quarterly financial accounts for general government.
That document found fault with Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus.
No more and no less than this is set out in the explanatory statement of my report.
