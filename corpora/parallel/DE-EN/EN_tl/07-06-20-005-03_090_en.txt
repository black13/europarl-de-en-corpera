rapporteur. - Mr President, I shall only take up your attention very briefly.
The report before us on the Community programme Fiscalis, a legislative programme, has been disgracefully censored.
The chairwoman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Socialist Member Pervenche Berès, inexplicably censored the explanatory statement of my report on her own authority.
This is unworthy of a parliament that calls itself democratic.
You will find the censored passages at the end of a lengthy exposé on money-wasting and on scrutiny of the European Commission in an addendum - perhaps you could call the House to order, Mr President - in an addendum which is attached for those who are interested.
