Mr President, I wish to give the report my firm backing, and I have voted in favour of it.
It is important that we should have a European strategy for mercury, because it is one of the most toxic environmental pollutants, and Europe must certainly lead the way here.
I did vote against some proposals designed to tighten the rules, because I believe it is necessary to provide incremental arrangements for businesses and to allow for a smooth transition so as not to jeopardise the general level of competitiveness.
I am also wary of creating too much red tape, and a steady hand is needed if we are avoid that risk.
On the whole, this is a very encouraging report.
