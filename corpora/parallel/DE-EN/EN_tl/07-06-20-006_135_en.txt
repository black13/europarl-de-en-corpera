Mr President, the single market and mobility depend on social security, which must extend beyond a person's working life.
It is important in this respect to maintain the balance between employers and employees on which the acquisition of pension rights depends.

The delegation from the Austrian People's Party has given the Oomen-Ruijten report its unreserved support, because we believe that this is the right way to continue developing mobility and the single market.
