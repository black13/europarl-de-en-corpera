I voted against the report on the portability directive.
The report goes well wide of the real target of increased cross-border mobility of labour between Member States.
On average, only 10% of all employees in the EU receive company pensions.
Because of the cost increase of at least 20% that can be expected to result from the high minimum standards which have just been adopted, there will scarcely be any interest in the creation or expansion of company pension schemes.
My fear is that what employers and employees have achieved to their mutual advantage in the national context over several decades is now being put at risk.
The minimum age for the acquisition of company-pension rights has been entirely scrapped.
The five-year vesting period has been abolished.
The minimum standards are to be applicable retroactively, which is in outright contradiction to the principle of safeguarding legitimate expectations.
I also voted for the deletion of index-linking, which would most probably be interpreted by the European Court of Justice as 'equitable adjustment' and as an obligation.
The German Bundesrat has calculated that treating employees who have changed companies on equal terms with those who have not will increase the cost of supplementary pension schemes by 30%.
European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla has announced the presentation of a new proposal.
Following the failure to reach agreement in the Council, the proposal will be largely based on today's parliamentary resolution and will thus jeopardise company pension schemes - and not only in Germany.
