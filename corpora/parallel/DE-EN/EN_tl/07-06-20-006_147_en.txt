Mr President, even though the introduction of the euro has made life easier in many respects, as in the case of cross-border trade, it would be wrong to overlook its less savoury aspects, such as the surrender of sovereignty and price increases.
As in the case of any enlargement of the EU, the introduction of the euro in new Member States will ultimately affect the fragile stability of the entire system.
This is why I believe it is imperative to ensure that the overall balance is not upset by the inclusion of weak national economies.
Now it may well be that Cyprus and Malta are ready.
In the past, however, governments have all too often played with marked cards in order to qualify for the euro club.
In my opinion, such an important decision must on no account be taken over the heads of the population, and that is why I have abstained in this instance.
