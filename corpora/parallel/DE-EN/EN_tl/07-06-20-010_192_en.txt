on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, I warmly welcome the fact that we have this joint motion for a resolution on an international arms-trade treaty, because time is running out, as arms expenditure and arms exports spiral throughout the world.
According to the study conducted by SIPRI, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the equivalent of EUR 900 billion was devoted to military spending last year, which represents EUR 137 for every man, woman and child on the planet.
That was three and a half per cent more than in 2005.
Over the past ten years, global arms expenditure has increased by 37%.
As for the international arms trade, in its new Yearbook of Armaments, Disarmament and International Security, SIPRI reports a 50% increase in the volume of trade since 2002.
Once again, the United States and Russia have been far and away the top arms exporters.
Germany, with USD 9.2 billion - EUR 6.9 billion - between 2002 and 2006, has pushed past France into third place.
Member States of the EU are up there among the global leaders when it comes to arms exports.
Last year alone, Germany's arms exports were worth USD 3.9 billion, more than double the 2005 amount of USD 1.5 billion.
France has armed Sudan, and Belgium is supplying weapons to the autocrat Joseph Kabila in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, partly so that he can massacre the opposition.
Once a conflict has been fuelled, along comes the EU with its military missions in Africa - in the Congo, Sudan and so on.
The fire-fighters are dousing the flames with petrol.
It is high time the EU and its Member States put a stop to these deals.
Arms exports are violating human rights all over the world.
Arms exports are killing people all over the world.
Let us finally put an end to this traffic in death.
