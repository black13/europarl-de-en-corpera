Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for your contributions and suggestions but also for the initiatives you have taken on this very important matter as well as for the warnings that were sounded by some speakers.
Let me just respond to two points.
Firstly, unless human rights and international humanitarian law are being respected in the recipient country, arms exports can never be licensed.
I have stressed that we are engaged worldwide at various levels in promoting respect for human rights.
That is another matter which has often been on the agenda of this Parliament.
The right to life, the prohibition of slavery, political and social participatory rights, equality before the law, freedom of speech and assembly and the prohibition of discrimination continue to be flouted in too many countries of this world.
It is therefore our duty to ensure that these violations of fundamental values are not fostered by the supply of armaments.
Secondly, there is the issue of embargos.
The United Nations Security Council, the OECD and the European Union have imposed embargos on a number of countries, and the present draft resolution of the European Parliament places special emphasis on the need to uphold the embargo against Sudan.
It is absolutely essential that observance of embargos be made one of the key criteria for export licensing in an arms-trade treaty.
It is no coincidence that this criteria is listed at the very start of the catalogue of criteria in the EU Code of Conduct.
I can assure you that we shall continue to make every effort during our presidency to secure an effective arms-trade treaty.
The key role that the European Parliament is playing in this discussion has also been a great source of help and support.
I hope we shall be able to maintain this cooperative approach throughout the subsequent presidencies.
