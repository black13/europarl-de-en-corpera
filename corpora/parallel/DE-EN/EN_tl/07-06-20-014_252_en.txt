Mr Mavrommatis, I also said that there has been a variety of developments and decisions within the scope that exists for this in the European Union.
It should be particularly useful in that, when the report of the expert group is presented, we shall have the facts on the table and be able to assess whether or not there are obstacles, as it were, to the functioning of the internal market, and what has been the impact on certain sectors to which reduced rates have applied in the past.
I am sure you will understand that we ought to wait for this report.
After that, we - the Council and Parliament - must conduct an assessment together.
