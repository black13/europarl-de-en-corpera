Mr President-in-Office, I should like to extend the question a little.
The attempts to achieve uniform or harmonised VAT rates in Europe are admirable, but surely the objective of European tax policy should be the ultimate achievement of uniform, or at least comparable, taxation rates and taxes throughout the European Union.
I should be interested to hear what kind of discussion there has been on this issue in the Council in general, whether this issue has been approached, and if so, how.
