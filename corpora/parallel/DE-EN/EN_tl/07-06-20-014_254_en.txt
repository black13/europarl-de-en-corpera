President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Leichtfried, I understand that a debate has been held in the past on tax rates and the various common tax base indicators in the field of corporation tax, for example.
You will be aware that, under the German Council Presidency, some work has been done on this, but no agreement reached as yet.
With regard to VAT, I would reiterate that this is the next item on our agenda.
What will this expert report find?
What are the Commission's proposals and analyses?
What is being proposed to the Council?
There is no current discussion in the Council on the specific question put by the honourable Member, however.
Subject: EU cross-border cooperation to protect children from child abuse - mutual recognition of disqualifications from working with children
There is an urgent need for effective systems within the EU to ensure that unsuitable people are not able to gain employment which brings them into contact with children.
On 1 June 2006 the European Parliament adopted its report on the 2004 'Initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to the adoption by the Council of a framework decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children' (14207/2004 - C6-0244/2004 -.
What progress is being made towards adoption by the Council of the proposed framework decision, which is crucial for ensuring the protection of children in Europe?
In the event of a lack of progress towards adoption, how does the Council intend to ensure that all the objectives this initiative aims to achieve will be otherwise met? (it aims to ensure that Member States recognise and enforce bans on working with children imposed on individuals by other Member States.)
