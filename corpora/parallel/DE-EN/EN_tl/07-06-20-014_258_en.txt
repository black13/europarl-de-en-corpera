President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Moraes, as I said before, we have indeed taken up the initiative, and the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs, too, have recently agreed to implement the key concern at the heart of the Belgian initiative.
Notwithstanding certain differences concerning the information permitted to be passed on, the EU has now found a joint solution to the core issue forming the basis of Belgium's initiative, which I believe is a significant step forward.
I am sure you appreciate that the time remaining to the German Council Presidency will presumably be insufficient to bring about agreement in other fields.
