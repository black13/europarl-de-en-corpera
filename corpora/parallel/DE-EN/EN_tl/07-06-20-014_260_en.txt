President-in-Office of the Council. - Baroness Ludford, I would rather not discuss at this time the outstanding decision on the amendment of the Constitutional Treaty, but I have made it clear that the Ministers for Justice reached an agreement on 13 June, and that a solution has been included in the planned Framework Decision in the form of the integration of the exchange of information from criminal records, a key element of the Belgian initiative.
It is particularly important to bear in mind that, if only one Member State has the information, what happens if a person takes up employment elsewhere?
Would the rest of the EU know about it?
This has now been guaranteed thanks to the Framework Decision agreed upon.
Subject: Discrimination against disabled people or children with learning difficulties
Although 2007 is the Year of Equal Opportunities for All, people with disabilities or special needs continue to encounter discrimination owing to their particular circumstances.
Typical examples are: (a) disabled people who are unable to obtain insurance cover and, in the event of an accident, have to rely on their families and (b) children with learning difficulties (e.g. stammering, dyslexia) who encounter a lack of standard practice in national school legislation.
Moreover, whereas they may be given favourable treatment in one particular country - oral examination in the case of dyslexic individuals, for example - they do not enjoy the same opportunities in other Member States, even in the European Schools.
Will the Council intervene to ensure that disabled people are able to obtain private insurance and that the needs of children with learning difficulties are met, in particular in the European Schools?
