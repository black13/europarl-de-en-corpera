President-in-Office of the Council.
I should like to start by saying that the Council Presidency considers this a very important, valid question.
The Council is fully aware of the importance of guaranteeing the welfare of disabled people and of children with learning difficulties.
The Council would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the general legislative framework for the fight against discrimination in employment and occupation on grounds of a person's religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
The Directive, which is based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty, lays down the minimum requirements to be met by all Member States.
The problem is that this legislative framework extends to neither insurance nor the education system.
Nevertheless, Member States may introduce or retain provisions that do even greater justice to the principle of equality than those of the Directive, and which envisage protection against discrimination in fields subject to national competence.
Concerning the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the Council notes with satisfaction that the Commission is intending to publish a number of studies relevant to the honourable Member's question.
These studies are intended to highlight the social situation of disabled people, including with regard to education and training, and to summarise the statistics on disabled people provided, in particular, by social-security institutions, with a view to obtaining a realistic overview of the situation of disabled people, including with regard to the educational dimension.
