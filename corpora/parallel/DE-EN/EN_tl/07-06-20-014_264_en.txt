President-in-Office of the Council. - Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I would have to have another look into the circumstances you have just presented.
Nevertheless, as I said before, an attempt must be made to develop new initiatives with regard to certain things.
When the Commission presents its report, it will become apparent where the gaps are, and then I am sure that these can be closed by means of legal measures either at EU or - as I am assuming will be the case - at national level.
