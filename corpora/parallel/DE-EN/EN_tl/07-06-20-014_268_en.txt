Mr Medina Ortega, the migration issue has been the subject of frequent discussions in past rounds.
I have pointed out many times, including in connection with another of today's debates, that the global approach to migration will undoubtedly play a key role in the Council conclusions tomorrow and the day after, and that it is not just an issue, but rather is being dealt with.
The honourable Member is right to ask how we can help Member States of the European Union such as Malta.
However, we shall also endeavour to find solutions to the issues surrounding, and causes of, migration, particularly illegal migration, together with the countries of origin.
The other question is of a technical nature, but of course this all depends on how we deal with the issue of the future of the Constitutional Treaty.
