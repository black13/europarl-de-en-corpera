President-in-Office of the Council.
At the 2007 EU-USA Summit, the European Union and the United States agreed the following: consistent with our common values, we confirm that we have long been working to ensure that efforts to combat terrorism are in line with our obligations under international law, including human rights standards, refugee law and international humanitarian law.
We shall continue and intensify our ongoing dialogue on the fundamental rights under international law that are relevant to our common fight against terrorism.
This dialogue has helped us obtain a better knowledge of each other's legal framework and should promote cooperation between us on fighting terrorism.
The Presidency informs Parliament regularly about transatlantic relations, including about issues connected with international law.
One such briefing was given here in the run-up to the EU-USA Summit on 24 April 2007.
On the subject of transatlantic dialogue, the legislator contributes to the transatlantic dialogue on security.
The Council noted the European Parliament resolution of 14 February 2007 on extraordinary rendition on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 5 March 2007.
The Presidency has neither sought nor received any responses from the Member States to the said European Parliament resolution.
The post of counter-terrorism coordinator is currently being assessed, and the search for a suitable candidate is under way.
