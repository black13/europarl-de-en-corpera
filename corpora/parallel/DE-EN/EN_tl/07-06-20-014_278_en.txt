President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Leichtfried, I do not want to go into your assessment of the checks in the United States at this time, but I do know that the actions of the USA are in response to certain events.
As the honourable Member knows, however, we are conducting ongoing dialogue with the USA about the Visa Waiver Programme, to ensure that the visa-free regime applies to other EU Member States, too.
I shall take the opportunity presented by your question to take up this issue again, and possibly also to suggest that our successor the Portuguese Council Presidency raise it in talks with the USA.
Subject: Deployment of US missile defence system in EU Member States
The USA's plan to set up a missile defence system in Member States of the European Union - Poland and the Czech Republic - on the pretext of guarding against missile attacks from Iran and North Korea has given rise to public concern in Europe, such plans being perceived as making Europe a target as well as giving rise to new divisions.
According to an announcement by the Russian Security Council, these plans have already entailed a revision of Russian defence strategy since they are considered to be a threat to the Russian Federation.
What are the Council's views on the deployment of such systems in Member States of the European Union?
What measures will it take to ensure that these plans, which are reviving Cold War conditions in Europe, are revoked?
