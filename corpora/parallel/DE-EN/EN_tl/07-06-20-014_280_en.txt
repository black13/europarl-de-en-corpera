Mr Papadimoulis, the US missile defence system and the planned stationing of 10 rockets in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic has not yet been discussed in the Council.
The bilateral cooperation between the United States and some EU Member States in connection with the stationing of elements of the US national missile defence system falls within the national competence of the Member States concerned.
Consequently, the Council has not considered raising the issue of missile defence in talks with the USA or with NATO.
Ballistic missile defence is the subject of consultations within NATO and the NATO-Russia Council.
On 19 April, special meetings of the North Atlantic Council and of the NATO-Russia Council were held on the subject of missile defence.
This subject was also discussed at an informal meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Oslo on 26-27 April.
