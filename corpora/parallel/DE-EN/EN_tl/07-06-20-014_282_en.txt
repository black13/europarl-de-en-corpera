President-in-Office of the Council.
I should like to refer once again to the starting position.
A few years ago, at the North Atlantic Council in Prague, the partners agreed on the new challenges presenting themselves and on the answers - possibly new ones - NATO had to find to these.
NATO has set up the relevant working parties.
This debate was continued in Riga, but no definitive result has been achieved as yet.
For example, we agree on the joint threat analysis.
At this stage, however, the United States made its proposal for a national missile defence system.
We take the view that, as a rule, the subject of the missile defence system should be discussed within NATO rather than within the European Union.
I can only reaffirm that this neither has been, nor will it be, discussed within the Council.
