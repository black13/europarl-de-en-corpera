President-in-Office of the Council.
As far as public participation is concerned, this is a national decision, and no guideline is required on the part of the Council Presidency.
This is a matter for Member States on their own responsibility.
In this connection, however, I should like to reiterate that there has indeed been movement on this issue in general terms, particularly between Russia and the United States, who have agreed to an intensive exchange of views on the subject and to confidence-building measures.
This currently remains open.
As the honourable Member is aware, Mr Putin recently made proposals to this end to the USA, too.
I believe that we should await these talks.
