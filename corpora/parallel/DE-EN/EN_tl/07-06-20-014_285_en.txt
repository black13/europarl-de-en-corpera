My question follows on directly from this.
Has the EU Council Presidency taken a position on Vladimir Putin's proposal to involve Azerbaijan in this missile system?
Secondly, does the position of the EU, or rather the Council, on the US missile system correspond to NATO's position, or is there a difference?
If the latter, what is the nature of this difference?
Thirdly, does the Council intend to deal with the issue of the missile system at any stage?
