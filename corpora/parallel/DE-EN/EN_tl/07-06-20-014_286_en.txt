President-in-Office of the Council. - The Council has not dealt with this as yet, nor can I anticipate whether it will do so in future.
As I said before, there is no need for the Council Presidency to give its opinion but, in view of the debates of recent days, we warmly welcome the fact that the situation between the United States and Russia, which was initially rather confrontational, has now returned to a different level and that the parties are declaring a willingness to talk to each other.
We have hitherto taken the view that this is a matter for consultation within NATO rather than within the European Council.
Subject: Gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea
There are varying reports as to whether the Council has approved the construction of a German-Russian gas pipeline running under the Baltic Sea.
It is important - particularly from a democratic perspective - that the public receives an answer on this matter.
I have discussed the matter previously with both the Commission and the Council without receiving specific and satisfactory information.
Has the Council formally approved the construction of a German-Russian gas pipeline running under the Baltic Sea?
The Council's approval is presumably required to enable the project to go ahead?
Should a dispute arise over environmental impact assessment in Swedish waters, is it the European Court of Justice or the Swedish Environmental Court which passes final judgment in the case?
