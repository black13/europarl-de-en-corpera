President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Paleckis, it is primarily the task of the parties planning and wishing to carry out this project to keep the countries concerned informed as appropriate - which is done by making the appropriate application.
This application will undoubtedly be followed by an examination of all possible aspects, particularly those of the environment and security.
I am assuming that the appropriate talks will also be held.
However, first and foremost, it is entirely up to the parties involved in the project to take the initiative on this - and these parties are private and not State enterprises.
