President-in-Office of the Council. - Mrs BudreikaitÄ—, there is both international and European legislation to be observed.
As regards the international legislation, I assume that Russia, too, is bound by this.
It is not a case of Russia carrying out its own examination and saying, when the result is available, this pipeline is environmentally sustainable on the whole; the other partners, too, have to be taken into account.
I should like to reiterate what I said in a previous Question Time, which is that - including in the interests of the enterprises operating this pipeline - complete transparency will be ensured in order to allay citizens' fears, and care will be taken that the mines and bombs remaining at the bottom of the sea do not pose a risk to those living near the pipeline.
This will be a very thorough examination, and is compulsory for everyone concerned, particularly the enterprises; so it would not just be a case of Russia approving and giving the green light to this project.
Subject: Overseas territories
Does the Council ever discuss the anomaly whereby some overseas territories, literally on the other side of the world, are deemed part of the EU when other places within the EU's borders are considered 'outside' the EU?
In view of the implication of these anomalies, is the time not right to modernise or regularise this situation?
