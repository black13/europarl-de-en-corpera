I presumably do not need to make specific reference to the fact that the areas associated with your question concern regions outside Europe but which are part of the European Union because, as it were, they are members of the European Union in view of their links to the mother country.
You are aware, of course, that countries such as Andorra or Liechtenstein are not members of the European Union even though they are situated in Europe.
A corresponding review in Council will establish whether these regions will continue to be affiliated and whether legislation will continue to be transferred to the areas mentioned.
