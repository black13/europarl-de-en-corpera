Overseas territories where military bases of EU Member States are located are certainly a frequent occurrence.
I would like to mention another specific case: Cyprus has designated sovereign military bases which belong to Great Britain but which are not part of the European Union.
My question here is as follows: Is it a tolerable situation where an EU Member State has areas belonging to another EU Member State which are not part of the European Union?
