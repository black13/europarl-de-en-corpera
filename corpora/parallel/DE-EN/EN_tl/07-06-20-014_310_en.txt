Naturally, we are aware of the debates which have taken place in the European Parliament and the resolutions adopted by this House.
However, I would again make reference to a detailed discussion which took place last Monday in the Council of Foreign Ministers and which will continue tomorrow evening in Brussels.
In the course of this, unambiguous clarification was again provided in relation to the fact that although the Ahtisaari proposals constitute a basis, we do need a UN decision to assist in finding an acceptable solution.
It would now be completely wrong, and this has also been discussed with the governments of neighbouring regions, to take a unilateral decision.
I believe that we should also be able to convince our partner, the United States, that a multilateral decision under international law is required.
To this end, further talks will soon take place at a bilateral meeting between Mr Putin and Mr Bush.
These talks will also certainly involve Kosovo.
However, I am now giving due notice that a unilateral decision would not represent a sound basis for other decisions which are in the pipeline.
I am aware that impatience also prevails in the region.
We have, for example, particularly thanked the Albanian Government for its influence over recent weeks and months and declared that a decision under international law is necessary and not just unilateral acceptance by individual countries.
