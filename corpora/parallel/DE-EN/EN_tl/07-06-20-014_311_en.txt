Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what initiatives are planned by the Council Presidency in the area of economic policy, above all, in the sphere of energy policy as well?
Could you envisage the SME Charter or the Energy Charter, for instance, being used as a starting point for also counteracting unemployment in the economic process as well as for transposing the Lisbon agenda there in an attractive manner?
