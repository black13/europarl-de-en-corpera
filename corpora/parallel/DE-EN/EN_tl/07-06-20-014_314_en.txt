Article 28 of the Treaty on European Union lays down the principles for financing civilian and military crisis management operations.
Military or defence policy-related operations cannot be financed from Community funds.
Athena is the mechanism created by the Council in 2004 to manage the financing of the joint costs of such operations.
The joint costs are less than 10%, which amounts to the total additional costs of an operation.
The remaining expenditure is financed directly by Member States according to the principle whereby costs are borne where they accrue.
Athena is managed under the supervision of a special committee made up of representatives from Member States who are accountable to their own national parliaments through their respective ministers.
As far as the Althea operation is concerned, both the European Union and NATO pay for their share as regards jointly used facilities, personnel, etc.
NATO does not receive any reimbursement from Athena for the services rendered.
