Mr Sepp√§nen, on the eve of the European Council, I do not wish to speculate today on the future of the European Constitutional Treaty.
We will see which debates will be held and the consequences in terms of the contractual provisions.
On the second point, I would like to say that the respective ministers from the Member States are represented in committee and these ministers, in turn, are ultimately accountable to their own parliaments since the contributions come from the Member States.
As far as I am aware, parliaments either have relevant specialist committees which can pass judgment and question the respective minister on the use of funds, or there are budgetary control committees which examine how these funds are used.
