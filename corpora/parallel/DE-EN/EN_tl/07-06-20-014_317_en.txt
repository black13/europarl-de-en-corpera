Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different.
In the security and defence sub-committee, I am told that the EU has paid money to NATO.
You are now saying that no money has been paid.
This is very interesting.
The problem is that we do not receive any figures when enquiring about them in the individual national parliaments, nor do we receive figures through the Committee on Budgets or in the security and defence sub-committee.
Would it be possible for the Council Presidency to compile a summary of the expenditure effected hitherto in relation to this Athena mechanism?
