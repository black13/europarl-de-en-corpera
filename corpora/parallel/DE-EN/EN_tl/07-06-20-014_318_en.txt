On the first point, I can state the following: I will, as I have said just now, certainly look into and review the matter mentioned by you as to whether there is an inconsistency as you have described.
On the other hand, as Council representative, I am unable to pass judgment on Member States' customs and laws in order to provide such an overview here.
This shall be left to the Member States.
Subject: EU - Georgia negotiations on concluding the visa facilitation and readmission agreements
Georgia is an important EU partner under the European Neighbourhood policy.
Its current government has demonstrated clear European aspirations and strong commitments to reforms directed to European values, as well as a good capacity in implementing them.
A lack of desire from the EU side for talks with Georgia on visa facilitation and readmission agreements is being observed.
This contrasts distinctly with the successful conclusion of the EU visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Russia which will be put into effect from 1 June this year, as well as the EU negotiations with Ukraine completed in 2006, and negotiations with Moldova launched early this year.
Simplification of the existing visa regime with Georgia has never been placed on the EU's agenda and, surprisingly, it seems that this country is being punished for its aspirations towards European values and reforms.
What is the Council doing to accelerate the process of negotiations and conclusion of the visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Georgia, and what are the Council's plans regarding these negotiations?
