President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Rutowicz, you enquired as to the status of the Regulation on roaming at the part-session back in February, and so I am pleased to be able to give the following answer to your further enquiry - even though you should already be aware of the subject matter, as the subject of roaming concerns us all given that we can no longer do without mobile phones.
As I am sure you are aware, the Regulation on roaming, which is based on Article 95 of the EC Treaty, is subject to the codecision procedure pursuant to Article 251 of the EC Treaty.
I can assure you that all three institutions have set themselves the objective of adopting the Regulation on roaming as quickly as possible.
At the European Council on 6-8 June, the Council reached a political consensus on the proposal, and thus approved the opinion of the European Parliament at first reading.
The legal and linguistic experts are already carrying out the final revision of the text, so that it can be adopted under an expedited procedure.
It is anticipated that the legal act will be adopted at the end of June.
It will be published in the Official Journal immediately afterwards.
