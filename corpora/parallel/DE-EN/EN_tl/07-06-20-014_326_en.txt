President-in-Office of the Council.
We all know that there is often a gulf between our objectives and our achievements, but we should be pleased that a first, important, step has been taken, and it will require energy on the part of everyone involved to bring this into force by the end of June.
This is also an example of why it is right and vital to discuss matters of the Constitutional Treaty.
The German Presidency's approach has always been to ensure that the public also sees the Europe of projects, the Europe of results.
The Regulation on roaming that is due to enter into force shortly is an example of Europe's capacity for action and also of a project for the European public.
We all know that there will continue to be discussions on further changes - I believe in the initiative of the European Parliament in that regard.
Subject: Implementation of the EU's Neighbourhood Policy
The European Union's Neighbourhood Policy covers 16 neighbouring countries, the Mediterranean countries of Egypt, Algeria, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Tunisia and the Newly Independent States of Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
An action plan has been drawn up for the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy in respect of each of the neighbouring countries.
16% of the external relations budget is to be earmarked for the Neighbourhood Policy.
Can the Presidency state with which neighbouring countries agreements have been signed pursuant to the Neighbourhood Policy instrument?
What amounts have been set aside, for what period, for the countries in question?
