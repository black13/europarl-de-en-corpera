President-in-Office of the Council.
This afternoon, we held a debate on MEDA and the European Neighbourhood Policy, but more in relation to the South.
I should like to underline that saying that the EU now has an external border, but that it also has neighbours and is interested in the political, economic and social stability of these countries, has given the Member States who joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 an impetus.
When we developed the ENP, therefore, we also established a priority, particularly with the important aspect that a programme can be drawn up for each neighbour having the appropriate relations with the EU, depending on the progress made in the individual case, with the result that there are customised programmes for Ukraine or Moldova, for example.
I can only say, Mrs BudreikaitÄ—, that the countries you mention are cooperating on drawing up these action plans and have every interest in these.
The content of these plans and this neighbourhood policy can play a vital role in certain fields, for example access to the internal market.
The fact that the European Council is to give its blessing to this new approach of neighbourhood policy in its conclusions tomorrow and on Friday will mean that the subsequent Council Presidencies are hopefully able to use this programme as a basis for their further work.
