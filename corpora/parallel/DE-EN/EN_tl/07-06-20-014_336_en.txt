President-in-Office of the Council.
I do not like having to say that the Council does not have competence in this area, but you said yourself that you have taken the opportunity to raise this problem with the Commission, too.
The Council is also aware of the problem, of course, but it is now up to the Commission to look into the relevant information.
Subsequently, the Commission is also responsible for making the relevant proposals and taking precautionary measures.
This really does not fall within the competence of the Council.
