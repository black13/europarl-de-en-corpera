President-in-Office of the Council.
I agree with you that the European Union has to take action where there is information such as you have just described, but we have laid down rules for ourselves in this area.
All I can do is take up your calls in the interests of consumers and encourage the Commission to inform the relevant bodies of the extent of its examination and what measures it is able to take, but I regret that we cannot constantly swap roles.
We have clearly defined fields of responsibility, and this is the Commission's.
I cannot anticipate the answer of the Commission, which does not need to be present for today's Question Time.
I can only offer to make a renewed enquiry, so that you, as citizens' representatives, receive a suitable, clear answer from the Commission.
