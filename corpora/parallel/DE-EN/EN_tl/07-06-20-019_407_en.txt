Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the right to asylum is universal, and that is why we need a European response - which, to some degree, we have already given.
The Commission proposals are very good, and I should like to place on the record officially here that we can be very proud of our Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, who is doing a very good job.
The proposals our rapporteur, my colleague Mr Pirker, has presented are excellent.
Anyone managing to achieve support across the group divide for such a difficult issue has clearly done an excellent job, and I should like to thank the rapporteur for this.
Even though none of its representatives is present, I should like to thank the Council.
This evening would not have been possible, and we could not have taken all these decisions, if we had not had an active German Council Presidency in recent months.
Therefore, I should simply like to say 'thank you'.
Judging by the lateness of the hour, the politicians working on home-affairs policy are the hard-working ones: we are still at work.
Therefore, I should like to express my sincere thanks, and refrain from using up my full speaking time so that we can go home earlier.
