on behalf of Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my special thanks go to the rapporteur.
Through her efforts we have an excellent own-initiative report to approve today.
I hope and am confident that the Commission will take the report's recommendations and conclusions on board when reviewing European consumer rights.
Our group supports your report, Mrs Roithov√†, and most of your compromise amendments.
However, we do regret your decision to water down your proposal on the subject of the European trustmark.
We will therefore not be voting for Amendment 4 and we will also be rejecting the Liberals' amendments.
Intellectual property rights cannot be allowed to erode consumer rights.
Consumers need clear information about their legal position when dealing with digital content and digital rights management.
They are entitled to interoperable solutions.
The report addresses important issues, calling for a European charter of user rights, the creation of a European early warning system and a database for combating Internet fraud, the inclusion of an external audit obligation for specific electronic services such as online banking, and standardising European provisions for cross-border electronic invoices.
It also calls for a coordinated global approach for the digital environment, including an analysis of external factors such as privacy protection, citizens' access to information technologies and Internet security.
The report also calls on the Commission to examine measures to deal with class actions in the case of cross-border digital environment disputes between businesses and consumers.
We will be supporting the report and hope that it will be adopted in the plenary.
