on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I would like to start by saying to the Spanish rapporteur that I do not need a visit from Mr Moratino to get het up about what the Spanish Government is doing.
Within the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we have enough colleagues from Central and Eastern Europe who work with the people in Cuba out of a sense of solidarity, and the issue is not limited to the Spaniards within the PPE-DE.
I do want to assure you of that.
The future for the people of Cuba should not be limited to two alternatives: either continuing with Communism or being taken over by the government in Miami.
In the light of the Common Position of 1996 we have a political responsibility to support the democratic and peaceful forces as they work for change.
That is why the European Parliament has awarded Sakharov prizes to the Ladies in White and to Oswaldo Pay√°.
I would have liked to have seen a clear statement in the Council Decision that the Common Position of 1996 still stands, that the Council Decision approved on Monday does not alter that Position, that the 2003 sanctions have merely been suspended, and that we will be reviewing the position again next June (the 17th evaluation of the Common Position).
The Council should have made that clear.
