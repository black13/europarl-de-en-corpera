author. - Madam President, back in the early Middle Ages, Ethiopia played a leading role in dialogue between the Christian and Muslim world.
It is the oldest independent state in Africa, an ancient civilisation which fought against fascism and colonialism, and as has already been mentioned, is also the country where the African Union currently has its headquarters.
Given all these factors, it is with horror that we contemplate what Communism has done in the country.
The free elections two years ago in Ethiopia were a time of hope.
Unfortunately, that hope was immediately dashed, as demonstrators were beaten and scores were arrested.
As my fellow Member Mrs Gomes quite rightly points out, it was the best and leading figures in the country from all parties and all walks of life who were the victims of the first wave of arrests, and who have also been affected by the most recent round of arrests, sentences and trials this year.
We now need to take a stronger line.
I call on the Council and Commission to provide the long-awaited inspection reports from those observers who attended these unjust mock trials, which were merely for show.
In line with the Resolution, I call for an independent fact-finding commission, since the members of Ethiopian Parliament's own investigation board have either been jailed or forced into exile for seeking to expose the truth about these events.
The situation is unacceptable and we now need an independent investigation.
We urgently need to use our strong position in the country to stand up for the rule of law and human rights.
