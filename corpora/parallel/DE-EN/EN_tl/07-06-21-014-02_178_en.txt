on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, on the 11 June, 38 leading opposition figures were found guilty of charges ranging from crimes against the constitution to high treason, all linked to the mass protests following the controversial elections two years ago, in which nearly 200 people were killed.
Before the members of the Ethiopian Parliament's investigation board were arrested or forced into exile, the board concluded that the security forces used unreasonable force and that marksmen targeted leading opposition politicians.
The sentences are expected in the coming months and there is a danger that most of the defendants will be condemned to death.
We call on the Ethiopian Government to release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally.
The Ethiopian courts urgently need to review the rulings and the government must work to ensure an independent justice system and a free press.
