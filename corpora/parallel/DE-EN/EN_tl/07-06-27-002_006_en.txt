Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not every regulation can be explained simply, but this one can.
With this in place, it will be simpler and, above all, cheaper to telephone from one European country to another in future.
I am quite sure that Europe's citizens will greatly appreciate it and we should, therefore, quickly put our signatures to the regulation, Mr President.
(Applause)
