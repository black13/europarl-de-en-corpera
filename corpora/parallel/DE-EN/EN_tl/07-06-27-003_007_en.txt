Ladies and gentlemen, we now come to the debate on the results of the European Council of 21/22 June.
Madam President of the European Council, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, you will today address for the fourth time the Members of the European Parliament.
This sets standards for each presidency to come.
I do not wish to anticipate the comments of the chairmen of the political groups and my other fellow Members.
I would, however, like to express our thanks for your good will, your patience, but most of all your decisiveness concerning Europe, without which the outcome of the Brussels summit would not have been possible.
My sincere thanks, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
(Applause)
