Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate shows just how powerful the European idea is and how much it unites us at times of crisis, even across party lines, giving us the strength to say what needs to be said.
I am a Christian Democrat, but I should like to express my unreserved support for the words of my fellow Member, the Social Democrat, Martin Schulz.
I should like to support every sentence.
As a German, I recall the final speech that the French President, Fran√ßois Mitterand, made to this Parliament in 1995.
He said: nationalism leads to war.
This is Europe's strength, which we must preserve through thick and thin: a Europe that defends peace prosperity and social security.
Above all, however, I should like to thank the Council Presidency and you personally, Mrs Merkel.
You faced a mammoth task and you succeeded.
Not all of our hopes have been realised, but the substance of the proposals has been maintained both in climate and energy policy and where the reform Treaty is concerned.
You have succeeded in extending Parliament's rights, ensuring that European law continues to take precedence, strengthening subsidiarity in many areas, clarifying the delimitation of competences and much more besides.
Questions have also been asked about the principle of competition.
We will have to take a closer look at the implications.
Overall I believe that the German Presidency has been successful on the two most important points: it has been successful in implementing many initiatives in the ongoing programme, and it has cooperated in exemplary fashion with the European Parliament.
For this too, I should like to thank you personally, Dr Merkel, together with all the members of the German Government and the German Representation.
(Applause)
