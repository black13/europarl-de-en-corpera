Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen!
Well done, Mrs Merkel, warm congratulations!
You have fulfilled your obligations as President of the Council.
The European Parliament had asked you to convene an Intergovernmental Conference and to resume the European Union's journey towards a constitution, a journey that has brought us peace and prosperity that now offers the globalised world a model of democracy and solidarity.
After a two-year period of reflection, the majority of the states and citizens came out in favour of forging ahead towards Europe's future.
Despite many abrogations, which I hope will not upset the EU's cohesion, we have helped those who had difficulties with the treaty.
We now have to prepare a mandate for this reform treaty, and we believe that is a good thing.
It contains a clear commitment to the principles, values and objectives of the EU.
In my opinion, the legally binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be enshrined in the treaty immediately after the preamble.
The extension of codecision and qualified majority voting are also positive aspects.
I nevertheless regret that clarity and transparency have been lost.
The symbols, the flag and the anthem also bear witness to the joy and freedom in Europe that Beethoven and Schiller emphasised.
I can assure you that we will continue to use these symbols and hold them up with genuine pride.
In this conviction, President-in-Office, we will now in the Intergovernmental Conference work together with the national parliaments and civil society to strengthen the European Union constitutionally.
We will continue to fight on this road, which Walter Hallstein described as constructio continua, and which Jean Monnet spoke of as 'step by step'.
And like sherpas, step by step, we will climb the Himalayas.
