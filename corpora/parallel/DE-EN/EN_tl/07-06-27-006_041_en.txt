Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I would like to underline once again what the chairman of my group has already said: it was a great weight off our minds when the outcome of the summit became known, and we shared your relief and your pleasure one hundred percent.
We were not surprised at Mr Prodi's disappointment either, however, because during this summit it of course became clear how everything was touch and go and what national egoisms actually threaten Europe.
In the days that followed - and in fact even during the summit itself - it struck me from reports and interviews about this difficult situation that in the light of this loss of further integration, which was also the subject of the summit, many people actually began to think positively about Europe again.
Basically, this is something quite simple: you only really understand what you have had when it is taken away from you.
Sometimes you only realise when it is too late, but this time it happened just in time.
I am extremely grateful for your negotiating skill, because I believe you were able to play very skilfully on simple matters such as how people tick and work in this Europe that is bequeathed to us.
There is also something I would like, however.
You have succeeded in bringing people closer to Europe again.
I would also like to see this transparency, the public nature of the summit, in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.
We should not allow this distance to occur and shut people out again.
I believe that would even help us in Poland, where we have the support of 80% of the population.
I thank you and wish you much success for the future!
