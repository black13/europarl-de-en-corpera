Mr President, like many on the Left in Europe, I cannot approve of anything that encourages nationalism and makes it even more difficult to use the European Union's resources to solve social, ecological and global problems.
I am therefore a supporter of European integration aimed at a federal European Union with of course a federal constitution, but one with other principles, other priorities and other objectives.
I, too, owe you my respect, Mrs Merkel.
You have succeeded in giving a broad public the impression that the Brussels compromise is your masterstroke.
In many respects, however, the compromise is a continuation of the same old things.
It brings no major change in policy, only a seemingly better design.
The rejection of the draft constitution in France and the Netherlands at the time was rooted not in fear of a superstate but in fear of a Europe that was not a social Europe, and you have probably done nothing to allay that fear with the compromise reached in Brussels, the half measures, the postponed problems and the jostling for power we saw over the weighting of votes.
That is why we continue to demand referenda in the EU Member States - on this treaty too.
There is absolutely no reason to fear that if, as the most recent surveys show, the majority of Europe's citizens are in favour of Europe.
If this treaty is a good treaty, there is also a good chance that the majority of the population will support it.
