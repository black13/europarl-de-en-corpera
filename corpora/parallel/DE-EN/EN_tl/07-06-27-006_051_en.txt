Mr President, I would like to take up what the previous speaker said.
Perhaps we ought to show the flag more often now and play the anthem more often to show that these things cannot be lost, because they exist.
We have fought for the substance to be preserved.
It has been, and I believe that is a mark of success.
More has been lost, however, than just the name and the symbols.
It is after all clear that the reform treaty is something different from the constitutional treaty, because the vision of a political union, not only of a Europe of states but a citizens' Europe, is now even further from our grasp and it will be a long time before we can make a fresh attempt at a European constitution.
On this point, Europe's opponents have won and the European federalists have lost.
We must be quite clear about that.
I also think that the simplified treaty is sadly still a complicated treaty.
There is a loss of transparency.
The citizens will not be able to identify so easily with the new product as they did with the Constitutional Treaty.
Thirdly, I am concerned that distrust between the Member States, and also some Member States' distrust of the EU and its institutions, has grown.
They all want to join, but they do not all want to join in.
We will be watching very closely to see whether there are not only different speeds, but also different classes.
Some evidently want to be second class.
If that is what they want, then let them.
They should not be able to block the others.
That was an important stage that takes us forward.
But it is not the end of the reform process, and the new treaty will for the first time allow this Parliament to make its own proposals for further reforms.
I have no doubt that, in the next legislative period, we will return to everything that has been left behind this time and that we will pursue the European Union's further development from this Chamber of Europe's citizens.
