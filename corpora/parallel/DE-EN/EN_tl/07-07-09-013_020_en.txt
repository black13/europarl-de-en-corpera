Mr President, I crave your forbearance because I do not know which Rule of the Rules of Procedure I am speaking under.
But I am sure that in your infinite wisdom you will find the right one.
We have a number of debates in this House about Parliament's calendar of meetings.
There is a very great need for coordination between the political groups.
The deadline for the tabling of amendments is 10 a.m. tomorrow.
On behalf of our group, but also with the agreement of other group chairmen and colleagues, I propose that the deadline be extended to 6 p.m. tomorrow.
That might give us time to resolve one or two serious problems, including organisational ones.
