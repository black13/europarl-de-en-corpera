Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the action programme on health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease are very closely related subjects.
I would like first of all to offer Mr Trakatellis my sincere congratulations on his tireless fight for this programme.
Prevention is better than cure.
Prevention means longer life, better life, better quality of life, less medical care, less sickness, lower sickness costs.
I am sure we would have liked more resources than 20 cents per head of population per year.
We are however modest and conduct many action programmes for little money.
We can only set priorities of course, and I must make it absolutely clear that we are talking here about prevention, about educating people, and not about treatment, which after all is a subsidiary matter and the responsibility of the nation states.
Prevention means stopping diseases from occurring in the first place, especially in the area of cardiovascular diseases, involving heart attacks and strokes, of tumour diseases and their causes, as with lung cancer and smoking, of unhealthy lifestyles such as the wrong kind of food or even doping in sport, of accidents and accident prevention, and of research and statistics, where the aim is to detect and understand diseases better in order to develop better guidelines for treatment.
I will now reply to the oral question from Mr Ouzk√Ω, to whom I also express my thanks here.
Much can be done to prevent cardiovascular disease by changing one's lifestyle: exercise, health, sport, balanced nutrition and ultimately also avoiding trans fatty acids.
We also need a catchy slogan for cardiovascular prevention, so that people know what is at stake.
We could say, for example, 'Save your heart, save your life' or in German 'Herzlos kannst du nicht leben'.
EUR 325 million for prevention over five years is not much.
I visited a German heart hospital this morning.
There, 200 million were invested in just one year!
