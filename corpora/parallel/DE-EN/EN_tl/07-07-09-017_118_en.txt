on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, in response to the previous speaker I would like to quote an Austrian proverb: 'blessed are those who believe, but you will still get to heaven if you do not'.
Perhaps now I can challenge Renate Sommer's world view a little.
It was not only Green Members, but the majority in this House who wanted a consumer- and environmentally friendly solution for the authorisation and labelling of genetically modified food and feed.
Even a government close to you has questioned EFSA's handling of the studies referred to today.
My question to the Commission is now: what concrete steps has the Commission taken to bring about a reform of the European Food Safety Authority?
This is not the first time we in this House have expressed doubts about its independence.
And yes, Mrs Sommer, we wanted and we want an independent Food Safety Authority.
But democratically elected Members naturally also have the right to take a critical look at its independence and work to see that it is genuinely independent.
That is very much our responsibility, because we of course also know the mood and attitude of the public towards it in all the Member States.
We agree, Mr Kyprianou, that EFSA should continue to be responsible for risk assessment and the Commission for risk management.
I am however convinced that both EFSA and the Commission need to take their responsibilities seriously.
As you know, next week we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety will be dealing with the question of how the individual authorisation of genetically modified organisms should be handled in the context of comitology and the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.
Such cases do not help that discussion very much.
I hope that in future concrete steps will be taken to demonstrate that the Food Safety Authority really is independent.
