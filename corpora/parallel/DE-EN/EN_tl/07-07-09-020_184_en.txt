Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this measuring devices directive is intended to remove around 30 tonnes of mercury from circulation, not very much but nevertheless an appreciable quantity.
The dangers of mercury are well known, its neurotoxicity undisputed.
Where human health is at risk, I believe the strict principle of substitution applies.
Where mercury is absolutely necessary and there are no alternatives, it can be retained under strict conditions.
Exceptions are therefore permitted only where there are no significant risks or where no alternatives are yet available.
The exceptions include sphygmomanometers for special applications and old measuring instruments, and it goes without saying that the number of old measuring instruments will continue to fall of its own accord.
I believe the transitional period of two years for barometers is quite sufficient.
The decisive thing for me is the harmonisation of the internal market, which is taken a step further here.
I approve the common position.
