Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree: mercury is highly toxic.
It is harmful to the environment, to animals and, through the food chain and by other routes, to human beings.
It is right that this element should be replaced where it is possible and sensible to do so, but not always and at any price and not because of the properties of the substance itself, but whenever its use really does present a hazard to the environment.
We cannot remove mercury from circulation completely in any case, because then we would also have to say goodbye to another product that is much valued by many Members of this House.
The energy-saving light bulb, which many would prefer to impose by law in order to protect the climate, also contains mercury.
If energy-saving light bulbs were universally used, we would have at least as much of it in our households as at present with traditional barometers.
I do not think much of banning mercury and a whole group of craft businesses from the EU market tomorrow while at the same time wanting to screw mercury lamps into our light fittings.
I would be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about these conflicting aims.
