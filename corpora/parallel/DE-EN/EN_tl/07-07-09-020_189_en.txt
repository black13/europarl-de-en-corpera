Vice-President of the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be glad to once again clarify the Commission's policy with regard to the handling of demonstrably highly toxic substances in our environment.
We cannot rule out risks in our society, but whenever the conditions for substitution are present, substitution must take priority.
I fail to understand how anyone could see it differently.
If it is not necessary to work with highly toxic substances in our environment, then we simply must not do it.
That also applies with regard to the energy-saving light bulbs that Mr Krahmer mentioned, which do indeed contain very small quantities of mercury.
There are as yet no substitutes for that.
But work must be done on it, and as soon as there are substitutes, manufacture without the use of mercury must of course be preferred here too.
May I conclude by talking about barometers again.
No one is a greater friend of beautiful old instruments than I am.
I am a great friend of traditional production methods, a great friend of traditional firms, especially small firms.
And no one wants to drive even one small traditional firm off the European market.
I have here a catalogue from one of these manufacturers.
There is no doubt at all.
Even today they offer beautiful barometers that show not the slightest external difference from the barometers that were manufactured in the past, but they no longer contain mercury.
Even the famous Prince of Wales barometer, a copy of John Russel's royal barometer, nevertheless costing GBP 795, is already available without the slightest trace of mercury.
The argument that even one firm could be forced out of business is simply not correct.
I can therefore tell you quite clearly that we are not acting in these small firms' interests if we prevent them from doing what is necessary to give their products a future.
And these traditional barometers will only have a future if they are made without mercury.
