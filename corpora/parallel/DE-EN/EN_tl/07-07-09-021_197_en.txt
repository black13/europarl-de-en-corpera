draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Mr President, cross-border crises, whether caused by terrorism or natural disasters, call for Union-wide protection of critical infrastructures.
Critical infrastructures cannot be kept secret by not mentioning them.
It would be completely na√Øve to think that.
From a psychological point of view, the destruction of critical infrastructures leads to a loss of public confidence in the European Union.
Crisis protection is not therefore only a national matter but requires European crisis management, as the Commission proposes.
Moreover, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has clearly pointed out, moving elements of European infrastructures outside the EU increases the risk of terrorist attacks and access to data in particular makes the entire infrastructure more vulnerable.
This is also true of banking and insurance.
Even if security and controls are constantly being improved in these areas, there is still a need for additional coordinated European action.
Nobody will want double regulation.
What we need is greater security.
The Directorate General for the Market must be guided by that and not by short-sighted wishes expressed by industry.
