on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one in this House disputes that close cooperation between the Member States is very important and necessary for countering terrorist risks.
Our criticism is of how this is to be done.
More bureaucracy will not help us against terrorism!
I would like to thank the rapporteur for at least bringing the proposal back down to earth and greatly improving the Commission's version.
She has also made a number of very practical suggestions.
We are all agreed that improved cooperation and information are good things.
That can be done bilaterally or multilaterally.
But compiling a list of all at-risk infrastructures will bring no gains in terms of security and may even be counterproductive.
In the end, however, competence lies with the Member States in any case, and there is no point at all in shifting it to the European level.
I hope that when we come to the vote tomorrow we will all proceed with the same realism as the rapporteur has shown and go on to secure what we now have: a sensible way forward that takes account of reality and fosters no illusions!
