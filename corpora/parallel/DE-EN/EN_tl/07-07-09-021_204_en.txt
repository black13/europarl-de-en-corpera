Mr President, unlike the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy or the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the committee responsible, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, failed to recognise the importance of the European level for the protection of critical infrastructures.
The focus is no longer on the protection of individual infrastructures but on the consideration of sectors.
I think the procedure proposed in the report lacks resolve.
The added value that comes from including the European level has been almost completely abandoned.
It is clear that responsibility for critical infrastructures must rest with the Member States.
However, if we leave designation entirely to the nation states we will not identify the weaknesses and structural dependencies, and that is precisely what is needed for the designation of critical European infrastructures.
The idea that a list would be as good as a textbook for terrorist attacks is downright na√Øve.
The Member States have had such lists for a long time.
One of the most important structural errors was, for example, not having checked those lists with NATO.
In the military sphere, NATO has had such lists of critical infrastructures for 40 years and relevant scenarios have long been provided for in anticipation of military crises.
