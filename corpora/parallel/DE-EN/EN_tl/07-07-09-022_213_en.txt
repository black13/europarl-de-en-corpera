on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, in the debate on second reading we said that we want to keep as much room for manoeuvre open for Parliament as possible.
I have no doubt that tomorrow we shall at last find a broad majority, Commissioner.
I was present at the conciliation procedure right to the end and must therefore say that in my opinion we - not only Parliament, but everyone involved - made hardly any use of the room for manoeuvre.
We could have wished for something more on one or two points.
Mrs Wallis has already mentioned that.
I am convinced that a broad majority of the public would be prepared to go a lot further than the statesmen in the classic areas in particular, in road traffic accidents or such areas as punitive damages.
When I look at the results of the summit, I can already see something of a gap here.
We are trying to fight people's disaffection with Europe with things they do not at all want, but the statesmen are often unwilling to bring in the things the public really wants.
It is also apparent that our meetings will show greater transparency in future, and I have great hopes of that.
It is also apparent that officials often have their own hobbyhorses and are much more reserved and restrained than necessary.
Unfortunately, politics is not up to speed here.
It would be good to have bold political decisions more often, even in the conciliation committees.
A Member State that proved obstructive at the last minute might then in fact often not be so politically obstructive.
As Parliament, we have now set out down this road with one of the first cases where codecision has been used in this area, and we ought in future to be even more self-confident in using the room for manoeuvre and demonstrate that we are also capable of allowing such negotiations to fail.
In the long run, all the studies and assessments with which we have been prevaricating for three or four years are not enough when the citizens want a decision here and now!
