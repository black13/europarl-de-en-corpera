on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, The debate on liberalising the postal services has taken up a lot of our time today.
It also shows that it is typically in the field of services that liberalisation is attended by an increase in precarious labour relations.
In the face of such developments, everybody expects the Commission to support workers' rights in a Green Paper on workers' rights, to set minimum standards at European level to prevent workers' rights from going into freefall, and to strengthen trade union representation and social dialogue.
Instead, the Commission's Green Paper starts talking about ideas of Flexicurity, which opens the floodgates to social dumping, which has caused bitter disappointment and will lead to a rise in Euroscepticism.
This House has made a clear amendment here: worker's rights are not exclusive, but apply to all employees, regardless of what their collective bargaining situation is.
It is the situation on the ground that is decisive.
More flexibility is only possible if there is greater security.
This is the only way in which the report can be further developed.
