in writing. - If we continue to conjure up new EU agencies just to assuage national sensibilities, and their tasks overlap with existing ones, we really should not be surprised at increasingly vociferous criticism of burgeoning red tape, unchecked organisational nonsense and creating unnecessary jobs.
Citizen-friendliness needs more than e-government and similar publicity stunts, and we have to avoid and cut down on duplication.
We should also make use of the present savings potentials.
These include: reducing the seats of Parliament to one single location, assessing expenses on the basis of the actual costs incurred, a top-class anti-fraud system and the real recovery of grants that have been improperly paid out, along with the millions to be saved by not foisting enlargements on reluctant citizens.
In no way should the EU follow the example of some Member States, where increasing numbers of migrants are taken up in the administration.
This will cause irreparable damage to the creation and development of a European identity.
