- Madam President, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert's target for the proposed directive should be supported because it is quite simply a matter of protecting important infrastructure which affects several countries against terrorist attacks.
That is why we need to identify and define the infrastructure, as well as security plans.
The Commission's proposal goes too far, though.
It undermines the principle of solidarity by confusing anti-terrorist activities with economic instruments.
The Commission should also ask itself whether the centralised compilation of critical infrastructure will not serve the terrorists and thereby increase the risk.
This House has made constructive amendment proposals, which, thank goodness, we have approved with a large majority.
I therefore propose that the Commission revise these.
I have voted in favour of the report.
