in writing. - I am voting for the report on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructure and the assessment of the need to improve their protection.
Damage to, or the outage of, an infrastructure facility in one Member State may have negative consequences for other Member States and on the European economy as a whole.
For this reason, protecting critical infrastructure is essential for the internal security of the EU.
I also agree with the report's proposal for setting up a list of priority sectors containing critical European infrastructure be made subject to common criteria.
However, the Member States should not be obliged to disclose their critical infrastructure in great detail, as this would go against the interests of national security.
Horizontal legal provisions at EU level, which would take into account the complex processes and the interfaces of critical infrastructures with a trans-national dimension is a justified concern.
It should, however, be recognised at the same time that the EU should support, not duplicate, the work done by the Member States.
For this reason I also approve of the proposal for a bottom-up approach, as national authorities know best what is going on in their own countries.
