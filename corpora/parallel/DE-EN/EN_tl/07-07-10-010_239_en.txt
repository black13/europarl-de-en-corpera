Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against Mr Vidal-Ouadras' report, not because I oppose opening up the electricity and gas markets - quite the contrary, but I cannot agree with one of the core requirements, which is ownership unbundling - or rather, I cannot do so at present - for three reasons: firstly, because we have to give national regulatory authorities more time to build up effective regulation for competition; secondly, it has by no means been satisfactorily demonstrated to me that ownership unbundling will promote investment in supply networks, and thirdly, because the unbundling proposal does not apply where networks and generation facilities are still under state ownership.
This is the point where we should impose those strict liberalisation conditions that have so far been denied to competition, instead of undermining those that are on the right market economy track through unbundling provisions.
