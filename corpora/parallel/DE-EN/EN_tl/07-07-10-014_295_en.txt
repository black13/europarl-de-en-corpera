on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, the present debate is also a warning: if this communication is yet another attempt to smuggle the deleted Articles 24 and 25 of the original Services Directive through the back door, then this House will unambiguously reject it.
The Posting of Workers Directive is there to protect workers, and this protective function must remain sacrosanct.
In the Posting of Workers Directive the local principle prevails, which means, amongst other things, that all measures by Member States that serve to protect posted workers and protect their interests are legitimate and desirable.
The Directive is a law for a free internal market for services.
But this freedom cannot come at any cost.
It is not the go-ahead for social dumping.
I am tired of having to make armchair decisions about the theoretical possibility of providing evidence of fair pay in the worker's country of origin within two or four weeks.
The situation on big and small building sites all over Europe tells a different tale.
The lack of possibilities for checking payslips on site gives additional opportunity to criminal machinations.
Surely that is not something you want to take the responsibility for?
Go and see the building sites for yourselves before proceeding any further.
See how workers are deprived of fair wages, and how social dumping distorts fair competition on those sites.
Equal pay for equal work in the same place must be the overriding principle.
