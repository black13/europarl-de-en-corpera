Madam President, On 13 June the DG Employment notified the Commission that some Member States are not implementing the Posting of Workers Directive conscientiously, Germany included.
My country is accused of exercising excessively stringent controls, and thereby driving workers from other Member States away.
How provocative can you get?
I expected a different position from a Commissioner whose fairness I otherwise greatly value.
Although cooperation between sending countries and recipient countries is important, it cannot replace effective controls.
Our common aim must be to secure worker protection, to prevent social dumping and to uncover and punish illegal working.
But this can only be done if we have valid documents, which should be in the language of the host country.
The following should be ready for presentation: work contracts, pay calculations, timesheets.
The General Prosecutor at the European Court of Justice supports this view, because inspectors will obviously have considerable problems with documents that have not been drawn up in the language of the respective country.
Secondly, in order to allow notices to be properly sent, the recipient must prove an address in Germany, and not just a mail-drop abroad that has been specially chosen for anonymity and everyone is obliged to appoint as an official representative anyone they consider appropriate.
The place of work could also be an address.
This I consider to be a fair solution.
Threatening infringement proceedings are an insult.
In Europe, Commissioner, things must be fair, not least as regards controls.
Mr Å pidla, I ask you, please keep the sense of scale and balance we are used to seeing from you.
