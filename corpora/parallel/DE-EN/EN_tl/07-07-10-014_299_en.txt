Madam President, Commissioner, when we were discussing the services directive, we stated quite clearly and definitely that it should in no way affect social rights in Member States.
That is why we removed the infamous Articles 24 and 25 from the directive, because it should not be possible to override these rights by exploiting loopholes.
We also agreed that, to clear up any ambiguities, the Posting of Workers Directive should be amended if any problems arise.
I would like to remind you of this compromise, which the European Commission also agreed to, and would like to demand this agreement again.
Commissioner, I share your view that lack of, or poor, cooperation among the authorities is one of the main reasons why we are having such problems with the Posting of Workers Directive, but do you really believe that by removing opportunities for control, documentation and everything else that is needed for control, will improve poor collaboration?
On the contrary, lack of documentation and poor cooperation among authorities equals social dumping pure and simple.
I cannot believe that that is what you really want.
So let us work together towards improving administrative cooperation, and to open the market for services and the markets for workers at the highest level of social protection.
Then we will be doing something positive for Europe, and, instead of a destructive approach to the Member States, strive positively for solutions that really will help things to progress.
That is the direction we should take.
Otherwise we will end up not achieving what we set out to do.
