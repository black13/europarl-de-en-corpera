Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the Commission proposal and also, of course, the rapporteur's report, as both make a contribution to the completion of the European internal market for air transport and to increasing safety levels.
I should like to mention and highlight four points.
Firstly, the provision on price transparency that has been adopted is a clear victory for consumers.
It will no longer be possible in future to lure citizens with false bait advertising.
Irrespective of the sales channel, all air fares are to be set out comprehensively and in detail.
Naturally, air traffic control prices are estimated on a flat-rate basis - although, at the end of the day, prices must be comprehensible.
We do not need to argue about this, however.
On the whole, we are creating clarity for passengers and strengthening competition.
Secondly, with regard to wet-leasing contracts, this is a balanced Regulation that, on the one hand, takes account of airlines' needs in the event that seasonal pricing movements occur or an exceptional need arises and they have to rely on such a model; and, on the other, makes clear that the circumvention of European safety and social standards is unacceptable.
Thirdly, like many reports on aviation legislation, our report contains numerous amendments on social legislation for employees.
The Commission is urgently required to make a proposal on this at long last, to close the loophole that the Services Directive has left and the present Regulation cannot close.
Fourthly, the new one-step procedure for traffic distribution is simpler and quicker than all previous procedures.
This is a good decision, including in terms of the future, that enables a more flexible response to capacity bottlenecks in infrastructure.
