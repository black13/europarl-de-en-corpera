Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Barsi-Pataky on this report and by thanking her for her hard work and willingness to compromise.
She has managed, in a very short, but accurate and perceptive report, to give an overview of the key priorities for Europe's future transport policy.
Experts - especially those who can read between the lines - will appreciate that.
However, our citizens will lament the lack of detailed, tangible examples and practical proposals.
The mid-term review on the European Commission's 2001 Transport White Paper shows that we have a lot of catching up to do.
This is not only true for the security aspects, but also for other areas such as sustainability, investment (particularly in TENs) and logistics.
Mrs Barsi-Pataky has indicated the right approach through her support for an intermodal transport network in which each carrier will develop their strengths so as to create goods transport services that are in the public interest.
I was struck by the absence of any call for an appropriate Community framework for intermodal tourism, in other words for structuring the movements of European citizens.
We also need intermodal approaches in public and private long-distance passenger transport in order to satisfy the constantly growing desire for mobility.
I very much welcome the decision to link existing transport problems to the development of intelligent transport systems and innovative technical solutions.
Policies should be bold enough to give priority to security-related legislation in the transport sector.
This should include strict rules for HGVs up to 44 tonnes and transport infrastructure safety management.
