Mr President, occasionally one hears that this Intergovernmental Conference will just be dealing with the technicalities of the Treaty.
That is not true!
You, President-in-Office, have shown that the political significance of the Intergovernmental Conference is that it will keep to the whole mandate and nothing but the mandate.
The political significance lies in the clear determination to conclude the negotiations in October, and in seeking to convince all 27 Member States that this is the right way forward for Europe at this historic moment.
I have no doubt that you will succeed, given the clarity of your programme and your firm political will.
The chairman of my group has said that you just need to get the ball in the net from the penalty spot.
Martin, let us not forget, this is not a penalty shootout, but a penalty awarded mid-game!
The game will continue.
There is still the whole second half, or the ratification process.
Past experience has shown that a few problems may yet emerge.
So I feel it would be good, President-in-Office, if you were to seek to convince your colleagues in the Council informally of the need for speedy ratification within the next twelve months.
It would be good if the Netherlands and France, who voted 'no', could be the first to ratify.
It would also be good, President-in-Office, if you could persuade the new British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, not to bring up the rear in the ratification process, but rather to lead the way.
That would send a clear message to the whole of Europe.
