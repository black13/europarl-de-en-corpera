Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we have been given our homework, and plan to send the right messages to Africa and Latin America.
The Intergovernmental Conference needs to discuss the technical details and implementing the substance of the Treaty and the decisions made at the summit, not to negotiate a new Treaty.
Today you will have noticed that the problem is not the European Parliament, not the Commission, and not Europe's citizens.
The only problem you may encounter is the vanity of some Heads of State or Government and Member States in the Council.
So I say to you: make sure that under your Presidency everyone keeps to what has been agreed, that everyone keeps their promises, that they make good on their financial commitments - I am thinking of Frontex - and that they take responsibility for doing at home what they promised at the European level: that they implement real projects and respect the rules, rather than presenting clever interpretations - particularly France.
If you ensure that what has been agreed becomes reality, you will generate new momentum in the European Union and have fewer problems.
