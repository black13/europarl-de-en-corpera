rapporteur. - Mr President, in this opinion we have given the green light to convene the Intergovernmental Conference.
We had a very tight deadline for producing the report and holding consultations.
There was no alternative, although there has been criticism from some members.
There are two minority opinions appended to the opinion: one from Marco Cappato and the other from Bernard Wojciechowski, but as I said, time was limited.
Exceptional circumstances require an extra degree of flexibility, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of my committee for their willingness to make constructive contributions, for the discussions on the proposal and for giving their approval on Monday evening.
We have respected the rules of procedure and so can vote today.
