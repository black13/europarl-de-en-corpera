Mr President, since several Members addressed me before the vote, I would like to use this opportunity to stress once again that the proposal to include the question of representation for the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference mandate was supported by many Members of this House.
So, if this is a signal you want to send, here is an opportunity to do so.
- Before the vote on Amendment 9
