Mr President, I would like to endorse that comment.
We need to stop the vote now.
It would be unreasonable to continue voting now, especially given the length of the reports.
If necessary, we will have to curtail the speaking times tomorrow or keep strictly to them, so as to be able to start voting at 11.30 a.m.
