Madam President, I welcome the three-leaved euro clover too.
The euro has been a success: the euro is the EU's best response to global challenges.
The euro and the four freedoms are the cornerstones of a strong internal market.
To my mind, the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact are the greatest regulatory principles to have been achieved by the European Union.
From 1 January 2008, the Euro Group will have an absolute majority among the EU members.
That is good news, and we would like to extend a warm welcome to Malta and Cyprus.
I am struck by the fact that we are getting excited because a Head of Government has promised to do their homework.
Homework has to be done.
We need to respect the rules, rather than interpreting them in a protectionist manner.
We are glad that there are economic benefits, and we call for those benefits to be used to reduce trade deficits and public debt, whilst at the same time allowing the workers to share in the benefits.
We are not questioning the European Central Bank's independence.
The Bank stands guarantor for the euro's good performance.
But an independent ECB and unified external relations for the Eurozone are not mutually exclusive.
A single voice for the Eurozone in external relations has nothing to do with the fact that these three gentlemen influence foreign exchange rates.
The foreign exchange rate is determined by the market, and the European Central Bank decides interest rates.
I want to make that clear to the left.
Nowadays we all sing the praises of the euro and the economic data, but we have forgotten that the euro should also be seen and presented as beneficial for Europe's citizens.
Let us emphasise how much we are saving in exchange rate costs.
Let us emphasise the euro's effect on stability in the Eurozone and the internal market.
Let us not forget that we are currently doing better than the dollar: that is a real sign of success.
When we introduced the euro, that is what citizens wanted.
