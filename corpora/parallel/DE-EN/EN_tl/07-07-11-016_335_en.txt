Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so clear.
Yesterday, the new UN General Secretary also stressed that the continued failure to resolve the status issue constitutes a serious threat to peace.
If Kosovo, where 90% of the population is Albanian, does not finally get what it deserves, namely independence under international supervision, then economic instability and political unrest could ensue.
It is high time that we took a pragmatic line.
Seventy-five per cent of this House voted in favour of the Ahtisaari plan.
We made it clear that we favour independence under international supervision.
The Commission, most Member States, and also the USA, have taken the same line.
So it is high time that we put an end to the deadlock in the Security Council.
Russian and Serbian nationalism can no longer be allowed to delay a peaceful solution that will give the Serbs in Kosovo extensive, internationally-guaranteed rights that are far better than those accorded to other ethnic minorities in other European states.
Now is the time to push forward with a solution, not least because our vital EU mission needs both a stable international legal basis and broad acceptance among the Kosovans if we are to avoid being seen as an occupying power.
It is therefore essential that we push ahead, with a view to achieving a long-overdue political solution.
Mr President, I would like to make it clear that we are not willing to allow the West to fall into the trap of allowing the Serbian constitution to make territorial claims on Kosovo and the Russians to say they will veto resolutions until Serbia agrees - which it will be unable to do because of the constitution approved by a dubious referendum.
An artificial barrier is being created that represents a serious threat to peace.
