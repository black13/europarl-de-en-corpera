on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, to be brutally frank, it is pretty clear that we have now reached a stalemate.
Serbia and Russia have both declared that they will not accept an enforced independence, and Mr Bush has since said that he wants Kosovo to declare its independence unilaterally.
So the European Union has a key role to play in the current situation.
There is however a whole range of unhelpful input, such as Mr Barroso's comments comparing the European Union to an 'empire'.
That may be borne out by some elements, but is not very helpful in the current situation.
The EU is an interested party itself and wants to make Kosovo a virtual UNMIK protectorate.
It is quite clear that the original Ahtisaari plan will not happen, and everyone needs to take a deep breath and accept that.
An internationally valid solution is needed, where Serbia also agrees to the whole package.
We in the European Parliament urgently need details of the planned CFSP mission in Kosovo.
We have not yet received the information, and we urgently need it.
