I wanted to ask another question.
Turkey is always announcing legislative amendments, but never passes the laws, and the situation is getting worse.
So I would like to ask: do you think that the law on language that you mentioned and the freedom of religious expression legislation that we cited will actually go through this year?
What will the Council do if they are not passed this year?
