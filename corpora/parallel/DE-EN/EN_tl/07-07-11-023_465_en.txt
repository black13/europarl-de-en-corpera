Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur.
In his report, he has called for the legislative and statistical cycles to be brought into synch, for a reduction in the administrative burden for small and medium-sized companies, he has said that we need to ensure that we receive quality data, which means better data, and that we should also include a number of social and macroeconomic indicators.
He has also reported that we have submitted a request to the Commission, for two reasons.
One reason is the recurring complaints about Member States who supply incomplete statistical data - the main culprits are Greece, Portugal, Italy and Hungary.
In one country, Hungary, the Prime Minister actually admitted to fudging the data and hiding the truth from the public and the Commission.
The second reason is that many requirements have not yet been implemented.
I would like to mention one: the Commission must be entitled to verify the data supplied in the country.
It should be possible for the Commission to hold discussions with the national banks, the finance, economy and labour ministries, and with economic research institutes in the country.
We cannot simply rely on the data provided.
The Commission's data has to be compared with the European Central Bank's data.
There are various figures of varying degrees of importance that need to be compared.
Thirdly, for all euro-related information - data relating to budgets, the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht criteria - the European Central Bank, the Commission and the Member States have to produce a joint final report.
We need unified, transparent data collection standards.
We are all familiar with the unemployment figures from the Member States and for the European Union.
One is played off against the other for reasons of political expediency.
This creates uncertainty, not transparency, and only engenders distrust.
