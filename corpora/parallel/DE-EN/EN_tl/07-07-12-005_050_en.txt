on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, allow me also to congratulate you once again on your election yesterday and on your first session in the chair here in the Chamber.
I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for this engrossing report, because at the end of the day we all have the one aim, namely to eliminate the disparities between the regions of the European Union.
That is not only in the interests of the poorest regions of the European Union but in the interests of all regions, because the development of the Union as a whole would otherwise stagnate.
The fact is that we have huge potential in the regions we are supporting.
People there want to get involved and to play their part in the European Union, but we must also give them the opportunity to do so.
I would like to focus on a few points which the rapporteur mentioned in her report and which seem quite important to me.
The European Union needs to provide rapid assistance, which means that we must build up the administration and must not tread on each other's toes in the various tiers of government.
This also requires a functioning system of cross-border cooperation.
I am eager to see how the Member States actually achieve that aim in the coming weeks and months.
I would be delighted if the new financial instruments, Jessica, Jeremy and Jasper, which were invented some years ago, finally became familiar in the Member States and were used to good effect.
Of more than 400 applications submitted so far for operational programmes, however, a quarter at most have been approved.
I would be pleased if that went more quickly; perhaps it could incorporate scope for subsequent adjustment.
There is one thing I would like to stress: getting rid of disparities between regions also means working to eliminate differences in the opportunities available to men and women.
I therefore urge the House to support the relevant motions here in plenary.
