on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I, too, congratulate you on your new office, Madam President.
One reform leads to another.
That was the reason why we in the Committee on Regional Development, immediately after the reform of the Structural Fund and for the umpteenth time, asked the question how we were to assess Europe's poorest regions in future.
The aim was to give the cohesion policy a future in the light of present-day experience with regard to the new reform of the Structural Funds in 2014, for we know that the willingness of the wealthy Member States to pay into the Solidarity Pact is waning.
At the same time, our common commitment to the poorest regions through the cohesion policy is the very thing that keeps the heart of the European Union beating.
Unfortunately, this report hardly deals with these issues concerning the future.
It concentrates on the implementation problems in the new Member States in connection with the current Structural Funds Regulation.
It illustrates what happens when a solid decentralised administrative structure is considered expendable.
I regard it as naive, however, to believe that banks are a substitute for a greater degree of involvement as a panacea for the absorption and administration problems in the very poorest regions.
The Jasper and Jessica initiatives must be used in such a way that democratic action is not abandoned and that the public purse is not saddled with debts for generations to come.
This would mean the European Union keeping the poorest regions permanently on life support, and that cannot be our intention.
