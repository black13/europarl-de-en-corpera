rapporteur. - I beg to point out that Amendment 1 should not be placed after paragraph 4 but after paragraph 146; that was agreed with the author of the amendment.
This paragraph does not belong at the beginning but at the end of the resolution.
I would be grateful if you could arrange for that to be done.
