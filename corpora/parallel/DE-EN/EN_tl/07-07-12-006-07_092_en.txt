Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the four oral amendments we moved are a last attempt to obtain a joint resolution.
Let me make it clear, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we endorse the criticism.
Criticism alone, however, will not stop the terrorists.

Accordingly, we move firstly that the following specific wording be added:
'Having regard to the joint ruling of the European Court of Justice of 30 May 2006 on cases C-317/04 and C-318/04,'
