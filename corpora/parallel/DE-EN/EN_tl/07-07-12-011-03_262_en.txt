Mr President, I only wish to point out that the honourable Member is correct but that, during the German Presidency of the Council, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights, GÃ¼nter Nooke, was here twice on Thursday afternoons.
That is a precedent which future Presidents of the Council should follow.
(Applause)
