Mr President, I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to all those who are grieving for family and friends.
My thoughts are with those who have lost their homes and possessions.
They need our solidarity.
The Greek Government was forced to admit that legislative loopholes and policy failure were partly the cause of the devastating fires.
In an era of climate change, a rejection of regional policy can have such devastating consequences for the natural environment.
This situation now needs to change, including in Greece.
In the reconstruction effort, one priority must be to preserve and restore the natural landscape in order to make the affected regions habitable again and give the people there a new basis for life and thus a future.
Land speculation in every form must be rejected.
It cannot be permitted, and certainly not with the EU's money!
I would also caution the Commission against amending the Structural Fund regulations at the expense of sustainability and the partnership principle which are enshrined in it.
At this time, that would be the wrong response to the devastating effects of the forest fires in Greece.
