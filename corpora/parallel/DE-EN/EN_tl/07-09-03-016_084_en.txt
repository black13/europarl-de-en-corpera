in writing. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the images of the serious fires in Greece haunted us throughout the entire summer.
The swift assistance provided by other EU countries to tackle the fires and the EU's current offer of assistance payments will not be forgotten in Greece.
However, there is something that has been forgotten in Greece for decades, and this brings me to the cause of the recent disaster: namely the need to set up a land register.
Greece has been obliged by the EU to act here for some time, but no action has been taken yet.
As a consequence, large areas of the Greek forest have remained common land, in effect a no-man's-land.
Anyone who burned a section of forest and put a cabin on it could be certain that there would be no comeback; indeed, his action would be legalised after the fact.
This situation has made arson the national sport.
The EU is willing to help the Greek people now, but Greece must take a good look at itself and if necessary give itself a rap on the knuckles.
Specifically, this means that if Greece does not complete its land register by 31 August 2008, not only will the penalties accumulated - which run into millions - finally be due; other payments must be considered as well.
As the rapporteur for the transparency of agricultural expenditure in the EU, I will be following this very closely.
