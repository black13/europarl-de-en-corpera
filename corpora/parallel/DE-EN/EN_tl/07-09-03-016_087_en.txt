in writing. - The frequency, scale, complexity and impact of natural disasters have increased substantially throughout Europe in recent years.
The summer of 2007 was marred by massive forest fires and severe flooding, resulting in substantial material and environmental damage.
These natural disasters have made it clear, once again, that the existing national resources are reaching their limits, both financially and technically.
A well-functioning, efficient and rapid-reaction European civil protection mechanism is therefore an urgent necessity.
For that reason, I call for effective engagement from Europe and appeal to the Commission to adopt appropriate measures.
Everyone remembers the flood disasters in Central Europe in 1999, 2001 and 2005 and the devastation they caused in Austria and its neighbouring countries.
The EU's disaster relief fund was established in response.
The time has now come to make this fund as flexible as possible and to mobilise it without delay.
The development of a crisis reaction mechanism will also facilitate a rapid response in larger-scale emergency situations.
