Mr President, we are in favour of removing restrictions on the internal market in order to promote its positive effects, such as sustained growth, and in that process it is important to pay adequate attention to social safeguards for ordinary people.
Because of their particular importance, the services of general interest - what we term 'basic' forms of provision - cannot simply be left to the free play of the market.
In the health and social fields especially, they need a specific set of rules.
I am sorry to see the quite unnecessary mention of nuclear power in paragraph 16.
This is indisputably a high-risk technology which puts the population in danger.
So, on that point I cannot back the report.
It also has to be said that diverging national interpretations in the transposition of EU law are creating uncertainty.
As numerous studies have shown, this is a considerable obstacle to the completion of the internal market.
Finally, I should like to mention the international importance of European standards.
The current controversy about faulty toys from China is a good illustration of how important it is, in dialogue with external trade partners, that we should have internationally recognised standards.
Even if countries like China do feel overburdened by a long list of quality requirements, we nonetheless need measures to improve product and food safety in the interests of protecting European consumers.
