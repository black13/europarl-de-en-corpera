Mr President, that your words have been received with approval and warmth is obvious from the applause.
You spoke out for solidarity and a sense of community and those qualities underpin what we are about here in the European Union.
Only through solidarity, a sense of community and practical action will we achieve our aims.
Yours is not an empty rhetoric for you have shown in the course of your political life that you are committed to Europe and capable of taking practical action on its behalf.
Speaking for the European Parliament, I should like to assure you that we as MEPs will do all we can to support the Portuguese Presidency, so that when the Heads of State and Government meet in October we may achieve a successful outcome on the Reform Treaty.
I would also make a point of extending our gratitude and recognition to Foreign Minister Luís Amado, Secretary of State Manuel Lobo Antunes and Ambassador Álvaro Mendonça e Moura and all their colleagues, whose task it is to convey, through the process of discussions, the expression of our political will.
To them I say: 'We are with you.'
I thank you Mr President, on behalf of the European Parliament, for your impressive words to us and I wish Portugal every success in the interests of this Europe that we share.
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Cavaco Silva.
(Applause)
