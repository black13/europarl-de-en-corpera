Thank you very much, Mr Virrankoski, and thank you too for observing the speaking time so scrupulously.
It would seem that the Finns have everything well under control here.
Representatives from smaller countries such as Finland, just like those from larger states, are capable of exerting great influence.
Our other rapporteur is also a Finn: you have the floor, Mr Itälä.
