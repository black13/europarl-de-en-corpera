on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are very positive rules for multimodal transport, which I hope will grow in future, because they are more transparent and easier to understand.
At last, inland waterways have been included, as the Greens had requested in an earlier report.
I found it hard to understand why this took so long.
The pollution caused by an accident involving a vessel transporting highly toxic chemicals can, of course, cause even more concentrated pollution if it happens on a river than might be case on the high seas.
I regard the stringent rules that Member States may lay down, and that extend to prescribing the means of transport, as necessary, important and right.
Conditions on our various transport routes are extremely varied.
There may be high bridges, for instance, that are inaccessible to rescue forces.
There may be high traffic density, which can under certain circumstances make the transport of dangerous goods even more hazardous.
Dangerous goods are often transported in the vicinity of towns.
All this means that we must provide Member States with that possibility, so that they can react to such dangers in a flexible manner.
A central issue in this report, however, as in many others, is monitoring.
The national states must systematically monitor compliance with the rules, otherwise we will have empty words that pretend to a kind of safety that, unfortunately, does not exist.
To be quite frank, there are serious deficiencies in this area in some European states.
There is also a major challenge to be met in terms of training fire-fighters and rescue forces.
I hope this also acts as an incentive to make this monitoring more stringent and at last to minimise the dangers of transport - whether by water, rail or road.
