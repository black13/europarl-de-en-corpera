Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my good friend the rapporteur, Bogus≈Çaw Liberadzki, on this really balanced and successful report.
As Mrs Sommer has already pointed out, 110 billion tonnes/km of dangerous goods are transported in the EU every year.
Like Mr Henin, I too would prefer at least part of that quantity to be stored in warehouses.
Unfortunately that is not the case, which is why we must look into that matter too.
A first, important point in this report is the updating and coordination of existing rules on safety requirements for tanks and vehicles.
A second important point is the extension of that requirement from road and rail to inland waterways.
If we look at the transport trend in recent years, it becomes very clear that inland waterways are becoming increasingly important.
I agree with Mrs Lichtenberger that accidents on rivers are, of course, particularly dangerous.
These measures - and here I am speaking as someone who lives in a country of transit - may also lead to a shift towards the railways.
That is, of course, a very good thing.
We in Austria naturally welcome this report, in particular because Austria, given its geographical location, sets very high safety requirements for transport participants.
I also find it extremely welcome that in future every Member State is also to have the right to regulate or prohibit the internal transport of dangerous goods on its territory.
In my view, that includes in particular laying down special provisions on environmental protection and the option of prohibiting or restricting the transport of certain hazardous goods.
If the report is adopted in the wording proposed by the rapporteur, it will be a very good report and we can all be satisfied with the outcome.
