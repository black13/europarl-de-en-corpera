on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Green I am of course in favour of any improvements in logistics because that can help reduce environmental damage.
I must say from the outset, however, that there are few areas where the European Union really has the power to do anything in this regard.
There are always logistical weaknesses in areas where the link between different transport modes does not work; this is particularly harmful when the railways cannot be used because the logistical links are cumbersome, bureaucratic, non-existent or poorly developed.
Even in cases where many transport modes run empty, however, we find that there is clearly a lack of logistics, or that it is simply not worthwhile to use the rolling stock in an efficient and targeted manner.
Those are crucial issues and they are indeed addressed in the dossier.
At the same time, they have been exploited by a number of lobbyists.
In my view, the improvement in infrastructure is not yet logistical; we still see empty wagons even on very good roads or railways, which does not help us in any way.
In particular, I object to the fact that this dossier has been misused as a propaganda instrument for what are known as gigaliners.
We are already suffering from the fact that very poor use is made of the rolling stock.
Nonetheless, it is intended for reasons of economic self-interest - especially on the part of the timber industry, in the past at least - to introduce very large HGVs, which will adversely affect road maintenance.
After all, we must all realise that roads will need to be repaired far more frequently if even more weight is put on the axles, if even more weight presses on the asphalt surface.
That is why we cannot speak of environmental or economic improvement here, because in the end this also hugely distorts competition with the railways.
