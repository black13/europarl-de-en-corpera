on behalf of the ITS Group. - Mr President, for years now globalisation has landed us with rising expenditure on freight transport; on top of that we have had enlargement eastward - together with a misdirected EU aid policy.
As a result, millions of vehicles are transporting freight every day, from private cars to HGVs, and the adverse effects such as congestion, noise, environmental pollution and fine dust pollution are escalating.
The concentration on road transport will no doubt exacerbate the existing problems in densely populated areas and on the main transport routes.
HGVs are far more often involved in accidents than other forms of transport and strict EU-wide rules on rest periods will make little difference.
Brussels does not take public health protection really seriously either, for there is no other explanation for the failure to transpose the Convention on the Protection of the Alps.
In fact the EU addressed those issues years ago, drawing up action plans and calling for transport to be shifted from road to rail.
Yet once again it did not managed to achieve any real results.
In regard to Trans-European Networks, we cannot continue to close our eyes to reality and, in the end, rolling country roads will have to become economically attractive.
