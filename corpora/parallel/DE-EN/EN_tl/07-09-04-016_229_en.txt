Madam President, Commissioner, we regard the Single European Sky as the most important project for the future of air transport.
The Commission always emphasised its importance under your predecessor and I also believe it to be the case.
We adopted the 2004 package of regulations.
We still have a kind of patchwork in the sky, with 58 national airspace blocks, even though we know we would really only need one, or to be generous perhaps three to six.
We know that this patchwork - the figures were given earlier - has adverse effects on safety, and of course also on the economy and consumers.
We know about the stacking and congestion in the skies and nowadays we are putting far more emphasis on emissions.
We have realised that we can take a big step forward here.
In its progress report, the Commission showed how slowly the Member States are moving, even if there are some initiatives, and proposed a few ways of exerting pressure.
Now I am not saying that is meaningless, nor 'I told you so', but as early as 2003 we said the bottom-up approach would not work, because even at that time we suspected that Member States would get embroiled in discussions about areas of sovereignty in regard to service provision and that such crucial matters need to be regulated by top-down legislative rules.
At the time we thought perhaps Eurocontrol could propose rules and make a proposal based simply on the substance, on functionality, which the Member States could then quarrel about, rather than waiting until they themselves had created another kind of patchwork, in a bottom-up approach.
What is important now is seriously to consider whether we need to review the legal framework.
That would be the only way to exert real pressure and bring about the necessary changes.
