Madam President, Commissioner, organising illegal immigration and people trafficking are important branches of the business of organised crime.
We as a European Union brought Frontex into being with your initiative - a good idea fraught with major implementing problems: Member States do not deliver, actions are interrupted in July and only resume in September.
What will you do to make the Frontex instrument function efficiently and provide Member States with the necessary support throughout the year, so that we can have an effective instrument in our hands to combat organised illegal immigration, something you also want to see?
