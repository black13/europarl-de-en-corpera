Commissioner, my question concerns the late payment directive.
Many small and medium-sized undertakings, and many researchers too, constantly complain about the length of time it takes from authorisation of a project to actual payment.
Pre-financing is far too difficult for many small and medium-sized undertakings.
Do you think the European Commission might also bring its payment conditions into line with the late payment directive, which applies throughout Europe and which we all agreed?
