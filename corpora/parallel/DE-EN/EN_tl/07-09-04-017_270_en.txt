Commissioner, you referred to political crises.
This year we have seen countless natural disasters in Greece, the UK and elsewhere.
It is most important for budget funds to be made available rapidly in such cases.
Are the instruments we have now adequate or could improvements perhaps be made?
Might there be ways of increasing the overall financial volume, given that the figures for this summer show that the funds we have at present will certainly not suffice?
