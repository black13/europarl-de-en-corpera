Mr President, our rapporteur and Commissioner Kyprianou made it quite clear in their opening statements that we are concerned not with condemning alcohol as a product but with its abuse.
Nor is this discussion about offering our citizens alcohol, as the report also makes clear.
Let me simply remind Members of the regulation on health-related information that we adopted in this House last year.
It bans health-related labelling on alcoholic drinks.
The European Parliament decided to endorse that too, on the basis of very good arguments.
The resolution incorporates the priorities set out in the Commission's communication of last October - to reduce the number of injuries and deaths resulting from alcohol-related road traffic accidents.
The focus on alcohol abuse by young people and children is important, but it would be a strategic mistake to pretend that only young people are affected by alcohol abuse and its adverse effects in the European Union.
Precisely because alcohol and the moderate consumption of alcohol are important components of our European culture - and that should remain the case and nor should it be criticised - we must give particular priority to raising awareness about alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
The consumption even of small quantities of alcohol during pregnancy can adversely affect the child's development.
I do not think the discussion about whether or not to introduce labelling will come to an end with tomorrow's vote, and in fact Commissioner Kyprianou has indicated that the Commission will very carefully observe Member States' experiences and then possibly take measures at European level.
