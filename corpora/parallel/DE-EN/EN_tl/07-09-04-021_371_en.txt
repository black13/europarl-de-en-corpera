Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join the rapporteur in extending thanks, for I think the overwhelming endorsement in committee is enough to show what good work has been done here.
The mini milk package is an important step not just for European farming and the milk sector, but above all for promoting the use of milk in nutrition.
Balanced nutrition is especially important for children, and here milk and milk products have a major part to play.
The healthy development of our children is determined by the supply of healthy foods, such as local milk products.
That is why it is most important to promote milk and all the various milk products, from yoghurts to soft drinks and low-fat products, which children and schoolchildren love so much.
One reason why it is important to promote sales of milk and milk products is that it is becoming increasingly clear that unhealthy eating is leading to a growing number of health problems among Europeans too.
The advertising budget contained in the mini milk package will increase people's awareness, which will in turn benefit the population as a whole.
It is vital to ensure that the savings resulting from the reform remain within the milk sector.
In conclusion, let me say that direct production prices for farmers are finally rising, although this is certainly not due to the fact that we are now producing bio-energy but is mainly the result of environmental disasters and better markets within the EU and outside it, i.e. in third countries.
