Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Jeggle has done an outstanding job with the three reports on milk, for which I give her warm thanks.
I also thank the Commissioner for the proposals that form the basis of our discussion today.
These three reports are of a rather technical nature.
The crucial debate on milk will take place in connection with the Health Check.
I would like to address a few points.
I am pleased that the first report is concerned with standardising the protein content of milk powder, which leads to market adjustment.
In the second report, I find it welcome that the 27 national quality classes for butter are to be removed and replaced with a single, Europe-wide quality definition.
I am also glad that more attention is being paid to the question of school milk.
It is better to make milk and milk products tasty for our children than to have to discuss alcohol abuse among young people, as was the case today.
The third report indicates that drinking milk could be marketed more flexibly.
Here I would insist to the Commissioner that the +/- 0.2% tolerance margin is far too high.
Milk producers calculate the fat content of the milk they get from the farmers exactly to within 0.01%, so they must also be able to give consumers an exact indication of the fat content of drinking milk.
Milk is a valuable and healthy food.
Milk and milk products form part of a healthy diet and I hope the upward trend continues for our dairy farmers and that the market grows.
That is urgently necessary to ensure that our dairy farmers are rewarded better for working 365 days a year.
The outcry about rising milk prices is not justified.
Average consumption in Europe is 260 kg.
If the consumer has to pay 10 cents more, that comes to 50 cents a week and surely we should consider milk production in Europe worth that much.
