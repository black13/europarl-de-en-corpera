Mr President, in my opinion, this debate is fairly fundamental to democracy in the European Union.
It is good to take a look back.
Since 12 September 2001, a 'war' has been waged on terrorism.
On that day, NATO invoked the mutual defence clause, having wrongly judged the attacks in New York and Washington to be military attacks.
How this mutual defence clause can be revoked is anyone's guess.
Now the 'war on terror' is being waged worldwide, for example in Afghanistan, where Iraqisation is increasing progressively, whilst at domestic level more and more fundamental and civil rights are being invalidated.
The whole situation could be described as a permanent state of emergency.
The EU has adopted a framework decision on combating terrorism.
This sets out a large number of points being implemented or to be implemented by the EU Member States and the EU itself.
We are currently seeing widespread 'actionism', especially by the German Minister of the Interior, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, who is now describing everything as terrorism and is clearly overstepping the bounds of what is actually necessary.
After London, the author A.L. Kennedy made a very interesting comment, which I should like to quote here: 'Nobody mentions that the number of victims, as horrendous as it was, would be considered only moderate in Baghdad on most days.
Nobody says that, in deciding to send our soldiers to war for profit, Tony Blair also put his country in danger [...]
Nobody mentions that our actions have only increased the number and the intensity of terrorist acts.
Nobody notes that even we have justified the torturing of prisoners by saying that attacks could be prevented by this means.
Nobody mentions that, for vast parts of the world, we are the terrorists.'
That is exactly what must be avoided, which is why the invalidation of fundamental and civil rights cannot continue.
