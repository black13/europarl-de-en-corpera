Mr President, the latest reports from Denmark and Frankfurt am Main in Germany are proof that the threat of Islamist terrorism has not gone away.
Yet the most recent studies demonstrate that this threat comes less from outside - that is, from Al-Qaida - than from young Muslims living in the European Union itself who are susceptible to radicalisation and subsequently turn into terrorists.
Terrorists do not just appear out of the blue, therefore; potential perpetrators grow up in our Islamist parallel societies, with madrasahs and preachers of hate, in particular, playing a major, a disastrous, role.
Thanks to political correctness, the indigenous peoples of Europe are all too easily labelled right-wing extremist or even racist for insisting on their basic culture, whilst migrants seldom face this problem.
The Islamist parallel societies now existing throughout Europe are often underestimated.
Terrorism often has its roots in schools.
It then continues in juvenile gangs and, following this radicalisation, may then culminate in attacks.
We must close the gaps in our society in which terrorism can thrive, gaps that have arisen from misplaced tolerance.
We must draw boundaries; there is certainly no need for us to tolerate everything.
Changing our traditional lifestyles and denying our own culture provides the best breeding ground for terrorism.
It is high time, therefore, that Brussels, too, accepted that the multicultural vision is in tatters and supported Europe's indigenous population again at long last, instead of constantly discrediting it under the pretext of stamping out racism.
