The Commission proposal on the simplification and unification of European legislation on the transport of dangerous goods should be endorsed in its entirety, including in the interests of better regulation.
As recently as 31 August 2007 I visited the traffic management headquarters for seven road tunnels, among them the longest tunnel in Germany, and became aware of the need for harmonisation, particularly of the provisions on the transport of dangerous goods in tunnels.
The transport not only of goods per se, but also of dangerous goods, is growing rapidly - and this is happening worldwide so that even the increase can no longer be absorbed by a single mode of transport.
It makes sense, therefore, to adopt the relevant rules for transport not only by road and rail, but also by inland waterway.
This improves the chances of applying the co-modal approach to the problem of our transport needs.
It is particularly worthy of mention in terms of the understanding of our fellow citizens that the present legal act takes account not only of the specific recommendations of the United Nations but also of Member States' subsidiarity requirements.
The fact that the directive summarises four 'old' directives and saves 2 000 pages of legislative text makes it an example of bureaucracy reduction in action.
Member States will retain the right to regulate or even prohibit the transport of certain dangerous goods within their territory, for example, for reasons of national security or of environmental protection.
In the final analysis, the public can expect this directive to make a contribution to improving both transport safety and environmental safety.
