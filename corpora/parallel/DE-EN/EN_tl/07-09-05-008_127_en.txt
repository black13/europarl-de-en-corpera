Mr President, I voted in favour of the Jeggle reports, because I hope they will facilitate the survival of our farmers.
After all, there was a time when farmers could make a very good living from their produce.
Nowadays, food prices are rising continuously but, whilst large enterprises benefit from this and harvest handsome profit margins, simple farmers are pushed increasingly into the role of supplicants.
Often, smallholders need a supplementary source of income to survive, and the love of nature is the overriding and only reason many take on this dual burden.
Increasing numbers are throwing in the towel, however, which has already led to a dependence on imports in the field of fruit, vegetables and feeding-stuff production.
Since EU accession, over 50% of Austrian farmers have given up their businesses; that is, ceased milk production.
Thus we are rapidly approaching the point at which our self-sufficiency in fresh milk and fresh-milk products is under threat.
