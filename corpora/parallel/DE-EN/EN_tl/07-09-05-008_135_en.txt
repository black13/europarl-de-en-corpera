Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution, as I believe there comes a time when we need to review this measure and assess whether it is really appropriate and effective.
If it is not effective, we will abolish it; if it is only partially effective and appropriate, it will have to be modified accordingly.
At all events, however, we should be working towards standardising implementation - that is, ensuring uniformity of checks - so as to put an end once and for all the vexation we are currently experiencing at airports.
