President-in-Office, I should like to be more specific.
The idea of Frontex is excellent, but the implementation is poor.
One reason for this is that the Member States are not providing the staff or equipment they have promised.
Mr Frattini has found that only 10% has been provided.
I should like you to tell me - and Parliament - how many of the staff and which technical equipment promised by which Member States has actually been supplied to date and what is still outstanding, and what action you envisage to ensure that all Member States finally provide what they have promised, to enable Frontex to function all year round.
