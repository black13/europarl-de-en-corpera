I should be interested to hear whether the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises has been considered - after all, these make a substantial contribution to employment in Europe.
I should also like to know the extent to which - as has been seen in the United States - female employment, in particular, has added measures to the Lisbon agenda.
Has the Council taken any relevant precautions to integrate workers accordingly?
