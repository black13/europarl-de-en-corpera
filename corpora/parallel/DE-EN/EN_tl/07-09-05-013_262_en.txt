I was concerned less with the regulation and more with the vision.
In 1998 I presented a report in this House on enlargement and internal security in which I proposed a European border service.
The Tampere Summit addressed this idea, along with that of a European Police College.
Frontex was created as an initial step in that direction.
Does the Council Presidency share the vision of further developing Frontex and the battle groups into a real European border service for the common protection of our external borders?
