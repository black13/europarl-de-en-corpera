Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for her report.
I am pleased that she has taken such full account of the recommendation I made in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
Particular attention needs to be paid to the role of women in human rights dialogues with third countries where their health and safety is concerned.
Human rights include the right of women to make decisions concerning their lives and reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.
Sadly, human rights dialogues still take insufficient account of this.
