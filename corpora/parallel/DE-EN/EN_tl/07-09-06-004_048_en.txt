Mrs Frassoni, I can tell you that there was nothing dramatic about it at all.
I was asked during a press interview to state my views on some of the issues that you have mentioned, and in this press interview I said that we should always consider the principle of solidarity very carefully before we take measures at European Union level.
I did not discuss the matter any further.
(Applause)
