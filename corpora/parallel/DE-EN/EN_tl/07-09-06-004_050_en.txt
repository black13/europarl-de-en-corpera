Mr Cappato, we have discussed other issues as well where you have particular concerns.
The point here is to air some general principles.
We have not discussed any details at all.
My recommendation is not to get so hung up on the issue.
Incidentally, no one will defend European law as resolutely as I do.
For me, European law is always the benchmark.
So I would like to leave it there for now.
