author. - Mr President, this afternoon we are discussing three states - Burma, Sierra Leone and Bangladesh - which count among the poorest in the world, although that really applies to their populations, not the states themselves.
The reason, of course, lies in the lack of democracy - although the situation in the three countries of course varies considerably in this respect - and in the exploitation of the population and, above all, the human rights abuses of every kind.
The contents of the recitals in this first resolution on Burma are especially shocking.
Indeed, they are horrific and, for us as privileged Europeans, they should be a wake-up call.
The abuses inflicted by this military regime on individuals, and especially on the various minorities - I would like to mention the Karen people in particular here - are hair-raising.
We cannot simply look away.
I would like to add something that is not really highlighted in this motion.
The Greens are very pleased to support the contents of this motion because it is entirely justified in social policy terms and from a human rights perspective.
However, I believe that the environmental disasters resulting from this military regime should also be emphasised rather more forcefully.
I would like to give you an example: there are plans to build a massive dam, which will result in 10 million people - just think about that for a moment - having to be resettled.
The activities of this military regime can only be countered by the most stringent joint measures by the EU, the UN and the nations of the world.
