author. - Mr President, West Africa was once known as a region where there was a great deal of positive development.
Today Sierra Leone has become a synonym for the particular horrors which we have witnessed across Africa over these past few years.
We therefore have a responsibility to ensure that the forthcoming elections not only help to restore democracy but also, and far more importantly, restore justice and the rule of law.
This must include the prosecution of the massive crimes that have taken place in this country.
After all, Europeans were among those who used Mr Taylor as a means by which to enrich themselves from, and in, Sierra Leone.
That is why I believe that the process of dealing with these crimes cannot be allowed to fail due to a lack of funds.
We Europeans have a responsibility in that regard, but I nonetheless believe that the questions that have been raised here are justified.
It is apparent that we will not make progress in the long term with ad hoc tribunals.
It is apparent that what we need in the long term is a single universal jurisdiction to deal with these criminal dictators.
However, that does not help us at the moment.
The first task now is to press ahead with the trials that have already begun and, in particular, to press ahead with securing the conviction of Mr Taylor, for that will send out a warning signal to criminals who are committing crimes against humanity today or who may do so in future: I would mention Zimbabwe's dictator, Mr Mugabe, in this context.
Mr Mugabe must be shown what could happen to him if he continues with his horrendous crimes.
That is why we need uniform criteria and stable institutions to deal with these massive crimes.
