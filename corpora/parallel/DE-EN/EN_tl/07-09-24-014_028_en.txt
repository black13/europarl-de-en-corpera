Mr President, naturally we discussed this idea at length in our Group too.
We felt that this particular moment, with demonstrations happening on the ground, is perhaps not the right time for us - to put it rather colloquially - to put in our three ha'p'orth and express our view.
Our view in this connection is quite clear.
If, however, that is the wish of the House and it is also made clear that we are of course on the side of the demonstrators, as we have always said, then we could agree a compromise to the effect that we are in favour of a debate, as proposed, but will not table a resolution at this point, which does not preclude the possibility that next time, when we know how things stand, we also adopt a resolution.
My request, at least, is that we hold separate votes on whether to hold a debate and whether to table a resolution.
