Thank you, Mr Swoboda.
That is precisely what I would like to propose.
First we vote on whether to hold a debate.
If we vote in favour of a debate, we then come to the question of whether to table a resolution.
That is a logical and conclusive procedure.
Can we follow that procedure?
(Parliament approved the proposal)
