Mr President, we did not know that the Liberal Group might want a resolution and, if so, that it would not be tabled until the next part-session.
That is a new situation.
We can all live with it.
That is why the proposal from the Liberal Group that you should now put to the vote is, if I understand it correctly, as follows: if the Groups agree to draft a resolution, it should be tabled during the next part-session.
That does not exactly mean that we have already reached agreement; it does mean, however, that if we do agree among ourselves, the resolution would be tabled during the next part-session.
We can all accept that.
