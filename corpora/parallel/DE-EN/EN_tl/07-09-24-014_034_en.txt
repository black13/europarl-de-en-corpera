Mr President, of course we need a European Parliament resolution on this issue.
We have drafted resolutions, some of them lengthy, on many other occasions and in some cases we could not have claimed quite the same urgency.
Here we have a very concrete reason, here we have a very significant change in the situation of this country, which we have been observing for a long time.
It has already been pointed out that the leader of the opposition, who has been under house arrest for many years, has been awarded our Sakharov Prize but has not yet received it.
That is why we must react to these new developments with a resolution.
Yet there is no urgent need to do so this Wednesday.
We will be holding the debate on Wednesday and I would propose that we vote on a resolution at the following sitting.
