Mr President, I would like to say something about why we should decide now on a resolution.
Basically I do not understand this debate.
Everyone clapped when the President took a clear stand.
What the President said can surely be incorporated into a resolution that Parliament could adopt as early as this Thursday.
What is so difficult about condemning what is currently happening in Burma?
Where is the problem?
Who needs 10 or 20 days to say: we are on the side of those who are fighting for freedom in Burma, full stop!
It would take 10 lines!
If the Social Democrats or the EPP-ED cannot manage it, we will draft it for them.
