We have already decided in favour of a resolution.
Shall we draft the resolution this week?
(Parliament approved the request)
I propose beginning Question Time not at 5.30 p.m. but at 6 p.m. to give us more time for the debate, while allocating the usual hour and a half to Question Time, i.e. from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)

No changes
Sitting on 10 and 11 October
Wednesday:
The Social Democratic Group has requested postponing the joint debate on the reports by Mrs Bowles and Mrs van den Burg on Community statistics to the October part-session in Strasbourg.
