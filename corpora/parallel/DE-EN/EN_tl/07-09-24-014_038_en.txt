Mr President, we are requesting the postponement for the following reasons.
It should be possible for us to reach agreement with the Council at the first reading.
If, however, we held the debate as early as 10 October, it might not prove possible.
That is why we should postpone it.
I believe the rapporteur also agrees with this proposal.
