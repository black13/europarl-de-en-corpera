Mr President, Angela Merkel received the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery yesterday.
In the context of its strategy of isolating the Dalai Lama on the international stage, China requested Mrs Merkel not to meet him.
On several other occasions in the past, Beijing has called on the Federal Government to refuse him entry.
That shameless interference is all the more remarkable when we remember that next year China wants to play the gracious host of the Olympic Games.
We have seen this kind of brazen attempt to exert pressure in relation not only to the Tibetan people but to human rights in general.
That is why I support the Chinese candidate for this year's Sakharov Prize.
I seriously wonder what else we can expect in the year to come and what more needs to happen before Europe stops all too casually selling its system of values in return for economic interests.
That makes Mrs Merkel's action yesterday all the more encouraging!
(Applause)
