Mr Wojciechowski, since you have addressed me personally, let me say to you that the principles of the European Union are based on discussing things together, conducting a dialogue.
In my speech I spoke of reconciliation, and nobody in Poland could criticise a single sentence of my speech because it was a speech about reconciliation and your views are also represented.
I must tell you that I do not understand how you can criticise the fact of talking with people and endeavouring to convince.
I ask you to be fair and to do your part in bringing about reconciliation in Europe!
(Applause)
