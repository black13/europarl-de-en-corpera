Mr President, specifically on a point of order, I am sorry that you responded in person just now.
I can understand that but I find it absolutely intolerable for the President of this Chamber to have to defend himself in person against such an unreasonable and inappropriate attack.
That is why I say this - and I hope I am speaking on behalf of all sensible Members of this House: both in this speech and in other, earlier speeches you have upheld the dignity of this House in an outstanding manner and defended the basic values of the European Union with dignity in every respect.
I thank you for that, and also for your speech in Poland!
(Applause)
