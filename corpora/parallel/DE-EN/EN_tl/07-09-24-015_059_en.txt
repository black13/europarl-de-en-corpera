Mr President, I would ask Members to take note of what this item on the agenda is actually about.
If Mr Schulz feels he has to comment on every second or third speech, that is his problem.
But if he is interested in having a real debate here, then I would be pleased if he would support our Group's request to hold a debate on this subject in this House at the earliest opportunity.
