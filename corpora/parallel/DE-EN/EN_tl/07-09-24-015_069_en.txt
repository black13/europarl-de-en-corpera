Mr President, like my colleague and friend Milan Horáček I wanted to address an event that occurred yesterday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was the first German Head of Government to receive the Dalai Lama, in Berlin.
She has stood firm against all the verbal attacks and disparaging personal remarks made by the Chinese.
She has repeated that she is prepared to support the Tibetan people in their aspiration towards cultural and religious identity and desire to achieve genuine autonomy.
Our European Parliament, which is the voice of human rights throughout the world, also endorses the non-violent approach the Dalai Lama has consistently followed.
Let yesterday's event set an example throughout the European Union.
It should encourage our Member State governments never to give in to China, not even under economic and political pressure.
(Applause)
