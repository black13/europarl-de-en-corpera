Mr President, let me begin by warmly congratulating Mrs Thomsen on her very good and comprehensive report.
This report, which I hope will be adopted by a large majority, follows the tradition of this House of urging the Council and the Commission to promote renewables.
Let me briefly address the central issue that will come up in the next few weeks when the Commission presents its draft directive.
The key question is security of investment.
We need investment if we are to reach the 20% target.
We must look at when and where investment has proved successful over the past six or eight years.
There are two systems in Europe: the system of guaranteed input prices and the system of green certificates.
A total of 90% of all renewable energies apart from large-scale hydropower were produced under the system of guaranteed input prices.
They were produced more cheaply than under the system of green certificates and, most importantly, this made it possible to introduce new players into the electricity market.
Those figures all come from the Commission's last report dating from December 2006.
I am rather shocked by what I am hearing now.
There is information that a majority in the Commission will probably be in favour of abolishing this good system and introducing a trading system with green certificates.
I must seriously warn the Commissioner against adopting that strategy, which would benefit only major, dominant energy firms such as E.ON, RWE, EDF and others, because it would lead to investment uncertainty and make other players reluctant to invest in future.
You will be judged on whether there is local investment, which should be on the basis of a comprehensively guaranteed security and not the kind of haphazard mechanism of green certificates.
