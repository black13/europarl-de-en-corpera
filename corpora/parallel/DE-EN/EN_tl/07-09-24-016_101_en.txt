Mr President, Commissioner Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, as we speak the Kyoto targets are being discussed in Washington and I believe the UN is right to discuss these global targets and to set targets as part of a top-down strategy, as well as creating the necessary instruments.
We believe it is important for us to concentrate on the bottom-up strategy, namely the Lisbon Agenda, and we should seek to ensure that employment and growth are achieved mainly through energy efficiency targets.
We have new objectives for various trades here.
We can produce a real economic impetus and a win-win situation through insulation and many other energy-improvement measures.
I believe that in terms also of security of supply it is important to focus on renewables.
Renewable energy, which is growing in our latitudes, is a secure source that is available to us at all times.
We should ensure that we really do achieve the target of renewables accounting for 20% of our final energy consumption by the year 2020.
We need EU-wide criteria for support measures, for incentives, for subsidies, for taxes, for the whole financial framework that we need to set up here.
That is a challenge and I think it is one that Commissioner Kov√°cs also faces.
Secondly, we need transparent and fair network access.
We need the 'must-carry principle' and we should consider penal charges for non-transport in this case.
We need harmonised planning procedures with a one-stop mechanism under which authorisation procedures can be concluded within a given period, i.e. a maximum of three years, to ensure that energy production is available at the right time.
We also need to safeguard the consumers' right to order 100% of renewables from their suppliers and therefore to have secure energy supplies for decades to come.
Nuclear energy is not a renewable energy, which is why I would ask for it to be dealt with in a separate report.
