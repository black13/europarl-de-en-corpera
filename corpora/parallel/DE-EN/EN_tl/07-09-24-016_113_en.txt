Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy supplies are becoming an increasingly serious challenge, not just for the European Union but worldwide.
In that context the use of renewable energy sources is crucial, both to ensure security of supplies in future and to make a decisive contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
We must support and promote innovation.
We must also invest more in research and development of new technologies, whether in the field of transport - e.g. research into new fuels or the construction of new engines - or in the field of the thermal or energy-based use of resources such as heating, electricity production, insulating materials and so on.
One good example is combined electricity-heat production from biomass by power-heat coupling, which is also being used increasingly in Austria.
Another key aspect is energy saving.
Regional, decentralised concepts are also of crucial importance.
We must use the opportunity offered by the decentralised production of energy and biofuels from renewables because it can also produce sustainable energy and use raw materials that are available on the ground.
The use of agricultural products to produce energy will certainly not prevent the production of adequate food supplies, since enough productive farmland is available and that land can also be used adequately.
The suspension of set-aside in the 2008 financial year is, therefore, really welcome.
Furthermore, the use of renewable raw materials can contribute substantially to the economic development of rural areas because of its positive impact not only on land use during normal crop rotation but also, in particular, on employment and the creation of new jobs in rural areas.
