in writing. - Renewables must play a significant role in our future energy policy.
Nuclear energy must not play a part in this scenario because unresolved safety problems still remain.
Renewables are our future.
For that we need innovation and the development of new technologies.
We need far more investment in research so that we can bring innovative solutions in all areas onto the market.
In March the European Council agreed to cover 20% of the EU's total energy demand through renewables by the year 2020.
In so doing, the Heads of State and Government took an important step and spoke out clearly in favour of giving more support to renewable energy sources.
That is why I call on the Commission to submit a forward-looking proposal for a legal framework for renewables.
It is crucial for us to have the appropriate instruments available at European level in order to achieve the Council's targets rapidly and efficiently.
