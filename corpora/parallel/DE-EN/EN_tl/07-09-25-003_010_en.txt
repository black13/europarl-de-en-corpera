Mr President, I refer to yesterday's plenary session and the one-minute speeches that took place at the start of the plenary session.
During those one-minute speeches there was an incident.
A Polish Member (I do not know which Group he belongs to) criticised our President in an improper manner in this House.
I defended the President of our House, as I thought was necessary.
I had the impression that many colleagues in this House saw things the way I did.
As a result my fellow Member, Markus Ferber, later threw a comment in my direction, the gist of which meant that I assume the right in this House to make comments on everything, which is definitely not the case.
I regret that I do not have the right to do this, but I do not comment on everything.
As a result I insulted Mr Ferber in the generally fevered situation with two German expressions, which I would not like to repeat here and which are not true either.
I therefore take it back, expressing my regret and would be grateful if you would convey to my fellow Member, Mr Ferber, that he should accept my apology and that I otherwise regard him as a very amusing fellow Member.
(Applause)
