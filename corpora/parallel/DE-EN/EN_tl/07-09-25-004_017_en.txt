on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give a brief review of the last reform.
Many sugar beet growers are asking why a reform of this market regulation, which has stood the test of time over decades, is necessary at all.
There are two main reasons why this reform was and is necessary.
Firstly, it was decided a few years ago, in the wake of the arms initiative, that as from 2009 everything except arms may be supplied to Europe from the poorest countries.
The sugar sector is also affected by this.
The second reason is that there is a WTO decision and we have to remove surpluses.
This means that we have to take more than 6 million tonnes of sugar out of production.
Commissioner, we put forward proposals to Parliament in 2005 and you have just said that the restructuring fund did not fulfil our expectations.
Today I would like to say here that if the Commission and Council had followed Parliament's proposals more closely in 2005, greater volumes of sugar would probably have been renounced voluntarily.
We now have the opportunity to make corrections so that incentives are improved.
I can only ask the Commission and Council to follow the proposals.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, for the report she has submitted.
The Agriculture Committee has largely followed these proposals - with minor corrections - and I am convinced that if the Commission follows these proposals, incentives will be increased to such an extent that much larger volumes of sugar will be renounced voluntarily.
I should like to state, Commissioner, that there are many members of the Agriculture Committee who have listened closely to the sugar beet producers.
If the requirements set out here are met, I believe that this reform will be successful.
