on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the sugar market regulation is not a showpiece of the Commission and Council!
Mr De√ü has already said that if you had listened a little more to Parliament's proposals, some of the glitches would not have occurred.
When we have an instrument like the quota, we must use it and not threaten it for 2010, and then we must make flat-rate or staggered reductions and provide compensation for these.
Your way of doing this through pricing came to grief because you then increased the quota by a million tonnes in one go by converting C sugar into quota sugar.
Furthermore, financing by consumers by means of pricing has meant that the sugar industry has had no interest in restructuring.
Export subsidies have not been radically reduced.
This too would have been required.
The errors should be specified and they are not being corrected now either.
The restructuring fund and restructuring aid are essentially discontinuations.
The regions, trade unions and growers are against them.
No diversification has been adopted, as Parliament demanded, in order to safeguard the regions' socio-ecological development.
Nor are all these errors now being corrected.
We are therefore remedying the wrong symptoms.
Another important point is that you now want to limit restructuring aid going to growers to 10%.
It used to be that countries could fix a higher price.
We are putting forward another proposal here and I hope that Parliament will implement it this time with the referral instrument, because you have not honoured the promises you made to us at the last vote, but have now gone back on them.
