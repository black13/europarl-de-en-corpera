on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, inspections and a forest of new symbols - this completely misses the heart of the problem!
Inspections are good, laws are even better!
We do not need more pseudo-safety, or more pseudo-political action for the sake of action, but better laws and better standards.
CMR substances, carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic substances have still not been removed from children's toys.
Toys should not become toxic traps for children.
Poison does not belong in children's hands, even in minute quantities.
Mr Verheugen, I find it intolerable how you absolve your own failure by scolding producers and consumers.
We know that the legal basis, the Toys Directive, has not offered children any protection from toxic toys for years.
The Commission knows this.
You can glean from your own report of 2004 that you get a resounding slap in the face there.
It states in black and white that the Toys Directive has failed.
We have been sending reminders on the revision of the directive since 2001 and they have repeatedly been shelved.
It is not true to say that lead is banned in toys.
Lead per se is simply not banned under the Toys Directive!
Or can the Commission explain to us perhaps why it has not initiated any legal product recall campaign, and why it was a voluntary product recall campaign by the toy manufacturers?
We should no longer therefore be leading the consumer to believe that we have got the problem under control.
We need better protection.
This must quite clearly mean that we have to change the foundation and replace absent standards with clear laws and bans.
It is downright absurd that carcinogenic substances are allowed to get into the hands of children.
Better controls are therefore of no help to us at all here.
Right now, then, we have to tighten up the laws and then carry out better controls.
We should not have our children poisoned while they play!
