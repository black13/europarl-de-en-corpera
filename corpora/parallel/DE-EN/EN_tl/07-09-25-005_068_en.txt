Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen has said that the subject occupying us today is primarily a problem of failure to comply with existing laws.
This is partly true.
We as the European Parliament should not neglect sending a clear message to the Member States that we cannot demand increasingly strict European laws and then not take enough money at home to guarantee their implementation.
It has also been stated, however, that we ought to apply the strictest standards of all in the toy sector.
This is where the Toy Safety Directive, which has been in existence for a long time, needs to be revised.
When this directive is revised, I am expecting a clear stance to the effect that the strictest standards of all will be applied and chemicals classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction will be banned.
Today I hope that we in the European Parliament will hold to this position in the decisions we make.
Not only does this discussion about toys provide evidence that CE labelling is misleading, but also the many discussions at home with our citizens do so too.
As I see it, we are hoping for either an indication of origin or at least a certain level of quality.
I think that as part of the revision we should rethink how we can mislead our citizens less.
I would say straightaway that I cannot quite understand voluntary safety labelling either.
In Europe and the European Union we have to become better at conformity, but it makes no sense to develop specific labelling as a reward for the fact that we have been complying with the existing laws for a long time.
I am very sceptical about this and I think that it is more important to focus on monitoring the implementation of strict rules.
