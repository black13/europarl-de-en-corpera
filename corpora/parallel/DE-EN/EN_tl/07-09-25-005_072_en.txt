Mr President, first of all, thank you to both Vice-President Verheugen and Commissioner Kuneva for being here and enhancing the debate.
If commercial and economic policy has a truly important task, it is where the safety of our children is concerned.
Children's toys have become increasingly inexpensive in recent decades and the cheaper the toy, the greater the likelihood that it was not produced in the EU.
I have to say even as a Liberal that there is justifiable doubt that parents always know best what is good for their children when buying toys.
The range is colossal and unmanageable.
Quality toys produced in Europe such as Lego, Playmobil, MÃ¤rklin, Brio wooden trains or Wader plastic toys are also correspondingly expensive.
Competition needs people who can and want to take responsibility.
Anyone who buys their children the cheapest junk toys untested does not want this responsibility!
We also have to consider whether the Commission should launch an information campaign for parents like these.
Yes, I am in favour of free trade, but not at any price!
As Europeans, we have certain standards, and - this has been repeatedly addressed here - we have to implement them in a clearer way.
At this point I should like to highlight once again the 'Made in ...' campaign.
Following the current events, it may be time to introduce a mandatory designation of origin, at least for toys.
I know Commissioner Kuneva's efforts on this issue and can only encourage her in them.
The label on the product must be sufficiently large.
Even though we are not in a position to change production conditions in China, this would at least educate citizens about this to a sufficient level.
