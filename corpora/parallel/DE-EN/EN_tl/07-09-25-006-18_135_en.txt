Mr President, on behalf of our Group I would like to request referral back to the Committee in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The reason is that we have just agreed on a 25% investment by the sugar beet growers in the restructuring fund, but the Commission is insisting on 10%.
In the latest version the Member States were able to go beyond this.
This too has now been abolished.
We were already considering on the last occasion whether we ought to be asking for referral back to the Committee at this point and therefore allowed ourselves to be satisfied with 10%.
We ought not to be doing so once again!
Our only opportunity - because we are in a consultation procedure - to get into discussion with the Commission, is to refer the report back now and to negotiate with the Commission and Council.
