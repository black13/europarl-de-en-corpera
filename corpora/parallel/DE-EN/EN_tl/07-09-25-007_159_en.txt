Mr President, I abstained from voting on the Jarzembowski report since high-speed routes in Europe have been extended in recent years, mainly between major cities, and shorter routes have been most appallingly neglected, despite the fact that 90% of journeys are made on shorter routes.
On the one hand, Brussels is demanding that people become more mobile, and is wanting to shift traffic from road to rail, but on the other hand it is trying to bring into play precisely the opposite development with the magic formula of privatisation.
The EU needs to ensure that common standards and systems facilitate cross-border rail travel and important projects are promoted within the arterial roads.
In the end, however, it must understand that private investors do not have the welfare of the country and its people in mind, but ultimately only their profits and returns on their investment.
