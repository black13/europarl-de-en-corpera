in writing. - I am voting for liberalisation of international transport as from 2010.
Two years after the law comes into force at the latest, the European Commission should examine the impact of the directive and discussion on opening it up further will then take place.
Competition will thus be allowed to a limited extent and national suppliers will not be at risk.
I am relieved that the European Parliament has argued against the automatic liberalisation of national rail transport in 2017.
