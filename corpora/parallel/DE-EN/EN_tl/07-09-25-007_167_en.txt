in writing. - I am voting for a standard driving licence for train drivers.
The harmonisation of training for drivers will also ensure greater safety in future on the railways.
A minimum age of 20 and an appropriate school education and language training are now compulsory as conditions for being allowed to work as a train driver in international rail transport.
The standardisation of training is key to a European rail network.
The driving licence issued in a Member State will be recognised in future by all the other Member States.
