in writing. - I am voting for a new passenger regulation as from 2009.
Among other things, the regulation governs compensation for major delays, companies' liability for passengers and their luggage, transport of disabled people and the information to be supplied by the rail companies.
In practical terms this means that, in the future, when there is a delay in cross-border transport of between 60 and 119 minutes, customers will be entitled to a refund of 25 % of the fare.
This rises to 50% for delays of more than two hours.
This does means more legal claims, but also greater certainty for rail customers.
It is now also up to the Member States to extend these rules to their national transport networks as soon as possible and not just after 15 years.
