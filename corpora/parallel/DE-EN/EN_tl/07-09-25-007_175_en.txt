in writing. - Liberalisation of railways is not an end in itself; it must serve users and improve efficiency.
Liberalisation in international transport is a natural thing because no one country should be able to close itself off from another.
In national transport there can be no sense and no purpose in exposing the profitable lines to competition during liberalisation, whilst at the same time leaving the unprofitable lines to the public sector, with no compensation.
With this in mind, I am anxiously awaiting the application of the recently adopted regulation on public passenger transport.
Parliament was able to stand up to the Member States and the rail companies for the rights of passengers, which is a huge success for the citizens of the EU.
Particularly in transit countries like Belgium, a difference between international and national passengers would make no sense and would be unfair.
In this sense, the third railways package represents a step in the right direction, even though it will certainly not be the last.
