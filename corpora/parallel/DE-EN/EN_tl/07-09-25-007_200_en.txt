in writing. - Even though the promotion of renewable energy is important, this should not be a pretext in relation to the EU Constitution for reducing even further the sovereign rights of Member States by the back door.
Since this point has unfortunately not found its way into the present report, and no clarification has been made, I must therefore reject the present report.
Concentration on expensive nuclear power plants has obstructed the development of other energy technologies for far too long.
The nuclear research budget is still seven to eight times higher compared with funds for renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.
If the EU really is serious about renewable energy sources with its roadmap, it must provide a fairer distribution of subsidies here, but there is no indication of this in the report on which we are voting either.
