Madam President, I would like to make a personal comment on the basis of Article 145.
The Polish Member, who has spoken as a representative of the UEN Group, has completely misquoted me in a comment on my speech and I would like to put it straight.
I asked the Council how long it would continue to put up with this attitude of the Polish President, Mr Kaczyński.
I had quoted Mr Kaczyński, who very much wants a better atmosphere to make the re-introduction of the death penalty in Europe possible.
My question to the Council was therefore: how long will the Council continue to put up with this?
How long will the 26 other governments continue to remain silent on this?
I have not presumed in any of what I have said to decide (how could I?) how long Mr Kaczyński will continue as President of Poland.
It is an absolute sovereign right of the Polish people to elect their government and President.
I do, however, implore the Polish people to be so wise as to put this government out of office as quickly as possible!
