Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the report.
You write here that you want to promote alternatives to the car, namely travel by bus, rail, cycling and walking.
However, you also know that 95% of EU cofinancing, which the cities are asking for, goes solely to road transport.
You are therefore considering whether you should say that at least 50% must in future go to these alternatives, because my home city of Berlin argues, for example, that EU funds should not be spent on local public transport.
I think that is mad!
If you do not change the funding, you will never be successful.
Therefore, how do you want to ensure that the EU's alternatives can be considered in future?
