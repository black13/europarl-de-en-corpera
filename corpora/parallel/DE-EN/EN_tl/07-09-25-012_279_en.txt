Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I very much approve of some of the things you have mentioned.
You have highlighted the upgrading of public transport, greater road safety, and environmental aspects in driver training and satellite navigation.
All this is associated with certain problems - it costs a lot of money.
Mr Cramer has already demonstrated one form of concerted action.
I should like to put forward a second, which has not yet been mentioned.
We have the miracle cure in our hands.
We have the internalisation of external costs in front of us.
We hear that this method of calculation is ready and aspects of urban transport that cannot otherwise be paid for could be subsidised and paid for by comprehensive internalisation of external costs.
Two questions on this: when can we realistically expect the presentation of a preliminary model, which we can subsequently expand and enlarge?
Can you also envisage using this money for similar projects?
