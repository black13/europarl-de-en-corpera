Commissioner, without wanting to offend the Commission or the Court of Justice, I have the feeling that neither our judges nor our Commissioners, or the female members of the Commission, are seen very often at a football ground.
If they were there more often, they would notice that we are currently at the start of the European Cup season, in which we have teams playing against each other in which often just one member at any one time is a member of the national squad.
We have therefore witnessed the nurturing of new blood being totally neglected and we attribute an exclusively economic dimension to it all.
Football is more than an internal market, and football is not merely competition in the legal sense.
Football is a sports competition between national, regional and local teams.
Something needs to happen here, and fast.
Can the Commission promise that something really is happening apart from studies being undertaken?
