Commissioner, what has just been mentioned is a problem.
A second problem apparently is that due to the increased use of biofuels, prices of staple foods are beginning to increase, particularly in countries where this really can become a problem and many people, particularly in these countries, are no longer able to afford their staple foods.
Are you aware of this problem?
If so, what are your thoughts on it and what is being done about it?
