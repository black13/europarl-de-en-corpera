Member of the Commission. - The main reason for the current price increases for food is rising demand, particularly in China, India and also in other states.
That is the main reason for the price increases.
My colleague, who will take the floor after me, will explain what measures we need to take.
It is clear that we have to produce more because demand also has to be covered.
As far as biofuels are concerned, their influence on food prices is very marginal at present because consumption of biofuels globally is still low.
We do, of course, have to take account of this because a great deal of maize is currently being produced for biofuels in the United States.
This can influence a certain sector, but there are ways to continue to meet rising demand.
I am of the view that we in the Commission have to find an answer to world market prices.
My colleague has already prepared some proposals on this.
