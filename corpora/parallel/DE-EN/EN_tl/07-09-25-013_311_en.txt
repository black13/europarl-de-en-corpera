I do understand that we have to deal with these negotiations on quota prices etc., but what I do not see here is the negotiation or dissemination of what Europe represents, the dissemination of our way of life.
Madam Commissioner, the question for me is whether you are entering into these negotiations and saying: we do not want any products that have been made by children!
We do not want any products that have been made by forced or slave labour!
We do not want any products that have not been produced in compliance with core labour standards!
Is this the issue and are you making an issue out of it?
