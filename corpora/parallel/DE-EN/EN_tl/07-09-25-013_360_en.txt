Commissioner, the historical credit for setting in motion what Mr Kohl and Mr Mitterrand had decided to do back in 1982, and which is now finally becoming reality, goes to you.
I have two brief questions.
Firstly, the Strasbourg-Kehl-Appenweier and the Munich-MÃ¼hldorf-Salzburg cross-border projects are also highly complex.
Is there any news on these?
Secondly: can you perhaps appeal once more to the rail companies - when we are already deploying so many European funds for cross-border routes - and ask them to stop cutting back cross-border train connections?
We are expanding the railways with our money at the same time as the rail companies are hacking transport routing to pieces with national timetables.
