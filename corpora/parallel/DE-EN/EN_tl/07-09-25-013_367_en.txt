Madam President, please allow me to speak on the Rules of Procedure.
I have been talking with my colleague, Mrs Madeira, and have also, of course, listened to the Commissioner's answers.
We have been asking our questions now for about three years and have not managed to get an oral answer to a single question.
Of course the written answer is also very detailed and correct, but it is easier to ask and make inquiries verbally and it makes the result even more interesting still.
Do you have any advice or guidance as to how this could perhaps be achieved in future?
