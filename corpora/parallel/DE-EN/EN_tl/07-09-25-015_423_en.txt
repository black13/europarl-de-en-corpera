Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, for the opportunity to work with him well and to be able to reach a compromise.
One of these compromises has just been mentioned and concerns those responsible for a foreign policy on energy.
I know this is a difficult field, not without controversy, and the Commissioner will still have to do a great deal more work on it.
If it comes to it, not only will the foreign affairs politicians need to be involved, but also the Commission's energy politicians.
One important aim of our foreign policy on energy is diversification.
This does not mean that we want to take action against those countries from which we obtain crude oil or natural gas, but we do want to tap other sources.
Even Russia is trying to gain access to sources in order to supply crude oil or natural gas to Europe.
It is our legitimate right to try to gain this sort of access as well.
In addition, the question of reciprocity is an important aspect in relation to Russia.
For our Group this does not entail a policy vis-Ã -vis Russia, but a policy of equal rights.
If Russia is opening up its markets, we shall do so too.
But we cannot be asked to open everything up while Russia is closing everything down.
It makes no sense for us.
The final point I would like to mention is a very difficult matter, also included in the amendment, and that is the relationship between energy policy and human rights policy.
When I was in Azerbaijan for a short time with my colleagues, we did discuss this.
Unfortunately, most of our sources of supply are in countries where the issue of human rights is not the top priority.
This cannot lead us to say we will not source any more energy from these countries.
But it must mean - if we want to remain credible - that we will do both: energy policy, but also human rights policy, and improving the human rights situation in these countries.
It cannot mean that we say 'we are sourcing energy; nothing else is of interest to us'.
We must offer a parallel strategy.
This is the only credible thing to do.
