Madam President, first of all I would like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski.
You can see by the very high attendance at this late hour how important the report is and you can also hear how emotionally charged the atmosphere is as we listen to the various contributions from different nationalities and groups.
It is therefore a compliment that the paper has actually been written and adopted.
As rapporteur for trade and economic relations between the EU and Russia, I would like to raise two aspects and then make a general comment.
The first aspect concerns the bilateral energy agreements.
If I read it correctly, the Saryusz-Wolski report is 'towards a common European foreign policy on energy'.
In other words, this common foreign policy on energy does not yet exist.
While it still does not exist, it must therefore be possible to find other ways to talk about energy.
The Member States are able effectively to agree among themselves - this is highly desirable, it is not a chore.
It is not possible to impose a veto on bilateral agreements.
It is a credit to the rapporteur's realism - because I know that he wanted something else - that he has written this in his report in this way.
My second point: combining the energy charter with Russia's WTO membership.
Linking ratification of the energy charter with accession to the WTO is a backward step.
It is also advantageous for the EU if Russia is a member of the WTO.
Moreover, we are not able to make a decision on this alone.
The rapporteur's report in favour of the common energy policy leans towards Russia, but this is simply consistent with the situation today.
