Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good that it has finally been recognised that it is not just about joint efforts to combat illegal migration but that comprehensive strategies are also required to manage and coordinate legal migration on a joint basis, especially in a Europe without borders.
However, this cannot only be the task of the Home Affairs Ministers, who quickly reach agreement on measures to deal with illegal migrants; it is a task for the Ministers of Employment and Social Affairs as well.
I therefore welcome the initiative of the Council and Commission to involve the relevant specialised ministries, including our Vice-Chancellor, Mr MÃ¼ntefering, for example.
The fact is that legal migration always means immigration into the labour market and therefore into the social security systems as well.
However, we must also combat the causes of migration more intensively and the reasons prompting so many people to seek a remedy to their situation by fleeing from their desolate countries.
We must create legal employment opportunities.
The 'Blue Card' and circular migration are an initial step in the right direction.
I have one comment about Frontex as well: what some Member States are doing here is scandalous.
The solidarity which is always demanded must apply to all EU countries, not just to a few, and the refugees must, in my view, be allocated among all the Member States according to a formula, which has yet to be decided.
It cannot just be a matter for Malta or the Canary Islands or Greece.
Ultimately, Frontex can only be as good as Member States permit.
I would like to made a peripheral comment on Frontex: Frontex always takes the names of its operations from Greek mythology; Nautilus is one example.
However, one forthcoming operation is called Hydra.
This seems to me to be in poor taste.
In my view, the name of the operation should be changed, for anyone with any knowledge of Greek mythology knows what Hydra means.
(Applause)
