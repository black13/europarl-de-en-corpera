in writing. - In my view, the decision to retain the idea of an EIT is a mistake.
None of the arguments presented is convincing as they start from false premises.
1.
Even the original idea put forward by Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, to launch the EIT as a European response to America's MIT ignored reality, and the proposal presented for the vote today further worsens the original concept.
MIT evolved with a great deal of money and diverse support, and in Europe numerous 'mini-MITs' are already carrying out world-class research.
Europe's dilemma is the inadequate financial and moral support for innovation and top-class research.
2.
The proposed EUR 309 million in funding from a reserve budgetary source blocks other parliamentary initiatives such as the strategically important Galileo project.
The funding proposal amounts to just an eighth of the estimated budget and therefore does not offer any incentive for serious additional private initiatives.
BP has invested USD 500 million in the biofuels sector in Berkeley in the United States alone.
3) With its own generous sources of funding and grants to the top-class European institutes already in existence, the EIT would have a prospect of success.
For example, the EU could follow the Canadian model and set up an innovation fund financed from monies left in the EU budget at the end of the year.
4.
The planned network infrastructure is a virtual supranational institution without any real significance in the European and international research landscape.
It is an unhappy and bureaucratic compromise.
I have therefore voted against the proposal.
