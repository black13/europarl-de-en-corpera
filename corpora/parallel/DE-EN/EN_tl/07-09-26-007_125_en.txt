Mr President, the ending of set-aside is absolutely the right course of action for us to pursue.
The demand for food and feedingstuffs as well as for renewable raw materials is constantly growing, and it is therefore absolutely essential to have these areas in production.
Set-aside was a measure which farmers never wanted but which they had to go along with because it was necessary.
Farmers want to produce!
I hope that the abolition of set-aside will not only apply for one or two years but on a permanent basis.
It also gives the agricultural sector the opportunity to make its contribution to the EU's ambitious targets for the reduction of its CO2 emissions.
