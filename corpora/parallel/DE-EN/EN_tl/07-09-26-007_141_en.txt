in writing. - Today's resolution underlines the urgent need for the revision of the Toys Directive.
CMRs - in other words, substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction - must be banned under the new Toys Directive.
Commissioner Verheugen endorsed this demand during yesterday's debate.
It will also be necessary to end the confusion over the CE marking.
European consumers assume this marking either to be a statement about product origin or a seal of quality, neither of which is denoted by the CE marking.
