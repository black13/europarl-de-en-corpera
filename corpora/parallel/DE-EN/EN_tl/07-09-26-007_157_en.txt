Mr President, I voted in favour of the report because it was made clear in Parliament that it will remain a matter for Member States to decide which and how many labour migrants will be accepted into their sovereign territory.
If the 'Blue Card' is introduced, it is important to ensure that it is applied as a control instrument for highly skilled workers residing in the EU, allowing temporary - not permanent - residence in the European Union as a whole.
I would like to address a proposal to Commissioner Frattini - who unfortunately is no longer present - from the European People's Party: that the 'Blue Card' be marked with an additional national symbol, such as the flag, so that it is apparent which of the Member States has issued the work and residence permit.
