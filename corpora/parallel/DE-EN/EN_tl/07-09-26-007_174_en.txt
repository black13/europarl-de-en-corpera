Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because the European Parliament has agreed a comprehensive strategy here to combat human trafficking and illegal immigration.
As the European Parliament, we have thus sent out a clear message that 'illegal' means the same as 'not legal' and must be dealt with accordingly.
In my view, it is particularly important to have clarified that there will be no quota-based allocation of illegal immigrants across all Member States and that mass legalisations of the type witnessed in recent years will no longer be permissible.
This ensures that there is no 'pull effect' and also allows human trafficking to be tackled indirectly.
