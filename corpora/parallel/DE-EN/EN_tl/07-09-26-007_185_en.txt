However, taking back illegal immigrants must become an obligation at last.
The EU is also acting extremely negligently, however, if it fails to provide adequate resources to secure its external borders or accommodate apprehended illegal immigrants in reception camps, in order to ensure that they do not go underground, until they can be returned to their home countries, to say nothing of a border protection agency which closes down during the main migration season!
Brussels has also slept through the potential threat posed by Islamic immigrants.
If the EU does not wake up soon and put a stop to the influx of radical Muslims and the immigration and naturalisation of citizens from Islamic countries, we will not only be forced to live in permanent fear of terrorist attacks; we will soon be strangers in our own country.
The present report pay far too little attention to these issues, which is why - despite the sound approaches it contains - I am unfortunately compelled to reject it.
