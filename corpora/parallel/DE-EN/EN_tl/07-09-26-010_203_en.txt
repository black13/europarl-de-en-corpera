on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fava report was adopted by this House in February 2007, and it contains a long list of recommendations which relate both to the legal and the political aspects.
I would have liked to see the Council refer to these recommendations and give details of what has happened since then.
If the Council does not have Mr Fava's report available, we will gladly supply it with another copy.
However, we would then be very keen to hear what has been done in respect of the recommendations made in this report, notably as regards the cooperation with the Member States but also with regard to the Council's own role, to which attention is drawn in this report.
Mr Dick Marty, the Council of Europe rapporteur, also presented a second report in July this year.
I would like to confine myself to two points.
In this report, he says that some European governments have not only obstructed the search for the truth but are continuing to do so by invoking the concept of 'state secrets'.
This is nothing other than the abuse of secrecy in order to protect those who have broken the law.
I am sad to say that he applies this criticism to my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, and to Italy, in particular.
On the other hand, he cites the positive examples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Canada, which holds observer status with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
In a second point, however, he makes explicit mention of Poland and Romania and refers to these countries in relation to the secret detention facilities.
That is also a point on which I wish the Council would provide us with an account of what has happened.
Invoking the subsidiarity of Member States is not enough in this case, for we are dealing here with common European values.
I draw your attention to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaties.
They apply in all Member States irrespective of subsidiarity.
