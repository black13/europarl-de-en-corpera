on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, to clarify, this is an ESDP mission in Chad and the Central African Republic under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; in other words, it is a military operation.
It is not about Sudan and Darfur.
The French Government wants this EU mission at all costs.
It wants to provide the Force Headquarters and the Operation Headquarters itself.
The German and the British Governments are very sceptical.
French troops are already deployed in Chad.
It is quite clear that France is acting as a protection force for the governments in Chad and the Central African Republic and now simply wants to embellish its engagement there with the EU logo.
The French troops are not neutral; on the contrary, they are obviously biased.
For example, they have bombed rebels operating in the country.
The rebel leaders have announced that if the EU force is not neutral, they will wage a war against these troops.
I have now heard that the Nordic Battle Group is not available, and the UN resolution calls for open cooperation with the military and the police in Chad.
It is obviously the case that Chad and the Central African Republic are not democracies.
Refugee return is not part of the mandate of this EU force and this mission is - to be frank - extremely dangerous.
As a group, we will be voting against the resolution tabled, because we believe that the situation will not improve but will deteriorate further as a result of this operation.
