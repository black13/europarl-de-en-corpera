on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe, indeed the whole world, is looking at Burma.
Today, for the first time, blood has been shed, as my colleague from the UK has already mentioned, for nothing else can be covered up and that is a new situation in the debate.
The Socialist Group is appalled by the brutal methods deployed by the military junta against the peaceful demonstrators.
We expect the UN Security Council, which is now meeting in parallel, to take immediate measures and bring its influence to bear, and that means its influence over and with China.
The second message to be sent out today must be the European Parliament's solidarity with the people of Burma: our solidarity, support and, yes, our admiration for the courage of its citizens.
The Buddhist monks are not a small elite minority.
They are part of the citizenry and are supported by thousands of people.
Clearly, the demonstrations were triggered by the arbitrary price increases, but violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and specifically of International Labour Organisation standards, torture and forced labour have been practised by the junta for years.
In the age of globalisation, isolationism is no longer an option, and that is a good thing.
Democratic basic rights and the universal value system apply on the Asian continent as well.
We expect the long-planned constitution in Burma to be put on the agenda straight away, and that Burma - like Thailand, interestingly, relatively soon - will hold democratic elections.
It is possible to establish and implement democratic regimes in these regions.
Besides the UN and Europe, the ASEAN countries must of course also play a more active role, especially since they aspire to be something akin to an EU.
The demonstrations in the Philippines today are a positive sign of solidarity in the region.
There is no turning back on the road to democracy, even in Burma.
