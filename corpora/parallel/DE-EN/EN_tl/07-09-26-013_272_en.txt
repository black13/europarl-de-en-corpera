Bosnia and Herzegovina will only have a future if it is transformed into a federation comprising all three of its nations on an equal basis, which must include not only the Herzegovinian but also the Central Bosnian Croats.
My question is quite specific: what can be done when an entity such as Republika Srpska blocks police reform and refugee return from within, but the EU only brings external pressure to bear on the state as a whole?
Do you also speak to the individual entities and exert pressure on them, or can this only be done via the central state?
If so, it becomes very difficult.
