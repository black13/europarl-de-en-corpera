Mr President-in-Office, do you know that Mr Papadimoulis is completely isolated here?
Are you familiar with the resolution adopted by this House in which a 75% majority of Members said that we were in favour of the Ahtisaari-Rohan plan and that we were clearly in favour of sovereignty under international monitoring?
Do you know that we unequivocally ruled out the option of a division of Kosovo?
I would also like to ask you what you think of these rumours and the talk of a division of Kosovo, which was actually ruled out by both the Contact Group and this Parliament.
