I would like to ask the Presidency how it is dealing with the phenomenon of climate change in relation to fishing quotas.
We all know that climate change is currently buffered by the strong heat absorption of the oceans; 80% of the energy is still being absorbed here.
However, it must of course be assumed that in future there will be massive warming of the marine environment as well.
How is the Presidency ensuring that appropriate account is taken of these new scientific findings and that consideration is given to the aquatic environment when setting fishing quotas?
