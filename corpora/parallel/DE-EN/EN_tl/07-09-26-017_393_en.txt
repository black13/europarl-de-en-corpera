draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Madam President, the question is: why are we talking about equality or inequality when more women than men reach a high level of education?
What this means is that we have the same educational opportunities and we are utilising them as well, but equality of opportunity is no longer guaranteed after that.
In training, in the use of their acquired knowledge, women continue to suffer discrimination, which means that there is still no equality in the education and training systems.
That is why it is essential that we take account of women who are already mothers and are studying, for example, that we demand particularly flexible organisation of studies here, and that we promote and support access for young women, especially from remote regions, and vulnerable groups such as migrant women and women from ethnic minorities, for there are major anomalies and inequalities here.
This must start at pre-school and school age and then continue all the way through to vocational training.
If I may, I will continue after a short break.
