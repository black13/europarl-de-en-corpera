on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the right to unrestricted education, which means the right of access to education, is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and yet it is still deficient and has still not been fully realised in practice.
The considerable disparity in performance between education systems in the EU translates into differences in economic and social development.
Education systems must be efficient, equitable and, above all, freely accessible.
Efficiency must be promoted and emphasised from the pre-school level onwards, in schools and also in the vocational training system.
It is extremely important that higher education should become accustomed to some measure of flexibility in order to respond swiftly to economic and social change, for this is the only way to create competitive advantages.
Multidimensionality, quality and cooperation with the private sector and the promotion of research and development are essential.
However, we must not educate people simply to supply the economy with well-qualified workers.
Education is personally enriching and is the prerequisite for us to be able to live in social cohesion.
It fosters personal development and self-esteem, and that is at least as important as specialist, vocational and business skills training.
We need to work towards a situation in which teachers and all their students receive a high-quality education and, above all, have opportunities for advancement and flexible development, for here, we have been travelling down the same track for decades.
That cannot continue!
It would be simplistic to say that education policy should be solely a matter for the Member States.
This is only partly true.
A European educational area with a common goal, namely the Lisbon objectives, also needs a common approach to achieve efficiency and equity.
