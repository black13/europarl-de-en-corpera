Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, education has played, and continues to play, a key role in the development of the European economy and the personal development of young people.
I fully agree with this and many other statements made in the report, and I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur.
It is also correct to say that education systems are effective when the resources deployed produce the best possible results.
These objectives are pursued by all the EU Member States, in fact, but comparative studies often reveal some interesting facts about the outcomes.
For that reason, pointers and appeals to the Member States, as set out in the report, are more than justified from a European perspective, even though we have no direct powers in respect of the content and structure of education.
The causes of such divergent outcomes can be found in the variations in educational quality and intensity, which result in different levels of performance and therefore also to unequal life chances for our young people.
In my view, it is essential, as a matter of urgency, to make it clear, time and again, that today's generation of school students will be entering an international competition for training places after completing their education.
Equal opportunities for all thus pose a challenge for Member States which they must meet in order to ensure that young people receive the best possible education that equips them with the intellectual skills they need in order to flourish.
However, equality of opportunity always has to do with quality and performance as well.
This, in turn, merits a greater focus on quality and performance in the education system.
In this context, it should not just be about educational equality for everyone, but about giving everyone an equal start, followed up by the best possible education which takes account of individual talents and differences in physical and intellectual abilities.
