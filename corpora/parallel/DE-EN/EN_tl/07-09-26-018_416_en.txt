author. - Madam President, I am pleased, too, that this important topic - the increase in dyslexia - is being discussed here this evening.
It is certainly the first time that we have talked about this issue, but it should not be the last.
I want the Commission to do everything possible to drive this issue forward.
We are not starting from zero.
There are already programmes, there are already initiatives, in many Member States.
It is important, in my view, not to talk about dyslexia as an illness or a disability, for that is incorrect.
It has already been mentioned that many children with dyslexia are actually highly intelligent.
We know that these children are quicker at thinking than in their motor skills.
The first step that we need to take, therefore - and this is my urgent request to the Commissioner - is to obtain an overview of what has already been done in the field of research and the programmes and initiatives which already exist at European level, and then pull all this information together.
I think it is important not to confuse dyslexia with ADS.
It would be disastrous to lump the two together.
We know that ADS is closely connected to excessive television consumption and over-stimulation.
On the issue of dyslexia, we should also consider how we can introduce children to books and reading early on.
We know that children who read a lot and have easy access to books are less susceptible to dyslexia.
This might be one way of curbing the alarming rise in dyslexia.
We urge the Commission to compile an overview of the diversity and the different approaches which exist in Europe.
Another option would be to hold a conference to bring together all these people and their different experiences in this area.
We know that children are our future and knowledge is our most important resource in Europe, so we need to do our utmost here.
