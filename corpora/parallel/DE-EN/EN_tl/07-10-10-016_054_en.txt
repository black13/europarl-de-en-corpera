Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Lisbon brings us yet another important step closer and successfully brings to an end the aftermath of the meetings.
However, Lisbon still does not bring us to our goal.
The ratification process is still ahead of us and will demand everything of us, indeed, of us all.
We shall manage together or not at all to make the European Union more democratic, closer to its citizens, more transparent, more capable of action, inwardly and outwardly.
The Reform Treaty signifies a further step in the right direction.
Only if we do this together will we succeed in anchoring the Reform Treaty in the public consciousness as added value for the citizens of Europe, the European Union and Europe as a whole.
The only thing is that we have still not put egotism, nationalism, protectionism, the EU naysayers and the EU mendaciousness in their place with the Reform Treaty alone.
They are the cancer of commonality, the cancer of Europe's future.
The opt-out method is inconsistent with a united Europe.
The opt-out method weakens the community of values.
It creates first and second-class citizens and I am wondering why the representatives of Poland and the United Kingdom want to thwart the European Union's common foreign and security policy.
We want data protection to be controlled by law with parliamentary participation.
We want staffing decisions to be taken after the elections to the European Parliament.
We want the social partners and social dialogue to continue to be anchored and strengthened.
We want public relations work to be carried out on the added value of the Reform Treaty and the further extension of the European Parliament's co-decision-making rights, because only by doing this will Europe become more democratic, closer to its citizens and more transparent.
