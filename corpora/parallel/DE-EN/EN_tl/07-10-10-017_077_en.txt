on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, there are different views in my Group.
I, however, support the report by Messrs Lamassoure und Severin.
With the report Parliament responsibly keeps its right of initiative to submit a proposal itself on its future composition.
It does so thanks to the intensive work done by both rapporteurs in a genuine European spirit.
The proposal is well balanced, it is based on a clear, comprehensible and transparent system, and can also be sustained for future enlargements.
The proposal follows the principle of diversity.
By using all 750 possible seats, it also ensures that in future Parliament will reflect the whole range of the main political orientations from each country.
The proposal is also based on the principle of solidarity, hence the larger, most populous Member States agreeing to have less influence in order to allow the smaller, least populous Member States to be better represented.
All this helps strengthen the Union's cohesion.
I therefore hope that the Council unreservedly and speedily implements Parliament's proposal before the 2009 elections.
One further comment in conclusion.
All the people who live in the Member State concerned form the basis for calculating a Member State's seats - as with the Council - including third-country nationals living there, because they are part of this society.
However, this is only one side of the coin.
Third-country nationals whose homes are in our Member States must also have the right to vote for the European Parliament.
I have always fought for this and I shall continue to do so!
