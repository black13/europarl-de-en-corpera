Madam President, fellow Members, Parliament is providing an input with this Lamassoure/Severin Report.
We will be distributing the seats in 2009, whereas the new formula for distributing votes in the Council of Ministers will not apply until 2014.
We are now ready to introduce this operation for the next period.
The entire proposal, however, only applies if there is a new treaty.
If the new treaty is not implemented, the Treaty of Nice and the accession treaties will remain in force, which means that all countries will have fewer seats.
There should therefore be great interest in backing this proposal in the Plenary tomorrow.
I thank both the rapporteurs, Messrs Lamassoure and Severin, for the work they have done.
We cannot satisfy everyone; that would be a miracle.
However, I do protest against what has been said by the Polish here, that somebody is suffering discrimination.
There is no discrimination against anyone.
On the contrary, a proposal has been put forward, which is plausible and adheres to objective criteria, on the basis of which the seats we have can be distributed.
We must, however, continue a debate which our Italian colleagues have started, namely the debate as to whether the concept of citizenship in the European Union is the same as the concept of citizenship at national level.
The nation state has closed the borders and excluded all others.
The EU is based on a different concept and we are in fact broadening this debate in order that all residents of the EU are represented by us and not just those in possession of a Member State's passport.
There are 30 million in the EU who do not have the passport of a Member State, but who abide by our laws.
We shall be coming back to this once again next time.
Thank you for this proposal, which now brings us on track to a successful conclusion for the Intergovernmental Conference and for a new European treaty.
