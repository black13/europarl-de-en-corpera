Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I would like to present the apologies on behalf of Parliament's rapporteur for the Green Paper on Maritime Policy, Willi Piecyk.
He is unable to be here today and I am to pass on his best wishes.
I should like to express my praise - I am a member of the Environment Committee - with regard to onshore transport connections for ships.
This has been included and, if we can bring about a decision such as this, is very good for air quality in Europe and it is also very good for reducing CO2 emissions.
In the Green Paper on Maritime Policy there is also discussion about the fact that ships should be included in the Emissions Trading Scheme.
We are only at the first reading concerning the inclusion of air traffic in emissions trading.
There has been no provision either for air traffic in the Kyoto Protocol and a very practical question is therefore: when does the Commission want to put forward a proposal for including maritime traffic in emissions trading?
