on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, as a member of the Mexico delegation, I would particularly like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and specifically the rapporteur for the fact that this problem, which has also cast a shadow on many discussions with our colleagues in Mexico, has been dealt with.
I am hoping for a very broad majority tomorrow, which expresses one opinion and which emphasises how seriously we heave dealt with this problem.
In view of the appalling figures, the reports on the harassment of witnesses and solicitors, death threats and threats of torture, harassment of families, of situations which can in no way be accepted, it is the European Union's duty to speak out and it is also its duty to point out the peculiarity of this phenomenon.
It represents a particularly dramatic development of a global phenomenon concerning the way in which women are treated, which must be quickly brought to an end in the 21st century.
It must be addressed on a very amicable basis with our counterparts in the countries concerned because a positive development is only possible in a society when women are able to live free of fear and aggression and when threats, which are made against them and from which they suffer because they are women, are prosecuted appropriately.
I therefore welcome all the positive measures being adopted here.
We need witness protection, we need a better legal system, we need education.
Then we shall be able - so I believe - to support women in Mexico, in Latin America, in order to achieve a level of protection for them that is acceptable to us.
