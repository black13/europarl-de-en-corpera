on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I am much obliged to my colleague Mr Chatzimarkakis, who has presented a report that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can endorse in all respects.
It is a legitimate question, however, whether this regulation was even necessary.
It will provoke intense covetous discussion, as it is difficult to explain the context to citizens.
Therefore, I think it a good thing that farming businesses are to be given an explanation of the reasons for the payments when details of these are published.
Our farmers do indeed make a valuable contribution to our society, supplying us with food day by day, taking care of our cultural landscape and making a large contribution to the functioning of rural areas.
Transparency cannot be a one-way street, however - it has to apply to both sides.
For this reason, my group supports the report's call to make users sign on or register when using the information.
As my colleague has just mentioned, it is also important that this directive does not invalidate data protection provisions, particularly those of Member States.
In the interests of equal treatment, however, I would ask the Commission to present a regulation ensuring transparency also in non-governmental organisations, for example.
I am convinced that more EU funds are being channelled into shady projects in the case of NGOs than is happening in the agricultural sector.
This report gives us the opportunity to show the public why taxpayers' money is being spent on agriculture.
Using the report appropriately will facilitate success in demonstrating to the public the great importance of European agriculture, in which case this Transparency Directive will have served its purpose.
