on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, this was not the first time that you faced a negotiating partner who is very difficult, to put it mildly, because based on experience, he assumes from the outset that Europe will always give in, in every instance.
As before, if you read through this document, it is clearly to the advantage of the US.
Whether there is anything in it for the European Union remains to be seen, for a joint committee is no more than an opportunity; it is not yet a success, especially given that the US is already calling the outcomes into question.
I see no balance yet, and very little concern for our demands.
The comparison drawn by the previous speaker about the rather bizarre marriage of convenience is very apt.
The issues of aviation security, environmental protection and ownership rights are still unresolved.
On the question of security, we have still not achieved what we need to achieve.
On the issue of data protection in particular - the protection of European citizens from overzealous measures - we have still not achieved the result that we need and that we must achieve.
In addition to that, the contribution of aviation to our failure to achieve the Kyoto target is still massive.
With the present rates of growth, Europe will face major difficulties unless we have a common agreement with the US, and I see no sign of that at all at the moment.
At most, I see initial faltering steps, but Europe must be much more self-confident and speak with one voice in this negotiating process, for what has happened so far gives us opportunities.
We have not yet reaped the benefits, however, and I can say with confidence that the European Parliament and the Committee on Transport and Tourism will be scrutinising the outcomes produced by this joint negotiating committee very carefully.
