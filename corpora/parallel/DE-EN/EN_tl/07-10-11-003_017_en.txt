Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his clear depiction of the situation and the position taken.
First, the positives, which have also been mentioned by the previous speaker.
With the open skies agreement between the US and Europe, we now finally have the opportunity to establish airline routes from the European Union via the United States to third countries such as Mexico and South America.
It also offers the opportunity for any carrier based in the European Union to fly from anywhere in the EU to anywhere in the US without any restrictions on capacity or prices, and I agree with the previous speaker: these opportunities must be utilised.
In the area of investment in US airline companies, too, progress has been achieved with this agreement.
The Open Skies Agreement thus takes the first important step towards an Open Aviation Area without any restrictions on either side.
It can thus create useful new air routes and a large number of new jobs.
On the other hand - as has already been said - it must be made clear that this is only the first step and cannot be regarded as a final agreement.
We expect the Commission, in a second stage, to negotiate unresolved issues such as cabotage, right of establishment, ownership and State aid with the US.
The potential for conflict has already been made very clear by the Commissioner, but I hope that the work in the transatlantic committee will make progress so that we ultimately have reciprocal rights which can be implemented and an Open Skies Agreement which is worthy of the name.
In parallel to this, the committee should push for the inclusion of flights from the US in emissions trading, for we know that we did not achieve very much at the ICAO meeting, as you have mentioned.
Of course, it should also give emphasis to our demand for one-stop security.
