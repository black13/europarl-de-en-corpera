on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report draws attention to some of the problems, notably congestion, which we, as people who have to fly fairly frequently, very often experience but which naturally affect aviation as a whole, not just business flights but holiday flights as well.
I would like to thank the rapporteur particularly for attempting to reconcile two positions which emerged in the committee on this issue.
On the one hand, there was unfettered euphoria about the prospect of growth, which appeared to rely solely on building new airports to relieve the old ones; on the other hand, there was the concern about organisational aspects and, of course, the issue of responsibility for the protection of both the environment and local residents.
We face a situation in which the quality of life of people living around major airports or, indeed, poorly situated regional airports is severely impaired.
Here, too, we have a responsibility.
We cannot simply deal with this issue in terms of new growth prospects.
It is a question of organisation.
The system of hubs and slots which currently exists in European aviation is not as good as it could be.
We have such large hubs in some areas that the ensuing complexity of connecting flights means that one small mistake can potentially have massive consequences, not just for one airport but for the airspace as a whole.
That problem needs to be solved and the report makes some important suggestions here.
However, these solutions must not be implemented at the expense of passengers and especially not at the expense of the workers providing airport services, because they too have a right to quality of life.
