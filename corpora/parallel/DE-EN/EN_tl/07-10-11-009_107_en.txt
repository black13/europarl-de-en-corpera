in writing. - Across the board, our small farmers, who are the salt of the earth, are being submerged in a sea of irrelevant bureaucracy and subjected to satellite surveillance, and woe betide them if their fence is standing a little too far to the right or the left.
It is time for some humanity again, instead of beating our hardworking small farmers senseless with bureaucratic cudgels.
The black sheep who fabricate entire fields and business activities and who cause BSE and other scandals should be named and shamed.
It is a mockery, however, to say that prices are rising so this could justify cutting subsidies.
Austrian organic farmers were getting around seven schillings - equivalent to around 95 cent - per litre of milk before accession.
Today, they get just 30 cent, which means that they are losing thousands of euros, and at the same time they are having to contend with ever-changing bureaucratic regulations that make their lives even more difficult!
The 'health check' envisaged must therefore serve only one purpose: to create a better, more reliable and longer-lasting framework, not to bring about reform by brute force and cause our last remaining farmers to throw in the towel.
In view of the massive exodus from farming in Europe, the idea that unspent agricultural funding could be used for prestige projects such as Galileo must be vigorously rejected.
We must retain our self-sufficiency capacity at all costs, and should not offer ourselves as hostages to fortune to the genetic engineering companies.
