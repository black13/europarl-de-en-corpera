I am well aware that Mr Cohn-Bendit's thirst for knowledge knows no bounds.
Let me say to you that there was not one second in the entire process when this was in any doubt.
Nor was the matter raised at all during the open session at the summit meeting.
But this rumour was being spread in other circles.
Wherever I could, I acted immediately to quash it.
There can never be a situation where the European Council or any other body could withdraw the voting rights of the President of the European Parliament.
This is not about me personally but about the office of the President of Parliament.
I would vigorously oppose any such move, and the House is united on that stance.
(Applause)
