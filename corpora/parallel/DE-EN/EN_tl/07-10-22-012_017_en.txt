on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, we spoke about this at the Conference of Presidents and said that, in view of the EU summit with Russia, Mr Putin's trip to Iran and the very real nature of the disputes that are taking place there, it would surely be absurd for this Parliament to debate these matters and not adopt a resolution in which the position of Parliament is set out.
Who are we, in point of fact?
We always want to have powers of codecision, yet now, when we have the opportunity to take a decision, we choose not to.
We are in favour of a resolution prior to the EU-Russia summit and, if need be, another resolution after the summit.
It is the duty of Parliament to scrutinise the Commission and formulate political guidelines and not simply to behave like a debating society.
