Mr President, I am not noted for intervening to any great extent on points of order, but we hold this debate every Monday at five in the afternoon.
I have started to wonder why we have another debate on matters of political importance on Thursday afternoons.
Maybe this very question could be discussed again by the parliamentary powers that be, because we have this same discussion every time about whether some item, such as a summit that some people are holding somewhere or other, should or should not be added to the agenda.
I would very much welcome a question of this nature being placed on one of the agendas of the House.
