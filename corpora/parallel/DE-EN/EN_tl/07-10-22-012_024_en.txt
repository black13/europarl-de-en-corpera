on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, it is always so difficult to decide between the pros and cons.
We were in favour of this motion, and we could subscribe to it if we had an undertaking from the EPP-ED Group and other groups that Uzbekistan really would be put on the agenda and discussed at the next opportunity.
In other words, changing the agenda should not mean losing sight of Uzbekistan and the developments that are taking place there.
Given such an undertaking, we could support the motion.
