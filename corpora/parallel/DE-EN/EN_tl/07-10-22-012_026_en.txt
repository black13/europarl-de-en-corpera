on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, there can be no doubt that Pakistan is a very important issue.
It is too important, however, to deal with it as an item in Thursday afternoon's debate on breaches of human rights.
Discussing Pakistan is clearly not just a matter of examining human-rights violations but a real opportunity to debate aspects of EU foreign policy in that entire region.
I believe we would do better to put Pakistan on our next agenda as a proper debate with the Council and the Commission, because that, in my view, is what we need most.
The subject of Uzbekistan is of more immediate concern, because the Council intends to lift certain sanctions today.
In the present situation, I believe we should adopt the position that what is happening in Uzbekistan is a human-rights issue which dictates that sanctions should not be lifted.
That can be quickly decided on Thursday afternoon.
Pakistan is a very difficult and crucial foreign-policy issue and should be placed on our next agenda.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(The order of business was thus adopted.)
