Mr President, I am very pleased that Commissioner Stavros Dimas is here.
On this occasion I would like to offer a word of praise for the action taken by the Commission last week on the illegal spring hunting of wild birds in Malta.
We have devoted a great deal of attention to this matter, not only in the Chamber but in our Committee on Petitions too.
Serving a final warning to the Maltese authorities is, I believe, an important step.
I hope that we shall see the fruits of this valuable and judicious political measure next spring and that European laws will be put into practice in the form of an enforced ban on illegal spring hunting.
