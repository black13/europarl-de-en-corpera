on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, time and again this Parliament has had to struggle with a very lax attitude to democracy on the part of the European Council.
This can lead to the number of seats in Parliament being increased by one without consultation, whereupon they simply speak of 750 plus one and think this keeps them on the right side of the law.
What fills me with apprehension, however, is the thought that this attitude is taking root in such a way here in Parliament that some Members are seeking to put the most trivial pragmatic considerations before the most basic of principles.
It seems so simple at first sight.
The Rules of Procedure commit us to the utmost transparency in our activities - not to any old interpretation of transparency, nor to a form of transparency tempered by pragmatism or cost-benefit calculations, but to the utmost transparency.
The audiovisual presentation does not match that description.
An audiovisual presentation can be used for propaganda purposes or provide a quick source of information, but it does not offer a serious analysis of the words spoken in this House, of the discussions and debates that take place here.
Of that there can be no doubt.
Multilingualism is a guiding principle of this Parliament, and parliamentary debates form the core of our activity.
Being in touch with the people is our foremost duty.
If we give this matter even a moment's serious thought, we cannot deny that a parliament which sets itself apart from all other parliaments in the world by no longer archiving transcriptions of its debates is thereby sacrificing much of its parliamentary identity.
With regard to the cost factor, it would be very simple to cut costs by transcribing the interpretation of proceedings rather than translating them here.
That would also reflect the liveliness of the debate and reproduce it in the way in which it was actually understood and conducted.
