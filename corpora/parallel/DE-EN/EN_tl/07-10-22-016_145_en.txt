draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Madam President, I acknowledge the car as a universal means of transport, and I acknowledge the contribution of the car industry to the prosperity of Europeans.
I do not, however, believe in the car as a fetish.
For that reason it is incomprehensible to me that manufacturers should design cars to travel at speeds in excess of 125 miles per hour.
Building efficient, environment-friendly cars is a necessity, given all the evidence of climate change.
In addition, Europe is duty-bound to set a good example to the booming emerging markets.
It is ultimately the consumer's choice that will determine which cars are driven in the years to come.
This is why I argued in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for transparent and more easily understandable information on the emission ratings of vehicles.
I call on the Commission to take this report as the starting point for the presentation of an ambitious legislative proposal and to act quickly.
