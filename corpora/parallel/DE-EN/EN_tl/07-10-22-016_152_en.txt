Madam President, Commissioner, this report, which Chris Davies has drawn up on the initiative of the Environment Committee, should signal to the Commission that the European Parliament is serious about reducing CO2 emissions.
When I see the amendments on the table, I start to wonder about that.
There are three points we should bear in mind.
Firstly, from 1 January 2012, new cars in Europe must not emit more than 120g of CO2 per kilometre.
We should not tamper with that date or the emission limit.
In 1998 the car industry made a voluntary commitment to reduce CO2-emission levels in its new vehicles.
In the light of news reports about the continuing advance of climate change, I see no reason at all for us to interfere with the deadline or the ceiling.
Secondly, future legislation must spell out clearly that the CO2 emissions of all cars must be reduced.
Large cars must make a greater contribution, but smaller cars must contribute too, so that we can achieve 120 grams by 2012.
My third point is that cars must remain affordable for people.
I agree with the previous speaker on that.
I come from a predominantly rural area, where people are dependent on cars to get them to their places of work.
For this reason, future legislation must perform a balancing act to reconcile the needs of the environment with those of the economy.
What good are strict emission limits if people can no longer afford new cars and drive about in their ageing vehicles?
It takes more than eight and a half years to renew the entire fleet of passenger cars on Europe's roads, and this must be in the back of our minds when we adopt new legislation.
Future legislation on CO2 emissions from passenger cars should be guided by the need to guarantee better protection of the climate as well as affordable driving.
