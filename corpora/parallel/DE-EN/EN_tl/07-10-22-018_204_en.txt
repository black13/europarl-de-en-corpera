Mr President, there is general agreement as to how important statistics are, and not just among the people who have managed to come here at this late hour.
The question is whether the aim which I presume we are all pursuing will be achieved with the measures that are being initiated here.
It made me wonder, Commissioner, when you spoke of another new regulation that was to be negotiated with us.
Perhaps you can tell us whether its provisions will also affect these advisory bodies.
The second question is this: there is always a great inherent danger with advisory bodies that they will become a law unto themselves and drag everything out.
Would it not have made more sense at the end of the day to evaluate briefly, concisely and clearly, using external management consultants where necessary, the problems that have occurred with Eurostat and then come to a rapid agreement with Parliament rather than passing the buck again and shelving the issue?
When all is said and done, every one of us knows that the crux of the problem is the interface between Eurostat and the national statistical offices.
The best an advisory body can do is to put the problem back on the agenda, but it is certainly not going to establish real transparency and efficiency.
