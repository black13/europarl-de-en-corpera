The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the results of the informal summit of heads of state and government in Lisbon.
May I give a warm welcome to the President of the EU Council and Prime Minister of Portugal, José Sócrates.
A very warm welcome this morning to the European Parliament!
An equally warm welcome, of course, to the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, and thank you to him for his work at the European summit.
Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the debate I should like - and I do not wish to jump ahead at all - to thank the Portuguese Presidency sincerely for its enormous input and for the success achieved on Thursday night at around 1 a.m. when it approved the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
This is a great result for the European Union and a great result for us all.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to add that without the European Parliament, we would not be where we are today.
This is also a great result for us all because the Treaty was and is the top priority for the European Parliament if we are to come out ahead and be victorious in this Treaty.
With these congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency, and also to the Commission - and I see Commissioner Wallström here, who has also made a significant contribution, next to the President of the Commission - it gives me great joy now to hand over to the President of the EU Council, José Sócrates.
A warm welcome to the European Parliament!
