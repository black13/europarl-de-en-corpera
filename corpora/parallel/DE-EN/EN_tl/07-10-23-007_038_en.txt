Many thanks, President-in-Office, for your report and for your work.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard about the composition of the European Parliament and the report by the President-in-Office did not discuss the voting rights of the President of the European Parliament.
I shall therefore emphasise here once again that this was not about the European Council either.
The President of the European Parliament will, if he agrees, make use of his rights, of course.
No-one can take that away from him and the European Council has not taken it away from him either.
I should like to state this here for the record.
I should now like to ask the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, to be kind enough to speak to us.
