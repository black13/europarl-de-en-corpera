Mr President, from Europe's many upheavals, peasants wars and revolutions, we are all familiar with the romantic story of the fugitive being hidden in a cart-load of dung to be taken over the border and escape Richelieu's bloodhounds and the king's guards.
If, at the end, he is successful, he does not look very nice, nor does he smell very nice, but once he has washed, then it can be said: he is alive!
The Constitution has fared similarly.
Governments have buried it in a tangled mass of illegible, indecipherable texts of opt-outs, clauses, footnotes, resolutions, Minutes, and they have taken the Constitution beyond the limits under cover of this dunghill.
The tragedy of it is simply that they sought shelter in this constitutional treasure not from the king's guards, but from the watchful eyes of citizens.
I have been digging in this tangled mass of texts.
Yes, I have actually found all the main achievements of the Constitution on which I myself have been working for more than 10 years and I could well be fortunate.
This situation nevertheless makes me very apprehensive.
In addition, of course, as is simply the case with such adventures, whenever anyone helped the fugitive, they ripped off part of the treasure.
I have therefore also found the hands of a few governments in this dung hill.
One has secured another opt-out for itself and therefore filched a part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a part of Parliament's rights, a part of data protection, etc.
The treasure arrives damaged, but generally speaking it does arrive.
We have gained a piece of Europe, we have saved a piece of Europe's future, not with our citizens, but without our citizens, not with the parliaments, but without the parliaments, and this is a great danger.
We have gained a piece of Europe, but we have not resolved the crisis of confidence among Europe's citizens.
There is therefore an enormous challenge ahead of this House: to regain the confidence of Europe's citizens.
