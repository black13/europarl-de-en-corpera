Mr President, gentlemen, you certainly do not have it easy at the moment!
In the countries in which referendums were promised, the Treaty is portrayed, as in the United Kingdom or in my home country, Austria, as just a minor detail, an extension of something.
In other countries, like Germany, the talk is of a total reorganisation of the Community and of a historic breakthrough.
Which is now true?
I think we should remind ourselves again on this occasion of the words and very clear sayings of the former President of West Germany, Roman Herzog, who was after all Chairman of the Convention responsible for drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights and who said that democracy is being eroded by the EU Constitution.
We now have it in a modified form in the Reform Treaty.
If you do not want it to be eroded, if you do not want democracy to be choked, please have the political decency at least to allow referendums, as there have been in the past - for the last EU Constitutional Treaty - even in Spain and Luxembourg.
