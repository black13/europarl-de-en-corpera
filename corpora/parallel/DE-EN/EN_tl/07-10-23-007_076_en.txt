Mr President, we have the Lisbon Strategy and hopefully we are now to have the Lisbon Treaty too, and both will move Europe forward.
This Parliament, particularly the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has been fighting and working for a new European treaty for seven years.
Admittedly we have not got the Constitution, but we do say that this Reform Treaty represents progress in every respect.
There is no single item on which we have fallen behind compared with Nice.
Everything is moving forward and bringing us further into the Union of 27.
We also need to say this to the citizens outside.
The winners in the new Treaty are the people of Europe.
There are diverse forms of direct and indirect participation in European policy and we are in a position to solve the major problems referred to here faster and more effectively.
The winners are also the citizens' chambers in Europe, the national parliaments and this European citizens' chamber, this Parliament.
Democracy is not therefore being eroded - as has just been said, and which is complete nonsense - but it is the completion of European democracy, which we can actually achieve with this Treaty.
This has now been the fourth agreement.
I hope it will be the last time that the Member States have to get together for this.
Every power must now be invested in ratification.
I hope that no country says no.
It is perhaps the last chance for this Treaty.
Every no would lead to isolation, if not to that country's self-exclusion.
We hope this will not be the case.
Every power should flow into ratification so that we have this Treaty by 2009.
