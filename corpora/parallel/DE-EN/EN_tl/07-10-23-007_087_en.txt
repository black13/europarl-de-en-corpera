Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at one blow the European Union has disengaged itself from its constitutional impasse.
The new European Union will be more capable of action, more democratic and more transparent and it will be in a position to discharge its duties more successfully both at home and throughout the world.
This is good, and congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency in this regard.
If I mention with pride that the German Council Presidency was there at the beginning of the road to Lisbon, I hope you will not mind my saying so, as a German.
Not all the problems have been solved yet.
The absurd episode surrounding the 751st seat mandate and the President's voting rights made this clear.
There should be no question at all of the Council not being authorised to remove an elected Member's right to vote - irrespective of position.
I am grateful that both the President as well as Parliament's representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference have quickly and palpably made this clear.
Nevertheless, there is a problem here.
It concerns Parliament's composition, which remains unclear as from 2014.
I am convinced that it will involve finding a system that defines and governs Parliament's composition according to objective criteria, irrespective of political caprice.
It cannot be true that the Council effectively distributes Parliament's seats as if it were lord of the manor.
We have to strive towards this until 2014.
One important advance has not perhaps been recognised sufficiently to date: the strengthening of the principle of subsidiarity.
This is a very important step in involving national Parliaments in responsibility for European legislation as far as subsidiarity is concerned.
Subsidiarity and the demand for it strengthen the Community and do not weaken it, Commission President.
We shall also be striving for this in the future.
I can merely ask the national Parliaments to make thorough use of these new opportunities!
(Applause)
