on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, this now also concerns fellow Members.
We were not informed about this application.
There was a communication problem here yesterday.
Neither the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats nor my group were informed of this request.
This is also the reason why we have been feeling relatively overlooked and have abstained from voting.
We have both - that is, my fellow Member, Mr Daul, and I - put forward the proposal this morning that we flesh out this resolution with care.
We note the desire for a resolution and accept it on condition that we flesh it out with care.
After the summit we shall also have all the information available, hence the deferral of the proposal until after the summit.
