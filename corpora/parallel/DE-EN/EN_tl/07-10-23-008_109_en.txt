on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I do not know how strong communications are within the large groups.
We have always said that we want a resolution - the General Secretaries have been informed of this.
We have said that if you speak out against this, we shall do so at the vote on Monday morning, as is our right.
We have always said so and if this has not been relayed to you, it is not our problem, but yours.
As regards the content: a new law against extremists, for example, has been adopted in Russia in recent weeks that clearly restricts freedom of the press and freedom of opinion.
We therefore want the resolution to be adopted before the summit to enable the EU to state our position on the situation in Russia through this resolution.
We shall still be able to draw up a resolution on the results after the summit, but this Parliament, which wants to be political, should also adopt political freedom of expression by a majority before the summit in order to show mainland Russia what we think about freedom and democracy here in the European Parliament.
(Applause)
