Mr President, we would all certainly go along with this.
Mr Cohn-Bendit has stated precisely what we are all thinking.
However, in this House there are rules of procedure, not just because we want to torment people, but because large groups with way over 200 members also have problems, which you have perhaps to a lesser extent, Mr Cohn-Bendit, in your smaller group, namely that we have to be able to consult one another.
When I add the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and those of my group together, there are way over 450 Members in this House who need a little time for consultation.
I would therefore make the following proposal: what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said here, that we convey to the Russian side that we consider this law unfair and that it should be retracted, the Commission and the Council can pick up from here on.
This is certainly a statement of the will of the entire European Parliament, which has already been made clear through this discussion.
A resolution, however, that contains 60-70 items also has to be able to be discussed a little and only by doing so will it work.
We therefore ask for the debate, the draft resolution, and then the vote at the next sitting.
This is in actual fact a fair compromise.
Please endorse it!
