Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for the result of the vote.
This is based on the result of the report on the sustainable use of pesticides.
We have voted out the top levels here.
We have, however, focussed on training and information for users and salespeople alike.
Only the expert and skilled handling of pesticides can ensure sustainability.
The latest technology and the most up-to-date knowledge are being applied here, of course.
We support Integrated Pest Management.
The Commission is calling for Integrated Pest Management to be made compulsory for agriculture as a whole by 2014.
We need general standards for this.
We cannot squeeze Integrated Pest Management into fixed criteria, certainly not throughout Europe.
Integrated Pest Management must always be developed flexibly.
It requires the incitements of good technical practice and it needs drive - and that drive needs to be maintained.
We must therefore discuss this once again here before second reading.
We still have the opportunity, together with the Council and the Commission, to bring this to a good conclusion so that we in the European Union can continue to make pest management actually possible.
