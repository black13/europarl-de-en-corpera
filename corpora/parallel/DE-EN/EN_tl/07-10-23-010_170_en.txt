in writing. - The proposed Directive establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides is important, since alarming quantities of certain pesticides are still being found despite the existing framework regulations on soil, air and water.
Evidence beyond the existing regulations also gives cause for concern in arable crops and requires a political initiative.
National action plans with concrete objectives for reducing the risks and dependencies associated with pesticides are crucial here.
It is extremely regrettable that in plenary we have not followed up the amendment with the objective of reducing alarming toxic and highly toxic substances by 50% by 2013 and reducing the use of pesticides by 20% in the next 10 years.
This would have been an important political signal even in the given situation.
