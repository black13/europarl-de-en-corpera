Mr President, I believe we should be striving towards public health and consumer protection and I should like to offer my full support for these positions too.
There is simply no sense in us introducing impractical solutions and creating situations in which food production is no longer possible with approved funds.
For this reason I am convinced that the Breyer report cannot endure in this form and that we should amend it in this regard.
I have voted against it and am of the opinion and am glad that a much more sensible and practical solution has been found in the Kla√ü report and therefore in the action plans, for which I was the rapporteur in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
For this reason I hope that we are also able to improve the Breyer report considerably at second reading, because we must improve it.
