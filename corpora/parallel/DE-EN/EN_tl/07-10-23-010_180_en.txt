in writing. - Yesterday I was not able to make use of my speaking time.
The vote in the Committee on Climate Change on the Hassi report, which forms the basis for the European Parliament's position for the UN Climate Change Conference, was taking place at the same time.
The European Union's new policy on the use of pesticides is an important step towards better health and environmental protection.
Of particular importance in the result of today's vote is Parliament's clear position against the three-zone model proposed by the Commission.
The proposed system is misleading and would grossly contradict the aim of the sustainable use of pesticides.
