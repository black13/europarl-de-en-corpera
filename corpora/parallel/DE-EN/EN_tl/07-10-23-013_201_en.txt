Mr President, anyone who was in the Committee on Budgets will know how difficult it always is in the autumn to release very much money at all.
It is usually tucked away under the reserve information services budget headings.
There is, of course, an attempt to be active and therefore to do something.
Here I would address you directly, Mr President.
The LUX film award has been set up.
The conditions were that the films would be viewed by 18 October of this year and only those Members who had seen all three films could and should vote under this budget item initiative.
I have just looked at the list.
There are not even a dozen Members who will be making the decision tomorrow on which Tower of Babel they will give to whom.
I should like to ask you, Mr President, to be honest enough not to deceive us tomorrow, but to tell us how many Members have in fact legitimately taken part in this vote.
Please ensure that the Minutes are not tampered with outside at the last minute, because the deadline for watching the films, the viewing deadline, was 18 October.
This relatively small problem on the scale of budgets, Mr President, can be carried over to so many other areas.
We are constantly throwing money around here without thinking about it because we have too much money and therefore even good ideas such as the film award are being knocked down.
However, please be honest at least tomorrow, Mr President!
