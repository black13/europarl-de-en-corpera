draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission is now willing to spend 44.2%, corresponding to EUR 57 billion of the budget, on growth and employment.
The increase in the corresponding budget headings by EUR 2.3 billion for 2008 effectively support the Lisbon Strategy.
I should particularly like to highlight the three pilot projects in the social sector, even though the Committee on Budgets has not approved the funds for this in one instance and has substantially reduced them in a second instance.
Even the project on the employment situation in health care, which has been reduced somewhat by the Committee on Budgets, is particularly close to my heart, because there have been considerable problems here since the EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007.
The pilot project should therefore be carried out as we have devised it.
This applies particularly in regard to possible regulations for social services.
The same also applies to another project we have proposed, namely the social integration of migrants.
Please therefore support the amendments we have re-inserted.
I should also like to promote once again the family project to be carried out by the foundation in Dublin, which we would like to support to the tune of EUR 400 000, but which the Committee on Budgets has entirely rejected.
Family-friendly jobs, the improvement in the housing situation for families and continuing family support are also prime objectives for us in Europe.
The treatment of these subjects should therefore be incorporated into the work schedule of the foundation in Dublin and the necessary funding made available, of course.
