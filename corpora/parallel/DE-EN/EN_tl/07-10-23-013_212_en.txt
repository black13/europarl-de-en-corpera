draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has restored the budget figures reduced in its sector by the Council to the amounts stated in the Commission's preliminary draft budget.
This means a 10.3% budget increase for the environmental sector compared with the 2007 budget year.
We believe this is also entirely appropriate for the most important instruments in the environmental sector.
The EMEA, EEA, EFSA and ECDC - these are the abbreviations for our agencies, with whose work we are entirely satisfied - have also recovered their money.
Life+ is agreed, work is beginning and the new health action plan is also replacing the old one from January 2008.
So far, so good - all of it!
We shall certainly be able to make an evaluation at the end of the year or in early 2009.
The HELP programme is giving us cause for concern, however.
We know how harmful tobacco consumption is.
However, we also want the European public to hear and understand this message.
2008 is the last budget year in which we shall be receiving money for this anti-smoking campaign from the tobacco fund.
We are asking the Commission to think very quickly about where the money for this campaign can come from in subsequent years.
