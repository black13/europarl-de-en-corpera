draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Mr President, I am speaking here for the Committee on Culture, which is responsible not only for culture, but also for education, youth, media and sport.
Our budget is very limited when compared to what it ought to be.
I believe that when we take a good look at how successful the ERASMUS programme has been, whereby university students in Europe can study in different countries, make friends in other parts of Europe, and discuss it afterwards among their friends and contacts, it is clear that it makes an essential contribution to mutual understanding in Europe.
I believe that we should do more for communication, especially now that the Heads of State or Government have agreed on the Reform Treaty.
The idea of 'going local', working with people in their own environment to gain their support for a European future, is crucial.
I am delighted that two pilot projects, at least, were possible: EuroGlobe, a mobile theatre like those from Shakespeare's era, set up to tour European capital cities so as to really involve citizens, and a culture project on the theme of artist mobility, to enable Europe's young artists to come together, work together and shape Europe's future.
