draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Mr President, it is important to treat the budget in a gender-neutral manner, as we should and must do, from the women's policy point of view.
The aspect of gender is of great importance here and 'gender budgeting' must not be merely empty words, but must be seen to be put into practice.
It is very important that we top up the DAPHNE programme.
Unfortunately, our amendment did not get through and we will now raise it in the Plenary once again.
We Social Democrats support the amendment and the increase of funds for DAPHNE, because it is a relatively small, but very important programme to combat domestic violence.
Then it is also important to provide appropriate financing for the European Institute for Gender Equality, to ensure that it is launched successfully.
It is also important that expenditure for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue is distributed equally between the sexes.
There are a great many women, especially migrants, who should be given a vital role in this intercultural dialogue.
