Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, thank you to the whole budget team for their good work.
Please allow me a few remarks from the point of view of the Committee on Regional Development.
In its estimates, the Commission evaluated the need for finance and, in harmony with the threshold values of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the terms of the financial perspective, took into account the likely applications for the current period.
Thus, logically, the commitments within the framework of the Structural Funds for 2008 increase by 0.9%, and payments by 3.2%, while monies for the Cohesion Fund increase by 14.4% for commitments and 36% for payments.
Since the Commission is, in fact, the only institution that has unrestricted access to the required information in connection with overall financial requirement, our Committee was guided by the Commission's proposal and also unanimously and immediately corrected unjustified amendments undertaken by the Council in its draft budget.
Above and beyond our amendments, we also simplified the administration and made the use of the funds more efficient, particularly against a background of the Lisbon and GÃ¶teborg goals.
We focused on the unique status of small and medium-sized enterprises and traditional small business activities such as research and development.
Not least, we considered it important to make special mention of the JEREMIE and JESSICA initiatives, to mention but two of the many key points in regional policy.
We also support the Commission in facing the future demographic challenges in Europe, particularly that in some regions and even in entire Member States, population ageing has become a major problem due to declining birth rates.
Family values must be promoted, for example by helping young women to balance family and career responsibilities.
This is forward-looking policy, which must also be reflected in the key areas of regional policy.
