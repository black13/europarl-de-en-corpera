Before I hand over to Commissioner Grybauskaitė, I should like to express my amazement that other Commissioners, whom we have asked to be here, are not present.
There are various reasons: ostensibly our invitations have gone out somewhat too late.
This may be the case and I shall check.
I should like to remind the Commission, however, that by Interinstitutional Agreement it has to be present during the week the European Parliament is in session.
I shall check the matter and I expect that both the Commission and we as Parliament, of course, will honour our commitments under the interinstitutional agreement.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner present, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, to convey this to the Commission.
I have already said as much, incidentally, at the Conference of Presidents.
I do not wish, however, to make any one-sided accusations here, but I shall be checking the matter.
