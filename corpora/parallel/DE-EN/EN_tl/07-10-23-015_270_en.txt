Madam President, Commissioner, in your examples, you specifically mentioned that four Member States had set up emergency call lines.
There have been other issues - I remember the situation with the tsunami at that time - in which those who came into this area, for example to indulge their inclination for paedophilia, were protected by data protection and their relatives and the authorities were unaware who was really affected here.
Is it not time to stop pussyfooting around and start naming these Member States?
'Naming and shaming' would be a suitable method of prompting these Member States to do what they should, so that they finally demonstrate better behaviour.
