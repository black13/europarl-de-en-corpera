Commissioner, I am sure you understand that the way the staffing of the European Union develops in future is a great challenge for us.
Therefore it is very important to Parliament that we are told not only the number of employees and recruitment offices - for I believe you have described these employees as full-time equivalents - but also the exact amounts that are planned for each of the categories and how they are distributed between the countries.
Could you provide us with those statistics?
