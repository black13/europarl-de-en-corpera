You have mentioned the staff screening exercise several times today.
One of the results of the staff screening was that the task of 32% of the Commission's staff is to administer the administration, that is, to provide administrative support and coordination.
That is 11 000 people!
Question: when are you going to draw some conclusions from these numbers?
When are you going to produce an action plan for reducing staff numbers?
