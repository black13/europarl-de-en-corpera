Commissioner, you mentioned the amounts imposed as fines.
These fines are intended to change the behaviour of the companies upon which they are imposed.
What are your observations in this respect?
In view of the occasion, I remember that when you commenced your role as Commissioner you gave us in the Committee on Regional Development the opportunity to discuss the de minimis rule with you.
You responded very quickly then, for which we are very grateful.
Are companies responding as quickly as you did then?
