Commissioner, I would like to ask another question.
My colleague Mr Papastamkos is absolutely right when he says that we must think about preventing European companies being disadvantaged if other countries do not participate in whatever follows the Kyoto system.
There are three possibilities: firstly, the European Union could be the only one to commit to continuing.
That would, of course, put companies under financial strain and disadvantage us.
The second potential scenario is that if other countries do not participate, we will not participate either, although we would then be unable to meet the climate goals we have set ourselves.
The third possibility, if the others do not join this 'Kyoto plus' or post-Kyoto system, would be for us to pass appropriate sanctions.
What exactly might these sanctions look like?
Can you imagine specific sanctions?
