Commissioner, thank you very much for your comments.
Transparency plays an important role in this process.
When are we going to receive the evaluation of the Green Paper survey?
Either there is no evaluation yet, in which case you would have released your paper without an evaluation, or there is an evaluation - I assume that there is - in which case it is high time that it was presented to the public and to Parliament.
Secondly, I am interested to know whether you believe it is really tenable to determine essential matters without amending the basic regulation on the basis of new principles.
Thirdly, why is it that you want to treat 'market' and 'non-market' economies equally?
Fourthly, still talking about Community production, where do you see the percentage threshold for production outside the EU?
