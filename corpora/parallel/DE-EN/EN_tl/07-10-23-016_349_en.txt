on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, this discussion has gone crazy.
We have been talking about falling prices, lowest possible prices and all-time lows for years.
All the speakers who are now bemoaning the fact that prices are rising - finally heading upwards for once - and are calling for measures to hold back the price rises.
We should be happy that the market is functioning, with your help.
With the help of your predecessors, but also of demands made by the European Parliament, the billions of euros that were going into intervention and price stabilisation - the price pressure that ruined market prices on the world market and have caused the countries of the third world to get into difficulty - have been done away with.
Finally this circumstance has been eliminated and we are getting closer to the market, entering a situation that is being exacerbated by the use of corn to produce fuels.
There are many other reasons why such great demand exists on the market at present.
The market reacts, the price goes up and now we, here in the European Parliament, as representatives of the farmers, are asking for prices to be brought down again.
I have never been involved in anything so ridiculous in all my 20 to 25 years in Parliament!
That is why I applauded Mr Busk.
We should be delighted with this situation.
Of course we have to be watchful on behalf of those who cannot afford to buy food at normal prices.
We have to hold unjust wage rates and misguided social policies in any country accountable, but we cannot take measures to put food in the mouths of the poor at the expense of farmers who, in recent years, have left farming in their hundreds of thousands.
This is not the right way to be talking!
I am glad that we can even discuss the situation here today and that we have a market in which prices are finally increasing.
