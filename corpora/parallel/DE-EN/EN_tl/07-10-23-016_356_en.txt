Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful that we can have this debate today with the Commissioner.
As commodities prices increase, people are paying more attention to agriculture again.
The situation is due, on the one hand - as already mentioned by the Commissioner and some of the previous speakers - to demand from third countries and on the other, to crop failures in traditional agricultural exporting countries such as Australia and New Zealand.
Therefore it is essential that we mobilise all the resources that we have in Europe.
I have now determined, for example during my visit to Romania, that at least a third of the total cultivatable land is lying idle, as it always has.
We have considerable resources within our Member States.
A first step would surely be to stop letting land lie fallow.
As already stated, as a farmer, I believe wholeheartedly that the first priority should be to produce healthy food, the second priority to produce fodder and the third priority to produce energy materials.
Ultimately, however, I believe that the slight price increase for our farmers does not in any way bring the price adjustment that would make up for the losses of recent decades.
As many of those who have already spoken have pointed out, we are getting perhaps 10% more in primary materials prices, but retailers are marking that up by 40-50% in some instances.
I am thinking of butter, for example, and this does not seem fair to me.
One way for us farmers to respond would be to organise ourselves better into producer cooperatives with production contracts, in order to meet the food retailer monopolies head on.
