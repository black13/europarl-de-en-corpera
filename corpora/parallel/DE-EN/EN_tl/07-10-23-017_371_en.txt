on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to wish you a happy birthday, Mr Florenz, albeit belatedly.
We know that smoking kills.
Every year, it causes the deaths of 650 000 people, and a further 79 000 adults die as a result of passive smoking.
We are delighted with the energy and commitment that the Commission has shown on this and are pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear, firm proposals.
We also have the majority of citizens behind us.
Almost 70% of them do not smoke, most smokers want to quit and Eurobarometer has clearly shown that 86% of those surveyed want a ban on smoking in the workplace, while 84% are for a ban on smoking indoors and 77% want no smoking at all in restaurants.
We are therefore very concerned about the amendments introduced by the rapporteur, because Amendment 3 would signify a definite dilution of this strong report by our committee.
It basically means a ban with exceptions, and we all know what happens with exceptions - they quickly become the rule.
Take Germany, for example, where we have seen that progress has been made thanks to stipulations made by Brussels and the debate at European level.
It would be fatal for the EU to cease championing this cause of behalf of consumers in the area of health protection and if we failed to see it through.
Therefore, I hope that we reject Amendment 3 tomorrow and that we stand up for robust European health protection so that we can finally achieve a smoke-free zone throughout Europe.
