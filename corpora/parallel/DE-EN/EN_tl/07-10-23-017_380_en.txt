Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations to our rapporteur.
My primary concern is the protection of workers.
I join with all Members who want the Member States to respond quickly, and that is what we are doing with this resolution.
Results to date show that it has worked in some Member States but not in my own.
When it comes to the protection of workers, the question is, 'what steps can the European Commission take to prevent the creation of first- and second-class citizens?'
How have the Member States reacted to this discussion so far?
Are they for pushing ahead with worker protection at European level and for taking actions and measures such as a ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars?
Most of us approach this topic based on our situation and we often forget that we should be thinking about the workers who have to work under these conditions.
