Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only with regard to protecting non-smokers, but also in other matters, I believe we should not take the EU's powers to extremes.
What are we really talking about here?
Surely the point is to initiate discussion about a potentially smoke-free Europe, not to wage a crusade against people who consume a product that is legal in Europe.
However, some of the contributions to this discussion, and many of the amendments, sound more like a religious war than the debate that I feel would be appropriate.
In the same way, the report stated that this policy should create an environment in which smoking was no longer seen as normal.
I do not believe that it is the task of politicians to teach people how to behave or to dictate to people what they should think.
We should keep things in perspective when it comes to the question of what the EU should regulate and what it should not.
Regulations structuring the tax systems of individual Member States are not part of our competence, nor are wide-ranging bans on smoking.
Put simply, the Member States have not given us that authority.
Even though there is a trend towards non-smoking in Europe, to exploit this trend to adopt excessive rules and to ride the wave of public approval is bad form, in my opinion.
We are talking here almost exclusively of bans.
Bans usually only increase the attraction of whatever has been forbidden, especially for young people, the group that we are particularly concerned about.
Instead, we should focus our energy and money on educating people about the harmful consequences of tobacco consumption, targeting each group as individually as possible.
That is the only way to get people to make wise decisions in the long term.
