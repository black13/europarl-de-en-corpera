Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics on the consequences of smoking speak for themselves.
Mr Florenz is right not to tire of pointing out that 650 000 deaths due to active smoking and 80 000 deaths due to passive smoking cost our health system EUR 50 million every year.
There should be no need for us Parliamentarians to discuss effective protection for non-smokers.
Therefore, the discussion is not about 'whether', but 'how' it can be effected.
There are several different models of effective protection for non-smokers in Europe.
Some countries, such as Sweden and Ireland, have imposed a strict ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and in public buildings; others have provided for narrow exemptions.
We should respect these different models.
In principle, therefore, I think that protection of non-smokers is a matter for the Member States.
The rapporteur proposes that Europe should intervene in the event that Member States fail to provide effective protection of non-smokers in the workplace.
However, where these rules are infringed, I favour the EU keeping to the framework of EU powers regarding occupational safety and health.
I also advocate recognition of the existing rules in the Member States.
Functioning, existing national rules in the area of protection of non-smokers must be able to be retained.
Member States that are well along the way should be rewarded; we need to recognise the effort they have made.
We should take national differences and regional distinctiveness into account on a case by case basis, and accept them.
However, this must still ensure sufficient special protection for children and young people, and for non-smokers.
We do not want to water down the protection of non-smokers.
This will achieve a high level of health protection while adhering to the principle of subsidiarity and respecting the interests and regional differences of Member States.
