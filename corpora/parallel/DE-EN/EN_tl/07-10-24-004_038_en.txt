Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's resolution on Turkey, the European Parliament is sending out a positive signal and has thus entered a new phase of constructive dialogue in its relations with Turkey.
Turkey is currently involved in an intense debate about internal reforms.
Turkey now has a government in power which has a clear popular mandate and can set to work.
This is a chance to give fresh impetus to the accession process in several key areas.
Calling for additional requirements to be met which are not part of the accession negotiations is counterproductive.
In Turkey, the development of a new constitution is now the highest priority.
The outline of this constitution is already discernible.
The call for the revision of Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code is being considered by the Turkish side.
Turkey now needs further positive signals from the EU.
We must encourage Turkey to continue this reform process with great zeal.
The Commission's progress report is expected on 7 November, and I think it is very important that the current positive developments in Turkey are reflected in that report.
