on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, stability and development in Europe and the world are impossible without sensible cooperation between the European Union and Russia.
What would I like to see, in contrast to Samara?
What I would like is for you to come back and tell us that you have a common strategy with Russia for the resolution of the Kosovo problem and a common strategy for the peace process in the Middle East, and that you have a common position on the nuclear problem in Iran and a common strategy to solve the Transnistria problem.
It is not just about energy supplies.
Let us forget about Galileo.
Industry does not want it, and the taxpayers are supposed to foot the bill.
Let us work with Russia on a sensible energy policy using new technologies.
Let us solve the problem of visa-free travel with Russia.
Why have we still not made much progress here, only for these specific groups?
In my view, there is a great deal that could be done.
What will be the European Union's position on the missile shield?
Will we stand with Russia and say that we do not want a US defence shield?
I think it would be wonderful if we could achieve that.
Of course, we also have to be critical of Russia and tell Russia that if I speak out against the anti-terrorism plans being forged by Mr Sch√§uble and Mr Jung in Germany, then I must also say to Russia that I do not want this anti-discrimination law.
That is quite clear.
If our view is that the situation in Chechnya is completely at odds with human rights, we need to make that very clear to the Russians, but we also need to follow up on it afterwards.
I think that if we have a sensible partnership agreement, this is something that good partners can and must say to each other.
We need Russia and Russia needs us, and we will go forward together if we put all the issues on the table and, above all, outline ways of resolving them.
