Now and in the past, the EU and Russia have been linked by their common history, strong economic and political contacts and shared traditions.
Their close cooperation has deepened further through the ongoing process of globalisation and the European countries' growing demand for fossil fuels.
In order to safeguard energy supplies in future too, the EU Member States have relied on more intensive cooperation in this sector since the 1990s.
The Energy Charter is a key instrument in this context.
This treaty serves to promote the development of the Eastern European countries' energy potential while guaranteeing the EU Member States' continued energy supply.
As the line between foreign policy/external trade issues and energy supply issues is becoming increasingly blurred, Russia's failure to ratify the Energy Charter is worrying.
In this respect, the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights must never be put at risk, also in the EU's external relations.
In light of the strong economic interdependence between the EU and Russia, threatening economic gestures can never be a useful means by which to achieve foreign policy objectives and must therefore be rejected.
I urge the Commission and the Council to withstand Russian attempts to secure unilateral advantages in the European energy markets.
Full reciprocity in market liberalisation and protection of investments must be safeguarded.
