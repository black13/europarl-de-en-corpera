in writing. - We already have a major problem with organised criminal gangs and illegal immigrants who tend to congregate in border areas where they are also easier to apprehend than in cities.
Both groups are already on the starting blocks and are intent on crossing into other countries as soon as the borders open, where they will vanish without trace.
We must respond to this situation with increased cross-border cooperation and intensive checks in border regions.
The expansion of Schengen is, after all, a major responsibility for all the countries involved.
Accession to Schengen should therefore not be made solely dependent on the functionality of the Schengen Information System, which is something Poland, for example, does not yet appear to have achieved.
Instead, we must ensure that future members of Schengen are able to assert effective control of the EU's external borders, that there is no softening of the transition periods for the protection of labour markets, and that begging does not increase any further.
Until this is guaranteed, over-hasty and ill-considered expansion must not be allowed to occur.
According to the FRONTEX Annual Report for 2006, the apprehension figures at Schengen's current external borders (mainly Austria and Germany) are still far higher than those at the EU's external borders, so it is highly doubtful whether the expansion should be approved.
Indeed, the question is whether Schengen should not be abolished in part, especially since the Austrian Interior Ministry's report on human trafficking indicates that almost 50% of illegals in Austria have entered the country across the Schengen border with Italy.
