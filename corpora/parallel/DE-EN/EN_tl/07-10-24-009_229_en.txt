in writing. - In principle, we all agree that we need better energy efficiency and more rational energy transmission and that the expansion of renewables is important.
Nonetheless, the promotion of renewables must not be used as a pretext to curtail even more of the Member States' sovereign rights by the back door as part of the EU's Constitution.
As this point is not made sufficiently clear in the present report, the report must be rejected.
Despite the ongoing expansion of renewable energy sources, we will remain dependent on conventional energy generation for many decades to come, and we must therefore ensure that it becomes more environmentally friendly.
In the EU, however, there still appears to be a fixation with nuclear power, which is not only reflected in its glowing description as an 'environmentally friendly source of energy', which itself is a mockery, but also in the generous funding of the nuclear research budget.
I see in this a failure to rethink our approach in any discernible way, which is another reason why I reject the report which is the subject of the vote.
