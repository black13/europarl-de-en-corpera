in writing. - The Reul report is an apology for the nuclear industry.
Flying in the face of common sense, nuclear energy is depicted as the technology of the future, with even more EU research funding and budgetary resources to flow into the development of this high-risk dinosaur technology.
Indeed, despite the recent 'incidents' at Vattenfall's nuclear plants, the focus is on expanding nuclear energy in Europe.
In light of these incidents, it is extremely cynical to claim that nuclear energy generation is becoming 'ever-safer'.
Instead of continuing to invest in this troublesome energy form, with a deliberate failure to address the issue of final storage, a social and ecological revolution should finally be the aim.
This means breaking apart the private monopolies which exist in the nuclear industry, providing a massive injection of funding for renewables and localising energy production.
Given that it is the nuclear companies, in particular, which have initiated a new round of massive price increases, there is an urgent need for action.
The report merely serves the profit interests of Europe's nuclear industry.
The call for new nuclear power plants in Europe is unacceptable.
The legal basis for funding for an indefinite period is to be enshrined in the Reform Treaty.
This is yet another reason to reject the Treaty.
Every additional cent for EU nuclear funding is one too many.
Promoting energy production from renewable resources, solar, wind and hydro power, is the only sustainable energy policy.
