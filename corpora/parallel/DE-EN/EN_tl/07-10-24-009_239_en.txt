Madam President, I voted against the Davies report because, in my view, we have taken what is, in essence, an unacceptable and unrealistic decision by envisaging uniform CO2 efficiency categories for cars.
There should have been a sliding scale based on size and weight, primarily to level the playing field for manufacturers in the European Union.
Let me give you an example: it makes a difference whether I heat a house or just one room.
That is why it also makes a difference whether I drive a large car or a small car.
That is why there needs to be segmentation and a sliding scale based on weight.
We have missed that opportunity, which I think is regrettable, and with this decision - which I did not support - we have also missed the opportunity to establish a measure of balance between the interests of the environment and those of industry.
