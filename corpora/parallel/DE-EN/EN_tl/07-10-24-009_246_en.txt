in writing. - I voted against Mr Davies' report on the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles.
Having initially voted in favour of the report in the direct voting in plenary, I then withdrew my vote in writing, as noted in the parliamentary records of 25 October 2007.
In my view, the report is extremely arbitrary and fails to take appropriate account of the needs of Germany's automobile industry or environmental concerns.
For example, the report does not differentiate between the various weight classes of vehicles and therefore makes unrealistic demands of car manufacturers.
As regards advertising, an increasing comparison is made between labelling needs for tobacco products and vehicles.
The rapporteur (Mr Davies, an English Green Liberal) was only prepared to compromise on one point at the very end of the process during the deliberations on his report.
This was much too late to formulate a sensible recommendation from Parliament which could have secured the support of all the groups.
