in writing. - I voted in favour of the proposals to introduce a binding average emissions ceiling, albeit with some concern.
In my view, a sliding scale based on the size and weight of the vehicle would have been preferable.
Although I otherwise tend to be in favour of voluntary commitments from industry, I believe that binding legal requirements are essential for the automobile industry: experience has shown that voluntary commitments here would be bound to fail.
As we know, a reduction of around 5% in greenhouse gas emissions from the EU-25 was achieved between 1990 and 2004.
Not for road traffic, however: in stark contrast, this sector saw a rise of 26%.
There is clearly an urgent need for action here, and the car industry must make its contribution to cutting emissions.
The year 2012 for the introduction of the ceiling has been criticised on the grounds that it does not allow a long enough phase-in period.
However, this date has been in discussion for years, and the industry has known what to expect for a very long time.
The issue which we must always consider, however, is balancing environmental interests and the interests of the car industry, as this is also in the interests of jobs and competitiveness in the European Union.
This is a buoyant industry and it is important for the EU.
Without robust industries, we would have no money for environmental programmes!
