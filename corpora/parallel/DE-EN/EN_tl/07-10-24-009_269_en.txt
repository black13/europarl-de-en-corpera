Madam President, yes, I also voted against the report on a smoke-free Europe, although by doing so, I am subjecting myself to what is tantamount to a witch-hunt, even in the House by the way.
That is the reason why so many of our fellow Members simply did not have the courage to vote against the report, even though they do not want this nannying policy either.
Of course I am in favour of protecting non-smokers, children and young people, but a matter of principle is at stake.
Firstly, we have no health policy competence.
That lies with the Member States.
Anything else is a violation of subsidiarity and is a constructed competence at EU level.
Secondly, and more particularly, we have had enough!
We have had enough, ladies and gentlemen!
For years, the EU has waged war on smokers, alcohol and the obese in Europe, apparently on the assumption that our citizens are stupid and need nannying through legislation.
That is precisely what I am opposed to.
The citizens who I represent are not stupid.
A prohibition policy is always counterproductive and my job is to represent people, not nanny them.
