Madam President, I did not vote for the resolution on Turkey because I am greatly concerned that the Turkish Parliament has agreed a military strike against Iraq.
This could not be taken into account in the report, but is a very topical issue.
Taking measures against a terrorist group is rather different from voting to invade a neighbouring country.
It is not in the EU's interests to see any destabilisation of Iraq.
We should be reminding Turkey that, as a candidate country, it should be considering EU interests within the framework of common interests.
This shows that full membership for Turkey - which I do not support, incidentally - with its shared borders with Iran and Iraq would mean a complete redrawing of the political map within the EU.
In my view, we should spare ourselves the associated risks.
