in writing. - I support the resolution on Turkey.
The Turkish Government must be vigorous in implementing reforms at last.
As for the Armenian genocide, although Turkey's admission of this genocide is not part of the Copenhagen criteria, a country which aspires to join the EU must surely face up to the dark side of its history.
Overall, Turkey has a very long way to go before it meets the Copenhagen criteria.
Substantial deficits in relation to human and minority rights, civil and political rights and the general weakness of Turkey's democracy vis-Ã -vis the military still exist.
There is still no progress on the Cyprus issue.
For that reason, we must continue to push, this year, for the ratification of the Ankara Protocol.
Without this, and also without the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island, there can be no solution.
Turkey apparently refuses to understand that there are 27 Member States of the European Union and that one of these is the Republic of Cyprus!
As regards the conflict in the south-east of Turkey, the plan to launch an incursion into northern Iraq has existed at least since spring 2006.
At present, it is to be feared that the invasion will indeed take place.
However, a country which - despite international support for the securing of its borders - claims the right to violate international law as it sees fit disqualifies itself from accession to the European Union once and for all.
