on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to extend my warm thanks to the rapporteur for his sound and comprehensive work.
We very much welcome the fact that the European Parliament makes clear and regular contributions to the political debate about the situation in South-East Europe.
Serbia plays, and has played, a prominent role in this region.
That is why it is essential to underline, time and again, that Serbia's future lies within the EU and that we are good and reliable partners.
However, it takes at least two to build a partnership, and so I appeal to Serbia to continue along the path towards EU integration and to play a constructive role in the resolution of the Kosovo issue.
We expect unlimited cooperation with the Hague Tribunal at last - that point has been made several times - and compliance with the criteria of European standards.
I very much hope that the better opportunities for travel will also make a contribution here and bring about improvements in the future.
What I cannot endorse, however, are the proposals that have occasionally been made to apply different standards to EU accession.
I am pleased that the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the representative of the Council take the same view, especially as we paid dearly for this not long ago.
I have great understanding for the difficult and painful position in which Serbia finds itself, but I repeat, it takes at least two to build a partnership.
