on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Oslo Process offers an historic opportunity to achieve an international agreement - not just a declaration, but an international agreement - banning cluster bombs.
For two decades, there have been campaigns and international initiatives, but they have been repeatedly bogged down in the diplomatic mire of military and economic interests.
Now we have an opportunity to reach an agreement in 2008.
This requires support not only from Parliament, which has a clear position here across all parliamentary groups.
I was very pleased and interested to hear, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, that the Commission also supports this position, which is most welcome.
The Council now needs to follow the clear stance that has been adopted by Parliament and the Commission; that is very important.
It is not just about banning the use and stockpiling of cluster bombs and the trade in these weapons; it is also about production.
We should have a ban on the production of these bombs, and the European Union is still one of the main producers of these weapons.
They are still being manufactured in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in France, in Spain and Belgium.
Legislation has now been adopted in Belgium and Austria to ban production but I know that production has still not stopped entirely in Belgium.
There are loopholes in this legislation as well.
We must press ahead with a ban on these weapons.
The Member States must move forward towards a ban, and the Council must defend the clear position that has been set out here.
That is the only way to ensure that, in 2008, we actually get an agreement.
