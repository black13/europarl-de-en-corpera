on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, the first time I dealt personally with this issue was during NATO's war of aggression against Yugoslavia, one of the wars which I opposed and which like many other wars was waged by Western countries.
Some 98% of the victims of cluster bombs are civilians.
Between 5 and 40% of the submunitions of cluster bombs do not explode.
Let me be blunt: it is mainly the major Western industrialised countries which produce and equip their armies with fragmentation bombs and deploy cluster bombs in wars.
There are 34 countries which produce cluster bombs, including 13 EU Member States.
Cluster bombs are a factor in wars being waged by EU countries, for example in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, so please, let us not shed any crocodile tears here!
The EU must bite the bullet.
In specific terms, this means that we need the European Union to adopt a common position condemning these murderous weapons.
That means an end to the production of cluster bombs, and of course no use of fragmentation bombs as occurred in the Gulf War, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon.
It cannot be allowed to continue.
