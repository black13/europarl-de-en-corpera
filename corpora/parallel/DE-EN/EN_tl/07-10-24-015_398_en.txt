Mr President, first of all, let me say that I think it is very good that we can now sit together down here.
I think that is a very good idea.
As to the question itself, I would like to say a few words about the fires, Minister, which in some cases are due to natural causes but in others are started deliberately.
This fire-starting is encouraged by the legal position in some countries because it offers certain advantages to certain people.
Has any thought been given to the possibility of bringing pressure to bear on these countries to change the legal position so that this incentive no longer exists in future?
