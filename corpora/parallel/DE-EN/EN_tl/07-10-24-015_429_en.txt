Mr President-in-Office, you have mentioned the Barnier report several times.
This report has prompted fears among the aid organisations because it seems to provide for quasi-military leadership structures or preliminary decision-making at military level.
Is the Council aware of these fears about the 'militarisation' of this civil protection force, and how can, and will the Council, respond to these concerns?
