Mr President, every victim is of course equally important, and so I welcome this inquiry.
However, Professor Hoti really was very well-known.
I am in close contact with his family.
He was the closest aide of Ibrahim Rugova, our Sakharov Prize Laureate, and he has been formally detained by the Serbs.
In that case, they must have some knowledge of his whereabouts!
This is an issue which has to be clarified formally with the government in Belgrade, with the involvement of the Council.
What does the Serbian Government have to say about the whereabouts of its prisoner, for whom it has assumed responsibility, given that it is holding him in custody?
