rapporteur. - Madam President, now that Mrs Lulling has addressed me directly, may I say that just because others are doing things badly, that should not be a role model for us.
The fact that debates are still being conducted at this hour or even later in the national parliaments does not improve the situation here.
It is a bitter experience, when one makes reform proposals, to find that others are constantly blocking them with reference to something else.
My second point is this: there was no delay, Mrs Lulling.
At most, there were misunderstandings.
The delay to which I have referred was the unfortunate coincidence of several matters having to be dealt with simultaneously.
As to my third point, I stand by my opinion.
I believe that, from a political and, indeed, a democratic perspective, it is not sensible to hold so-called debates at such a late hour, and I look forward to seeing the Commissioner again with our mutual friend Mr Staffler in the Hotel Laurin in Bolzano and conducting a dialogue there.
I think it is very likely that political progress will be made on that occasion rather than here, given that there are now just three of us plus the Commissioner - yes, let me repeat that, just three of us - engaging in pseudo-debates with each other at this ungodly hour.
