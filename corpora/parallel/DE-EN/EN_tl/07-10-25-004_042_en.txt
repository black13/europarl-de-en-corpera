Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - I am extremely grateful to you for this statement, Mr President, and also to the Conference of Presidents.
It is a serious matter when the European Parliament - the chamber of the people at the European level - is excluded from the legislative process relating to a regulation on European political parties.
That is truly a subject that concerns all of us here, whatever our party affiliation.
It is unthinkable that the bureaucracies in some finance ministries and then their governments should decide on this issue rather than the people's representative assembly of the EU.
We should not stand for that!
With regard to the budget for 2008, let me say that the national governments have wishes which they can only fulfil together with us.
When dealing with the 2008 budget, this Parliament should remember what the Council decided yesterday with regard to this Regulation on the European political parties.
Thank you for your statement.
We have not seen the end of this issue.
