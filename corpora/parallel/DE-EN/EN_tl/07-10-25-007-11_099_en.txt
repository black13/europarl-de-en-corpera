Mr President, I wanted to say a word on this amendment.
We had to make a correction there, and I ask Mr Sch√∂pflin and other Members to vote in favour, because there was a mistake in the original text.
1992 is the wrong year.
We would keep that mistake in the recommendation if we did not vote for Mr Kacin's amendment.
Let us please vote for this amendment.
- Before the vote on Amendment 29
