in writing. - Besides the important discussion of unfair trade policies, the report on the state of relations between the EU and Africa also deals with the prevention and resolution of conflicts.
In this context I should like to refer to the last colony in the world, the last colony in Africa, namely the Western Sahara, which has been occupied by Morocco for more than 30 years.
This occupation infringes international law and is accompanied by flagrant violations of human rights.
When we champion the human rights of the Saharawi people and their right of self-determination, we often hear that we are adopting a pro-Saharawi stance.
That is an appalling attitude, for our sole aim is to uphold human rights and international law.
All European institutions should be devoted to this cause and not merely pursue the economic interests of the Member States.
Europe needs to adopt a credible stance against dictatorships.
Wagging our finger at a few selected dictatorships damages the credibility of the Union as a peace broker, and damages those who suffer oppression and are subjected daily to gross violations of their human rights.
