author. - Madam President, the attack to which this resolution relates was targeted against a diplomatic solution to the situation in Sudan.
The context is quite important, because the attack occurred shortly before Desmond Tutu was due to conduct meaningful talks in Darfur.
It seems obvious that the attack was deliberately timed to thwart the quest for a diplomatic solution, which is so desperately needed in that region.
There followed lengthy speculation, of course, as to the identity of the rebel group that had carried out the attack, which claimed the lives of ten soldiers from the AU peacekeeping force.
The signs seem to indicate that the most likely perpetrators were a pro-Western rebel group.
When we deal with the Darfur issue, it is important not to focus too narrowly, but to remember that the most widely diverse rebel groups from the Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic are operating there in addition to the local armed forces on both sides.
I find it very revealing that the attempt made by the European Union to act on the Darfur conflict through the Chad mission is effectively in a sorry state at the present time.
At the start, the talk was about sending an EU force there.
In fact, a French force with a few additional troops has been sent there under the EU banner.
I have not yet been able to obtain any proper information about that force's actual area of operation.
Although we are still being told that the force is essentially there to protect refugees, most of the refugees are to be found in the border area, which is precisely where the Government of Chad does not want the EU force deployed.
Perhaps the Commissioner can assist again with some information.
What the EU is doing at the moment is definitely not what is needed to defuse the present situation We have to say very clearly that the very thing Desmond Tutu wanted, namely a diplomatic solution, is what we ought to be supporting here.
