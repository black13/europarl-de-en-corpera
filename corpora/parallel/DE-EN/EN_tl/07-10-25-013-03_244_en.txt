author. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the facts are known: there was an attack on the AU peacekeeping force on 30 September; ten soldiers lost their lives, eight were seriously injured, and forty are still missing.
I was in Darfur with a delegation from our Parliament in July.
During our visit we met representatives of AMIS, the African Union Mission in Sudan.
It was, and still is, an incredibly difficult mission, as we heard from some of these AMIS representatives.
For example, one of the commanders, a Nigerian general, told us that he felt as though he were a priest rather than a soldier.
All he could do, he said, was appeal to people to refrain from evil acts; he had no real mandate to act, and so it is hardly surprising that rebel factions have exploited this weakness.
The West is not focusing sharply enough on Africa.
There is an imbalance between the extent of the tragedy in Darfur and the level of attention we devote to it.
Military operations in Africa are all very well, but there is a danger of Africa becoming a testing ground for that type of mission.
When the EU conducts operations there, its forces must be armed with a robust mandate, appropriate equipment and sufficient manpower.
The duration of the mission must also depend on its objectives.
We must not hide behind others, but must fulfil our own obligations.
This applies to the funding of AMIS and to support ranging from logistics and military equipment to personnel.
Above all, however, we need the political will of everyone, and it is my opinion that peace in Darfur and the whole of Sudan can be achieved only in cooperation with China.
