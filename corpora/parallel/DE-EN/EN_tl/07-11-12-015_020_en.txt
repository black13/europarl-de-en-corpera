The final draft of the agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 November pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed to you.
The following amendments have been requested to this draft agenda:
Tuesday:
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the shipping accidents in the Black Sea be placed on the agenda for Tuesday afternoon, after Mr Leinen's report, with a corresponding extension of the afternoon sitting until 6.30 p.m.
This would mean that questions to the Commission would not commence until 6.30 p.m. and would thus be half an hour shorter.
Who would like to justify the motion?
If there is nobody to speak for or against this motion, that is the end of the matter.
(The motion lapsed)
Wednesday:
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance requests that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Georgia be included and dealt with in a joint debate with the report by Mr Obiols i Germ√† and Mr Tannock, and that the afternoon sitting therefore be extended to 6.30 p.m. and questions to the Council shortened by half an hour.
They also request that the debate on Georgia be concluded with the tabling of motions for resolutions and that voting on the matter be carried out during the November part-session in Brussels.
Who would like to justify the motion?
