Mr President, there is not much for me to justify: it is obvious to all what is happening in Georgia, and it is clear that we should include Georgia when we are discussing neighbourhood policy.
This should be laid down, so that the Council knows what is what.
Then we should quietly proceed with preparing a resolution, for I believe it is important that the European Parliament formulate a clear resolution on the events in Georgia.
This should then be adopted in Brussels.
That is the correct formal procedure and I hope that all Members will agree to it, so that we can proceed in this way.
