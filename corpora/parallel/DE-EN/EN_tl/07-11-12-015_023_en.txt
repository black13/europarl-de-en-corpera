Mr President, we wish to support this for a very important reason.
The Rose Revolution in Georgia brought many positive elements with it, especially after the Shevardnadze regime.
Now there is a great danger that the undoubted successes will be destroyed if the opposition's criticisms are not addressed.
An initiative by the European Parliament could help President Saakashvili to get back on the right track; that is, to begin dialogue with the opposition.
I should also like to ask you, Mr President, to maintain contact with the Speaker of Parliament, who is also very active there, and to try to convince her, too, to follow the path of dialogue.
That is the point of this debate and also of the resolution, and I therefore support it wholeheartedly.
(Parliament adopted the motion)
