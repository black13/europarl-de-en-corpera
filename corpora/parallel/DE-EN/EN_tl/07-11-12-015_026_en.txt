Mr Andria, please bear with me.
I called very clearly for Members who wanted to justify the motion.
There was no response.
Nor were those responsible for managing the procedure in the room at that point.
I looked around very carefully, and there was no contribution to be heard at all, either to justify or to support the motion, and so the House agreed that it was not necessary for anyone to speak against it if it was not justified.
Those of us up here agreed, as did the plenary, that this motion thus lapsed and is no longer on the agenda.
Therefore I ask that we now proceed as has just been decided.
