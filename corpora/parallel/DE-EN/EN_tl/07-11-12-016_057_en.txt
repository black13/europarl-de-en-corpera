Mr President, we saw only recently the fourth anniversary of the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, who has heart problems and is suffering from hepatitis.
It is unacceptable that these two men remain in prison in the Siberian city of Chita, in violation of Russian law.
For spurious reasons, their applications for early release, which is possible under Russian law, were overruled, despite good behaviour.
This was clearly a step designed to keep opposition to a minimum before next year's election.
When our group visited Moscow two weeks ago, I met with Mr Khodorkovsky's lawyer, Mr Yuri Schmidt.
We also met with various other representatives of Memorial, with Garry Kasparov and Grigory Yavlinsky, all of whom confirmed that the Yukos problem is very much a political one.
I therefore call upon the EU to address human rights violations more intensively and clearly in its dialogue with Russia.
What matters here is not retribution, but humanity and justice.
