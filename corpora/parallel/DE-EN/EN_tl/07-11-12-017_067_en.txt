Madam President, I asked for the floor before the report was announced.
The President in the chair before you called upon a large number of Members - as part of the catch-the-eye procedure - who were not even present in the House.
For that, he was reprimanded by the Rules of Procedure incarnate, Mr Corbett.
I tried to speak dozens of times, and also handed in my request, but was ignored.
I believe that what the President in the chair before you has just done is contrary to the rules of this House and unworthy of this Parliament.
