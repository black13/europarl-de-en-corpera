Madam President, there was of course the European Year of Education through Sport, and I think that we can and should go back to many of the conclusions that Year brought us in the way of insights.
We have already adopted some resolutions on various matters.
There is still much on the agenda, including the report by Mr Schmitt, and I think we have a great deal of material to hand in order to illustrate and confirm everything that is now being discussed; that is, how important sport is and what we should learn and take from it.
But not enough is happening in sport - I mean, not enough is happening for sport.
People are more aware of health, but obesity and diabetes are on the increase, especially amongst children.
We have spoken a great deal about teacher training, and I think that we have to begin with primary school.
There are no specialist PE teachers in primary schools - at least I know that is true of my country - instead, teachers with general training are used to teach PE as well.
Specially trained teachers are needed here as well, so as to begin as early as possible.
I believe that cooperation between associations, schools and public authorities is very important.
Associations do a lot in the way of education and training work with children, and receive far too little support.
They all struggle financially with too little money, while in fact their services are invaluable.
I am proud of the project currently operating in Austria in which sporting administrators have managed to get into schools and increase the physical education offered, in cooperation with teachers and each state's school organisations.
There is a particular focus on the children's aptitudes and abilities.
I believe it is very important to involve the parents.
We cannot and must not leave everything to public bodies; instead we must also make people aware that nutrition and physical activity are important for children.
It is important to start with the parents here, too.
