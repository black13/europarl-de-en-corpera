Madam President, congratulations to Mr Schmitt on his own-initiative report.
I hold the opposing view to Mr Lundgren.
Unfortunately, in school matters, the European Union is being restrained by the Member States, for any objective analysis of the problem quickly reveals how vital it is that the approach to different aspects of schooling be harmonised.
PE is part of this, in the same way as training in creative thinking or social involvement.
Mr Schmitt's report concentrates on PE.
While in the USA only very sporty students who also have excellent grades get a place at a good university, in Europe it is exactly the other way around.
The higher the level of schooling, the less time there is for young people to be involved in sport.
PE has a lowly status in the world of school.
Sport is regarded as being only a leisure activity, and that is a mistake.
Sport enables people to overcome mental limits, and that is exactly what we need in Europe.
These days, people often manage to have a career in sport despite school, and not because of school.
That is an error in our system, one that the present report brings to our notice.
Finally, I should like to speak up for a community that cannot do so here for itself.
Due to the political situation in their country, young sportspeople in the Turkish part of Cyprus cannot take part in international competitions.
They hope that the European Union will bring an end to their isolation.
By now, more than three years since Cyprus joined the European Union, if a solution is not already in place, at least a proposal for one should be under consideration.
