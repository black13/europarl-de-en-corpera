Madam President, I would not have asked for the floor again had not the Commissioner tried to play the victim in his closing remarks.
Commissioner, you must come to terms with the fact that you are in a European forum in which you have a specific obligation to be very careful about what you say, and what you said in the Il Messaggero interview was factually incorrect.
No authority in Europe has the right to go into some camp, ask a person 'How do you make your living?' and deport the person if they cannot answer immediately.
That is completely and utterly wrong, but that is what you said in the interview with Il Messaggero, so do not get into a huff when it is pointed out to you.
