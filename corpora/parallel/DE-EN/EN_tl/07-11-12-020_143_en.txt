on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, we stand for a definite 'yes' to EU-wide soil protection.
We have heard that soil is our most important non-renewable resource.
Soil deterioration costs the EU more than EUR 38 billion every year.
In Germany, only 2% of the soil is still in its natural condition.
Twelve per cent of soils in the EU are affected by erosion.
Soil deterioration does not respect national borders.
Thus we are in the process of pulling the rug out from under our own feet by the way we are currently using our soils.
The EU proposal was good; it went in the right direction, and we should have liked to improve it.
I know that the rapporteur fought for it, but unfortunately the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety watered down and further spoiled a great many points of the proposal under pressure from the conservatives and the agricultural lobby.
I cannot understand why we in the Committee on the Environment have agreed to maintain secrecy about soil containing inherited contamination.
I hope we shall still be able to correct this tomorrow.
It runs counter to transparency and also to the Aarhus Convention.
We also know that climate change and good-quality soil go hand in hand, that soil is an important carbon dioxide pool and is continually losing this ability to bind CO2.
Because of the watering down that has happened in the Committee on the Environment, I fear that an ambitious Soil Protection Directive is, unfortunately, impossible.
However, we need effective soil protection with a shared timeframe and common criteria.
In short, we need effective, specific goals to put a stop to the deterioration of soils in the European Union.
We must not give up on creating something that is legally binding because of this so-called compromise.
Only legally binding measures will enable us to set an ambitious soil strategy in motion.
