Madam President, I am another representative who believes that soil protection is very definitely a task for the European Union, and that the European Parliament should therefore adopt this Framework Directive.
Nor, to be honest, do I understand the comments that have been made about how the different soil types in our Member States have not been taken into account.
I am going to read this Directive through again and try to see what the other Members are referring to, for I did not notice these inflexible measures and proposals.
I should also like to mention the role of agriculture, for, in my view, the compromise amendment by the various parties is very important.
It requires the Member States, when using soil for agricultural purposes, to encourage crops and afforestation methods that could have a beneficial effect on soil organic matter and soil fertility and thus prevent landslides and desertification.
Likewise, agricultural methods that prevent the compaction and erosion of soils should also be supported.
We know that very often agriculture causes problems for soil quality, and I believe that this clarification is absolutely vital.
I do not believe that the 'support for agriculture, no matter what' formula is sufficient to protect soils at regional, national, or even European level.
