in writing. - In the light of the recent agreement on the Reform Treaty, the European Parliament, and with it the whole EU, must support and strengthen this renewed confirmation of a spirit of closeness to citizens and of the protection of subsidiarity, starting with the current initiatives.
The present proposal on the Soil Protection Framework Directive does not do justice to this intention.
The bureaucracy required in connection with it bears no relation to the actual usefulness of the Directive, and there is no way it can be justified to the citizens of Europe.
Quite the contrary, it runs counter to the decision of the European Council to reduce bureaucracy at EU level by 25% by 2012.
Soil is first and foremost a local resource.
Effective soil protection must, therefore, be carried out at the most suitable levels - at the regional or local level.
Only at these levels can the very wide range of soil characteristics be dealt with comprehensively.
Despite the extensive improvements made by the rapporteur, I reject this proposal, because it infringes the principle of subsidiarity.
Some Member States already have extremely good regulations, which could even be weakened by this Directive.
If necessary, the open-coordination method could provide a solution.
