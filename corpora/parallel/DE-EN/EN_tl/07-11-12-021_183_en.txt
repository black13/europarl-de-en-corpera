Mr President, it is always interesting to hear how some Members refuse to accept reality.
I find the Commission proposal good.
I also believe that Mr Liese has further improved it.
This is a classic case of the internalising of external costs.
Markets can function only if we create the right framework conditions.
We have all undertaken to apply the 'polluter pays' principle, but this also means that those who bring the costs into being must also pay the price.
This means including all costs, and that includes the environmental costs brought about by the CO2 emissions of aircraft.
I also believe that we must bring more courage and ambition to this matter.
We all know that for all of us, including many people in the United Kingdom, doing nothing in this case would be much more expensive than taking this step.
However, we must also be fair.
All sectors must contribute to this system.
We know that CO2 emissions at a great height have a much more damaging effect than CO2 emissions on the ground.
This must also be taken into account when we are talking about including these aircraft emissions.
In addition, this is a sector that is characterised by very high growth rates.
Secondly, we must also say that we have the potential to introduce various management measures to further limit these CO2 emissions.
That must also be taken into account.
The Community has an obligation to function as a role model in the international arena.
We cannot expect other countries to get on board if we are not setting a good example.
I also believe that we have significant opportunities here to build on the competitive advantage in this particular sector that we already have to some degree, so we should provide innovative companies, in particular, with the support they require.
