Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapidly growing aviation sector must be integrated into the emissions trading scheme as quickly as possible.
That will mean that this form of transport also starts making a contribution to the reduction of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect.
From the point of view of transport policy, our legislative task now is to refine the framework conditions.
These framework conditions must be defined in such a way that the possible impetus for savings is provided via an appropriate price per tonne of CO2, without drastically limiting the number of flights.
To achieve this, when the airlines are first issued with allowances, for example, this must be done in such a way that the lack of such allowances can be realistically balanced out on the market, otherwise flights would have to be cancelled, and I do not know how much of that we and our society could cope with.
Even if airlines were issued with 100% allowances upon entering the scheme - and none of us is asking for that - an annual growth in aviation of 5% would require an equally high volume of savings in terms of CO2 emissions.
That is no small challenge.
The greatest potential for reduction is in the realisation of the Single European Sky, which means that it depends on the political will of the Member States.
The airlines' only option for the time being, therefore, is to update their fleets, if there is sufficient capital left over for this purpose after the planned auction sums are taken into account.
That will hardly be the case for regional airlines.
