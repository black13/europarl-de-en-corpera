Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, many thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his good report, and to Mr Jarzembowski.
I believe that, overall, the compromises are very workable.
Politics often depends on symbols, and we are sending a clear signal here: it is the first legislative proposal since the Spring Summit.
Thus we are beginning actively to implement climate protection.
The seven key points of this report - the commencement of emissions trading, the reference period, the number of permits, the use of the proceeds, exceptions for smaller aircraft and the method of calculation - have, in my view, been sufficiently and reliably addressed in the compromises.
I do not wish for any derogations, although I do believe a special additional arrangement for the outermost regions is required, so that these areas are not disadvantaged.
I believe that the proposal is very good and that competition has been sufficiently acknowledged.
We should not forget: even if 100% of the allowances are auctioned - purely theoretically, as we have just heard - that is a sum of EUR 2 billion, definitely a manageable sum for the airlines, which will, no doubt, have an effect on the setting of prices.
However, I do not envisage any problems with this, including in connection with the large number of flights.
I should like to see the EU push further ahead with this in the context of climate protection, and I hope that we can convince all the other major competing airlines to join this agreement.
