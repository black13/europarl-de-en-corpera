on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, this discussion on comitology has been going on for a long time.
On the basis of the Basel II report, the European Parliament has finally won rights of scrutiny that should actually be normal in a democracy, against huge opposition from the Council and opposition from the Commission.
Now we must attend to adapting the directives accordingly.
Here the focus has been on the question of adapting the relevant directives - and that is understandable.
The question of the extent to which we adapt the directives legislatively is certainly an important aspect.
However, the agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council is about how Parliament can be appropriately involved.
The Commissioner expressed her hope that Parliament will adopt the relevant alignments in the current year.
It is important to us that Parliament be informed about the processes in good time and that the exchange of information to Parliament via the comitology committees take place promptly.
The actual implementation phase is yet to begin and time will tell whether or not this will strengthen the rights of Parliament.
The same applies to requests for urgent debate.
To take one example: accounting is next on the agenda, IFRS 8.
Here the procedure was that we in the comitology process were, unfortunately, only informed by the Commission at the last minute.
Then we were expected to take a decision relatively quickly.
The key, apart from the formal alignment process, will be whether the Commission, the relevant Directorates-General, the officials working in this area, are willing to include Parliament in the work in good time.
Only then will effective scrutiny be possible.
This is where it will be revealed whether the Commission as a whole is for this or not.
