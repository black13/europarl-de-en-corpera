Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the PPE-DE Group is concerned, the objectives for the coming year in the field of the internal market and consumer protection are very clear.
Firstly, we want to see the completion of the internal market through the removal of remaining barriers and obstacles.
That is why, Mr Kyprianou, we welcome your proposal for a health services directive, based on Article 95, which would adopt a very broad-brush approach to the health sector.
We also welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy and his Directorate-General will be looking at further aspects of public procurement as a follow-up to the Services Directive.
Secondly, we want to see comparable standards of consumer protection being established in all Member States of the European Union and, Mrs Kuneva, we greatly welcome your review of all the relevant EU legislation in this area.
We are also pleased that we can act on this review in two directives, firstly in a horizontal instrument and then in a revision directive which will cover all the other areas to be dealt with.
Thirdly, we want to help achieve a situation in which we finally have clearer, simpler and therefore fewer rules in the European Union.
I am turning to you now, Mr Verheugen: as Members of this Parliament we will be looking very closely at all the proposals relating to the free movement of goods from this perspective.
The Toy Safety Directive will come, as will the Construction Products Directive, and I am sure we will see some movement on tractors and defence goods as well.
We hope that we will make tangible progress here.
We are also very much looking forward to your anticipated study on consumer labelling.
Sustainable Europe
