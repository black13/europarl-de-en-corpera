Mr President, the focus on a sustainable Europe arises, among other things, from our priority to protect the climate.
There have been many references today to excessive bureaucracy, over-regulation and the violation of subsidiarity.
It has also been made very clear that these arguments are invariably advanced whenever a new rule or law is unwelcome.
However, in terms of effective climate protection, it is clear that if we had gone ahead 10 years ago and adopted rules to cut CO2 emissions from vehicles, the European Union would now be in a better position and we would not be under the pressure we are now feeling to bring about the effective climate protection that is required.
It is also apparent from the European Commission's various assessments that one of our decisions, namely to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, could be attained simply through compliance with legislation which is already on the statute books, and so my question to the Commission is this: what specific steps are being taken to monitor the implementation of existing legislation?
I have another question which relates to risk assessment on genetically modified organisms, which is also mentioned in the Commission's work programme.
My question is this: what improvements is the Commission trying to make in this area?
As we know from many debates, this is also one of the main points of criticism of our work and of legislation in this field.
