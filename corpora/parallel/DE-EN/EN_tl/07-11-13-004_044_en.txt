Mr President, very briefly, I would like to list what I regard as the most important points arising from this work programme.
Undoubtedly a key theme for 2008 is the Health Check for the common agricultural policy.
The 2003 CAP reform should be reviewed and simplified, we all agree on that, and to that extent I hope, as rapporteur, that the important contributions that we in Parliament make to this own-initiative report will be taken into account in the ensuing legislative proposal.
This Health Check must help us find the right path towards a common agricultural policy for the post-2013 period.
A further project is the planned Green Paper on Agricultural Product Quality.
Quality must become an even greater focus in agriculture, and this applies to farm imports from third countries as well, which must conform to the same standards as those applicable to EU producers.
I am particularly keen on an initiative to promote the consumption of fruit in schools.
This is something which we in the PPE-DE Group have been championing for some time, and we are gratified that the Commission intends to take up this initiative.
Other key issues for 2008 such as the Milk Package, the 2008-2009 Budget Review, the Action Plan on EU Animal Health Strategy and the Review of Support for Less Favoured Areas will certainly make sure that there is no scope for any boredom in Parliament!
