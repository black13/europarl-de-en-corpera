Mr President, the issue of transport and mobility is naturally also viewed as a priority in the programme for 2008.
Of course, we have very clear challenges here.
We must set priorities in 2008 ranging from economic efficiency, impact on the environment and, not least, the rights of users and their safety: issues which can only be touched on briefly here.
The rules on security controls at airports, for example, were introduced in response to pressure from very topical events at the time.
In the PPE-DE Group, we consider that the relevant directive could now be reviewed.
As to passenger rights, this issue could be dealt with conclusively if we were to focus in more detail on the rights of passengers in international coach travel as well.
That would mean that in Europe, passenger rights would be covered in all modes of transport: air travel, rail and road.
As regards trans-European networks, this is a topic which we have discussed on frequent occasions in recent months.
Here, of course, we face a special situation: too little money and a lot of projects, especially now that the Council has announced several new projects in recent weeks.
We take the view that on the issue of trans-European networks, clear decisions must be taken in 2008, and that transboundary routes must have absolute priority so that the so-called bottlenecks disappear, allowing effective application of the principle of multimodal transport.
A swift decision must and could be reached by taking account of those countries where cofinancing is already envisaged and where the projects have got off to a good start on a technical level.
