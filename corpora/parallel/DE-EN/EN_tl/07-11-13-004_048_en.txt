on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we are discussing the programme for 2008, I would like to start by pointing out that we have made major progress in the field of home affairs policy in recent months, and I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Frattini for that.
We have Schengen, and this week in plenary we have taken major steps forward with Pr√ºm, the Visa Information System (VIS) and data protection.
This is major progress.
We cannot leave it at that, however.
Now it is about the practical work for tomorrow.
The key priority for all of us, on a practical basis, is to make major progress with SIS II.
In the PPE-DE Group, our main concern is that after the great success of the enlargement of the Schengen area, fatigue will now set in and many Member States will slip into a state of inertia.
That is something we cannot afford.
We need SIS II as a major project for next year.
In the legislative sphere, I would like to touch upon the border security issue again in particular.
Here, we must consider whether in future the evaluation of external border protection should no longer be carried out by Schengen members' own evaluation teams but by the Frontex agency.
That is where this responsibility should lie.
I would ask the Commission to be brave and, on the proposals regarding migration, to actually define a European added value.
If a proposal is submitted for a Blue Card for highly skilled workers, this should not just be a proposal that endorses national rules and applies a common label: it really has to be a European proposal.
The same applies to combating terrorism.
If a system for the transmission of air passenger records is established, we cannot have 27 individual rules, which we could bring in straight away; we really need a European proposal.
