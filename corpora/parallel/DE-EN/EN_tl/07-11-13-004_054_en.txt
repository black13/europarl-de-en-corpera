on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of budgetary control, the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008 is a disappointment because key issues and problems relating to budgetary control simply do not feature in the programme.
It could be argued that this is about current management, but our concern is this: if we look at the past few years of 'current management', it is clear that in order to solve the problems, the Commission really should have adopted an agenda which went beyond current management.
We are unlikely to make any progress on the statement of assurance, although the Commission should be bringing substantial pressure to bear on the Member States here.
You have our support on this issue, yet we do not see you doing this.
As a result, you are very likely to fall short of your own commitments: commitments which the Commission President himself undertook personally on behalf of this Commission.
He pledged to move forward towards a positive statement of assurance.
We are at least as far from achieving this now as in all the years before, as we have known since yesterday evening.
When it comes to implementing the commitments, what we believe is lacking is a serious approach.
The same applies, incidentally, to the Commission's legislative programme itself.
You should be world champions in practical implementation, not in planning!
Of the 200 items for codification announced for 2007, just 23 have actually been submitted to Parliament to date, and only six of the 43 announced new items have been tabled so far.
The question which arises is this: why are we even talking about this programme if you will not be putting it into practice?
You really need to do better in 2008.
