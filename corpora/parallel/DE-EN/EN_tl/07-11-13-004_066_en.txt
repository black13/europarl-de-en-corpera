on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, 'Europe as a world partner' is a very nice heading for the Commission programme, but what we are really talking about is the European Union, not Europe, and it is presumptuous to use this heading at all, for Europe is far greater than just the European Union.
The EU wishes to present itself as a world partner, and the Commission's programme is very honest about this: it talks about a foreign policy to project, promote and protect - and therefore assert - Europe's interests and values successfully.
How is that supposed to happen?
The answer, increasingly, is by using military means!
The European Union is now a military actor all over the world.
On paper, this is to provide assistance to people, but in practice, EU interests, or the interests of EU Member States, are being asserted by military means.
Congo is a good example.
The EU's military intervention there has ensured that Joseph Kabila, an autocrat who is acceptable to the EU, is now in power, backed by elections, and his opponent has been forced into exile.
A brutal war has erupted in Eastern Congo, with some 350 000 people forced to flee their homes.
The EU's military intervention in Chad, too, has primarily served to bolster the position of military ruler Idriss DÃ©by, an old friend of France.
This type of EU military operation is simply a continuation of Member States' neo-colonial policies.
It seems that it is difficult to voice unadorned criticism of political friends.
Pakistan is a case in point at present.
The basis for all of this is the Reform Treaty, which makes a clearly militarised EU policy possible.
The next issue is Kosovo, and we are seeing what can happen there.
Individual Member States have already announced that they intend to recognise Kosovo on a unilateral basis.
I urge the Commission to reject such measures unequivocally and not to condone any unilateral recognition of Kosovo.
