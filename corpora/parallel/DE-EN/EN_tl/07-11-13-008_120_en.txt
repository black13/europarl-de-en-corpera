in writing. - Although Bulgaria and Romania have managed to achieve accession to the European Economic Area, Brussels is apparently surprised by the lack of progress on combating organised crime and corruption.
These are widespread problems, however, which are rooted in socio-political developments in post-communist countries.
The general public is irked by the anonymity and indifference of capitalism and resorts instead to familiar and tried and tested networks.
This proves, yet again, that social transformation cannot be imposed from outside: something that the US is trying to achieve with its wars of aggression, while the EU dangles the prospect of 'accession'.
The fact is that the latter is losing its effectiveness, forfeiting any opportunity to exert influence once countries have joined the 'club', which is why the EU must not repeat this mistake with Turkey.
