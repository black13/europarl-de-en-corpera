in writing. - For far too long, the EU has given a helping hand to countries around the globe while failing to make these monies conditional on the readmission of illegal immigrants.
This has exacerbated the flood of illegal economic refugees pouring into destination countries without any education or prospects for the future.
This has occurred in tandem with various visa scandals, in which countless people have entered the EU in the guise of tourists and promptly vanished into the EU's low-wage sector, thus destroying jobs on a massive scale.
It is high time that readmission arrangements were made a fixed element of agreements.
The opportunities to vanish into the anonymity of our conurbations must also be removed at all cost.
The growing trend towards the establishment of visa centres - which are then closed down due to a lack of applications - must also be treated with caution.
This practice must under no circumstances lead to a situation in which visas are issued arbitrarily simply to avoid such closure.
