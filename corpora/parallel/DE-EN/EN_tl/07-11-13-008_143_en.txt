Mr President, I said what I had to say during the explanations of vote, in order to save time during the voting.
I am pleased that Parliament has adopted this report by an overwhelming majority, also because I am aware that there have been very arduous and intensive discussions in the Council working groups.
We are sending out a clear message from the House today.
The report offers the opportunity for us to obtain quality statistics on public health and health and safety at work.
This will be a prerequisite for many of the policies which we will be championing in future.
