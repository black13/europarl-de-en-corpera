Mr President, in my view, the inclusion of aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading is a step towards meeting the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol, that is correct.
However, may I recall what Mr Sarkozy has just said.
He said that Europe must demand reciprocity, and there is none, or far too little, of that here.
Emission trading should not begin before 2012 at the earliest.
As is the case for small cars, exemptions must be in place for small aircraft under 20 tonnes in order to avoid any disproportionality.
A jumbo jet is not the same as a Cessna!
Many points in the report by the Committee on the Environment simply go too far and leave European businesses no room to manoeuvre and no time to implement the measures.
There is massive discord here.
Recalling again the words of the French President, we must think very hard, once more, about how we structure this emission trading scheme.
