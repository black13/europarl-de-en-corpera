Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the purpose of the report, which is to include European aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading, a number of questions arise.
What is beyond question, however, is that we have clear indications that this is not a particularly successful scheme, and although the Commission has data showing that it is not successful, we are now about to include aviation in the scheme as well.
That is my main point of criticism and it prompted me not to vote for the report.
By including European aviation in the scheme, we are approaching this as an isolated solution.
However, that is the very point which ultimately jeopardises the competitiveness of European airline companies and, alongside these companies, the competitiveness of European airports as well.
To my mind, this is not acceptable and we must do all we can to identify global solutions which include other airlines and other airports too.
That is the only way to achieve a solution which is good for the environment but is also good for competition in the European Union.
