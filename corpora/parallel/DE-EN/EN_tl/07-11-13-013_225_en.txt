Mr President, extending the Schengen area to include nine new Member States is an historic step which completes the enlargement of the European Union and dismantles those borders where once the Iron Curtain separated our nations.
There were those who believed, in advance of the process, that it was too early to do this, but we can now allay those fears.
The most recent evaluation has shown that the new Members are implementing the Schengen acquis to everyone's satisfaction.
Let us be honest: border controls and the traffic jams which they produced have only ever made a limited contribution to our countries' security.
Real cross-border organised crime can only be combated effectively through intensive cooperation by our police and security agencies.
This cooperation must be improved in future, and everyone is invited to play a role here.
After all, among the old Member States, Germany is one of the countries whose borders have been most affected by the removal of controls.
I would therefore like to welcome the citizens of our neighbour countries to our common area of free movement.
May I say that people in our own countries - in Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Spain - will benefit from the newly acquired freedom as well, whether during their vacations or a visit to friends.
On 21 December, Europe will move a step closer together.
This is good for its people, and it is good for Europe.
Once again, many thanks to Mr Coelho, our President-in-Office and Commissioner Frattini.
