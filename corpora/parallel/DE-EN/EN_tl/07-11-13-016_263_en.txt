Mr President, migration is one of the priority topics in the European Union.
The Euromed region is, in that respect, a strategically important region for us.
The Euromed ministerial conference on migration will be the first of its kind to focus solely on this issue and include the Euromed partners.
It is therefore all the more regrettable that no consultation with civil society organisations was held in advance of the conference.
It is equally regrettable that the aspect of asylum was excluded from the agenda for the ministerial conference, especially bearing in mind the hopeless situation of refugees in many parts of the southern and eastern Mediterranean due to the lack of appropriate legislation to protect them.
None of these countries, as we know, has any asylum laws.
Only a few of them recognise the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Libya, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan have not ratified the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.
It is also to be regretted that the members of the Barcelona Process talk about the rights of migrants but are silent when it comes to the rights of illegal migrants.
The fact is that illegal migrants also have rights, especially when it comes to the enforceability of wages, access to education for their children, or basic medical care, especially for women migrants, where the relevant protective provisions apply.
If we want cooperation in our efforts to combat illegal migration, we must not deny or neglect one aspect: respect for the rights of migrants and refugees.
