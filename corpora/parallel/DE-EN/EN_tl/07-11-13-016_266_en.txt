Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the issue of migration demonstrates very clearly to us how close Africa is to Europe.
What happens in Africa affects Europe directly.
Migration flows from the crisis areas to the south of the Mediterranean terminate in the Mediterranean countries of Southern Europe, which means, of course, that they directly affect Europe as a whole.
Africa is a continent with a wealth of talented people.
We ourselves, and Africa, must be clever and use this potential in and for Africa.
This partnership which we are striving for with Africa offers a huge opportunity.
The offer which we aim to extend from the European Union is very challenging.
It ranges from help towards self-help in the fields of security, trade and good governance to stabilisation programmes, including assistance to combat crime, the creation of training places and jobs, the offer of microcredits, and information campaigns about the opportunities for legal forms of migration and all the consequences of illegal migration and measures to combat it.
However, the European Union, at the next Summit, must also make demands.
One of these demands must be for readmission agreements with all countries in the southern Mediterranean before we launch all our action programmes, because all these aspects interact with each other and because what we want is a partnership.
I agree with Commissioner Frattini when he says that what we are talking about now is partnership and no longer about cooperation; it is about partnership and the offer of complex packages.
The European Parliament is ready for this, the Commission supports it and so does Parliament, and Africa must be invited to use these offers in the interests of stabilising North Africa and also in the interests of the security of EU citizens.
