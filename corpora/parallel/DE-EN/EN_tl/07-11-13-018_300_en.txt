Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, euro exchange rate trends do of course affect the relative price of European tourism products for consumers from third countries.
Although the euro exchange rate is not a political instrument, but is formed freely on the foreign exchange market, the consequences of the recent rises in the euro-dollar exchange rate on tourism should be viewed on a differentiated basis.
First of all, fluctuations in the euro exchange rate have very little impact on tourism flows within the European Union.
According to the available data, 70% of revenue comes from cross-border tourism in the European Union, in other words, from tourists from other EU Member States.
Secondly, we should not be focusing solely on the euro-dollar exchange rate.
Calculations of the effective euro exchange rate show that the overall trend is far less dramatic.
The euro's rise against the Chinese yuan, for example, was much less pronounced this year, and yet revenue from tourists from non-EU countries barely doubled in the years between 1995 and 2005, whereas the revenue attributable to tourists from China increased twelve-fold over the same period.
The Commission is aware that price is a key competition factor.
Nonetheless, the Commission's vision for European tourism in the future, as presented in its recently adopted communication, is based on high quality, not low cost.
We are convinced that even with a strong euro, Europe will still be the world's number one destination if Europe makes the best possible use of its advantages: its heritage, its beautiful natural environment, its geographical concentration of attractive sites and its reputation for a high level of service.
