Vice-President of the Commission. - I am afraid that the honourable Member and I may have to agree to disagree.
As you know, just a few days ago a major European tourism conference was held in Portugal and all these issues were discussed in detail there.
The conference brought together 500 leading specialists from all over Europe and I did not have the impression from that conference that the European tourism industry or, indeed, the Member States are worried about Europe losing its lustre as a tourist destination.
The figures we have available do not bear out what the honourable Member has said, namely that we are facing a particularly serious situation.
Let me say again: of course exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on price, but what Europe offers visitors from other countries is not determined primarily by price.
The decision to travel to Europe is not a decision which is influenced mainly by price but by the quality of what Europe has to offer.
Nonetheless, I agree with the honourable Member that we must pay very close attention to the burdens placed on the European tourism industry and ensure that framework conditions are put in place that allow this industry to capitalise in real terms on the massive growth and employment potential that it has to offer.
