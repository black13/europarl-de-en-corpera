Madam President, Commissioner, we have been told that only a small percentage of Union funding is being made available for the northern part of Cyprus.
What is the situation with regard to the obligations which must be fulfilled by the northern part of Cyprus itself?
Are delays not occurring here as well?
I also have a supplementary question for our fellow Member here.
The terminology which he has used is not the terminology of bicommunality but that of two separate states, given that reference has been made to ministerial level, presidents and colleagues.
Is this helpful for the debate?
