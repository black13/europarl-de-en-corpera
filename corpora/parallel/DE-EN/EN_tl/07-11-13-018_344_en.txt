Many thanks for your good answer, Commissioner.
There are two points which I would like to make.
Firstly, as you know, this House voted by a 75% majority in favour of internationally monitored independence for Kosovo on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan.
We voted against plans for the division of Kosovo and against any reversion to rule by Belgrade.
I would like to know whether the Commission endorses this position.
Secondly, like you, I was in Belgrade last week, and as you have said, the longer the decision-making process takes, the more destabilising the effect on Serbia will be.
Serbia too needs a swift decision in order to be able to pursue its course towards a future in Europe.
