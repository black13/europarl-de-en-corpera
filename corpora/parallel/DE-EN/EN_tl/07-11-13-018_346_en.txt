Commissioner, we all hope that the status issue will indeed be resolved on 10 December.
However, the question is this: what if there is no resolution?
What are the risks then for the region as a whole, in your view?
Do we have any way out of that situation or any alternative strategies if there is in fact no agreement on 10 December?
