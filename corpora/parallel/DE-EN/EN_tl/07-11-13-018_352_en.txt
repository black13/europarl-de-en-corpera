It is very likely that on 21 December the Schengen border of Italy and Austria will be extended to include another country, namely Slovenia.
Does this have any relation to the opening of a chapter - on the common area of freedom, security and justice - in accession negotiations?
Does it really make sense to build major new external borders here which will have to be dismantled only a few years later?
