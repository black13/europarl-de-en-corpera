Commissioner, I believe that the Sanader Government and the chief negotiator, Mr Drobnjak, are doing first-class work but in my view, there are two problems.
Firstly, I hear, for example, from the Slovakian side that conditions are being set for Croatia which were not set, in this form, for Slovakia.
The second question is this: what is the situation with regard to the Commission's own capacities to deal with this dossier?
I have heard that a great many matters are being left to lie because there is not sufficient capacity to process the Croatian dossier.
Is that correct?
