Commissioner, where education or training for illegal child immigrants is concerned, we are talking about a highly sensitive issue.
We also know that there is no method which is off limits to human trafficking organisations.
Do you not see a certain risk that children may be sent on ahead so that parents are then able to join them through the process of family reunification, thus simply accelerating illegal immigration?
As much as I welcome efforts to cushion the effects on children, I do see a risk that this could give further impetus to illegal immigration.
