Madam President, Commissioner, Airbus is a European success story and a model of European cooperation.
Airbus provides jobs at six European locations and employs a total of 58 000 workers.
In Hamburg, where I come from, there are 12 000 people working for Airbus.
In the past, Airbus has shown that EU industry, given the right strategy, can compete successfully in the toughest markets with top technology.
In the dispute between the US company Boeing and the European Airbus, each side is accusing the other of paying billions in subsidies and brought complaints before the WTO in 2004.
This could have negative consequences for transatlantic trade relations, which I would warn against, but it is very important, nonetheless, that the EU makes it clear that the financial support provided for Airbus was in conformity with WTO rules.
Both sides have declared their willingness to find a solution outside the WTO and reach an agreement on a bilateral basis.
Our goal, as politicians, should be to avoid a dispute over subsidies in the aircraft industry.
The economic performance of the two companies must not be jeopardised, and financial support should focus primarily on research.
This must include an increasingly strong emphasis on environmental, social and indeed employment policy aspects.
It is important, for the competitiveness of European industry, to ensure that Airbus also remains competitive.
In the European Parliament, we must stand up for fair competition.
The Commission must act on this, for we all have an interest in ensuring that by 2010, the EU is the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
Economic and employment policy, combined with innovative technology policy, will play an extremely important role in achieving that goal.
