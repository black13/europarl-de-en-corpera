on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, firstly, I would like to complain once again about the fact that this report in particular is being dealt with at such an inconvenient hour in terms of its public resonance.
I have five comments to make in all.
My second point is that we need decisions about Treaty infringement proceedings from the Commission.
It is not enough, Commissioner, to produce a document that is simply designed to record one's own determination, which is what the interpretation has just said; rather, it is essential to bring about real improvements.
Your job is to facilitate decisions about Treaty infringement proceedings which you then publish, if necessary with the ensuing judicial decisions or legal rulings.
Thirdly, the Council is becoming more political.
With more qualified majority voting, the Council is taking on more overall responsibility, as co-legislator, for its legislation and thus for the execution of these laws.
We wish to emphasise once again that we would therefore very much welcome much more involvement by the Council in the activities of the Committee on Petitions and, for example, the designation of a senior official to coordinate petition-related matters.
My fifth and final point is this: we do not just want to criticise others.
With this report, we want to send out the message that we ourselves, as the European Parliament, need to improve.
You can read about this in paragraphs 25 and 26.
We need a better process in the European Parliament.
We need appropriate human resources, we need appropriate response times, we need better workflows, we need a more transparent procedure for citizens, and we need a better method of sifting out unimportant and inadmissible petitions at an early stage so that we can focus on those that are admissible and important.
Parliament has taken a significant step forward here by setting up a committee of inquiry, so we are well on track.
