Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, those who proclaim their commitment to a fairer world have no qualms about blaming globalisation for the difficulties in their own economies.
They therefore call for less free market, more regulation and more government intervention.
Yet globalisation offers the genuine prospect of a win-win situation because it enables the emerging economies and the slow starters in the world economy to catch up and give us the opportunity to develop new markets for high-quality, top-of-the-range products, facilities and services.
If we are to grasp these opportunities, however, we must do our homework, which means redoubling our efforts in the fields of training, further education - particularly for young unemployed persons - and lifelong learning, becoming even more creative in the ways we shape the value-added chains and processes of our economy and encouraging even more free enterprise.
Unimpeded globalisation leads to more open markets and more competition, which benefit all consumers.
Let us resist the temptation to shield our economy.
Such a move would quickly degenerate into sheer protectionism.
Instead, let us nurture the inherent power of our economy to keep renewing itself.
Let us invest in the technologies of the future, and the future will be ours.
