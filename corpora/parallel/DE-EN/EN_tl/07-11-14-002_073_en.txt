Madam President, one of the previous speakers, Alexander Radwan, said that Europe was well prepared for globalisation, yet the modern-day version of globalisation has already been with us for eighteen years.
We, meanwhile, are sliding straight from the globalisation trap - the talk of what used to be, the reversal of mass prosperity and the onslaught against democracy - into the European trap, a product of the political original sin of failing to secure a decent treaty back in Nice, where overhasty enlargement was preferred to deeper union.
As a result, the core of today's problems consists in bureaucracy, wastage of billions of euros and - yes - mistakes in the political recruitment of Europe's elites.
Indeed, you yourself, Commissioner Verheugen, are a case in point.
The despicable personal attacks on you began when you tried to bring the bureaucracy under control.
Now there is a new man, and they are already trying to pull the carpet from under his feet.
We shall see what progress he manages to make on red tape.
This is no way to proceed.
If we cannot cure these ills, the Union will remain in the grip of political paralysis, and the challenges of globalisation will defeat us.
