Mr President, I should like to bring to your notice that, when I, like many other Members, was applauding your last announcement, Jean-Marie Le Pen made this hand gesture, signifying 'Fuck you!'
directly at me.
May I ask you to check that on the video recording.
I believe such an action really must have consequences.
I find it appalling that anyone should behave towards me in such a downright aggressive manner.
