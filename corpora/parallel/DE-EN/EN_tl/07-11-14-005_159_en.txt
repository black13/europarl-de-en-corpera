in writing. - Humanitarian aid is often very difficult to deliver because of adverse circumstances or security problems.
This makes good harmonisation and coordination of aid activities all the more important.
Efforts to achieve that objective, however, must not in any way be used as a pretext to make European institutions even more bloated, nor can either an EU civil-defence agency nor an EU rapid-response force provide effective protection in the event of natural disasters.
Moreover, consideration must be given to yesterday's criticism from the Court of Auditors, which identified a 'material level of errors' in various areas, including the EUR 5.2-billion budget for food aid, humanitarian aid and the part-funding of non-governmental organisations.
Since the present report, in my view, is not a suitable basis for the resolution of all these problems, I have voted against it.
