Mr President, I regard this Framework Directive for Soil Protection as a serious mistake which jeopardises the competitiveness of European agriculture and food supplies in Europe.
What image do the supporters of this directive actually have of our farmers?
Let me tell you: they believe that we need a fat bureaucratic directive, that we need to map 420 million hectares of farmland, wield the threat of horrendous fines and finally create priority areas for soil protection before farmers will take proper care of their soils.
I say to you, however, that this image is completely divorced from reality.
Soil is a farmer's most precious asset.
Any farmer who does not treat his soil with care will not be a farmer for long.
Most of the soils in the EU are cared for; they are worth preserving and are nurtured by our farmers.
I regard this directive as an example of ivory-tower bureaucracy, and I hope we can rectify this mistake quickly before any serious damage is inflicted on our agriculture.
