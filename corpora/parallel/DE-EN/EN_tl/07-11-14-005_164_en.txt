Mr President, I voted to reject the Commission's proposal.
The proposal breaches the principle of subsidiarity.
Soil has no cross-border aspects, which is why this matter can be regulated equally well or even better in the Member States than at European level.
Many countries already have soil protection legislation.
The Commission's proposal takes scant account of that.
In the final vote I also voted against the report and most of the compromises, although I do believe that the report adopted by Parliament is a marked improvement on the Commission's proposal.
There were improvements, for example, with regard to the identification of potentially contaminated sites.
The redraft offers greater flexibility in the application of the criteria enumerated in Annex II.
In general, however, there are still many provisions that make this directive an elaborate bureaucratic and expensive instrument.
One good thing is that the criteria listed in Annex I will at least be non-binding now.
Another is that the directive recognises the special character of agricultural land use.
The cons outweigh the pros, however.
On the question of funding, for example, we ought to have spelled out more clearly that the Soil Protection Directive will have no impact on the Community budget and that no new funds will be set up to implement the directive.
Only the existing support mechanisms are to be used.
For these reasons I have voted against the directive, and I hope that the Council will now make the necessary corrections.
