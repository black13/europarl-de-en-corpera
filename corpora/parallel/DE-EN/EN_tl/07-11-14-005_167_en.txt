Mr President, all the Austrian PPE members advocate an ambitious set of measures to protect soil, but they must be adopted at the right political level.
We consider the proposal and the report to be in clear breach of the principle of subsidiarity, which is why we have voted against many of the amendments and also against the report in its entirety.
In spite of the sterling work of the rapporteur, Mrs Guti√©rrez, who drew many of the fangs in the proposal, we take the view that this report overshoots by far the proper bounds of EU legislation.
The Member States should, however, be urged to involve themselves deeply in this area because soil is the basis of all economic and agricultural activity.
It must also be said that the Member States are responsible for funding their own programmes.
