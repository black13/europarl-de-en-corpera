Mr President, I have voted against this so-called soil protection directive because I find we lose any credibility if we talk every day about eliminating red tape and then we create this bureaucratic monster of a directive.
Unlike air and water, soil is not a cross-border issue but a national matter.
We need this directive like a hole in the head.
The Commission and President Barroso ought to have withdrawn this draft.
President Barroso speaks eloquently of eliminating red tape, but his actions do not match his words.
Where I come from, people like that are called Dampfplauderer - patter merchants.
For 46 years I have been tilling my soil.
My soil is more fertile now than it was 46 years ago.
I am all for a European soil protection regulation, but one that protects my soil from European bureaucracy.
