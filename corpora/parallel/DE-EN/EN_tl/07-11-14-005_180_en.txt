in writing. - Soil is a vital asset.
As a non-renewable resource, it is of the utmost importance in sustaining biodiversity, as a source of raw materials and also as a storage and filter medium for nutrients and water.
Soil, however, is not something that crosses borders, nor can it be shifted by the European Union.
Protecting our soils is in the best interests of those who own land and therefore falls within the responsibility of the Member States.
This application of the subsidiarity principle must remain intact.
There is no justification for ignoring all the existing European legal provisions and the dedication of farmers right down to the present day and to enact new provisions running parallel to the European directives, national statutes and cross-compliance rules that directly or indirectly affect the protection of soil.
Among the numerous soil-related directives and regulations enacted by the EU are such instruments as the Nitrates Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Emissions Trading Directive and the Plant Protection Products Directive.
The bureaucratic commitments that could hit the Member States and the farming community is in stark contrast to the common efforts to eliminate red tape.
In addition, the precautionary measures envisaged in the draft directive impinge on every aspect of the law as it relates to agriculture.
I consider a European soil protection directive to be superfluous and inexpedient, and I have voted against this proposal.
