in writing. - Healthy soils are the basis of human health and wealth.
They must be protected.
We cannot be content with the current state of soils in all parts of the EU.
Nevertheless, wanting to regulate this problem paternalistically and bureaucratically at European level is a step too far.
Soil, which is already protected by the directive concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (the IPPC Directive) and the Habitats Directive, does not migrate, as we all know, from one country to another, although the same cannot be said for water, which is a potential factor in soil pollution.
That, however, is already covered by the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive.
If we now add a soil protection directive, the result will be duplicated regulation and costly bureaucracy, which nobody wants.
Open coordination and sharing of experience on best practice would be a better approach.
Adopting a framework directive on soil protection would be putting the cart before the horse.
It is unthinkable that countries which already have exemplary legislation on soil protection should have to invest a great deal of time and money re-examining their entire territory for possible risk areas.
I tried to engage in damage limitation in this vote, but I am afraid I did not succeed.
I was therefore unable to vote in favour of the report.
I want to know that I can still look our farmers in the eye.
