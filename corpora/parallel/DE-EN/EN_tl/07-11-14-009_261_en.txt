Madam President, allow me to extend a warm welcome to Stavros Dimas.
We look forward to our discussions with you in Bali about the path that Europe intends to pursue in the field of climate policy.
I see the pursuit of climate policy as a challenge for all of us.
It is not the preserve of misty-eyed environmentalists or of liberal merchants but a challenge to which we must all respond together, and the Temporary Committee on Climate Change is starting to do just that.
Not everyone appreciates this yet, but we have nevertheless made a good start.
Bali is a milestone - no doubt about that.
A post-Bali gap, which would also be a post-Kyoto gap, would be a disaster, not only for the environment but also in terms of economic policy, because industry cannot invest without hard and fast data.
It is also a matter of where we stand at the present time and what we actually have to offer in Bali, for we must have something to offer, otherwise we cannot expect other continents to join us in a common effort to solve the problem.
This is why it is right and proper that we should be committed to making offers here.
Three times twenty per cent amounts to a great deal, and we would be happy to hit these targets.
I still see major obstacles ahead, to be sure, but we shall make it.
Besides, precisely because we need to set a good example, I do believe we shall arrive at a European environmental foreign policy that serves to influence the search for answers to questions such as why these huge conflagrations break out across the globe, producing more CO2 than all of Europe's power stations put together.
I believe Europe has to get involved here, and we are well on the way to doing so, and then Americans within the United States - not necessarily through their government - will be given a positive stimulus to move forward too.
That is precisely where we are heading.
I regard climate change entirely as a golden economic opportunity.
If we do not take it, others surely will.
