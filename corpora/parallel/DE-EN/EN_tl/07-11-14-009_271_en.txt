Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at their spring summit the Heads of State and Government took good decisions on the fight against climate change.
Their decision on greenhouse gases provides for a 20% reduction in the 1990 emission levels in Europe by 2020.
It was also agreed at the spring summit that the reduction target would be raised to 30% if other industrialised nations committed themselves to cutting their greenhouse-gas emissions.
The EU should therefore make every effort to encourage other industrialised nations to sign up to the post-Kyoto agreement.
I should like to refer to another specific point, namely transport, for it is important that we should succeed in securing the inclusion of transport in the post-Kyoto agreement.
In Europe alone, transport produces 21% of all greenhouse gases.
International aviation in particular was not covered by the Kyoto Protocol, because the ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organization, gave assurances that there were plans to create a global system.
This pledge has not been honoured in the period since 1997, and I am afraid we are still waiting for aviation to be incorporated into the Protocol.
I hope that this step can be initiated in Bali.
