Madam President, I should like to add my voice to the numerous compliments that have been paid to the rapporteur for this good and objectively presented report, which also received the support of a good majority of the Committee on Climate Change.
It goes without saying that we expect results and a clear mandate for Bali.
This must include shared but differentiated responsibilities for the industrialised nations, the states with emerging economies and the developing countries.
This resolution also indicates clearly that we expect results by 2009.
In the legal instruments the European Parliament adopts - and speakers have already referred today to the inclusion of aviation in emissions trading as well as to CO2 emissions from motor vehicles - we must send very clear political messages to the rest of the world, to the other continents.
That is an essential condition if we are to bring all countries on board.
