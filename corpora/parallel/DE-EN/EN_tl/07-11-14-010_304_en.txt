Mr President, the official aim of the European neighbourhood policy is to create, and I quote, 'a ring of stable, friendly states' around the EU.
A very large amount of money is being spent on it - EUR 12 billion for the period from 2007 to 2013.
For what purposes?
There has been much talk of human rights, but it is all about asserting the interests of the EU.
For example, there is talk of establishing a free-trade area.
For whose benefit, I ask.
There is a lot about protecting borders and controlling migration.
Specifically, the report says, if I may quote parts of it, that Parliament 'stresses the need to improve the capacity of ENP countries to manage migration flows, effectively combat illegal migration, ... to intensify their cooperation in the fight against ... terrorism (and) supports the neighbours' involvement in the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) and the European Police Office (Europol)'.
These are things that we do not support, and so, as my colleague Willy Meyer-Pleite has said, our group will not be voting for the report.
