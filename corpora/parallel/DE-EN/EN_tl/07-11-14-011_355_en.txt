Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your very comprehensive reply.
I have only two brief supplementary questions.
Firstly, do you think it conceivable that a date for the opening of accession negotiations will be set in the course of next year?
Macedonia's applicant status dates from more than two years ago, and it is surely high time to think about a date.
My second supplementary question is this: what approach is being adopted?
Are attempts being made to link Macedonia's accession with that of other countries, such as Serbia, or is this country really being dealt with separately from any others?
