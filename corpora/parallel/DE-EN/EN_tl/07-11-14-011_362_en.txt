Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, my question has to do with this issue but relates to a slightly different aspect.
I believe - and you rightly referred to this - that questions such as the one under discussion arouse strong feelings among the general public.
On the other hand - and you also referred to the legal position - are we in the European Union really justified in arrogating legislative or contractual powers to ourselves on every issue that deeply concerns anyone in the EU?
Or should we not exercise a little restraint in these matters?
