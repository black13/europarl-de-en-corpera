Thank you very much, and my apologies for having spoken so quickly.
I was consciously trying to avoid overrunning.
I mean it is important that we deal with such concerns when they matter to the people of Europe.
On the other hand, we should also be aware of the legal limits of the Union and take care to respect these limits as far as we can.
The approach you have proposed seems interesting, but we should not leave ourselves open to the accusation that the Union is claiming competence for all global matters.
