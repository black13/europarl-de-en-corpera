on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, we have here before us a great many ideas on social policy, for which I thank Mrs Lynne.
As social policy does not carry as much weight in the EU as economic policy, this report is not EU stocktaking - as the title says - so much as a list of demands for sociopolitical measures in the Member States.
I have two comments to make.
Sociopolitical matters are within the competence of the Member States.
We at European level may only make recommendations.
Europe is in a state of imbalance because there has been economic but not social harmonisation.
Europe has not become more just since Lisbon 2000.
On the contrary, poverty is increasing.
To truly combat poverty and make it possible for all EU citizens to live with dignity and justice, we need not only economic, market and competition aspects but also a social, just, ecological internal market for all people.
Secondly: often it is a case of 'all talk, no action'.
We know what the problems are.
We do not really need studies and analyses.
It is time to take action at last.
It is not sufficient to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
We need an effective anti-poverty agenda, we need data - so that all people, including those who are unemployed, have sufficient basic income and can live in dignity.
This is a matter of justice and is a human right for all.
