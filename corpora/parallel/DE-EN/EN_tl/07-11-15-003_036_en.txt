Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, I am much obliged to the Commission for the initiatives and to Mrs Lynne for her most excellent report.
Anyone who wants to combat poverty - as Mr Fatuzzo has already said - must really focus more intensely on the older generation.
We must stay abreast of demographic changes and also ensure, despite steadily rising costs in the health system, that it will be just as possible to age with dignity in the future.
Older people have just as much right to comprehensive, quality-assured health care and long-term care regardless of their income or where they live.
We urgently need a targeted exchange of experience amongst Member States as to how best to organise and secure high-quality, affordable care.
In particular, we must take into account the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from dementia.
However, to do this, we need sound data; that is also why we are asking the Commission to provide us with these data as quickly as possible.
In a social Europe, all patients must have equal access to evidence-based medicines and medical products.
It is simply unacceptable that the very same antibiotic costs EUR 3 in Belgium and EUR 34 in Germany, for example.
Therefore I am glad that, with this report, we are calling for the Commission and the Member States to enter into intensive dialogue with us, and with the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups, in order to develop balanced guidelines for greater transparency as far as the effectiveness and price of medicines are concerned.
This is another contribution to reducing the costs of health care for us all.
