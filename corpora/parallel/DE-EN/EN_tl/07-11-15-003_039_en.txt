Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my voice sincerely to the thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lynne.
Social protection and social inclusion help to combat poverty and exclusion in preventive health care and many other areas, and are among the most important challenges for the future.
The term 'minimum income' is often discussed in different ways in the Member State that I come from.
However, I fully support Mrs Stauner's approach with regard to jobs, full-time working and income.
The social partnership is strongly established in Austria, which gives us a great opportunity, indeed one that is used in attempts to find a solution with the agreement of all those involved.
This means we do not have as many strikes as in other EU states, where these are frequently the order of the day.
This is precisely why a regulation at EU level must be approached very carefully.
The different national social welfare systems mean that we must proceed very judiciously with any harmonisation.
Our concern must be to offer social protection to all employees and to enable their social inclusion.
Naturally, it must also be possible, within the framework of subsidiarity, that Member States should, must and can have higher standards.
