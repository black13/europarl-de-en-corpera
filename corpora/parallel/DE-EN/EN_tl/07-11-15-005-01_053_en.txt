rapporteur. - Mr President, last Friday, the Council accepted the essential content of this Regulation on the funding of parties and foundations at European level.
In addition, this morning, a trialogue took place with the Commission and the Council, and we reached agreement on the questions that remained to be settled.
Therefore, there is a realistic chance of adopting this project at first reading and creating the prerequisites for better financing even for 2008.
I therefore suggest that we postpone the vote until 29 November, at the next plenary, in Brussels.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
