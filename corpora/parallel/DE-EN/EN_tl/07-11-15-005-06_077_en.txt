on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we held an extensive debate in this Chamber in which Commissioner Frattini took part.
The Commissioner responded very moderately in his own comments and in his answers to speeches from various Members.
The resolution criticises only one point; that is, that it can be proved that Commissioner Frattini gave the public incorrect information on a specific point of European law.
The fact that our resolution corrects this and also clarifies that the Commissioner responsible for the legal protection of the citizens of Europe made an incorrect statement in public on an essential question of citizens' rights is the duty of this Parliament and has nothing to do with any conspiracy theories.
However, we know very well, Mr Daul, that you are a pitiful Member, because you were pressured by Forza Italia to make that statement.
That is all there is to be said on the matter.
(Applause from the left)
