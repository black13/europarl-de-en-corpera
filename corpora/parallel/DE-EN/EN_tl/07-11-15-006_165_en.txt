Mr President, my delegation, the Austrian Social Democrats, abstained from voting on the report on the Bali conference for precisely the reasons that Mrs Korhola has also raised.
We support the other political messages of this report.
The report is very good.
My delegation cannot support the sending of a signal that nuclear power is an essential element in combating climate change.
I also think that it should be up to the countries and continents themselves which strategy they follow.
I should like to reemphasise my delegation's support for all elements of this report, including the exclusion of nuclear power projects from the Clean Development Mechanism.
However, we did not want to back this political signal in favour of nuclear power, so we abstained.
In order to show our agreement with the rest of the report, which is good overall, we did not vote against it.
