on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, if you will pardon my saying so, Mrs Flautre is talking nonsense.
Muslims do a huge amount for Muslim minorities.
We support Muslim and other religious minorities.
However, it is unfortunately true that if we do not do anything for Christians, nobody will.
The Islamic or Arab League has never championed the rights of Christians as we have the rights of Muslims.
It is therefore high time that we put this matter on the agenda.
It is an act of justice, whereby I must say emphatically that the problem is not Islam.
Christians in the Middle East have survived 1 200 years under Islamic rule.
It is in our supposedly so advanced age that they are seriously endangered, especially in Iraq, which is occupied by the West.
We must acknowledge our own responsibility to make it possible for them to survive and live in freedom and dignity.
Most religious persecution takes place in communist China, in pseudo-Christian nationalist Russia, in communist dictatorships - and also under Islamic regimes.
For me, Islamism is simply a perverse dictatorship and ideology of the twentieth century.
We Europeans have a duty in this regard, and we shall perform it.
(Applause)
