author. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a democratic institution, we cannot allow human rights to be trampled on anywhere in the world.
However, we find it equally unacceptable if, within this very House, diplomatic relationships and interparliamentary cooperation between the EU and Uzbekistan are risked without giving it a thought.
When I look at the motions for resolutions presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the left-wing groups, it is tantamount to a diplomatic demolition derby.
In Parliament's last resolution, dated October 2006, we committed ourselves to a constructive, dialogue-oriented solution.
Today, however, we are not seeking dialogue but slamming a door shut.
My group cannot answer for this, so I ask you to reject the motions for resolutions by the PSE Group, the ALDE Group and the left.
The motion for a resolution presented by our group together with the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has the following in its favour.
The political situation in Uzbekistan is by no means satisfactory.
The human rights situation continues to be alarming in many respects.
Yet some progress is being made in spite of everything.
For example, the first round of the human rights dialogue between the European Union and Uzbekistan took place in Tashkent on 8 and 9 May of this year.
Any resolution by the European Parliament must illuminate the current situation, and the present resolution can only be based on this.
