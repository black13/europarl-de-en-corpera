on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, under the German Council Presidency, after explicit influence from the German Federal Government, the sanctions against Uzbekistan were relaxed under the condition that Karimov's government would improve the human rights situation in the country.
However, torture is still used in Uzbek prisons; the human rights situation in Uzbekistan has not improved at all.
We hear this from international organisations, which are observing serious attacks on civil society.
Not only human rights organisations, but also women's organisations, information centres and many other organisations are being affected.
Human rights activists are being condemned to long-term sentences and numerous activists, including journalists, have had to flee.
We must not soften the sanctions; we must not lift them.
We are seeing once again that, even in this Parliament, there are different discourses on human rights when it comes to access to raw materials compared to when raw materials are not at stake.
We must send a clear signal that we do not accept this.
