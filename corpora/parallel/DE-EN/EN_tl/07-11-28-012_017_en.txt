on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, on our agenda today we have the Commission statement on the partnership agreements with the ACP countries and a resolution is planned for this debate.
Our Group, this morning and in recent days, has held very intensive debates on this resolution.
We have also tried very hard to work out a compromise resolution with other groups, with a view to reaching such a compromise.
Unfortunately, that has proved impossible.
Nonetheless, we do not want to give up on this task and we are still attempting to reach a compromise before we have to resort to contested votes.
On behalf of my Group, I therefore propose that the resolution on this Commission statement and the vote on that resolution be postponed until the December part-session.
I would be grateful to the Members of this House if they could support this course of action, which would offer some scope for negotiations on a compromise.
