on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, I am rather surprised at this proposal from the Socialist Group.
The joint motion for a resolution by the Socialists, the Greens and my Group incorporated the resolution adopted in Kigali.
In Kigali, the members of the PPE-DE Group also agreed to this compromise, so I simply cannot understand why everything should now be postponed for further debate when, together, Members of this House had already reached an agreement.
The fact is that everyone agreed to this compromise in Kigali!
I am therefore opposed to this postponement because the document in question has been endorsed by a large number of Members already and could be voted on today.
