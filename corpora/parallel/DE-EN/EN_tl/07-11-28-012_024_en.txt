on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, just so that there are no misunderstandings: the problem is not the substance; the problem is that they want to ensure that they get a majority.
I think that is legitimate.
You are absolutely right, Mr Markov; the proposal implies that the debate should start again, which is hard to understand, but the Socialists' idea - let's see - is about securing a majority to endorse what everyone wants to achieve anyway.
That is the issue and that is the reason why they want a postponement.
That is all.
(Parliament approved the request)
