on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, Mr de Deus Pinheiro has just mentioned the Christmas spirit.
I am also in favour of the Christmas spirit, but we should not overdo it.
After all, in that spirit, we were quite willing to have a compromise coming from Kigali.
As to Venezuela, there are always going to be differences of opinion, indeed controversy, in any debate about Mr Ch√°vez.
We believe the debate is useful - indeed, it is now being held - but we are not convinced that we can get a sensible resolution in the short time available today or tomorrow.
If we take this resolution forward to the December part-session, it will be three weeks old by then.
It is very useful to have the debate now, but we do not want a resolution because it will either be cobbled together or will come far too late.
I think we should have the debate today, and that will be enough.
