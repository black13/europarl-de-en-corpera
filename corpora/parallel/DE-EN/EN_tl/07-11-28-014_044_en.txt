on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, today, I am proud to be a Member of this House which from the very first day has been a stalwart champion of fundamental and civil rights in general and this Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular.
It is now nine years since the Cologne Summit took the initiative to start working towards a legally binding Charter, and this process is not yet complete.
As somebody who has been privileged to follow this constitutional process all the way through, I would like to share two experiences with you.
One is very ironic: it is odd that, over these nine years, nothing has proved to be so laborious and controversial, or as difficult to achieve, as those documents which embody the principles which form the very basis of the European Union and which we should be able to take for granted: democracy, parliamentary rights, social rights, the market economy, transparency of legislation and fundamental freedoms and rights.
It is a very odd situation and must surely have to do with the root causes of the crisis of confidence besetting the European Union.
The second experience which I would like to share with you is this: it is important not to become exhausted or disenchanted, and it is important not to lose heart.
I have long believed that Sisyphus is the patron saint of Europe, and this whole experience bears this out.
That is why I think that, today of all days, we should try again and appeal to the United Kingdom and Poland, in the name of the indivisibility of fundamental rights, in the name of the indivisibility of human rights and fundamental rights and liberties, to join in this great European consensus!
