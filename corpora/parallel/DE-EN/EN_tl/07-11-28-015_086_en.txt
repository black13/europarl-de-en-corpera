in writing. - In one of the amendments tabled on this report, an attempt is made to secure the European Parliament's support for European minimum wages.
In my view, this approach is fundamentally wrong.
The conditions and parameters in place in the individual regional labour markets are so disparate that a European approach will not enable us to increase prosperity for citizens; instead, we would be entrenching poverty, unemployment and black-market work.
There is also a call for minimum wages to be set at no less than 50-60% of the average national wage.
Which country in Europe has such a high minimum wage?
Before tabling this type of amendment for debate, its initiators should at least make the effort to look at the reality in Europe.
An attempt is being made here to champion a European wage-setting policy which would increase existing national minimum wages by an average of 20%.
This is blatant populism!
I hope that a clear majority will emerge in Parliament to quash these dangerously utopian ideas, which would merely increase joblessness and poverty and put Europe's economic competitiveness at risk.
