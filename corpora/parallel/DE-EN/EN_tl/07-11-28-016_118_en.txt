Mr President, Prime Minister, Parliament will be deciding tomorrow whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be legally binding in future.
For me, having been a member of the Convention established to draw up the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights, this will be a very important vote, not just because I had the honour of working on what is the most modern European document on fundamental rights, and not just because I - like many others - fought for seven years to ensure that it became legally binding.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the indivisibility of civil, political and social rights.
For me, as a left-wing Member of this House who comes from Berlin and lived in the GDR until the peaceful revolution in 1989, this is of fundamental importance.
For me, the resounding 'yes' to the Charter is the logical consequence of our critical appraisal of our own history: an appraisal which was necessary and which focused on the massive violation of fundamental and human rights under 'actually existing socialism'.
Your country, Prime Minister, plays an important role in the EU.
By voting 'yes' in the referendum to what was then the Constitutional Treaty, the citizens of Spain made a major contribution to the Charter not being shelved.
You can and should build on this achievement.
Everyone has great expectations of Europe.
They expect Europe to address their daily needs and concerns.
They want Europe to work in a substantive way - and not just hum the melody, as Jean-Claude Juncker said - in order to create a Europe of the workers, a Europe that is genuinely based on solidarity.
That is why a vigorous campaign needs to be conducted in the European Union against social and wage dumping.
Minimum wages for everyone which safeguard people's livelihoods: that is what we need.
The social issue is indeed crucial for the future of Europe!
