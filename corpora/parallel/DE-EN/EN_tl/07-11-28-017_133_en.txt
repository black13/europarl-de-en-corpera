on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission's negotiating strategy was completely wrong; in fact, it was a catastrophe.
It was based on the 'Global Europe' strategy, which is all about market access for Europe's major transnational corporations.
I have always wondered what this approach has to do with partnership agreements.
Partnership means something completely different.
Partnership means respect for the country which needs to carry out economic and social development.
A partnership agreement must foster respect for the fact that the provision of development aid must not be linked to the conclusion of an EPA.
Economic partnership agreements have to take account of the development of the weak, and weakest, countries.
No country, if it does not sign, should be in a worse situation than it is already.
That is fair partnership and that is an approach based on solidarity.
The Commission was miles away from that.
I think it is a good thing that, under pressure from many sides, it is now starting to pursue a different strategy, although I am very sceptical about this when I see how it is acting with Mercosur, ASEAN and the Andean countries, where it is still pursuing the same old way of thinking.
We Europeans seem to be saying, 'this is what is going to happen, take it or leave it'.
I repeat, that has nothing to do with partnership.
I was rather annoyed - in fact I was appalled - by what happened here today, that we could not use the Kigali decision as a basis, even though it was endorsed by all the Members who were in Kigali.
Parliament should have given this delegation its support by endorsing the decision.
