Mr President, the compromise which Ruth Hieronymi - of course with help from her colleagues - has devised here is one which I can wholeheartedly support.
I really would like to thank her very warmly; this was a very difficult piece of work and she has done a marvellous job.
In my view, the compromise covers most of what we wanted to achieve at first reading.
As we know, the rapid pace of technological development had rendered the old Directive obsolete.
I myself worked on this first Directive.
We now have something new: new transmission opportunities, new services 'on demand' alongside traditional TV, so we need this new directive.
For me, it was important in this context to uphold the country of origin principle and maintain short-term reporting.
More flexible regulations on advertising have been introduced, but I believe that maintaining a maximum of 12 minutes per hour is the right thing to do.
As before, cinematographic works and news programmes will not be interrupted.
One sticking point, as you know, Commissioner, was product placement.
Many of us voted for the present compromise with a heavy heart.
What is positive, however, is that the ban comes first, followed by the exemptions which have already been mentioned here.
I think that if these are correctly applied, we will not have any American-style conditions.
The restriction on advertising in children's programmes is also something which I welcome.
This compromise enables the audiovisual sector to face up to the major changes taking place and adapt to technological and market conditions.
The compromise helps the audiovisual sector to become more competitive in future.
This compromise is, at the moment, the best balance between media pluralism and cultural diversity, and offers the opportunity to develop a more competitive European audiovisual industry.
Once again, may I express my warm thanks to the Commissioner but especially our colleague Ruth Hieronymi.
