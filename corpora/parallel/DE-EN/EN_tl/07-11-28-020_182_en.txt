Mr President, eyewitnesses are reporting a speeding incident which almost defies belief, involving Harald Rømer, the Secretary-General of the European Parliament, at around 3 p.m. on 14 November this year, apparently in a Luxembourg-registered CD vehicle which was travelling from the European Parliament into the centre of Strasbourg.
Sparrows were crushed beneath his wheels as he roared along the Allée de la Robertsau, blasting past slow-moving vehicles in traffic queues at speeds of more than 100 km/hour and forcing startled pedestrians to leap to safety off the zebra crossing.
I therefore have a few questions to ask Mr Rømer: were you indeed travelling in this vehicle at the time?
Who was at the wheel?
What instructions had you - or had you not - given to the driver?
Why was the vehicle in question being driven in such a reckless manner, and why was the speed limit exceeded so dramatically?
Do you think that traffic regulations do not apply to you?
Would you not say that as the European Parliament's most senior official, you should be showing special consideration to others and keeping within the limits of traffic law?
Is this how you intend to behave in future, and should all road-users run in fear from you?
