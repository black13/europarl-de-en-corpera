Mr President, I do not think there is much to be added to what Mrs Kallenbach has just said, other than that it has been a pleasure for me to work alongside the Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Arlene McCarthy, and my colleague on that Committee, Gisela Kallenbach, with whom I worked very closely with great confidence during this phase of the process.
Not least, I would also like to thank the Commission, represented in this case by Commissioner Verheugen.
Such close cooperation is a rare commodity.
What can you say in a minute when you have taken 30 seconds to thank people?
In essence, what we have achieved is this: the European Union has sent out a clear message that, when it regulates the legal firearms trade, it is equally concerned about tackling the illegal transfer and abuse of firearms.
We have made it clear that the European Union will not tolerate any form of crime involving firearms on its territory, that we will not tolerate people using weapons which they have not acquired through a legal process, and we will not tolerate a situation in which people abuse the rights they have acquired through the EU.
I say this to everyone who has today received countless e-mails, as I have, from hunters and sports marksmen accusing us in the European Union of restricting their freedoms: read the directive, contact the Commission and you will see that the European Union has taken action to protect its citizens, not the reverse!
