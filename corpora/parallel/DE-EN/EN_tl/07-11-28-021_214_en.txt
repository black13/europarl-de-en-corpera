Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the basis for the amendment of this Directive was the UN Protocol and the question of how we can tackle terrorism effectively.
That was also the basis for the Commission's proposal.
The rapporteur's proposal adopted a fairly revolutionary approach to the existing Directive.
If we look at what we are discussing today and voting on tomorrow, we see that it is a compromise which, as so often, does not completely satisfy all sides.
The compromise is this: on the one hand, we are trying to tackle everything that is illegal - and here, we are never rigorous enough - and on the other hand, we do not wish to overly complicate the use of legal firearms.
There are certainly some aspects, such as categories or registration, where tougher rules on the basis of subsidiarity would have been appropriate, but this was not a 100% success.
However, a start has been made and we will see how the exercise works out in practice, and how Member States tackle this issue.
I think that this is a viable compromise, and I know that everyone involved has worked very hard to achieve it, so I too would like to express my thanks.
In this context, however, I think we must constantly be mindful of the difference between legal and illegal firearms.
We have to tackle the issue of illegality in a rigorous and consistent manner, but we must apply a judicious approach and a lack of bureaucratic complexity as the appropriate benchmarks in the legal sphere.
