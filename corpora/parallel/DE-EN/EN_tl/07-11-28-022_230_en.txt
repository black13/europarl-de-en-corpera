on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to Paolo Costa.
I especially welcome those aspects of the report which underline the importance of social and ecological sustainability.
A carefully preserved natural and cultural landscape is the best magnet to attract tourists to a destination country.
The acceptance of tourism by the citizens of the host country - in other words, the people who live and work there - is a key prerequisite in ensuring that tourists feel that they are genuinely welcome guests.
A high level of training and overall satisfaction among employees in the tourism industry is what is needed to guarantee satisfied guests.
Mobility is a prerequisite for tourism, and 'soft' forms - public transport, cycling or walking - will promote growth without destroying the essential bases of a healthy and, of course, sustainable tourism industry.
This comprehensive report contains a number of ideas which should be more than pious wishes.
I trust that these ecological and social principles will be embedded in the 'European Agenda 21 for Tourism' that has been announced.
