in writing. - Developments in recent years have shown that European tourism, like any other economic sector, is strongly influenced by wider global conditions.
In order to respond to these challenges successfully, more intensive coordination of national policies is essential.
Entirely in line with the subsidiarity principle, Member States must utilise the opportunities available at EU level in order to augment their existing national policies.
In this way, the EU can make an effective contribution to curbing burgeoning bureaucracy and dismantling obstacles within the tourism sector by means of harmonisation.
Our aim must be to make efficient use of available resources and utilise all the opportunities to create synergies in order to boost the EU's global competitiveness and create more jobs.
An important step, in this context, would be to simplify visa procedures and reduce the costs for tourist visas in all the EU countries.
I also urge the EU to adopt uniform quality standards for hotel accommodation in Europe in order to enhance transparency and, at the same time, to strengthen the rights of consumers.
This must not lead to any lowering of national quality standards, however, but should send out an important signal to consumers.
The EU must utilise its existing opportunities to provide active support to Member States in this context without, however, calling existing national competences into question.
