Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, we Greens commend the work of the Court of Auditors.
We need the information it provides, but we regret that many areas of activity have seen no improvement for years, because these findings bring the European Union into disrepute.
We have no wish to be fobbed off any longer; what we want is efficiency at long last.
Mr Kallas cut a fairly conciliatory figure today, but when the content of the Court of Auditors' report became public, he called it too harsh and also attacked the Member States.
That was not a wise move on the part of the Commission, for it bears political responsibility, and we expect the Commission to exercise that responsibility and to ensure that improvements finally materialise.
We Greens have serious doubts as to whether we can grant discharge for the 2006 budget, and what we have just heard may well have political consequences for certain Commissioners too.
That is why we urge the Commission to change its budgetary practices and start making significant improvements.
