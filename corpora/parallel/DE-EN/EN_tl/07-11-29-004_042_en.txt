President of the Court of Auditors. - Mr President, I had already left the chamber when this question was asked.
Needless to say, I should like to clarify the matter.
It was alleged that, in a BBC interview, I had sided with Mrs Andreasen.
I can tell you that I certainly did give an interview to the BBC, but the name Andreasen was not even mentioned in it.
Two of my staff who are here can testify to that.
Another particularly important point is that I am supposed to have said that 80% of expenditure had got the red light, if I may express it in these simple terms.
I actually said the exact opposite.
The interviewer, who is free, of course, in the way he chooses to present things, asked me whether I had a problem with Mr Kallas's statement to the effect that 40% of expenditure had been given the green light.
I replied that I had no problem with it.
I say this to make it clear that there is no difference between Mr Kallas's perception and my own.
One can always argue about percentages.
This one might even be higher than 40%, but I must reaffirm that the figure 80 did not pass my lips.
I did not make any reference to Mrs Andreasen, because the issue is between the Commission and Mrs Andreasen, and the Court has no wish to interfere in that.
Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to respond.
