Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard it as a remarkable success that this compromise between the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Council and the Commission has enabled us to achieve a result at first reading on the sensitive issue of the acquisition and possession of firearms.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone involved.
