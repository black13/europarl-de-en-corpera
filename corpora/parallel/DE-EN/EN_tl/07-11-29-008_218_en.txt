in writing. - After lengthy deliberations, we, the rapporteurs from the political groups in this House, agreed on a compromise for the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
This compromise was reached after consultation with other bodies, including the Council.
It takes full account of the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny.
We succeeded on the one hand in widening the powers of Parliament compared with those envisaged in the Commission's draft.
We also managed to correct the draft report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and turn it into a practicable and realistic proposal.
All amendments designed to misuse the new comitology procedure to amend key elements of existing GMO legislation by the back door were rejected.
The fact is that we cannot afford to turn our backs on green genetic engineering.
On the contrary, GMOs are indispensable to our future.
In the light of the climate debate, it ought to be abundantly clear by now, even to ideologically overladen Green politicians, that we need to apply bioengineering methods to improve renewables for use in the production of biomass and energy.
We simply do not have enough arable land to grow sufficient quantities of conventional energy crops.
Moreover, we must ensure that food and energy crops do not have to compete for space.
Authorised GMOs are safe, and ideology does not fill bellies!
