in writing. - I endorse the report on a new EU tourism policy.
It highlights opportunities for EU action in the realm of tourism.
Although the EU has no overall powers in this area, it can still take measures to promote tourism.
In this way, the Union can help to enhance the competitiveness of the tourism industry, which is a significant economic factor and an even more significant source of employment.
I attach particular importance to the aim of promoting sustainable tourism, in other words a form of tourism in which environmental, economic and social elements receive equal consideration.
Sustainable tourism is essential as a basis for the development and continuation of tourist activities and is a crucial factor in the preservation and enhancement of our natural and cultural heritage.
Conservation of the natural heritage plays a key role in the continuing success of this economically important industry and enables European tourist destinations to hold their own in the face of international competition.
Besides, we must not forget that the EU invariably serves as a shop window too.
In numerous areas of activity our example is being followed more and more frequently in many parts of the world.
This imposes a heavy responsibility on us.
I would therefore ask my fellow Members, particularly those who come from regions associated with tourism, to support the quest for sustainability.
