Mr President, the Duma elections on 2 December once again demonstrated that no surprises are to be expected in Russia.
The approaches have provided for the targeted breakdown and intimidation of the opposition, by massive changes in election legislation, the imprisonment and elimination of potential opponents such as Khodorkovsky and the repeated arrests of Garry Kasparov.
We are not impressed by the result of the United Russia campaign.
Putin's party wins, democracy loses.
This questionable success is reinforced by the fact that no party critical of the government entered into Parliament.
These elections are no indication of a common basis for relations between Europe and Russia built on democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
This discouraging final rehearsal does not bode well at all for the Presidential elections in March 2008 and at the same time shows us the importance of our understanding of values.
