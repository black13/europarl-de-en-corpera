Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the situation of the Bulgarian art historian Martina Baleva and her German colleague from the Free University of Berlin, Ulf Brunnbauer.
Both have been subjected to death threats and hate campaigns in connection with, and as a result of, scientific work on a painting, specifically by the television station Skat TV and the radical Ataka Party.
More recently, at the end of Ataka's European election campaign, a billboard displayed a banner stating: 'Baleva on the scaffold - the German Jew tied to the stake!'
The complaint has not been processed by the Bulgarian public prosecutor's office since June owing to public incitement to murder.
For safety reasons Mrs Baleva is now staying in Germany; the TV station has offered a reward for information on her whereabouts.
The Bulgarian Government is not reacting and this is unworthy of a Member State and unacceptable!
