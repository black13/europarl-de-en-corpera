Mr President, last Friday more than 70 000 signatures in favour of tighter legislation on the transport of livestock were handed over to the President of the Austrian Parliament, Barbara Prammer.
A citizens' initiative was created by a small group of people, coordinated by one of my fellow countrymen, Helmut Schaupensteiner, and backed by a highly committed journalist, Maggie Entenfeller.
They managed to find these 70 000 signatures in the shortest possible time.
This initiative has my full backing and 70 000 signatures show that the population is no longer willing either to allow these tragic circumstances to pass without comment.
As a Member of the European Parliament I therefore regard it as my duty to inform you, ladies and gentlemen, about this splendid application of the initiative against the transport of livestock and to ask us all to finally do something here so that these things that are currently taking place on European roads will no longer be able to take place in future.
