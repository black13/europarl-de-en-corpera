Mr President, the compromise found is better than expected, but celebrating it as a great success would be a sham because it was watered down.
Wherever it is measured against the revised provisions, it has been watered down because heavily polluted locations can now be factored out.
The negotiated compromise, however, is also damage limitation, because the planned period of grace should now be understood as nothing more than an invitation to do nothing.
In order that the exception does not become the rule, the Commission must monitor the action plans under consideration and compliance with the limits and sanction the failure to transpose them.
It should not therefore be celebrated as a great success because we indeed know that this Directive should in reality have been in force long ago.
Nor should it, however - and this is a positive aspect of the compromise - give German local authorities carte blanche to twiddle their thumbs.
The fresh invitation to do nothing has thereby prevented the local authorities and the federal states from having to produce action plans.
We must also stress, however, that the judgment of the Federal Administrative Court in Germany means and has emphasised for Germany that the local authorities are duty bound to act in any case.
We know that there are already good initiatives in the European Union such as, for example, environmental zones and vehicle fleet conversion.
It must also be quite clear now, though, that this is the last reprieve.
Actions really do have to follow words now to ensure that an ambitious clean air policy does not become absurd.
