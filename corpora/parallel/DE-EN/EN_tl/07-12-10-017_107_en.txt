Mr President, I am delighted that we have found agreement so quickly here in all the groups on this important dossier.
Air quality is central to our citizens' health and wellbeing.
I am also delighted that we have set strict limits, particularly new limits in the PM2.5 sector, as these are particularly harmful to health.
Unfortunately, there has been no tightening up in many other sectors, which would have been desirable.
This concerns PM10 as well as the NOx sector, of course.
What alarms me more than the limits we have set, however, is the current air situation in the Member States.
As you all know, almost all the Member States are exceeding current limits.
The ball really is in our court now to implement this ambitious legislative package, as it is in that of the Commission to monitor it.
The Commission has so far not introduced any infringement procedures, although limits are continually being exceeded.
On the one hand implementation must therefore be clean, but on the other hand the Commission must also take practical action if Member States are still not able or willing to adhere to the limits.
It is also important that we have found consistent criteria for measurements.
Practice differs widely here in individual Member States.
With regard to transport - one of the primary causes of air pollution even in my homeland - it has to be said that the Commission is to some extent not prepared either to support initiatives here that countries are taking in order to adhere to air limits.
The Commission should really be asking for Member States to be supported and not obstructed here in their aims to keep the air clean.
We have seen some very significant increases in traffic passing through the Alps and here, too, something must be done with regard to the air.
