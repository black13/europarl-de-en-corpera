Mr President, in view of the ethnically based conflicts which are constantly flaring up, manifesting themselves to excess in the most recent Paris riots, for example, it is pleasing to note that we in the EU seem to be finally awakening from our multicultural dreams and are wanting to ask questions on ethnic origin and religion in an EU-wide population census in 2011.
This data should definitely be collected so that we are better able to evaluate the risk potential in this regard.
Cultural differences can - as we have seen increasingly in recent times - escalate all too easily.
In this respect we in Europe - where some countries have boastfully declared themselves immigration countries - are sitting right over a powder keg that should not be underestimated, even in the metropolitan conurbations.
The most recent conflicts between the Kurds and the Turks have thus required massive police presence in our towns and cities, as is generally known.
Statistics on the ethnic and cultural composition of the resident population could therefore be of paramount necessity and benefit for the prevention of violence.
