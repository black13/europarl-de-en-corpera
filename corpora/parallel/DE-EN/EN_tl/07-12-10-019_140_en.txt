on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks for the briefing you have given us today once again on the progress of discussions.
We have definitely made progress already, but this is still not enough for me, of course.
Various matters still lie ahead of us.
One of them we have already repeatedly discussed: the European Union must carry out the preliminary work itself.
I am also rather sorry about the fact that the amendment of the Toy Directive has still not been tabled.
When I heard we would be getting an amendment in December, I assumed that it would be in December 2007, not December 2008.
We are now in December and we know we shall not have it.
I hope it will be available not in December 2008, but by this January at the latest, because it is urgent.
The second matter, Commissioner, is that the Member States also have to fulfil their obligations.
They must make much more efficient and more consistent use of RAPEX.
That is one thing.
They must also, however, take market monitoring, for which they are responsible, much more seriously.
We also have to move matters further forward here so that we can also actually achieve the necessary security.
It is not just governments or their agencies that are being interrogated in this regard, however; toy manufacturers are being interrogated too.
They themselves also have to ensure that the quality of their products is appropriate.
They cannot continue simply shifting responsibility on to others.
We cannot let them go to China and say: yes, we want toys, but they must not cost more than so much.
This will be at the expense of quality, which they must know.
We must not let manufacturers off the hook, but must demand that they do this, too.
As we have said, however, supervision is even better and this is what we have to achieve.
I hope that you will manage to move this forward in real terms in the safety package you have been addressing.
