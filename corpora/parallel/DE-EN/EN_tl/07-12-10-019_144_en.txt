on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, this debate criss-crosses the Directives.
Commissioner, you are confusing the Product Safety Directive with the Toy Safety Directive!
We do in fact have an implementation problem with the Product Directive, whereas we have a legislative deficit with the Toy Safety Directive.
Greater supervision does not help us here because we have safety loopholes, namely that dangerous chemicals, for example, are not banned.
Two months ago Commissioner Verheugen guaranteed that the Toy Safety Directive would be presented this month.
He said that toys containing lead should not be entering the European market.
In the first case there is no sign of the review of the Toy Safety Directive.
In the second case, Commissioner Verheugen has admitted to me in writing that he was wrong when he said that toys containing lead were banned in Europe.
This is not right either.
You are confusing the Product Safety Directive and the Toy Safety Directive.
It is therefore very odd when you say we need a bar code for particularly dangerous products.
Hopefully you do not mean that for toys!
Dangerous products have lost nothing in children's hands!
We need the principle of prevention.
Nor are there any warning messages here about magnets.
What about warnings on toys that contain carcinogenic substances?
In Europe we have polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
We shall be banning them in car tyres, but they are permitted in toys even though these are carcinogenic substances.
This debate is absurd because you are criss-crossing both Directives.
Please concentrate in your second answer on the Toy Safety Directive and answer the questions on when this Directive is finally to be submitted and when - as we proposed in our resolution - the legal loopholes are to be filled, and please do not continue to mix them both up.
Supervision is good; laws are better.
