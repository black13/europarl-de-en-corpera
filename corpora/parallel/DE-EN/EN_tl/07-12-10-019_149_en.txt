Mr President, Commissioner, I have already stated in committee that we appreciate your efforts and that we thank you for those efforts.
Nevertheless, some of these things highlight where something is in a bad state.
If you want to provide warnings about magnets, for example, this just shows that the Toy Safety Directive is not adequate.
The Toy Safety Directive is unfortunately based on the new approach.
The new approach implies that the equivalent standardisation committees are active.
Unfortunately, the standardisation committees have not been active regarding magnets, just as they have not been active as regards carcinogenic substances.
Only three carcinogenic substances are currently banned; the rest are not.
We must check as a matter of urgency when we are revising the Toy Safety Directive whether this new approach really is the right way or whether it is not considerably more important for European legislators to lay down standards right now in the toy sector, because toys appeal mainly to children and children must be given special protection.
I appeal to you to check once again whether the new approach really is the right way here or whether we in fact need a different approach when revising the Toy Safety Directive.
I should also like to point out that we have underlined the responsibility of importers when revising the product package.
These importers must take their responsibilities seriously.
I hope that you and the Commission will also be supporting this in the trialogue.
Importers must be held responsible in the same way as manufacturers.
One final point: the Member States.
Here it can be shown that the Product Safety Directive has simply been too weak.
The Member States must be forced to monitor it and they must also be forced to actually phase out certain products.
Unfortunately, not all of them have actually been phased out.
