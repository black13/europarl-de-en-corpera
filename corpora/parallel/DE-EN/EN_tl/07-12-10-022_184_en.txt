on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, the Ottawa Convention is a success thanks to the upward pressure from social movements.
It was not governments that started it, but the anti-land mine movement.
In the meantime 156 countries have signed it, as have 30 armed non-state actors, interestingly enough.
The problem is that it does not cover anti-tank mines.
These anti-tank mines must also be banned, because trucks, buses, etc. are also affected.
Exports must be stopped so that further exports across other countries are no longer possible.
The point is also that other mines associated with land mines must likewise be banned.
Jean-Claude Juncker pinpointed it beautifully in 2004.
He said that a ban on cluster bombs would be the logical extension of the ban on land mines.
I must state very clearly that EU defence procurement groups are producing land mines.
I refer to the German firms Diehl, Rheinmetall and EADS.
There must finally be an end to these brutal murder weapons, land mines, not just here in the European Union, but throughout the world.
