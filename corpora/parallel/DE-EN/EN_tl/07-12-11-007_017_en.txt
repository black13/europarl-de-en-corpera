on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a long and sometimes contentious debate on this subject.
Let me express my thanks to the rapporteur.
He has earned a great deal of respect for his work, which he performed in a focused manner, cooperating well with all his fellow committee members.
Yes, the common organisation of the wine market must be reformed.
It must be adapted to take account of present circumstances and future markets.
At the same time, Commissioner, this proposal raises the question as to whether the Commission ought to interfere in the small things that help to create a regional identity, in the methods that have been practised in particular regions for centuries and underlie the culture of those regions?
Such interference certainly does not help ordinary people.
People sometimes do not understand what is going on.
It is incomprehensible that we should prohibit sucrose while at the same time be signing agreements to import wine produced with sucrose from countries outside the European Union.
Commissioner, as the third institution alongside the Council and Parliament, the Commission should concentrate on its own specific task, namely making proposals which foster the continuing development of the Community, which promote that whole development process.
The common organisation of the market in wine is part of that process.
Let me say on this point that the compromises we reached in committee, for which we grappled and, in some cases, are still grappling, are good for the whole House.
I endorse them on behalf of the PPE-DE Group: we all support the compromises.
We shall reject any amendments that run counter to them.
