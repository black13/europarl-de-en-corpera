on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, we want wine to be a unique beverage, both in its production and in its consumption.
What I mean is that we do not want any oenological methods that take us in the direction of Coca-Cola; we want the future of designations of origin and geographical indications to be secured.
We want to see support for organic production methods, and it is our wish - we have tabled an amendment to this effect - that regions should be able to decide by a majority vote that their wines can be traded in bottles only.
We agree with you that permanent distillation of wine is inappropriate, and its introduction through the back door of crisis distillation must be prevented.
We share your view on that point.
On the question of planting rights, we believe there must be a grubbing-up option.
In point of fact, if no indication is given that new planting will be authorised at some time in a given location, the decision to grub up there is not based on the quantity of wine that can be sold.
This linkage, in short, is imperative, and we support it.
When you speak of enrichment with grape must or sugar and say that there must be a shift in the balance between these two methods, that is fine by us, because it basically means that chaptalisation will remain legal.
If a compromise were found on that basis, we would regard it as an acceptable outcome.
Sugaring is an old oenological process.
We should therefore preserve it and reject the Americans' many unreasonable demands regarding our winemaking processes.
Provided that our amendments are carried, we shall support the rapporteur's draft in its entirety.
