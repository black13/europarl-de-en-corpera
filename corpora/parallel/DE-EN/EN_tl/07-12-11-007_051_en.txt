Madam President, Commissioner, as we have heard today, the tradition of viniculture goes back hundreds of years.
For decades we have been trying to improve the quality of our wines, and those efforts have been extremely successful, which I, as an Austrian, can say of my own country's efforts too, particularly those of my home province of Burgenland.
Part of this success, however, has been down to the use of sucrose as required.
Having to top up the sugar content of wine with must concentrate from other regions would mean influencing and even altering the character of our region's wines.
We certainly cannot consent to that, nor would it make any sense to our growers, who have been nurturing high quality standards for many years.
It is unthinkable that sucrose as an additive should be abolished and replaced with must concentrate to compensate for the abandonment of the very costly practice of crisis distillation.
For this reason, I believe we should support the old compromise package, which will enable us, among other things, to preserve regional winemaking cultures and traditions.
