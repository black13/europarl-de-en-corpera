in writing. - The case of Muhammad the teddy bear has brought home to us once again how easy it is to get into a tight spot in a foreign country.
It does not always take a natural disaster, an accident or the loss of a passport; a cultural misunderstanding can be enough.
We still have a great deal to do in this area.
In Turkey, for example, an applicant country for accession to the EU, life can be dangerous for Western travellers, since - as a very recent study demonstrates - the oft-proclaimed improvement in the protection of minorities exists only on paper, and the situation on the ground has actually deteriorated.
Two things, therefore, need to be done.
The first is to establish a sound network of diplomatic missions that can serve our citizens as an anchor, and the second is to ensure that the travelling public are not only aware of an ambassador's responsibilities but also know that they can seek assistance from the embassy of any EU Member State.
In the light of these considerations, I voted for the envisaged action plan.
