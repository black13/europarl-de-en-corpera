on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the Verts/ALE Group too, the crucial question is whether the European budget is truly geared to future needs and responds to the formidable challenges of the coming years, particularly as regards our responsibility in the field of foreign policy but also in relation to research and development, education and, of course, the struggle against climate change.
We do not believe that the budget as a whole is good enough yet to rise to these major challenges.
Nevertheless, we find it gratifying that the decision in favour of Galileo has now been taken.
That represents something like a bridgehead from which we can go on to change the budget and fit it more adequately for the future, and it is also a historic step for the European Union to put on track such an ambitious project in the realm of industrial policy.
I believe it is very important, particularly in the light of the Lisbon agenda, that Europe should not leave these new technological developments, this navigation system, to the United States or China but that our aim should be to play our own self-assured role in the world and in the global marketplace.
For this reason, I believe we must do even more in the coming years to engineer these changes and to find appropriate answers to global issues.
I am also delighted that we have managed to reallocate resources from the Euratom programme to fund Galileo.
In my opinion, spending existing money on better and less environmentally harmful technology is another step forward.
I would like to add my thanks to my fellow committee members, to Mr BÃ¶ge and to the two rapporteurs for their hard work on this budget.
I certainly believe it is a step in the right direction.
