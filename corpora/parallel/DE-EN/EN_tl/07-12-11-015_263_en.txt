Mr President, the report contains good innovations.
There is, for example, a chapter on the European Neighbourhood Policy.
The report also describes the worsening human rights situation in Russia but sounds a warning against any moves to isolate that country.
Nevertheless, it is important that subsequent dialogues should involve further discussion of issues such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press and religious freedom, anti-NGO and anti-extremist legislation, the fight against terrorism and the Chechnya question.
The Council and the Commission should establish a follow-up mechanism.
Moreover, there is a complete lack of willingness on the Russian side to engage with the NGOs.
We must hope that the Russian Government will agree at long last to take part in the consultations leading up to the human rights dialogues.
The report shows that the EU has become more active in the field of human rights, but it regrettably misses the opportunity to engage in more critical reflection on the human rights situation within the EU itself.
That, however, needs to be done if we are to pursue a credible policy on human rights.
