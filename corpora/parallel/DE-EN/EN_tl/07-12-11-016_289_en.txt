Mr President, allow me to refer to some results of the summit which, I believe, reveal more than anything else the lack of a consistent development policy.
The good frameworks that were created for the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals and climate goals are being demolished again by the build-up of pressure in relation to the economic partnership agreement negotiations and, to an even greater extent, by an energy policy driven by the needs of the conglomerates.
Free trade agreements are to be wrung out of individual partners, which will ensure that even established regional economic areas in Africa are segmented once more.
In the field of energy policy, the only concern is to serve the interests of major European investors, and the drive to export nuclear plants to Africa is, in my view, a scandal.
On the subject of management of migration, you have once again made significant promises.
These, however, run counter to the draft directives on selective migration that Commissioner Frattini has presented.
I believe there is an urgent need to withdraw these drafts, otherwise mobility and freedom of movement between Europe and Africa will remain a pipe dream.
