At the WTO negotiations it will be very important to negotiate on the chapter under which bioethanol should actually be dealt with in future.
Will it be classed as an agricultural product, or does it belong in the category of non-agricultural products?
How does the Commission see the future structure?
Will the more likely aim be to discuss it in the agricultural chapter, or is it more of an industrial product?
Bioethanol comes from a field crop and is essentially an agricultural raw material.
On the other hand, however, as a energy product it could fall under the heading of non-agricultural market access (NAMA).
Has the Commission already formed an opinion on this question and, if so, what line will it pursue in negotiations?
