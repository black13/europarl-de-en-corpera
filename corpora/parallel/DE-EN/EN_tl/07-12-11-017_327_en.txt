Commissioner, in the case of road vehicles, noise emissions may not exceed defined ceilings.
In the case of rail transport, the ceiling is based on average noise levels, which means that extremely high noise levels have to be endured in the vicinity of railway lines simply because the average noise level does not exceed the permitted limit.
Does the Commission intend to adopt similar measures to those that apply to motor vehicles so as to provide relief in future for those who live next to noisy stretches of railway line?
