First of all, thank you very much for your very good and thorough reply.
I only have two brief supplementary questions.
Firstly, is there specific cooperation with the two candidate countries in the region, namely Croatia and Macedonia?
Secondly, Kosovo's energy dependence is a particular problem.
Is it not possible to provide special support for wind and hydro power in neighbouring Albania?
As a matter of fact, there is considerable potential for hydro-electricity generation in Kosovo and Albania in particular but also in Macedonia.
