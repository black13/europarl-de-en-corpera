Commissioner, I should like to ask you a question on this subject that has been occupying me for a long time.
I myself am a member of some of these organisations.
Recently, however, I have been wondering more and more often how democratically these organisations work and whether the Commission checks whether these NGOs are democratic organisations that hold internal elections or whether they are bodies with a command structure that is not open to scrutiny and is not accountable to the members of the organisation or to anyone else, which would mean that funds might, in certain circumstances, be channelled in directions that no one would suspect.
