Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that the enforcement of legal provisions is at least as important as their enactment.
We have a case that you have not mentioned yet.
That is the situation in which the disposal of certain waste is made a criminal offence in one country, and the waste in question is then shipped to another country.
In such a case, in fact, two Member States are probably committing infringements of the Treaty.
Has consideration been given to this eventuality too?
