on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would also like to begin my speech with a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried.
He cooperated closely with us and always kept us informed.
That was a good starting point, for the subject was not the purely technical and administrative matter it might seem at first sight.
It ultimately became very clear that, as is so often the case, this was a struggle involving numerous competing interests.
Let me deal now with the individual points.
I believe - and I hope this reflects a widespread conviction - that a single airspace needs strict and uniform supervision.
Divergent investigation standards must become a thing of the past, and at the end of the day we must have an instrument - an instrument with teeth - to properly implement and enforce the blacklisting rules for aircraft based outside as well as inside the European Economic Area.
We learned at a hearing that blacklisted aircraft cause far more accidents than all the others.
It is, in short, clearly apparent that European rules make very good sense.
We all hope, of course, that we shall now make equally rapid progress on the issue of functional airspace blocks, which continues to be thwarted, as you know, by the national interests of some Member States.
That is a great pity as well as being highly detrimental in the long run to efforts to reduce the volume of emissions from air traffic.
Whether there should be penalties or fines was one of the most complex questions.
Yes, I am afraid there is no alternative in our world.
We saw that intermediate measures were needed for an efficient system, and these have now been put in place.
One final word on cabin crews: I am very pleased that we have now come up with a sound arrangement.
It was high time we did.
The recognition of that occupational group must be taken further, and another task on the agenda will be to cut emissions and to make aviation less harmful to the climate than it has been to date.
