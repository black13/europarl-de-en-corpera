Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the oft-invoked 'European sky' is still far from being a genuine common airspace, even after more than 50 years of the European Communities.
The Member States remain fundamentally unwilling to give up their sovereign airspace for the sake of a united Europe or even to share their sovereignty with Europe.
Moreover, common European legislation is lacking in many specific technical areas too.
Our aim in establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency, or rather in extending its remit, is to forge ahead with a small but important regulatory package.
The Commission presented a balanced proposal.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism and its rapporteur have, we hope, improved it.
In the next step of the process, the report has been the subject of successful consultation with the Council, which means that we can now be hopeful of its adoption at second reading tomorrow.
Lastly, as many other Members have done before me, I should also like to mention the rapporteur and thank him for his good work.
Together with his shadows, Mr Leichtfried has done a really good job.
Let me remind the House, however, that there is still a very great deal to do.
Yesterday and today we discussed many unresolved issues relating to air safety.
I hope we shall manage to reach a consensus on the remaining key issues of funding, comitology and liquids - a buzzword, perhaps, but one with deeper implications.
We need a consensus on these matters if the dream of a common European open sky is to become a reality.
