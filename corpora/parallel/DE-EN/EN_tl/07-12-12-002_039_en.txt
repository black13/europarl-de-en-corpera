Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing the summit, and I do not expect this summit to spring any surprises.
I do expect it, however, to open doors to the future and to position the European Union on many issues.
The first door it must open is the door to ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
We expect ratification to be effected quickly in all Member States and the result of the 2009 elections to the European Parliament to be taken into account in the appointment of office-holders pursuant to the new Treaty.
I also expect, however, that clearing the way for ratification will also mean that the Council and Commission finally begin to communicate and provide information on the content of the Treaty in the Member States.
Do not remain silent about the reasons why we support this Treaty.
We welcome it because it strengthens our citizens, our parliaments, democracy and the European Union.
The second door we are opening is the door to freedom.
Schengen will be discussed.
We are pleased that more Member States now fulfil the Schengen criteria, because meeting the Schengen criteria means more freedom within the European Union and greater freedom for citizens of the European Union.
Thirdly, the door will, I hope, be opened to enable the European Union to assume more global responsibility.
Let me therefore say plainly that the scope for a negotiated solution to the Kosovo question has been exhausted and that the European Union must jointly assume responsibility for Kosovo.
It is our unequivocal view that the future of Kosovo and Serbia lies in the European Union and that we must make every effort to ensure that people's desire to be free and to live in peace with each other is satisfied.
My last point concerns the door to research and technology.
Implement the Galileo decision, which could only be taken because the European Union shouldered its financial responsibility.
