Obrigado, Mr President-in-Office.
We shall see each other again in Lisbon tomorrow, of course, and next week you will be here again to accompany the President of the Council, José Sócrates, but since this was your last speech here in plenary, I should like to express our very sincere thanks to you and to reaffirm that our cooperation with you has been a great pleasure and, above all, a great success.
Thank you, Manuel Lobo Antunes.
