rapporteur. - Madam President, may I ask you to ensure that Members are seated for the vote, because we need the prescribed majorities.
That is very important for the next three reports, otherwise there will be a problem tomorrow with the vote on the budget for 2008.
I therefore request that you ask my fellow Members kindly to sit down and take part in the vote, otherwise we shall have a serious problem.
