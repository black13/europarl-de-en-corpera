Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to convey some information to you, and I ask you to provide now for the necessary calm.
The King of Jordan is in the European Parliament and will address us immediately after the solemn proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Please ensure, not least out of consideration for our guest from Jordan, that we have no more interruptions so that we can complete this proclamation in a dignified manner.
