Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in consideration of the formal sitting with the King of Jordan, all my fellow chairs of the political groups have no doubt been unable to take the opportunity to make a statement under our Rules of Procedure about the preceding occurrences.
I should like to do that now.
I believe I speak on behalf of many Members when I express my thanks first of all to the President of this House, to Mr Barroso and to Mr SÃ³crates for the dignified way in which they defended this solemn act, the signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
They had the overwhelming majority of this House behind them.
(Applause)
There are, however, two things I wish to say to the House, and I say them entirely in a personal capacity and not on behalf of my group.
I speak for myself.
I should like to draw the attention of the House to a matter to which I am privy as chair of a political group.
It is not normal practice to report on the deliberations of the Conference of Presidents, but you should certainly know, ladies and gentlemen, that the only group chairman who asked at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents for an invitation to attend the formal signing of the Treaty in Lisbon was Mr Bonde.
I believe the House should know that.
No other group chair made that request.
Mr Bonde, who makes such a racket here, was determined to be there at the signing of the Treaty.
These are the kind of double standards we have to live with here.
Another comment I wish to make is that I learned at grammar school in Germany about the way in which the tactic of collective chanting was used to shout down political opponents in the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic.
The political group that introduced the practice was the one led by Adolf Hitler.
Today's occurrences reminded me of that.
Thank you.
(Loud applause)
