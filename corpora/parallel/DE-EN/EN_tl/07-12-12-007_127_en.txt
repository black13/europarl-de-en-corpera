Madam President, today we finally saw the introduction of a transitional period for existing nutritional and health claims on the labels of food intended for children.
The Commission had forgotten that and tried to leave Parliament holding the baby.
We have prevented it from doing so.
We have compelled the Commission to make a statement acknowledging the need to introduce transitional periods for claims relating to children's health and development too.
The only problem, however, is that the Commission's long-standing refusal to present a proposal to this effect has distorted competition.
Products have already been taken off the market because the Regulation has entered into force in the meantime.
It has been a seriously botched job on the part of the Commission.
In addition, I tabled a motion on behalf of my group for the deletion of Article 4.
That was a political demonstration.
We stand by our opinion that this Regulation is senseless.
It is not possible to produce nutrient profiles for all foodstuffs.
Almost half of the Members of this House share that view.
EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, has now stated that it cannot see itself being able to provide nutrient profiles for all products.
Nonsensical red tape - a superfluous piece of legislation!
