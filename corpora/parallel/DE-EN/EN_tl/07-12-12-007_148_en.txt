Madam President, in the fight against terrorism, we must deploy all means that are effective, available and compatible with the rule of law.
If the Union wants to win that fight, it must cooperate with partners.
I voted against this resolution because of its anti-American tone.
Instead of standing up against terrorism, the author and many others take a stand against partnership with the United States in the fight against terrorism.
Another reason why I voted against the draft resolution is that it calls on the Commission and the Council to bring detainees from Guant√°namo to Europe.
That would amount to importing terrorism into Europe.
It would be a misguided act.
The third reason why I voted against the resolution is that it rejects measures which are demonstrably usable in the fight against terrorism, namely the extension of passenger name records to Europe and a reinforcement of Europol.
