in writing. - In the common organisation of the wine market, the Commission seeks to take account of the special characteristics of wine-producing regions by delegating more responsibility and creating more scope for initiative.
Today the European Parliament has set down these very aims on paper.
We have absolute confidence in our proposals, which were adopted by all Members of Parliament from all Member States.
Viniculture in Europe is part of our heritage.
The cradle of global wine production is here in Europe.
Viniculture means business, income and jobs.
It is not the task of the Commission to seek market balance by limiting our production or by changing the rules to make production impossible.
It is, however, the Commission's task to safeguard our share of global markets and to ensure that our products enjoy the international prestige they merit.
The aim must not be to restrict the market but to open up new markets.
Why should we alter winemaking methods for wines that are selling well?
Our winemaking methods are rooted in ancient cultures and traditions.
Today the European Parliament has clearly reaffirmed its support for more market measures, national budgets and scope for regional initiative, for socially sensitive phasing-out of intervention measures and for the preservation of existing oenological practices, in other words the addition of sucrose and rectified concentrated must (RCM), with these additives being placed on an equal footing by means of additional RCM subsidies.
I hope that our proposals will be incorporated into the new common organisation of the market in wine.
