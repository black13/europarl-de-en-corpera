in writing. - In years when conditions are unfavourable for vine-growing and when there is too little sunshine, the fructose content of grapes is insufficient to produce the volume of alcohol required for fermentation.
For this reason we add sugar, which does not alter the taste of the wine.
The crucial point is that the sugar is added before fermentation and not afterwards, which means that it is not a matter of sweetening sour wine, and the addition of sugar is only permissible for table wines and vins de pays.
This should remain the case in future.
The Commission's plans to replace beet sugar, which has hitherto been the standard additive, with grape must from the southern regions with production surpluses, do not stand up to scrutiny.
Apart from the impassioned debate among experts regarding variations in flavour, there is also an environmental argument.
It does not make sense to me to transport grape must all the way across Europe to areas that already have their own supply of sugar beet.
