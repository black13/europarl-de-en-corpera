in writing. - With its proposal for the reform of wine production, the Commission seems to have come up with yet another pièce de résistance.
On the one hand, it is trying to dry out Europe's wine lakes by giving financial rewards for reductions in the total vineyard area, while on the other hand it intends to allow vine-planting everywhere after 2013.
If the growing restrictions are lifted, however, labour-intensive hillside vineyards will become unviable.
As if it were not enough to make these wine producers fear for their existence, the planned sugaring ban would deprive the whole of northern Europe of its harvest in years with relatively little sunshine, while the abolition of aid for concentrated grape must would ultimately make wine production impossible in southern Europe too.
Add to that the mooted ban on the designation 'table wine', which would inevitably result in a surfeit of varietal wines of the lowest category, and it becomes impossible to avoid the notion that the planners of this reform simply lack the necessary expertise and sensitivity.
The Castiglione report is an improvement on these proposals, which is why I have voted for it.
