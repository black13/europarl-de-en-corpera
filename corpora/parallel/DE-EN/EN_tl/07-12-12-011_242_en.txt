Madam President, the human rights dialogue between the EU and China has been taking place twice a year behind closed doors for the last eleven years, and yet it has done nothing to improve the human rights situation in China.
Reports of executions, torture in prisons and labour camps and the oppression of the Tibetans plainly show that we Europeans are not shouldering our responsibility.
The Olympic Games are coming up, and they give China good reason to furnish proof of genuine reforming zeal.
At the same time, we must not practise double standards either.
It is very gratifying that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel received the Dalai Lama in spite of heavy criticism.
It would only be logical if leaders in Belgium, France and other countries were to do likewise.
The EU is accepted worldwide as the voice of human rights, and it is high time we acted consistently in every context, including that of our dialogue with China.
