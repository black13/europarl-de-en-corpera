Mr President, Montenegro is not just one of the world's most beautiful countries; it is also the Balkan country with the oldest tradition of independence in the modern era.
When Belgium was founded, Montenegro had already been independent for centuries and possessed the characteristics of a state.
I stress this because Montenegro is always wrongly dismissed as an example of a superfluous tiny land that suddenly found itself independent by a quirk of fate.
Let me say to Mr Markov that Montenegro was annexed by its Serbian ally after the First World War.
There was no question of voluntary union at that time.
A pro forma parliamentary vote was taken, but that was all.
There was a massive Montenegrin liberation movement, whose activities continued through the twenties and into the thirties.
Tito then restored Montenegro's independence within Yugoslavia, and under Tito's Yugoslav Constitution it had a right of secession.
When it tried to exercise that right, however, obstacles were placed in its way.
Today it is an independent country on the way to membership of the European Union.
We must support the democratic forces there.
As has already been said, its treatment of minorities is an example to many others in the region, which is why the minorities supported independence.
What it still needs, however, is a stronger system of independent education, such as that provided by the Franciscan school centre in Tuzi, near Podgorica.
Private education initiatives are needed to release the country from its rigidity.
I call on the government to keep moving vigorously along this path towards pluralism, not only in the economy but also in education and in the country's constitutional and democratic structures.
(Applause)
