Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the example of Montenegro shows how important a referendum can be.
I therefore understand why numerous posters calling for a referendum were held aloft in the House today, as the Treaty of Lisbon itself, of course, gives us the option of offering the European people such a referendum.
I believe it is important that the general public are involved in the consultation process and that they have the opportunity to express their wishes.
In Montenegro I believe there is also a need to improve the country's economic structures; as Mr Posselt has already indicated, the educational establishments and programmes of the European Union are particularly important in that respect.
In energy too, energy efficiency and renewables pose a huge challenge in Montenegro as well as offering unprecedented opportunities.
In the telecommunications sector too, it would be desirable for Montenegro to transpose the Roaming Directive into national law because that could, of course, contribute to better communication with our European countries at more reasonable prices.
It goes without saying that the environment is one of the key challenges, and the domain of waste management, sewage works and waste water poses a particular problem.
If we speak of magnificent unspoiled natural beauty, we have grounds for applying the latest standards there.
The European Union is offering environmental support frameworks, which should be put in place as soon as possible.
