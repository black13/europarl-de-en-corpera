rapporteur. - Allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.
Commissioner Kyprianou, I tabled an amendment providing for certain exceptions, which are not intended to be implemented on a voluntary basis, and indeed the original instrument also allows for a variation, an updating, if it is done in accordance with Article 9(4).
In certain circumstances - and these must not include voluntary arrangements, which would render the whole exercise pointless - it would be possible to give some consideration to ways in which the concerns that my fellow Members have expressed here could be met in practice.
This is only intended as a suggestion and a question to which you might like to give some thought.
