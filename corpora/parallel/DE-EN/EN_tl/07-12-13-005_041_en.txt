draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy thanks the rapporteur for adopting our proposals.
We think an agreement is reasonable, but would nevertheless point out that there have been considerable sectoral problems with Korea in the past.
I am thinking here of the discussion on dumping prices in the shipbuilding industry in recent years, for instance, where we also had lawsuits.
We wish to ascertain whether these sectoral problems are being resolved in order to ensure that both sides really are opening up and Korea is not the unilateral beneficiary, and that - even when we think of our pharmaceutical industry, the car industry, of the many industrial sectors - reciprocity is guaranteed.
One particular subject was Kaesong.
The Commissioner has just addressed the issue of how to involve these North Korean special zones.
According to what I am hearing, eight other special zones are planned.
In the opinion of the Committee on Industry, international standards must apply here.
We cannot undermine our own free trade agreements in this way.
We therefore ask that this aspect in particular be thoroughly checked.
Otherwise, many thanks - to the Commission, too - for these negotiations!
