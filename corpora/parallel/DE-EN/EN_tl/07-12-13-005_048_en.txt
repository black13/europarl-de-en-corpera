Mr President, as leader of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur specifically and say that I am very happy to back this report.
I should also like to emphasise something that many still do not know: that the Republic of Korea is an important trading partner.
Precisely for this reason it is important that we conclude a free trade agreement.
The aim of this agreement must be to achieve fair and equitable trading conditions to our mutual advantage and our mutual benefit.
I can also say that I am pleased that the negotiations have been running substantially better in the fifth round than they did in the fourth round.
I should like to encourage Korea to support EU proposals for the faster and reciprocal abolition of import duties.
The EU's target for this would be 2015.
As we all know, the motor vehicle sector is and remains a challenge in the negotiations.
What we as the European Union expect is that our safety standards are accepted by Korea just as we, too, accept Korea's standards in this sector.
I am optimistic that the barriers in the pharmaceutical products and services sectors, and particularly in the banking and legal advice sectors, can be removed.
With regard to Kaesong, I should like to say that it would be significant for the negotiating partners to find a way of supporting the Kaesong project and other projects, on economic and political grounds, particularly for introducing North Korea to the international community of states.
We are generally on the right track and I hope that there will be a conclusion at the beginning or in the first half of 2008.
