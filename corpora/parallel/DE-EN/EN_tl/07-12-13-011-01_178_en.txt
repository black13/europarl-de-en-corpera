on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, it has been said of the last Bourbon kings that they always took action too late on an idea, a government or an army.
This unfortunately seems to be the case today for the West and for Europe, because we have already allowed the catastrophe in Darfur and in eastern Chad to go on far too long.
The later we intervene, the more costly it becomes, not just financially, but militarily and politically as well.
I am therefore very grateful to Mr von Wogau for moving matters ahead decisively on military and security policy and I am very grateful to Mr Dess for doing the same in the humanitarian sector.
We ultimately have to take action.
However, the nations are procrastinating, not only on the equipment required, but also on the troops required.
We need troops and forces on the ground with local knowledge and experience.
I am very much of the opinion that there should be no disguised French operation, which nobody is talking about either, but we do need the local knowledge and experience of the French.
We also, however, need the cooperation of the African Union and the Arab League, which are unfortunately still keeping completely aloof.
This should not, however, absolve us Europeans of our responsibilities.
I say very clearly: we want to get involved but we must not make the mistakes we made in Afghanistan, namely intervening without having a political strategy.
Anyone who intervenes there must also know that they must have a strategy for peace talks, for interethnic discussions and for a solution to the massive tribalism and other conflicts that exist both in eastern Chad and in Darfur along the artificial borders.
As the European Parliament, we should therefore be campaigning for the deployment of troops and for humanitarian aid, but we should also be making our contribution as quickly as possible to a sustainable political peace strategy for the region.
