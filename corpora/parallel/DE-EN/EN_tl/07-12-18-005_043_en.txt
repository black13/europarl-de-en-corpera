- Mr President, there is no question that you have securely moored a lurching ship to the Tejo Quay here.
The issue is simply: what is on the ship?
Has what the former German President Roman Herzog observed so critically about the Constitution now been cleared up?
Does it not come ashore any more, is it no longer on the ship of the Reform Treaty?
Or are you simply pushing it aside?
You say that we have the capacity to act.
There is something in that.
It is just that this is still not a democratic value.
Even dictatorships are proud when they are able to demonstrate the capacity to act.
And what about the matter of justice - where is the progress there?
I think there would be a way out of this bureaucratic impasse and the waste into which you have manoeuvred yourselves here.
This would be the referendums.
It is a shame that you are avoiding these if you are so convinced that you have moored the right ship to the Tejo Quay.
