- Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, alongside all the successes of the last six months, the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon is certainly the absolute highlight of the Portuguese Presidency.
I think that this Treaty of Lisbon, which will also go down in the history books, is the third significant European treaty after the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty.
After the Nice Summit in December 2000, therefore exactly seven years ago, this Parliament showed a great deal of energy and commitment in achieving an improved European treaty and I believe the entire Parliament will thank you for the fact that it can now become a reality seven years on.
It can become a reality if all 27 Member States also ratify it, as has been repeatedly stated here.
Last week in Strasbourg I was shocked, to be frank, that there is a coalition of nine countries opposing Europe from the radical left to the radical right.
Let us not be fooled: many who say here that they want to include citizens in truth merely want to confuse them and obstruct Europe.
This is not about citizen participation, but about halting further European unity.
One of the visions of the Treaty of Lisbon is the creation of a European democracy, and this is new: it does not exist anywhere in the world.
May I say thank you that the regulation on the European parties has also come about under your Presidency.
We really have created a masterpiece at first reading.
It is also the basis for European political foundations and therefore for many platforms for setting up a European debate and publicity for Europe.
I should like to say in conclusion, Mr SÃ³crates, that we have planted a seed here, which in just a few years will grow into a tall tree with many branches.
I hope that these branches will already be visible in the campaign for the next European elections in June 2009.
Many thanks for your Presidency.
