Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it is very poor practice indeed for important debates to be concluded without a resolution.
This Parliament is here to take clear positions and not just to be a talking shop for group chairmen and other group spokespersons without the adoption of resolutions.
Mr Musharraf will be coming here and he should know what this Parliament thinks about the situation in his country, so that we can argue the matter out with him.
I believe we should be bold enough to put an end to the old habit of postponing the adoption of decisions for fear of acting on our own courage, by voting for a resolution.
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
