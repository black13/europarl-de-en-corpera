Mr President, we are very shocked at the Russian Government's closure of all the regional offices of the British Council.
These regional offices have been sacrificed as a result of the worsening relations between Russia and the United Kingdom.
Can civil society in Russia expect nothing more than this kind of provocation?
The murder of Alexander Litvinenko has still not been solved and Russia refuses to cooperate in the matter.
The chief suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, has been a member of the Duma since the end of 2007.
The circumstances surrounding the death of Anna Politkovskaya have also still not been explained.
Is criticism being stifled under a mantle of secrecy or is it simply being eradicated?
The EU must call on Russia to respect human rights and the rule of law.
We can set an example by naming our press office after Anna Politkovskaya.
