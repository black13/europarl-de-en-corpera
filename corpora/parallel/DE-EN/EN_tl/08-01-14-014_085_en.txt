Mr President, car manufacturing is one of Europe's key industries.
It employs some 12 million people, it represents innovation and growth and it produces something designed to provide individual mobility.
It must therefore be our aim to see that the European car industry maintains its global leadership and its competitiveness.
At the same time, however, we need to remember that in today's global economy there is a very fine line between incentives for innovation and penalties for economic actions, and that, at the end of the day, we are still exporting the best products in the world and not just outsourcing our production locations.
I essentially want to focus on the CO2 issue, which is without doubt one of the most important aspects of the subject we are discussing here.
Lifestyle criticism, which Mr Verheugen mentioned, has long been an unpleasant aspect of the European climate debate.
It is very 'in' to criticise individual lifestyles.
Claude Turmes has just done as much.
The thing is, if we were to withdraw all the two-tonne limousines from the market, as he would dearly like to do, the CO2 reductions would scarcely be measurable, but the damage to the national economy would be enormous.
Let me now comment on the proposed CO2 regulation that is currently on the table.
Mr Verheugen has said quite clearly in this respect that he has no wish to introduce legislation that would constitute a lifestyle criticism.
However, when I look at the penalty payments now being proposed for minimal deviations from the prescribed limits, I tend to be of the view that this is precisely what the Commission has done.
In actual fact, the regulation that we are discussing and approving here today is hostile to innovation, for the money that the car manufacturers will have to pay out is needed for innovation and research.
