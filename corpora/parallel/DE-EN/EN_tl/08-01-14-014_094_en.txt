Mr President, I wanted to direct a further question to Mr Verheugen.
Mr Verheugen, in your speech you said that the rules that we are now laying down for the car industry would as good as mean the relocation of European industry.
You repeatedly referred to the pressure being applied to the European automotive industry.
Could you perhaps subsequently make it clear in your presentation that the regulations that we are introducing will of course apply equally to all motor manufacturers worldwide?
This naturally means that the Japanese car industry will also have to comply with these rules.
Moreover, in this respect let me just add a further comment: last week you presented us with the 'lead market initiatives'.
Does this not then mean that in the car manufacturing sector in particular we are positioning Europe as the market that now has the most demanding legislation and that we are therefore specifically creating a lead market for efficient motor cars, even allowing for environmental constraints and oil supply problems?
