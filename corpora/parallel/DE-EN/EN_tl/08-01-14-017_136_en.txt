on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there was another reason why the debate on airport charges and on their common regulation took such an extremely long time.
An additional factor was the endless series of interventions in the course of the debate in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
This dossier was the subject of extreme lobbying, in other words there were lots of monetary interests tied up with it, and we as Members of this House have to ask one or two questions.
What is behind all this?
Why is this happening?
Why such a hard fight, why such tough arguing?
The answer can always be found by asking: who benefits from intransparency?
The old question of who gains, or as the Latin puts it cui bono, helps provide an answer here.
Intransparency always benefits those who have market power, those who can dictate the conditions.
Only in very few cases is this beneficial or even fair to the consumer.
There is unfair competition whenever there is a lack of transparency, when there is concealed patronage and when there are hidden subsidies.
This is why I considered it very important that we should produce a common regulation.
For me the downside is that we were not able to regulate a much larger number of airports.
I would also have liked to include the smaller installations within the scope of the directive, for these are often in unfair competition with the larger airports because they massively promote the low-budget carriers.
Just one final point: I believe that it is very important to introduce an amendment that will link airport charges to emission performance.
This is an opportunity for us to lessen the environmental impact of the air transport industry and at the same time to reduce the noise nuisance for the more seriously affected residents.
