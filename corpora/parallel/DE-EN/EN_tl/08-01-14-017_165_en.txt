rapporteur. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank everyone for their comments and suggestions.
We still have a certain distance to go together and there will be some hard bargaining when the Council presents its common position.
In recent weeks it has become apparent that the Council is coming over to our way of thinking on several points, including the scope of the directive, the subject of airport networks and the rejection of 'opt-outs' by national states.
However, there are also some new points that have not yet even been discussed, such as setting national upper limits on charges.
There therefore needs to be further internal discussion on these matters.
It will first of all be important to reach as much common agreement as possible on these points tomorrow so that we have a strong negotiating mandate when presented with the Council's position.
I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for the detailed position that you have presented.
I would just like to conclude by explaining why infrastructure pre-financing is so important for this Parliament: for one thing, it is possible under the ICAO; secondly, we naturally do not want to see a sudden escalation of charges when the new infrastructure comes on the market; and finally, of course, there is a large backlog demand, not just in Eastern Europe but in other new Member States too.
However, I know that this is a contentious issue and we will have to wait and see what progress can be made here.
Thank you again and I look forward to further discussions with you and with my fellow Members here.
May I also thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation.
(Applause)
