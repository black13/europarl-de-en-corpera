draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Madam President, I should like to extend my warmest thanks most especially to the rapporteur and the Commission, and of course to the Council too.
We have presented a very good report here.
We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have given a high priority to producing a practical regulation that will control the international import and export of hazardous chemicals in a reasonable and logical way and that is sufficiently coherent that the importing countries can understand what we in the European Union are trying to achieve.
That essentially was the main problem, namely that we had put in some nice things and we had put in some dangerous things but no-one could understand what it actually all meant, all the stuff that we then added in the supplement to the international list.
The proposal before us is a good regulation and I hope that it will be understood at international level, so that it can also be properly applied.
Things that are not understood will of course not make much sense.
This can be just as dangerous; if something is not understood then it will not work no matter what.
The Committee on Industry is satisfied and I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for having negotiated with such persistence and common sense that we ultimately achieved a good compromise.
I would just request that we do not try to add further to the list immediately but that we test out what is there so that we then actually have a piece of legislation that works.
