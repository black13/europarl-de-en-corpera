Madam President, I too would like to thank Mr Blokland.
I am pleased that the European Parliament has changed tack and has closed this massive loophole.
We know that there are more than 1.5 million cases of poisoning and nearly 30 000 deaths a year in the developing world.
It would have been appalling if the Commission's proposal had come into force, as this would have meant that dangerous chemicals could be exported without the authorisation of the importing countries provided that no response had been received within 90 days.
It would also have been a very questionable interpretation of the health and environment legislation if we had continued exporting when on the one hand we are laying down a new safety landmark by way of the latest pesticide certification, while on the other we are doing the very opposite with our exports.
The EU should not just be ensuring a high level of protection on its own doorstep but should also be advocating the same for the rest of the world, and this paradoxical softening of the export rules would have done nothing for the EU's credibility.
What is more, we need greater transparency when it comes to the export of chemicals and pesticides.
There needs to be a better system for disclosing the quantities of products being exported by the EU Member States.
After all, we are talking about the movement of goods that are subject to restrictions and prohibitions and we in the Member States need maximum transparency in this area.
We therefore require more information on the quantities involved and on the particular Member States the materials are coming from.
