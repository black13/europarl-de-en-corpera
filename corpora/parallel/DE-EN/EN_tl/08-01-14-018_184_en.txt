in writing. - The new regulation on the import of certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides now includes a number of sensible technical amendments.
In the past, international trade in this area was forever being halted because of administrative obstacles.
This was mainly due to the fact that the importing country had to give its 'explicit consent' before the goods could be shipped out.
There is no doubt that this consent is absolutely essential when dealing with potentially hazardous substances and for this reason it is a requirement that should be retained.
The principle of subsidiarity is, after all, one of the pillars of the Union and it is important that the Member States themselves should in future still be able to determine which potentially hazardous substances are allowed to cross their borders.
However, from the point of view of free trade we need to retain a certain amount of flexibility in this area.
Having more room for manoeuvre also makes it easier to prevent those countries whose import surveillance systems have not yet been sufficiently developed from being taken advantage of by exporters whose operations are not effectively monitored.
The current compromise takes these considerations into account and not only ensures that potentially dangerous chemicals are traded in a responsible way but also provides the room for manoeuvre that is needed so that the international exchange of goods can continue to run smoothly.
