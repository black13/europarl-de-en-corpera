on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Willmott, for her excellent work and especially for having been so willing to compromise.
More than 160 000 people are killed and some 300 000 incapacitated every year in the EU because of industrial accidents and occupational diseases.
That is too many.
In this society of ours in which the individual is often regarded as a mere production factor, too little emphasis is placed on the human aspect of this problem.
The state, by which I mean legislatures and governments, must ensure that purely profit-driven business operators bear the social cost of exploitation.
That is the only way to ensure that the necessary priority is attached to health and safety at work.
Public opinion tends to take more notice of industrial accidents than of the wide diversity of occupational diseases.
More extensive and vigorous efforts are needed to redress the balance.
Improvements cannot be achieved without close scrutiny, in other words inspections and analyses and the setting of precise targets for reductions in the incidence of occupational diseases, including new illnesses affecting those who work in fields such as nanotechnology.
