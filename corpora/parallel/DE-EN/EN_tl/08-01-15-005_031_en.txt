Madam President, a Community strategy for health and safety at work is absolutely essential.
While technical health and safety measures are effecting rapid improvements, the meteoric pace of change in the working world poses new risks.
The problems and hazards involved in working with new chemical substances are self-evident.
First and foremost, however, the increasing pressure to perform which characterises the contemporary workplace creates not only physical problems but psychological problems too.
Insecure jobs and people's fear of losing their livelihood lead to psychosocial problems.
New potential for aggression builds up, new stress factors lead to mental abuse, and bullying becomes a common occurrence.
SMEs are particularly susceptible to such contemporary phenomena unless these are curbed by means of countermeasures, information, supervision and training.
Accordingly, this resolution is more important than is probably recognised.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
