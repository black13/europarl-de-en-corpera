Madam President, health in the workplace must be given priority.
Our Parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are among the places where more action is needed.
Just take the ambient temperature in this chamber, which borders on a health risk.
I also believe in the power of good example.
A few months ago I was stranded in a hotel in Greece as a forest fire raged all around, and I must say that the hotel, a typical SME, had prepared for that eventuality in the most exemplary fashion.
Had not all the safety precautions been perfectly devised, well organised and properly drilled, many of the people there could probably not have survived.
That is why I believe that great importance attaches to this learning process to which Mr Ettl referred, this training and preparing for emergencies.
Incentive systems would also be useful in this respect; insurers, for example, could allow appropriate discounts on premiums to companies with trained staff, and social-insurance schemes could also offer relevant training courses.
