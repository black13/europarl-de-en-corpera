on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must regrettably adopt a directive tomorrow which does not meet our own criterion of better regulation.
There has been no impact assessment, even though this is an entirely new proposal, in spite of the intervening enlargement of the EU with the accession of 12 new Member States, in spite of major differences between Member States in financing practices and regulatory systems and in spite of social disparities within Member States.
Instead of complete harmonisation, there was an urgent need to give the Member States greater freedom of action.
The Member States can respond quite differently and far more quickly today to the various new models that appear on the market on a daily basis.
The Member States are also better equipped to respond to a financial crisis.
They can regulate matters in a shorter time frame than it takes the European Union to act.
This is why it would have been wise to confine ourselves here to minimal harmonisation instead of trying to harmonise as much as possible.
That is the criticism we have to make of this consumers' directive.
Moreover, we also deplore the fact that numerous opt-out clauses have had to be adopted in order to get all the Member States on board.
This, unfortunately, has done nothing at all for the rigour of the provisions.
There is also, however, one exemption for which we would argue, and it relates to renovation loans.
In view of the formidable challenges posed by climate change, there is an urgent need to exempt from this proposal renovation loans secured by mortgage, which have nothing to do with consumer credit but should be treated as mortgage loans.
