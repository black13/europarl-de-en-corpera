Mr President, I have only one request.
Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure states that 'Normally Parliament shall vote by a show of hands'.
For this reason it would be right to examine whether the IND/DEM Group's motion to have all votes taken by roll call is consistent with the Rules of Procedure.
I believe it is not.
May I ask that this be done by tomorrow.
I believe we shall be voting today as stipulated in the voting list, but I would ask that the question of legal admissibility be reviewed by tomorrow.
