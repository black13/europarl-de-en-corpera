Mr President, in this House we have very liberal and, in particular, minority-friendly Rules of Procedure, and rightly so.
It is our wish and our duty to preserve them.
This, however, presupposes that the various groups exercise their minority rights properly and do not abuse them.
When that happens - as it has done today - we should rethink this practice.
