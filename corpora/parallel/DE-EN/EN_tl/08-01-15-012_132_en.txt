on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I only wish to acknowledge that the President who chaired the sitting this morning did indeed forget to ask who wished to speak for and against the proposal.
It is equally true, however, that a clear majority of this House voted that we should not debate or hear the explanations of vote now but at ten o'clock this evening.
Now there is a new proposal, and I wish to support it on behalf of my Group and, I think, on behalf of other Members too.
I believe the arrangement you have proposed makes good sense, and we shall see how the vote goes.
Moreover, as you said yourself, the House is sovereign.
The majority of the House will decide.
(Applause)
