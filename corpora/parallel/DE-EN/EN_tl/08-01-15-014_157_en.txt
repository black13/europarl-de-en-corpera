Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to take the opportunity to make two basic points.
The first is that I fervently hope and urgently appeal for immediate action to appoint the director of this Fundamental Rights Agency as soon as its work programme has been adopted, for the whole purpose of establishing an agency is that it should be made fully functional as soon as possible.
My second basic point is that I wish to use this discussion to call once again for an appraisal of the performance and utility of all agencies.
As a matter of fact, I am not convinced that all agencies work in the way we wish or that they must exist for all eternity; on the contrary, I firmly believe that there are some parallel structures and that it would certainly be possible to dispense with some agencies without anyone noticing their absence or being any the worse for it.
I should like to ask you when the Commission intends to launch such an evaluation.
