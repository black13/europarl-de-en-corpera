draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Mr President, may I begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report and on the cooperative nature of our deliberations.
We fully agree with many major aspects of the report.
I wish to highlight two points, however, to which I attach particular importance.
The first of these is the right to education as a prerequisite for children's social development.
The Member States must create unhampered access to education for all children and young people, regardless of their ethnic and social background and their family circumstances.
This also means that any kind of exclusion, discrimination and violence against children must be prevented.
It is essential to press ahead as quickly as possible with the launch of the helpline.
The second point that is very important to me is the promotion of language, as languages are one of Europe's cultural treasures.
There is also an innovation that we should not overlook, for the rights of children also extend now to their involvement in new developments in the field of education and training and in particular the cultivation of media literacy.
Competence in the use of information and communication media is an extremely important educational tool and must be vigorously developed.
