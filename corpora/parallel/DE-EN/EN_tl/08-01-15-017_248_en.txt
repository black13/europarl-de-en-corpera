Vice-President of the Commission. - I shall gladly do so.
In answer to your first question, let me say that I have already decided that parallel trade in counterfeit medicines will be treated as a matter of priority.
I have amended the workplan of the Directorate-General, and we shall be making legislative proposals during the current year.
I believe that can be done shortly after the summer recess.
As for your other question, I am grateful for your recognition that I cannot answer it without prior examination.
I shall have that examination carried out, and you will receive the requested written answer in the coming days.
