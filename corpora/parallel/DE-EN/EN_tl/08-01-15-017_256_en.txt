There is something I would be interested to know.
We have this 30% reduction target imposed from the top down, and it does seem to be widely endorsed.
As you quite rightly said, others must follow suit if these targets are to be achieved.
My own question to you is this: do you yourself have a plan for achieving this 30% reduction personally in your own sphere of activity?
