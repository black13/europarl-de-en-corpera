As we know, the European Parliament has set a reduction target of 30% by 2012 on the basis of EMAS, and we are keen to see what specific measures are adopted by the European Parliament and its decision-makers.
Commissioner, you said that the application of EMAS would mean less electricity consumption.
It would interest me to know what specific measures have been taken, what specific measures are planned for the coming years, and what role renewables are to play.
