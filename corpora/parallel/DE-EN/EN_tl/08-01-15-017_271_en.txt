Commissioner, you have indicated that a great deal is being done to remove dangerous toys from the market.
That is an important step.
The fact is, however, that some of these products are being marketed here with generally recognised certification marks, including in some cases the familiar CE mark.
Under any rules of good practice, if a toy is not demonstrably safe or is actually dangerous, such labelling is not only abusive but downright fraudulent.
Is there scope to envisage criminal prosecution in such cases?
