rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all may I thank everyone involved for the flowers they have presented to me.
I would be happy to give a few blooms from this bouquet to Jan Figeľ.
After having campaigned for adult education since 1993 and having seen the first fruits of these efforts, I am gratified that we have now achieved the great breakthrough in that the importance of adult education is recognised in every sphere of political activity.
I am particularly keen that every possible incentive be created to motivate adults to re-enter the education process.
Many have never had the opportunity, and many need to be motivated.
There is also a need to overcome these people's inhibitions and remove barriers.
This is why I also believe that the numerous adult-education centres, foundations and charitable organisations which, as we know, are already doing outstanding work in this field should be supported and that these providers' high standards - and I see no reason why they cannot become even higher - should be maintained.
As I said before, we must ensure that the quality of adult education is further improved.
I was delighted to hear that a working group had already been formed in your area of the Commission, Mr Figeľ.
I am pleased that it can perhaps be linked with Grundvig too so that we can light the fuse, as it were, for the national governments.
Let us therefore make a start.
The many fine words really must now give way to deeds, and our task is simply to disprove the venerable saying 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks'.
In the context of adult education that is as wrong as anything can be, which is why I hope that we can now try, by dint of our own efforts and with your help, to hoist the national governments into the saddle so that they can start trotting, for it will take a while before they are ready to gallop.
