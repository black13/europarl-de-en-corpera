in writing. - I did not vote for this report on the Airport Charges Directive, because what is being proposed here amounts to unacceptable discrimination against Luxembourg Airport.
This is no way to treat a small country.
The application of the directive to Luxembourg Airport, with its 1.6 million passengers a year, and the fact that its provisions do not apply to either of Luxembourg's direct competitors, Frankfurt Hahn and Brussels Charleroi, which process more than three million passengers, is intolerable discrimination in a single market and is based solely on the fact that a national border lies between Luxembourg and these other airports.
The key factor in this directive must not be national borders but objective criteria if its purpose is to ensure that no airport abuses a dominant market position.
Smaller airports, even if they are the only air terminal in their country, do not run the risk of perpetrating such abuse, especially in the case of Luxembourg, where the aforementioned rival airports lie within easy reach and, moreover, are used by budget airlines.
Luxembourg is so small that three different countries lie less than half an hour away from the airport by car.
This proposal is an imposed infringement of the proportionality principle which cannot be accepted as it stands.
That is why I am voting against the proposal by way of protest.
