in writing. - Unscrupulous traders are trying to evade the special requirements that apply to the transport of chemicals and other hazardous goods, requirements such as specialised driver training, labelling and the like.
Vans belonging to parcel services carry highly corrosive acids, explosive liquids or ammunition, often without the driver even knowing.
If items are not labelled and waybills do not indicate the true nature of the goods, staff may be risking their lives in the event of an accident.
A fire would have unimaginably dire consequences, not only in the form of permanent damage to health but possibly of environmental contamination too.
It makes sense to simplify the requirements for the transport of dangerous goods without compromising safety.
There is also a need to think about ways of speeding up the switchover to double-hull tankers in order to reduce the incidence of environmental disasters.
Above all, however, more targeted spot checks on HGVs are needed throughout the EU so that the black sheep who drive with unsecured, unlabelled or dangerous loads, defective brakes, etc., can be taken off the road.
