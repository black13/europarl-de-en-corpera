in writing. - The report entitled CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework has my full support.
This report can help to enhance the competitiveness of the car industry.
Besides imposing new obligations on the industry in the form of environmental requirements, we also need to give it simplified procedures, to cut red tape and to apply the principles of better lawmaking.
In addition, the automotive sector must benefit from more research and development funding.
With regard to the achievement of the target CO2 values, it is important that we base the phased reductions on the parameter of vehicle weight rather than the 'carbon footprint'.
The only physical correlation that exists is between the weight of a vehicle and its CO2 emissions.
The carbon footprint does not offer this kind of correlation, and its use would only serve to put the German car industry at a competitive disadvantage.
We have come out emphatically in favour of an integrated strategy that takes account of all possible means of reducing CO2 emissions.
We want factors such as individual driver behaviour, the creation of various incentives to drive environmentally clean cars, the use of biofuels and the promotion of new forms of vehicle technology to contribute to the reduction of emission levels.
This poses a challenge not only to car manufacturers but to all stakeholders.
