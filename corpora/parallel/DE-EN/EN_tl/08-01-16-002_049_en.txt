- Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the night between 20 and 21 December 2007 we extended the Schengen border.
We gained a bit more freedom again and came another step closer to each other.
The barbed wire has finally been removed and Slovenia took over the Presidency of the Council of a reunited Europe on 1 January.
As a European, but particularly as an Austrian, a friend, a neighbour and an ally, I am very pleased about this.
President-in-Office of the Council, this debate revolves around six items.
Firstly, the fact that you hold the Presidency has more than merely symbolic value.
It makes us aware of historic developments that for many have either already become self-evident or are unfortunately seen as a threat.
Secondly, the ratification process started in Hungary.
You need to structure and galvanise the process and provide sufficient coordinated information to the citizens of Europe.
Thirdly, please use the targets for climate change and greater European energy independence to provide further impetus for growth, employment and social cohesion when implementing the Lisbon Strategy.
Fourthly, your geographical position, experience of history and the timing of your Presidency give you special responsibility in terms of Croatia's accession, freedom for Kosovo and the agreement with Serbia.
Fifthly, we are embarking with you on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Let this Presidency be one of cooperation, of mutual respect, thoughtfulness towards one another and mutual understanding.
The sixth and final item: do not confuse your European responsibility with the bilateral issues to be resolved or Austria's responsibility towards the Slovenian minority in Austria.
Bilateral treaties between two Member States do not fall within the European Union's remit.
