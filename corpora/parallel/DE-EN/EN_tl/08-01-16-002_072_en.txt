Mr President, Prime Minister, we have various projects that are very important for us, including the 'Research on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises' project.
I would ask that the Council's conclusions insist that we are able to complete this at first reading because I believe that this is a pressing concern for our small and medium-sized enterprises.
The second point is that energy efficiency in production and consumption should be for us a focus of the debate.
A large number of jobs can be created here.
The Lisbon Agenda for new jobs and employment is very important for us all.
