rapporteur. - Madam President, as we have now been debating this guideline in the institutions for six years, I would therefore like to make a few comments.
Firstly, I would say that this should not be taken as a criticism, but this lengthy period shows how European legislators have dealt very earnestly with this complicated subject and how close consumer protection lies to our hearts in Europe.
I am confident that the legislative procedure will be finalised with today's vote, which is also my intention, despite all the differences on the subject at various points.
I want to expressly put on record that in my view all the joint amendments now available without exception improve the Council's text, the joint position.
They certainly also hark back for the most part to my own proposals.
To clarify matters, I wish to say that we have wanted to reach an agreement, and in order to come to an agreement, on Article 16(2) as well, which until recently had actually been disputed merely on account of the wording, we have decided to approve the proposal by the Socialists and Liberals in order to resolve this issue amicably, just as we have also withdrawn a few other amendments for the sake of harmony.
I also wish to thank the Commission, the Council and Members expressly (we have had intensive, even heated discussions) for the cooperative and enjoyable teamwork.
As regards the remaining proposals, I would emphasise the statement that in my view they are merely an additional improvement to the joint position and would in no way compromise consumer protection and the benefit this would have from the directive, because it is also a high priority for us.
I wish to conclude by expressing the hope that the positive expectations arising from the directive will also be met.
(Applause)
