- Madam President, I speak on behalf of the Ã–VP-Europa-Club [Austrian People's Party European Club].
We have blackballed all articles that include the right to sexual and reproductive health, because the interpretation of this text can also, of course, be used to terminate pregnancies at any point in time and we are against this.
We voted in favour of Article 127 on the headscarf ban, because young people should not be encouraged to wear political symbols and because we want to guarantee that freedom to vote and freedom of choice continue to be safeguarded for young people.
We also voted in favour of Article 116, but this does not mean that mandatory legal consequences would be derived from it.
