- Madam President, Mrs Pack's report on 'Adult Education: It is never to late to learn' is in my opinion one of the most important programmes of action in the European Union: the motivation to take part in adult education programmes, the learning of foreign languages, the motivation to complete tertiary education and with it the chance of having better job opportunities and therefore a better income, as well as the opportunity for better integration of immigrants.
It is particularly important for women, however, that the relevant framework programmes for child care are available here.
In particular we must also pay great attention to the possibility of exchanging knowledge between the generations.
For this reason the Ã–VP-Europa-Club was happy to approve this report.
