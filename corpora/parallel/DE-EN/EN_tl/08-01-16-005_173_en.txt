- Madam President, I should like to make a verbal declaration regarding the very good Angelilli report on the EU strategy on the rights of the child.
The radical treatment of the issues of child prostitution and sex tourism is particularly important.
The victims of these criminal offences can also be found in our own backyards.
In the border area between Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria, for example, prostitution involving women and increasingly children increased enormously after the opening of the borders.
However, no attention was paid to this subject at EU level for a long time.
Problems central to child prostitution, such as the networking of perpetrators through the Internet and the lack of cooperation regarding cross-border surveillance and law enforcement, can only be combated at European level.
The report deals with these areas and incorporates them into a comprehensive strategy.
Even though there is still a great deal to be done to combat child abuse, this is an encouraging sign.
