- Mr President, I should like to follow up on the question from my colleague Glenys Kinnock to Commissioner Michel.

In what direction is budget support being modified?
One extra question: I assume that arrangements are already in place in the current budget support system for support to be suspended in such a situation as that which prevailed in Kenya after the elections?
