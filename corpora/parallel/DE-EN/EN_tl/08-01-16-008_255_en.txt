- Mr President, it is not only recently that the extent of corruption in Kenya has become evident and as a result, many Member States - actually all Member States - have stopped budget support in the last few years and even switched over to project aid.
This is actually one of the points of criticism I would like to address to the Commission, since the Commission has apparently not made the Member States aware of these concerns and has carried on with the budget support.
I, too, am now in favour of continuing the support in an appropriate form, but not in a form that would give the previous structures the opportunity to administer the money via budget support.
I am also very much in favour of in future supporting the institution that has now been authorised, in other words the Kenyan Parliament.
We cannot automatically assume that all Members of Parliament behave properly and that there is no prevailing corruption.
I have no illusions about this.
Nevertheless, we should channel a large proportion of support into Kenya's political institutions, into promoting its Parliament and our colleagues' capacity for work.
Then we shall have the opportunity to enable these newly-authorised colleagues to govern Kenya more effectively in future than the current government has managed to do.
