draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgets is positive about the Commission's proposal to lead Europol out of its interstate position and into communitisation.
If Europol is therefore soon to be funded entirely from the European budget, Parliament's budgetary rights must also be protected by the structures.
The Committee responsible has kindly adopted all our respective amendments.
I also hope that the list that Commissioner Frattini has just read out is not exclusive, because I noticed that a number of amendments were not included.
We have all, however, got it straight that part of the administration would again be financed by operational resources.
We now call upon the Council to sit down at the table with us immediately and come to a mutual agreement on the financing of Europol, because one thing is certain: everything we decide tomorrow applies only under the proviso of the result of the Council negotiations in accordance with Article 47 of the interinstitutional agreement of May 2006.
