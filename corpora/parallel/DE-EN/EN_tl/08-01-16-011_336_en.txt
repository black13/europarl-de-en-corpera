- Mr President, my question is as follows: how will increased food and energy prices affect the WTO negotiations?
We do know that the biggest stumbling block so far has been subsidies and the Farm Bill in the United States and that Europe has of course suffered under increased world market prices.
Are there new opportunities here for adjusting quotas and duties accordingly?
Is the Slovenian Presidency planning an initiative for bringing the WTO negotiations to an end?
