- Mr President, even the European Parliament respects the Commission's right of initiative, as the Council has just expressed it.
However, we shall therefore always let the Commission know what we believe is particularly important.
Criteria such as unemployment or greater migration would certainly be subjects that could be introduced into the discussion here.
Because you talked about the Slovenian brown bears in the previous question, as a Styrian I would like to say thank you for this export and I hope that the open Schengen border will lead to even more immigration.
