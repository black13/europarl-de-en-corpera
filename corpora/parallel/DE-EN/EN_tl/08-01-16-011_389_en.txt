- Many thanks for this very good response.
Allow me as an exception to make a personal preliminary remark.
In 1991, when Slovenia gained independence, I was at the independence celebrations in Ljubljana - as the only EU citizen, I believe.
I was also in favour of the Association Agreement during the war in Ljubljana which, thankfully, was brief, and later as rapporteur for Parliament.
I would simply like to say that today is a historic day for me.
I am very happy.
Please forgive the personal preliminary remark.
Now an even shorter question: do you believe that the naming issue between Macedonia and Greece is a bilateral issue, and can a bilateral issue have an impact on accession negotiations?
