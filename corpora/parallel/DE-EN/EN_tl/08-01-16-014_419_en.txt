- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to reject the criticism that Commissioner Å pidla is too lazy to attend to this problem.
I do not think this is the right way to conduct discussions in the House.
It is important that we concentrate on improving educational provision for young Roma people.
We are all familiar with the system of compulsory education and I believe that language and literacy, and numeracy skills - quite simply, things that are necessary for a good life - should be made compulsory.
On the other hand, I do understand that not everyone wants to be integrated, of course.
Of course we do have to offer initiatives to all those who do not wish to integrate into our society.
I believe the concept of an open approach to these problems is the main solution for the future.
