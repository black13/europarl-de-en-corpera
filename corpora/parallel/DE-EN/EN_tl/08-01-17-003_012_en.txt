on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, I would first also like to thank the rapporteur for her help and cooperation.
We made the most of our opportunities to work together across political boundaries and I would like to express my warmest thanks for this.
I would begin by pointing out that we have already presented a large number of reports on this subject.
The demand for equal pay for equal work goes back more than 30 years and we have still not been able to make it a reality.
Of course we are taking small steps forward and we are producing paper after paper, but the situation of women in industry still remains a long way behind what we have been working towards all this time.
In the manufacturing industry, for example, 85% of the employees are women, and in the ICT sector the figure is 15%, and indeed women are very poorly represented in the high-technology industries.
This does not imply that women are less educated, it only means - and this applies especially to rural areas - that there are simply no opportunities to take up other jobs.
Women continue to work in the low-wage sector and even here there is differentiation between male and female workers.
There is still inequality and discrimination, and not just in respect of wage levels but working conditions too.
We are therefore also appealing to the trade unions to do more to prevent this type of wage discrimination when taking part in pay negotiations.
Support for professional and vocational training programmes is still lacking or is woefully inadequate.
Education and training is needed in order to provide female employees with career prospects, even in low-skill sectors.
We also call on companies to apply family and women-friendly policies in their workforce management plans, which will work to everyone's advantage: when everyone has that feel-good feeling, business runs better and this also benefits the women who work in it.
