in writing. - Until a short while ago Kenya was a holiday paradise for many people.
Visitors were well shielded from the massive corruption and terrible poverty in which a large majority of the population have to live.
Since the events of late December and the fraudulent presidential elections, Kenya and its political problems have suddenly been on everyone's lips.
While the parliamentary elections were generally regarded as successful by the official observers, doubts were raised as to the accuracy of the results of the presidential election.
In tabling today's motion for a resolution on Kenya, we are once again condemning the widespread irregularities and the conduct of the incumbent President Kibaki, who in rejecting the offer made by President John Kufuor to help resolve the crisis has seriously undermined the mediation efforts.
We call on Kenya's political leaders to do everything in their power to prevent further violence in the country and to ensure respect for human rights.
During the debate on this subject we again discussed and examined the question of the effectiveness of direct budgetary aid.
This topic, like that of Kenya, is one that will continue to occupy us in the months ahead.
