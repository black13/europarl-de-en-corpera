author. - Madam President, our Group has nominated Hu Jia and his wife, Zeng Jinyan, for the Sakharov Prize.
Because the couple are under house arrest they used a webcam link to take part in a hearing of the European Parliament on the human rights situation in China.
The renewed arrest of Hu Jia has only served to demonstrate something that he himself warned of.
Does China by its action wish to show its contempt for the opinion of the European Parliament?
Human rights must be firmly enshrined as an issue that cuts across all the relations that exist between the EU and China.
We too must act in a coherent and consistent way and should not simply sacrifice our values on the altar of good economic relations.
We are therefore calling on the Council and the Commission not just to take up a position for Hu Jia but also to use the next EU-China summit to call for a commitment to human rights.
China has to put a stop to the systematic intimidation of human rights activists.
If China does not change its conduct we will again need to raise the issue of our participation in the Olympic Games.
Moreover, Russia is set to host the next Winter Olympics and that country also has a poor record when it comes to human rights.
(Applause)
