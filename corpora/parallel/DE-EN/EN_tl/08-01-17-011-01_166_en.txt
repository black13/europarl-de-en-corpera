author. - Madam President, seven months before the start of the Olympic Games, China is demonstrating how little account it takes of human rights.
The hope that the IOC decision would help improve things in the Middle Kingdom has been an illusion.
In October and November 2007 the State Security Services abducted and maltreated the attorneys Gao Zhisheng and Li Heping.
At the end of December they imprisoned the human rights activist and cyber dissident Hu Jia on the charge that he had used the Internet to incite subversion of State power.
On 10 October Hu Jia took part in a press conference on human rights, which was held at the European Parliament in Brussels.
He was linked to us live from China by telephone.
We must thank him for this courageous act.
Last year he and his wife Zeng Jinyan were nominated by the European Parliament for the Sakharov Prize.
In his Internet blog he reports on political prisoners and on the victims of land confiscations for the forthcoming Olympics.
In a letter he thanked Chancellor Angela Merkel for having received the Dalai Lama.
This clearly was too much for official China.
In an open letter some 57 Chinese intellectuals called for the release of Hu Jia.
Our President, Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, endorsed this.
It is a slap in the face when human rights activists are arrested, especially because of their contact with the European Parliament.
We have to use all diplomatic means at our disposal to ensure that he is released from prison immediately.
China is promising the world the best Olympic Games ever seen.
The price for this should not be censorship or contempt for the rule of law.
