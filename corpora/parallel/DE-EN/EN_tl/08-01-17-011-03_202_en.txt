on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I am one of the few people here in this Chamber who was present when President Sadat gave his famous speech in the European Parliament.
This speech could be taken as a policy document for the Year of Intercultural Dialogue that has just begun.
It was one of the greatest speeches ever made here in this House.
Down through the years President Mubarak too has been an important and reliable partner for the European Union, and this is of course in spite of the many failings and mistakes that we have seen in Egypt.
I therefore simply cannot understand the speech that the President of the Egyptian Parliament made in reaction to this motion.
We are simply saying in a reasonable and restrained way that we consider Egypt to be one of the most important partners in the Mediterranean area, but we are criticising by way of a number of specific points and using categorical facts that some things still have to change as Egypt moves forward towards democracy and the rule of law.
This is our commitment towards our own citizens and towards the people of Egypt.
I certainly believe that breaking off relations, which is now being threatened, would be completely the wrong move.
We need to keep talking to one another and for this reason I support this motion for a resolution, which has been drafted in reasonable language, and call on the Egyptians not to see this as a breakdown in the dialogue but as a clear signal for a more intensive dialogue to start: that is what we are trying to achieve with Egypt by way of this motion.
