Madam President, I should like to refer once again to the role of transport as one of the main causes of climate problems and stress the need to make it the focal point of our action.
As far as reducing transport emissions is concerned, the European Union has not exactly covered itself in glory.
Now, however, we have a second chance.
For example, we have the opportunity to make the social cost of transport operations fully reckonable by charging heavy goods vehicles for infrastructure use under the Eurovignette scheme and thereby shifting a greater volume of freight from road to rail, where emission levels are far lower.
If we do not tackle the transport issue, we shall never have any prospect of achieving our climate targets.
This applies especially to the countries at the heart of Europe.
To make these Member States take action at long last to help reduce the volume of road traffic, we also need sanctions for those that cause further increases and are unwilling to reduce their traffic volumes.
