on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, our resolution deals with the human-rights situation in Iran and the dispute over the Iranian nuclear programme.
On the subject of human rights, this House has clearly expressed its views time and again over the years.
The High Representative spoke once more today of executions and torture.
In the light of recent events, I should like to mention the names of political activists belonging to the Ahwazi Arab community who have been condemned to death, and to call on the Iranian Government not to execute them.
Their names are Zamal Bawi, Faleh al-Mansouri, Said Saki and Rasoul Mazrea; the same applies to two Kurdish journalists, Abdolwahed 'Hiwa' Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour.
May this publicising of their plight in Europe afford them protection!
As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, Saeed Jalili, the chief Iranian negotiator, did not provide the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week with a clear indication of Iran's real intentions.
Questions from 24 committee members were dealt with en bloc in a cursory manner.
This is no way to dispel the deep distrust that prevails between the international community and Iran.
Solidarity on the part of the international community is the best response to such evasiveness, which is why, in our resolution, we welcome the agreement reached in Berlin on 22 January on the drafting of a new UN Security Council resolution.
This will bring Russia and China on board, which will send a strong signal to Iran.
The resolution provides for additional measures as part of a concerted approach on the part of the international community.
I believe it is right that we should seek dialogue wherever possible but that we should also spell out time and again where our interests lie, namely on the one hand in human rights but on the other also in cooperation, though only if and when Iran recovers its trust in this community of ours.
