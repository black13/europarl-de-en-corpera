on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, according to the US intelligence report, the situation has changed.
What is needed now is a moratorium on the nuclear issue.
The case must be diverted away from the UN Security Council and back to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran has a very vibrant civil society, in spite of all the repressive measures against groups such as the trade unions.
There are intolerable occurrences, such as the rejection of candidates for election to the Majlis, but I am strongly opposed to tighter sanctions.
They would be counterproductive, particularly for the democratic opposition.
We are still hearing threats of war against Iran, especially from the United States.
My group is very firmly against any threat of war and the preparation of any war plans.
Mr Solana, in the British Guardian newspaper, Robert Cooper, a member of your staff, is quoted as saying the following in connection with the recently mooted manifesto for a new NATO: 'Maybe we are going to use nuclear weapons before anyone else, but I'd be wary of saying it out loud'.
Does this statement relate to the situation in Iran, Mr Solana, and when are you going to dissociate yourself from it?
Let me repeat: negotiation with Iran, not escalation and war.
