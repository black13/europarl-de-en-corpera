Mr President, as we have just heard, even here in our European Parliament there are representatives whose priority is not to modify the behaviour of the Iranian regime but to destroy that regime.
I believe there is one thing that has to be spelled out very clearly, namely the logical imperative that those who seek the destruction of a regime and focus their policies on that goal will do nothing to modify the regime's behaviour.
Yet such modification must be our aim whenever we discuss the nuclear issue.
The diplomatic offensive would be greatly reinforced if the United States were directly involved in the talks, because it can offer something the European Union cannot provide to the same extent, namely security guarantees.
As Mr Solana pointed out, the findings of the US intelligence services do not warrant the conclusion that the Iranian programme is not a potential threat.
That is indeed a problem, and it cannot be solved by removing the pressure.
The issue cannot be taken out of the UN Security Council, because that is liable to result in the Iranian regime eventually saying, 'Thanks, that's it now - we have enough highly enriched uranium; it's time for us to renounce the Non-Proliferation Treaty and start producing our nuclear weapons'.
Should that scenario materialise, we would have no alternative but to revert to the strategy of nuclear deterrence we know from the sixties and seventies.
One thing we should exclude from this debate at all costs - and let there be no doubt about this - is the so-called military option.
Whatever is understood by the term 'the West', whether it be North America alone or whether it include Europe, exercising the so-called military option would be a political disaster which would rebound on the West for decades to come in its relations not only with the Muslim world but also with countries such as India that have helped to put this issue on the agenda of the UN Security Council.
