Mr President, it is good that we are able to conduct this debate so soon after the horrific events in the Gaza Strip.
It is also good that Parliament has this opportunity to outline its position to Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
At the same time, it is important that we take this opportunity to inform ourselves more fully.
Mr Cohn-Bendit said that it was not enough to provide food but that we had to talk too.
We now have new mechanisms like the Pegasus programme that can foster more fruitful dialogue and cooperation.
Perhaps the Commissioner can give us more information about these.
