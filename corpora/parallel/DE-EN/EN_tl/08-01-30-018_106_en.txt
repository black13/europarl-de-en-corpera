Mr President, one of the supreme anti-war novels is about the good soldier Schweik, by Jaroslav Ha≈°ek.
The position adopted by the Commission and the Council, however, outshines Schweik; it outdoes Franz Kafka too, and it even outdoes any ostrich.
We cannot pursue this head-in-the-sand policy.
We must discuss this issue among ourselves, on the floor of the European Parliament, but we must also discuss it, of course, with the members of NATO.
We must discuss it with the Czechs, the Poles and the Russians.
This is an essential process that must be conducted on a pan-European scale.
