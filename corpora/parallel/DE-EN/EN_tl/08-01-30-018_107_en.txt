Mr President, the technical function of the planned anti-missile system is to take out a potential enemy's second-strike capability - of that there is no doubt.
In other words, it is also an attack system.
This must be taken into account in the debate.
Whether the missile system is set up by the United States, by NATO together with the United States or by any other combination, it remains an arms programme.
The salient point for me is that the European Union is unable to come up with a common position on the issue.
In this matter the common foreign and security policy of the European Union is being exposed to ridicule.
Mr Cohn-Bendit can cite the Reform Treaty until the cows come home - as long as the present situation continues and no common position is adopted at all, the Union will simply make itself a laughing stock.
What we must do is to say clearly that we do not want this anti-missile system.
The fact is that a very clear majority of this European Parliament says 'No' to this system.
In the countries of Europe, including the Czech Republic, public opinion is firmly opposed to the anti-missile system, and of course the Polish Government has undoubtedly refined its previous position.
For these reasons I would welcome our adoption of a resolution in which the House clearly rejects this missile system.
