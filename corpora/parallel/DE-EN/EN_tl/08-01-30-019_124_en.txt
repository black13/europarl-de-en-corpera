on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I am afraid the facts of the matter prevent me from joining the celebrations.
Fact number one: who will benefit?
Those consumers who live in cities and love to receive advertising material in their letterboxes.
They will benefit.
So will businesses that specialise in mass mailings and postal advertising campaigns.
Those people who are blind or visually impaired, on the other hand, will not benefit.
I therefore implore you to support our amendment on this matter.
There will be no benefit to the employees of the postal services either, who will be working for low pay and will be under enormous pressure, which can only increase in the envisaged conditions.
Another group that will not benefit are people who live in the country or in remote areas and will have to rely on private postal services, for we shall see a creeping erosion of service levels down to the minimum possible and permissible.
In particular, there will be no benefit to taxpayers, who must once again finance the universal service that was previously funded internally, as it were, being effectively subsidised by revenue from mass mailings and private postal services.
For these reasons I come down against the directive.
I believe it is misguided.
Competition is good, but care must be taken to ensure that it takes place on a level playing field.
That has not been done in this case.
