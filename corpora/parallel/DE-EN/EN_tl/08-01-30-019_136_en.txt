Madam President, it is surely very obvious that Mr Ferber's position and those of Mrs Wortmann-Kool and other Members are poles apart.
I believe it is wrong to treat privatisation and liberalisation of public services as the standard response to globalisation.
I also have reason to believe that increasing numbers of people disagree with that approach.
In a referendum in Leipzig last weekend, 80% of the electorate, or rather of those who voted, rejected privatisation, thereby preventing the city council from carrying out any more privatisations for the next three years.
Let me also tell you that it is simply not the case that this directive we are discussing today incorporates real safeguards to protect people - employees - from social dumping.
We have seen how the introduction of minimum wages in the postal services in Germany has met with resistance from those very companies that have built the foundations of their business on rock-bottom wages.
I also have serious concerns about the implications of public institutions awarding contracts to such companies.
