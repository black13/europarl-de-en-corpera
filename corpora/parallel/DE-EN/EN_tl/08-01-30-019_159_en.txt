in writing. - EU-wide liberalisation of postal services will happen - not in 2009, as originally planned, but in 2011.
In economic terms, the postal sector is very important, and it also impacts on other sectors of the economy.
As in all other areas of economic activity, more competition in the realm of postal deliveries makes sense.
Nor will businesses be the only beneficiaries, for consumers will reap great benefits too.
This will not be the case, however, unless the basic conditions are right.
In other words, it must be guaranteed that letters will be delivered as efficiently as ever and at reasonable prices.
Care must be taken to ensure that the blanket provision of postal services is guaranteed in the long term - and guaranteed everywhere, including remote areas.
Particular importance attaches to good working conditions and, above all, job security for all those who work in the postal services.
It is also important that the same conditions should govern the operations of all postal-service providers.
It was firmly established from the outset that this was not to be a cut-throat liberalisation.
We must create a good and sustainable arrangement for everyone - the postal companies, their employees and, of course, their customers.
