Madam President, when we look back at the Bali conference, we cannot but conclude that it was the biggest, most expensive and most elaborate climate conference ever held and that it actually achieved only one result, namely an agreement to continue negotiating.
If truth be told, nothing more came out of it.
An honest appraisal in the aftermath of Bali compels us to analyse the conference as follows: first of all, the International Panel on Climate Change managed to convince much of global public opinion with its climate scenarios but was by no means as convincing on the conclusions to be drawn from the present situation; secondly, while Europe forges ahead on its own, there is scarcely any sign of willingness among the international community to enter into binding agreements on CO2 reductions.
This applies not only to the United States but also to Japan, Canada, Australia and many other countries.
A glance at the four remaining candidates with a realistic chance of becoming President of the United States shows fairly clearly that there is virtually no prospect of commitment to a UN process in the field of climate policy.
We - by which I mean the EU - should rethink our strategy.
What happens if the 2009 Copenhagen conference ends in failure?
There are cost-effective alternatives to an international agreement, such as technology transfer, a decent system of incentives to protect tropical rain forests, carbon capture and storage and the development of nuclear energy too.
The law of scarce resources will eventually induce even the United States and China to save energy and avoid CO2 emissions.
The new industrial revolution will come when the price of oil rises.
We do not need to force it by enacting laws.
