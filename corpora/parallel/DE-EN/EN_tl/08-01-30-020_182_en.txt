Madam President, for 'Bali' read 'Kyoto' or 'Rio 1992', and most of the speeches made here would not be out of place.
Why should that be, Mr President of the Council?
Since yours is a small country, you might be able to diagnose why we never arrive at solutions.
Is it the power of big business and business interests, is it the fact that the international system is not working, or is it a lack of public awareness?
I believe an awareness deficit is no longer the problem, certainly not among decision-makers.
It all boils down to business and politics, and I think a great number of mistakes are being made in those domains.
We cannot engage credibly in the process and find truly constructive solutions unless we start with ourselves.
In practical terms, this would simply mean reducing the CO2 emissions that result from political activity.
Here is one quite specific example that the Slovenes could examine: if we were to give up Strasbourg and hold all our meetings here in Brussels, it would send out a small signal, both on the CO2 issue and in other respects.
That would certainly be achievable for your Presidency, unlike the major projects that will have to be passed on to someone else in any case at the end of your six-month term.
