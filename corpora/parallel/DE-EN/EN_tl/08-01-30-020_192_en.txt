Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the conference in Bali was a step in the right direction, and I should like to express my warm thanks to my fellow Members and to the Commission for what I regard as a good result.
The increase in the average global temperature is already having an impact in many parts of the world.
It is therefore imperative to adhere to the aim of limiting global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Efforts to achieve that aim must be reinforced and nurtured by means of new innovations, investments in research and development and, above all, investment in education and training.
Climate change interacts with agriculture in three different ways.
On the one hand, farming is the third-biggest source of pollution after transport and industry.
Secondly, it bears the heaviest brunt of climate change, because our agricultural production takes place in the open air, which means that it is more directly exposed than any other economic activity to the effects of climate change.
Thirdly, farmers can also see climate change as an opportunity and turn it to account.
New prospects are opening up to us in the farming community as producers of renewable resources and above all - in the second and third generations - as producers of substitutes for petrochemical products, not to mention the scope for new cultivation methods.
I must re-emphasise the importance of research and development and of education, especially in the agricultural sector.
The production of renewable resources, however, is crucially dependent on the development and application of sustainability criteria.
Climate change, Commissioner, is a global problem, affecting entire societies rather than being confined to specific areas of activity.
Accordingly, this comprehensive EU-wide and indeed worldwide approach is the only way to tackle it.
The European Union should play a leading and facilitating role in these efforts.
