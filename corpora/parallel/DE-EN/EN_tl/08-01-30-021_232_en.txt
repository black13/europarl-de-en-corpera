Mr President, I wish to place on record in this forum an incident that occurred in the chamber this afternoon.
When President Pöttering was in the chair, Martin Schulz, the Socialist Group chairman, called out so loudly and clearly to me from the front row that he could be understood up here.
'Shut your trap, you idiot!' were his words.
That is truly unacceptable behaviour; it is insulting as well as calumnious.
I expect appropriate steps to be taken, particularly since the man in question aspires to the position currently held by Mr Pöttering.
That is no way to conduct the business of a parliament.
Matters were made worse by the fact that, at the same time, some Members were singled out at random because they had the courage to call for a referendum and were then threatened with absurd sanctions.
