Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is to implement and administer cross-border, supranational and interregional cooperation measures.
It is no exaggeration to say that this new network is intended to improve the quality of people's everyday lives, to make our businesses more competitive, to extend the scope of our research and education centres and, last but not least, to preserve our environment.
There is no compelling need for the EU to provide financial support for EGTC measures.
This instrument will enable regional and local authorities to form cross-border alliances with their own legal personality - a significant innovation in terms of the scope for territorial cooperation.
The EGTC offers a unique opportunity to generate synergetic effects that transcend the institutional framework and to guarantee better, coordinated investments and uniform and efficient use of resources.
On 5 July 2006, as we know, this instrument was created by virtue of a European Parliament and Council Regulation.
By 1 August 2007, all Member States were to have enacted supplementary legal and/or administrative provisions.
The fact that only five or six Member States have adopted national rules gives us cause for serious concern.
The losers will be the potential committed participants who want to foster cross-border cooperation with their good ideas and innovative projects.
To that extent, the questionnaire was warranted, and we also urgently await information on this matter from the Council.
