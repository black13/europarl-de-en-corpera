- Mr President, what can be affirmed is the fact that not only do the Council and the Commission place greater emphasis on the term 'security' in their documents, but they also appear to have become increasingly aware of citizens' basic freedoms and rights.
We in Europe, however, can do as much work as we want on the common area of freedom, security and law when third countries' legal systems are apparently impeding us in this exercise.
I believe that the Commission, and specifically the Member States too, should be increasingly monitoring the extent to which the US legal system, for example, is impacting on the households of European citizens.
The Commission and the Council will find themselves faced with a question from me and some of my colleagues, asking how it is possible that mail transfer data from the United States, which to all intents and purposes should be used only for customs purposes, is being passed on to the security authorities.
The confidentiality of mail is one of the last bastions we have so far been able to protect.
I hope that the Commission in cooperation with the Council will be able to resolve the problem of a global approach to combating terrorism and organised crime not only from the security aspect, but also from the aspect of freedom, protection of citizens and elimination of the problems of conflicting legal systems.
