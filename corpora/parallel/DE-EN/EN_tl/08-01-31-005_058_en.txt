Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday a comment was made by Martin Schulz to another Member here in the House - Hans-Peter Martin - the substance of which was very specific.
The President cannot therefore accept the substance of this statement.
I am disallowing the substance and am censuring the substance of this statement.
