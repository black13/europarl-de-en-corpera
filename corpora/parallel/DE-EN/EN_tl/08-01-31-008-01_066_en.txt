Mr Farage, firstly, you are entitled to ask for the matter to be adjourned.
Nobody is questioning this right.
We did briefly discuss the substance of the issue yesterday, however, after Mr Hannan asked for leave to speak.
I would say to you very clearly that the substance of your statement, in which you refer to dictatorial measures, is inappropriate here.
Accept the majority decision of this Parliament, accept the majority decision of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs!
Everything here proceeds properly, according to the law, and you should be good democrats and accept it.
