on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, our Group has discussed this issue very thoroughly.
We believe that the President should consult the House once again prior to the decision, particularly with regard to how the revised version is worded, since accusations of authoritarian action are completely unjustified.
Far from it!
There is no reason at all in this regard to make use of wording as the last speaker has done.
Please may we therefore proceed with the vote as you have proposed.
