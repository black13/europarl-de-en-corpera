I was rather too quick.
A formal proposal has been filed.
One Member is able to speak in favour of the proposal and one against.
We have listened to the speaker who is critical of the proposal.
Someone in favour of it can now speak.
I assume that Mr Hannan wishes to support Mr Farage.
For this reason he and he alone now has the floor.
Please proceed, Mr Hannan.
