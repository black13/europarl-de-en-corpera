Mr President, I have never so far used the word 'dictatorial' in connection with the European institutions despite all my criticism over the years.
I think and am convinced that what has become possible today owing to this unbelievably far-reaching empowerment of the President is opening the floodgates to despotism.
We cannot always assume - and certainly not in this House - that the President will always act in an even-handed and well-balanced manner.
As a result of the decision that was made here and against which I voted, of course, the President now has unbelievable arbitrary power and this Parliament will therefore be able to mutate into an arbitrary Parliament.
The citizens of Europe do not deserve this!
I believe it has quite clearly gone beyond a rift here and this will lead to major democratic problems.
