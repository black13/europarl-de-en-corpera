And many of our new Member States are regarded as transit countries, from which people can converge on Western Europe.
Tighter controls at the EU's eastern external borders are therefore long overdue to ensure that the abolition of the Schengen borders does not degenerate into a 'free ticket for criminals'.
For this reason I too have voted in favour of the Cashman report.
