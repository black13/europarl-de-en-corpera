in writing. - It is important that the link between deforestation and climate change is explicitly highlighted in the resolution adopted.
The role of the rainforests is crucial to the world's climate.
They store huge amounts of CO2.
In addition, they are the earth's largest reservoirs.
They soak up water like a sponge and thereby cool the atmosphere.
Deforestation and slashing and burning, however, jeopardise this extremely important role enormously.
Stopping deforestation and slashing and burning would therefore be an extremely radical contribution to combating global warming.
Increased demand for biofuels in Europe is diametrically opposed to the protection of the rainforests.
Thousands of hectares of rainforest have already been cleared to extract palm oil in order to meet the increased demand for bio-diesel.
Certification and identification of the sustainable production of biofuels is therefore an essential requirement for the protection of the rainforests and the world's climate.
In addition, production is also aggravating the social situation in the countries concerned owing to the massive increase in the price of staple foods.
I am therefore against the Commission's proposal as part of the climate and energy package to fix a binding target of 10% for biofuels by 2020, because this contributes nothing to climate protection and is a far cry from a sustainable policy.
