on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I will keep this very brief.
I must say, I am rather surprised why, for weeks and months, there has been such active, massive and, in part, aggressive opposition to a Treaty when the Members opposing it do not even know which Treaty we are talking about.
(Applause)
Mr Corbett has made the essential point: this is not about the Consolidated Treaty, it is about the contents of the Reform Treaty.
There are different opinions.
That is quite normal in a democracy; indeed, it is a good thing that opinions differ and that there is a lively debate.
However, everyone should also take note of others' opinions and allow a vote to take place.
We have been discussing this Treaty very earnestly for weeks and months and it is now time to send out a clear signal as to whether the majority of this House is in favour or against it.
Outbursts and attempts to prevent others from speaking, which is what we have witnessed here, could give the wrong message to the public.
Please, let the majority of this House decide this week whether it is for or against the Treaty.
That is what democracy is all about.
(Applause)
