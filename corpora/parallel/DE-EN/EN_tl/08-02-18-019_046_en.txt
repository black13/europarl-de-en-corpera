Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, too many animal sanctuaries in Europe basically serve only one purpose, and that is to dispose of stray cats and dogs.
This sounds cruel in itself, but the real cruelty is only revealed in the methods deployed for this purpose, which entail every conceivable form of barbarity, from poisoning to starvation and clubbing to death.
The worst aspect of this scenario, however, is that these cruel acts are not taking place far away in distant countries; no, as committed activists from Austria have told me, they are happening right on our doorsteps.
Cases of animal cruelty only recently came to light in the Czech Republic, for example.
What is also worrying is the Commission's brief and pithy statement that the protection of domestic animals still falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States.
It seems that the Commission very often acts when it is not supposed to, and takes far too little action when it ought to.
This situation must change, for a national competence does not mean that the EU should distance itself from an issue entirely.
I therefore appeal to all Members not to kill off the issue of animal killing stations in their own countries by remaining silent.
I also appeal to the Commission and the Council to condemn these cruel acts.
