Mr President, Russia will be holding presidential elections at the beginning of March, but there are few signs of a positive outcome being likely.
What has happened in the run-up to these elections?
The opposition has been systematically obstructed and silenced, press freedom comprehensively curtailed, and the arrangements for the elections disrupted.
Let me give you just one example: the Russian opposition politician Garry Kasparov, who is highly critical of the Kremlin, was arrested again by the police last week on completely spurious grounds.
What will happen during the election?
There will be no transparency in these elections, for Russia has put obstacles in the way of election monitoring by the OSCE.
What will happen after the election?
It is highly unlikely that the human rights situation will improve under a President Dmitry Medvedev enthroned by Putin.
The EU must take action here.
The Russian population should not be left to cope on its own.
(Applause)
