Mr President, I think this is a particularly good debate.
However, I would like to warn about the abuse of transparency.
Some populists - although they are not here in this chamber today - abuse this debate in the public arena, but in doing so, make no distinction between the private sphere and what is appropriate in the public interest.
We must not lose sight of this privacy debate.
We are aware that there is also justification for data protection.
Finding a balance here is the right response from the European Parliament for the future.
