Mr President, it is no secret that the European Union has been battling for years to get its finances under control.
We fund major companies which then relocate from one Member State to another, while small and medium-sized enterprises go away empty-handed.
Indeed, the EU often does not appear to know who it is actually funding and who is pulling its strings.
In my view, a register of lobbyists is long overdue.
The numerous irregularities also leave a bitter aftertaste, especially when they have a direct connection to the EU's institutions.
In this context, freezing the EU funding for Bulgaria until the cases of corruption have been cleared up sends out an important signal.
There is also the fact that some Member States apparently have little interest in recovering funds that have been paid out incorrectly.
If cases from the 1990s are only now being closed, then obviously things are moving far too slowly in the EU.
