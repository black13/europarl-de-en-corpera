Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak again.
I would like to thank Mr Bösch, not only for his praise of our rapporteur, but also for his fairness and help.
Mr Bösch has been dealing with the fraud report for many years.
Now we have this honour, and I think it is a great sign of strength in the Committee on Budgetary Control that we are in agreement here.
We have focused our full attention on the Member States.
The Commission should also take with it the message that we want to help to bring this lack of clarity to an end.
If we look at the figures on the recovery of funds, we see that we are dealing with a very wide range of opinions.
That is why we are having this discussion as part of the current discharge procedure.
Consequently, I really must ask the Commission to have the courage to say if it does not know certain things, so that we can help.
I think that if we tackle the issue together, then together, we will be successful.
Once again, very many thanks to Mr Bösch.
