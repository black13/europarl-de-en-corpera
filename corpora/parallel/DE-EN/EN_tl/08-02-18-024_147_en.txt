Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is undoubtedly much more than just a customs union.
We will not reduce it to a customs union in today's debate and in the decision we take tomorrow.
Nonetheless, the customs policy at the EU's external borders is an important element of the European Union's activities and a functioning internal market.
The Ã–VP Europe Club in the European Parliament welcomes the proposal for a regulation on a modernised Community Customs Code.
Why?
Because it streamlines customs procedures, because it establishes the basis for simpler, speedier common customs procedures at the external borders, because it means that the radical changes in the international trade environment - for example, in relation to information technology, electronic data, etc. - will now be taken into account, and because customs representatives will now be subject to clearly defined common criteria, which will result in greater reliability and professionalism.
This regulation strengthens cooperation between the Member States and the European Union.
It creates a stronger Community, which is also reflected in the fact that all the amendments tabled by Parliament have been taken over by the Council.
From my perspective, it means simpler, speedier common customs clearance, and that is good for business and for the European Union as a whole.
