on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is sad that we have to hold yet another debate about terrorism.
Radicalisation and terrorism do not fit with Europe.
The Europe which we are building is a Europe of tolerance, so it is always sad when we have to discuss this issue.
There is a great deal that unites us.
Terrorism is recognised as a major threat.
Recruitment must be stopped.
We must respect fundamental rights.
Dialogue is the key to tolerance.
We must be particularly aware of the Internet, particularly its significance in communication.
In our foreign policy we view anti-terrorism as being particularly important.
In Europe we need better networking of services to ensure that we can combat radicalisation and terrorism.
I would particularly like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission for his suggestions here and for his summary.
For my group, therefore, it is a great pity that the outstretched hand of our own rapporteur, Mr Mayor Oreja, was not taken and that we could not reach a compromise at the end of the process.
The EPP-ED therefore has a number of key points which we have defined for tomorrow's vote: for example, when there are motions for deletions which state that the violation of individual rights and the rule of law lead to terrorism; when there are motions for deletions which put school and religious centres under special surveillance; and when there are motions to delete references to Jihadist terror.
If we want to combat a threat, we need to know where the threat comes from.
That is why we must identify Jihadist terror as the key challenge and state this in the report.
If it is deleted, we will not be able to vote in favour of the report.
We will not support any further watering-down of the report.
I therefore hope that we can achieve a good result in tomorrow's vote.
