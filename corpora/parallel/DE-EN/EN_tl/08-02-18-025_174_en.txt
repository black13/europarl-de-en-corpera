Mr President, Commissioner, by the time the fanatics have snuffed out innocent lives and carried out bomb attacks on democratic societies, it is already too late.
For that reason, no effort must be spared, especially - as Commissioner Frattini says - when it comes to prevention.
Dialogue, as the key to tolerance, must be at the forefront of our attention.
However, we also need better police cooperation and exchange of data; indeed, all the tools which can be used both within and beyond the European Union should be reinforced.
I particularly welcome the fact that the Commissioner has drawn attention to the importance of helping victims.
It is not just about tolerance, it is also about practical measures.
Let me stress that there must be surveillance of the preachers of hate: that is a necessity.
However, the information must then be acted on.
Glorification of terrorism is never acceptable, so we need a zero-tolerance strategy towards crimes against our society.
I think it is most regrettable that on an issue which has always been a very serious topic of discussion in this House, the national polemic has once again loomed so large in relation to this report.
