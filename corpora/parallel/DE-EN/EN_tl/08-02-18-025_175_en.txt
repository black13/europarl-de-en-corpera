Mr President, I have been asked by fellow Members from the ALDE group how the PPE-DE intends to vote.
Let me say again that the PPE-DE Group supports 95% of what is in the report.
I would also like to underscore that I think it is very sad that both the ALDE representative and the PSE representative, Spanish colleagues, have attacked the PPE-DE today.
I think it is a great pity that domestic issues are preventing us from finding common ground in this Parliament.
Anyone who wants this House as a whole to achieve a major decision tomorrow should please vote for the PPE-DE amendments.
We are not changing anything of the substance of the motion, but we are removing the domestic policy aspect.
Anyone who wants to grasp the outstretched hand of the PPE-DE Group can do so tomorrow.
