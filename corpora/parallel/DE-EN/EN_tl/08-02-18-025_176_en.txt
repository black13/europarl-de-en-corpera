Mr President, I am delighted that you have given us leave to speak again, as that has been handled differently in another debate.
Nonetheless, although Mr Pirker and I may not always see eye to eye - we often argue, and do so with great enjoyment and fervour - he is quite right to say that such debates should not be abused for national purposes.
It disrupts everything and it simply leads to false compromises.
I am sure that the Spanish colleagues here in the House will give a different answer.
I simply know from my own experience that this type of thing is very often dragged into the national debate.
I am also getting rather tired of the fact that - not for the first time - we are being used as a ping pong ball between the PPE-DE and the PSE on these matters.
However, I am glad that the Liberals have been able to mediate and are still up to the challenge.
Our colleague from Northern Ireland is unfortunately no longer present.
I find that rather galling because he said something that I view as quite incredible: he said that terrorists do not have the same basic human rights as everyone else.
However, that is precisely what distinguishes us from terrorists: the fact that we regard human rights as universal.
We should never give the impression that this House could ever take a different view.
