draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the proposal for a common legal framework for the marketing of products.
We all agree - and the Commissioner also touched on this point - that product safety is a matter of credibility.
Credibility creates confidence, and credibility and confidence will create a better internal market.
With regard to this Regulation, the attention of the Committee on Legal Affairs was focused on three main points.
The first is that the design and manufacture of products must satisfy current requirements.
This is not merely a matter of dealers' responsibility; no, it is primarily about the responsibility of producers.
Dealers and consumers must be able to rely on the economic players who put products on the Community market.
Dealers' obligations should be confined to specific checks.
Our second focal point, and one that was of particular interest to me, was the role of importers, who bear particular responsibility.
Importers have no control over the design of products or the way they are manufactured but are nevertheless bound, since they are placing goods on the Community market, to guarantee that the products comply with all applicable legal provisions.
The third point was a clear definition and demystification of the CE mark, which is not a quality label but only a mark indicating that products comply with all the relevant provisions of Community law.
We thank all those involved in this process for their cooperation and welcome the reports that have been presented for our approval.
