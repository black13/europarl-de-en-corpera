Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I should like to express my thanks for this report and remind the House that the CE mark of the European Union means that a product complies with European standards of quality and reliability.
There must be no doubt whatever that in future imported products will have to match exactly the same standards that we apply to goods produced in the European Union.
Only then shall we have a level playing field.
It must also be possible, however, to continue marking products visibly with the Member States' recognised symbols, because we are aware that these inspire great confidence among hosts of consumers.
In conclusion, let me say that great importance also attaches to additional markings for regional specialities and for organic food products, since we know that these too are widely recognised and trusted both within and beyond the European market, and such goodwill must be nurtured.
