rapporteur. - Madam President, there has been so much consensus that I can only express my thanks for the discussion, and there is nothing I wish to repeat.
The one or two dissenting contributions were devoid of substance, and for that reason I shall disregard them.
Allow me nevertheless to put today's evident harmony into perspective.
I believe that what we are about to adopt are good legislative instruments.
In recent years, however, it is not so much our legislation that has posed problems as its application in the Member States.
Of course it is not always like the Mattel case that was mentioned earlier, in which millions of toys had to be taken off the market, but such delays, whenever and wherever they occur in the European Union, indicate that market surveillance is simply not working.
Take the RAPEX system, which highlights wide divergences between European countries' systems of market surveillance.
Such divergences are no longer acceptable either.
I therefore appeal to the Member States to ensure that the instruments we are adopting here, as well as the market-surveillance mechanisms that already exist for the safety of consumers, are really put into practice.
Allow me to make one final personal remark.
We have thanked very many people today.
During the drafting of my report, I had the marvellous experience of working with fantastic colleagues from the secretariat of our Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
Without them we could not have produced this report.
Allow me, therefore, to express my special thanks to Peter Traung and Luca Visaggio.
