Mr President, the report that was originally presented was a good one, because it provided for clearly defined measures to support the fight against terrorism, such as necessary steps to improve prevention, closer police cooperation, more exchanges of data and assistance for the victims of terrorism.
Today's votes, however, have completely changed the report.
Key elements of the report have been voted out.
Jihadist terrorists, for example, are suddenly no longer considered dangerous.
Other positions - unacceptable positions - have been voted into the report, with the result that I have had to vote against it, as the majority of the House has done.
It is a pity about the original draft, because it would have been good to have a better set of political and technical instruments with which to combat terrorism and improve security.
