Mr President, Prime Minister, you referred to the common agricultural policy as the only EU policy that is fully in the hands of the Community.
You will, however, be aware that, over the past 15 years, agricultural policy has undergone more radical reform than any other EU policy, and there is no way in which agricultural policy can be compared or equated with industrial policy, because they are subject to quite different conditions.
Security and scope for advance planning must continue to underlie the common agricultural policy.
I should like to remind you that the share of the EU budget devoted to agriculture will be down to 35% by 2013.
The farming community takes its responsibility to the public very seriously, a responsibility that is enshrined in the Treaties of Rome.
Research, development, sustainability, employment and protection of the environment must be our common objectives.
I am really looking forward to an exciting Swedish Presidency.
