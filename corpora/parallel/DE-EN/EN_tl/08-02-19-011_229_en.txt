Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the European economy is facing major problems.
Crises on the world financial markets, rising energy and food prices, sluggish domestic demand as a result of wage dumping and social robbery, the growth of insecure employment - those are all urgent problems that need to be tackled.
Yet there is no mention of them in this report.
We are reminded that the rise in incomes should keep pace with the medium-term growth in productivity.
Yet at the same time the report calls for the continued pursuit of neoliberal structural reforms, i.e. precisely those alleged reforms that produced the problems we are facing today in the first place.
Instead of creating jobs through public investment, even more pressure is to be put on employees and the unemployed, working hours are to be increased and protection against wrongful dismissal undermined even more.
Instead of taking action to regulate the financial markets and capital transactions, we are to stand by helplessly as the current financial crisis spreads ever further.
And instead of putting an end to the policy of liberalisation, which has contributed a good deal to the forcing up of prices on the energy markets, we are to continue stubbornly to focus on privatisation and deregulation.
Our Group will not vote for this report.
It will not endorse a report that advocates a neoliberal agenda, stamps on social rights and will produce ever more crises.
What we really need is a radically different economic policy, in which the interests of the employed and the unemployed take precedence over the profit-seeking of big companies.
