Commissioner, paradoxically the situation now appears to be that one European air safety agency is forbidding aircraft from flying while another, like the Austrian agency, believes they could so after all.
My question to you is this: will the EASA find things easier now, as a result of the wider competences we have decided on in this area, given that it seems - as you have said - that the company that produces these aircraft is creating certain difficulties at present?
If the EASA can now do what we have agreed, namely also impose fines and not immediately withdraw a licence, will it find things easier?
I think these wider competences we have decided will make things easier for the EASA in future.
