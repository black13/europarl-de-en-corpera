Commissioner, you said yourself that 60% of undertakings intend to do nothing.
Now I ask you: what does the Commission intend to do?
I come to my second question.
We have now learned from an actual case in Germany that these gentlemen - for they are mainly gentlemen - not only earn very good money but do not want to pay tax on what they earn, which is why they go to Liechtenstein and elsewhere.
What does the Commission intend to do in future to put a stop to such practices?
