Commissioner, did I understand you correctly that German-speaking minorities cannot receive support until 2013?
Surely it is the case, for example, that real minorities exist, like the Germans in the Czech Republic, the Poles in Lithuania, the Poles in the Czech Republic etc.
So if they have media or cultural projects, they cannot receive any support at all at present.
Or have I misunderstood?
