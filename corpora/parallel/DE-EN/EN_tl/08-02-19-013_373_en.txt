Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to begin by thanking the rapporteur Mr Ã–zdemir and all the shadow rapporteurs who worked on this report.
With this strategy for Central Asia and this first broad debate in the European Parliament, we are actively taking the appropriate steps to promote dialogue and to meet all the challenges that still await us and which the Commissioner addressed.
This strategy will involve small steps down a long road.
I am glad that we will have closer cooperation and that this will not be a one-way street but an exchange of views based on mutual trust.
Today's debate shows us that we have to do a balancing act when we talk about Central Asia.
The various Central Asian republics present very different features.
We have very different requirements to make.
We want to import energy but on a secure basis, and we want to export democracy and human rights.
We want to combine the two, which is not easy.
Since 1999 I have been a member of the delegation for relations with the Central Asian countries; I know those countries.
I have learned from the people there and I know they too have a face and that they do not want to lose it.
We must, therefore, proceed very carefully and sometimes pragmatically.
That brings me to Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan is currently taking big steps that we should strongly welcome.
The death penalty was abolished on 1 January.
I thank the rapporteur for his oral amendment.
Moreover, the habeas corpus principle was introduced, i.e. the principle that the court ascertains whether detention is lawful.
In May this year we will be holding the second human rights dialogue with the Commission.
I am confident it will take place.
That is another good step that continues what we have begun.
May I say here that I will support the amendments tabled by the UEN Group because I agree with them, because I regard them as a step towards dialogue and because we must seek dialogue and partnership.
