Mr President, I am pro Europe, and therefore, as a Member of the left, I support the Treaty of Lisbon.
I do not agree, however, with the increased emphasis on military aspects.
Today I would like to remind Parliament that the deepening of European integration achieved with the Treaty was hotly debated with the 'eurosceptic' and particularly the nationalistic positions.
That which has been achieved must now be defended, and I hope that the comprehensive reform of the European Union can now enter into force.
The Treaty of Lisbon retains many improvements from the former constitution.
In particular, it directs the European Union to become essentially more democratic and closer to its citizens.
The Union can also become more socially oriented.
In my opinion, the neoliberal cement of the Maastricht Treaty has finally been broken up with the embedding of Treaty conditions such as the goal of full employment, with the basic principle of a sustainable social market economy, with the horizontal social clause, according to which all legal acts will, in future, have to be checked to ensure that social objectives are taken into account, and with the new Protocol on services of general interest.
The Treaty of Lisbon offers the opportunity to extend the Economic and Monetary Union by adding a social union.
That is why the neoliberal Zeitgeist in Europe must be driven further back.
Its protagonists must not succeed in turning the EU into a free trade zone without social accountability.
The rush to reduce taxes and wage dumping, with its dire social consequences, must be brought to an end and a minimum wage must be introduced in all Member States.
