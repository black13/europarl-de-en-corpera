Mr President, again and again we are told that this Treaty of Lisbon will make Europe functional.
We are told that this Treaty will operate vigorously.
As someone who is very critical of this Treaty, I can only hope, for the sake of our children and our children's' children, that this is true, as if it is not the case, if this Treaty takes us down a blind alley, then God help us.
One thing is certain, and that is that this Treaty, which the EU establishment is now pushing through at any price, is ill-fated for the simple reason that it despises everything that it is possible to despise about democratic politics.
The national parliaments will, of course, be marginalised.
The plebiscites in France and the Netherlands were, of course, quietly turned on their heads again, as it were.
Most likely, if Ireland votes against this Treaty, ways and means will also be found to discount that vote.
I am against this Treaty, because I am pro Europe!
