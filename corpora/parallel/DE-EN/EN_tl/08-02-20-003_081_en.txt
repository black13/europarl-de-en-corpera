Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would be interested to learn, Commissioner, the degree of acceptance for the different protocols and texts of the Reform Treaty.
Are there any analyses of which points are particularly popular with the public and which points are more problematic?
Do you have any market research results to show what the public believes are the three most important goals of this Reform Treaty, so that we can see what the 500 million citizens of the European Union are interested in, that would show that this Reform Treaty is absolutely necessary?
Is any analysis or market research available on how well informed people are about this Reform Treaty, both quantitatively and qualitatively?
That would be the basis for revealing the importance of this reform step for the European Union.
What steps do you, as Commissioner, plan to take in the immediate future to make this information more readily available to people?
