Mr President, this oral amendment is intended to make the text more precise and up to date.
By tabling it I have also carried out the wish of the shadow rapporteur.
I will read it out in English:
'Welcomes as a positive step towards reform of the criminal justice system in Uzbekistan the approval by the Uzbek Parliament of the laws on the abolition of the death penalty and the authorisation of courts to issue arrest warrants.
Calls for a comprehensive overhaul of the criminal justice system that would effectively promote the implementation of these reforms.'
(The oral amendment was accepted.)
- Before the vote on Amendment 17
