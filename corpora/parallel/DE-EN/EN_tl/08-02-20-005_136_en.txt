The Austrian People's Party Europaklub in the European Parliament voted enthusiastically in favour of the Corbett/MÃ©ndez de Vigo report because the Lisbon Treaty strengthens the citizens of Europe, the Member States and the European Union.
The citizens of Europe and the parliaments that represent them are the winners.
In the light of the Kosovo debate, we see how important this Treaty is because through it we are far more likely to achieve a common foreign and security policy.
Making the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding shows us the way forward to make fundamental rights a possibility for all citizens in the European Union.
Anyone not in favour of this Treaty as a whole is against the citizens.
We must continue to stand with the people and bring this treaty closer to them.
