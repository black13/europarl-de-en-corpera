in writing. - The Lisbon Treaty will make a militaristic Europe possible.
Previous EC and EU treaties do not allow a permanent EU military budget, but the 'start-up fund' (Article 28 paragraph 3) now pays for operational EU military spending.
In addition to the individual states' military budgets, it provides for the EU to have a military budget of its own.
Article 28c paragraph 3 contains the much-criticised mutual aid and assistance obligation to be implemented via a European Defence Agency (Article 28).
Institutional collaboration between the EU and NATO is stipulated in the Treaty (Article 28a paragraph 7).
The right of the Bundestag to decide whether the German Federal Army will be deployed in other countries is significantly undermined.
The Reform Treaty allows for the formation of a military core Europe via 'permanent structured cooperation'.
This creates a primary legislation framework for increased deployment of EU battle groups (Article 28, Protocol 4).
The European Court of Justice is explicitly not competent (Article 11, 240a).
Nor is the European Parliament competent; it is merely kept up to date (Article 21).
This releases future military intervention from democratic control.
This enabling of a militaristic Europe is accompanied by repressive partitioning off of the external borders.
The new Article 62 of the Reform Treaty is designed to effect 'the gradual introduction of an integrated management system for external borders'.
Thanks to the undemocratic enforcement of the Lisbon Treaty by circumventing referendums, the codifying of neoliberal economic policies and the militaristic parts of the document, Europe is developing in completely the wrong direction.
