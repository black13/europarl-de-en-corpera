It is a success for the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance that the Commission proposal for this regulation was not simply passed through Parliament as a routine matter.
With our tenacity, we Greens have managed to ensure that this regulation guarantees protection where sensitive information is collected in the area of population and living situations.
The voluntary annex, which provided for the collection of microdata and questions on extremely sensitive topics such as sexual behaviour and literacy, has been deleted entirely.
In addition, thanks to pressure from the Greens, the European Data Protection Supervisor was called in on two occasions.
From his point of view, data protection has been taken into account sufficiently in the amended draft that is now before Parliament.
For example, the regulation contains our amendment referring to the observation of data protection provisions both in the Member States and at EU level.
Furthermore, there are now clear references to data protection provisions for data transmission and processing.
With this extra support to bolster it, the regulation now delivers what it was meant to - that is, not the collection of new data, but simply the standardisation of the collection of statistical data on the most important social and economic characteristics of regions that is already taking place at national level, in order to be able to make comparisons across Europe.
The standardisation of European data will ensure that regional funding is effectively applied to those areas that are most in need of it.
