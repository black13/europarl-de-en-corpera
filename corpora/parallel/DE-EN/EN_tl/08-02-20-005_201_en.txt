in writing. - On Monday, the European Parliament Committee on Industry, Research and Energy gave the green light to the final acceptance of the statutory foundations for the EIT.
That means that all the questions about financing and the EIT's internal organisation have been dealt with, and it is ready for launch.
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology is a central component in achieving more for our economy, more for science and more for sustainable jobs in Europe.
Therefore, it is essential that a decision on the location of the EIT be made quickly.
I call upon the EU Heads of State or Government to agree on a defined time frame for this decision at the Spring European Council.
The decision must be made by the EU summit in June, at the latest.
The Austrian Federal Chancellor, Mr Gusenbauer, must also be involved in setting the time frame, since Austria submitted a very appropriate application.
The time frame for this decision must be determined at the spring summit and form part of the summit outcome document.
Given Vienna's excellent application to host the EIT, Chancellor Gusenbauer has considerable responsibility to ensure that the decision is made quickly and a precise time frame is set.
