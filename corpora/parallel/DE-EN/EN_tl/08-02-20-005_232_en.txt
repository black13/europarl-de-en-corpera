Strategic planning for Central Asia is certainly a good idea, and is indeed necessary, especially for economic cooperation and the opening up of the markets.
It would also make sense to speed this up in order to keep abreast of developments.
However, the situation where certain standards that apply at European level become minimal in Central Asia cannot be allowed to continue.
On the other hand, applying the same yardstick there as in Europe would be to show considerable arrogance towards the people groups named in the report and their rights to self-determination.
As regards the role of women, there is sufficient need for action in other regions of the world, not least the entire Arab world, where the need is far more urgent.
However, child labour, which is widespread, especially in China, is covered by the standards I have already mentioned, which trading partners are required to observe.
Combating terrorism and the drug trade, which are linked to some extent, must be at the very top of the agenda.
These must be fought relentlessly.
