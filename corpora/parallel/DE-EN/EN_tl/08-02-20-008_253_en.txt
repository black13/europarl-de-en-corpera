Mr President, Mr Vice-President, in your introduction you pointed out that the Commission does not want to launch out blindly but sound out whether something should be done, by discussing it with the Member States.
Now, within the Commission itself - which is, after all, a collegial institution - there is not always a clear, unified position on certain issues.
In the area of transport I currently see a topic that will become more and more problematic for us in the coming years - and probably within the Commission too - and that is the concept that money should be redirected to more environmentally friendly modes of transport by way of cross-subsidies from money that is earned in a less environmentally friendly area - road tolls, parking fees, etc.
That is, in effect, a subsidy.
Has there been any discussion about this, and how does the situation look?
