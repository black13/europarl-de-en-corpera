Mr President, I would like to make three comments.
Firstly, the fact that we are in this situation shows that we as the European Union were once again not in a position to hold our own between the two poles of Russia and the United States.
My second point is this: we must now do everything we can to establish minority and cultural rights in Kosovo.
The Kosovar Government would therefore be well advised to do a great deal in far-reaching, practical ways.
I would like to thank you, President-in-Office of the Council, for making an important contribution through EULEX.
Thirdly, for historical and cultural reasons, I have a lot of sympathy for the sentiments in Serbia right now and I believe that, for this reason, we need to be patient as we allow Serbia to find its way to the European Union, and that we must support that process.
We must also make it clear, however, that violence will not be tolerated.
We should continue to pay our funds - EUR 187 million in 2007 - but on condition that things proceed peacefully, in order to pave the way for a stable region.
