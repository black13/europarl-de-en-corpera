I salute the way you are looking at the big picture here and distinguishing between medium- and long-term strategies.
You referred to a summit coming up soon.
Are you, as President-in-Office of the Council, prepared to call for an agreement by the relevant states in Africa on the readmission of illegal immigrants as a condition for positive cooperation, for more economic assistance and more assistance of other types?
