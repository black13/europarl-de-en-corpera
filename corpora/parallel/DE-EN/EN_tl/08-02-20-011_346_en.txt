President-in-Office, if there is one area in which people in Europe want the European Union to shoulder responsibility, it is the area of illegal immigration and immigration policy as a whole.
Although, in my opinion, Parliament and the Commission are very active in this area, I am not so sure about the Council.
You said that everyone knows what the Council is doing on this matter.
I know what it is doing - and that is to do all it can to prevent the creation of vitally important European competences.
That is what it has been doing for years.
I would be interested to know what makes you so optimistic that anything will change and what concrete measures you are putting in place to bring about change.
