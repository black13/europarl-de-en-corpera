I believe that this mission is a good idea in principle - as long as it is carried out professionally - because it achieves precisely what was addressed in the migration debate we heard earlier, namely creating security where immigrants come from.
Therefore, I simply cannot understand that some hypocritical Austrian right-wing populists are against this mission.
However, what I am concerned about already is that it is a constant topic of discussion whether, in particular, the French army will conduct itself in this mission with neutrality towards the parties in dispute.
I would be interested to know what information you have about this and how you will ensure that the mission remains neutral overall towards all disputing parties.
I would also like to take the opportunity to wish the soldiers there all the best.
