Mr President, indeed, why are we women having fewer children?
The multitude of reasons and proposed political solutions are contained in the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
My fellow Member Mrs Castex has already successfully incorporated almost all of it in her report.
Thank you, Mrs Castex.
How, then, can we help women to fulfil their desire to have children?
Firstly, equal pay for equal work!
That is the only way both parents will have an equal say when they decide who takes parental leave after the birth of a child.
Secondly, both parents are equally responsible for bringing up their children.
We need fathers' help.
Without the support of the father of my four children, it would be impossible for me to work here.
Thirdly, employers must facilitate parental leave for their employees, with support from the state if necessary.
A country that wants children must put children at the centre of its policymaking.
Fourthly, we need high-quality childcare and a child-friendly environment, no matter what the parents' income.
Anyone who does not agree does not deserve to hear the laughter of children.
