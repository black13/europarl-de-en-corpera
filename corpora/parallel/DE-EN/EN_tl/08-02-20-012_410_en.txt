Mr President, today, at this late hour, we are discussing a report that deals with Europe's demographic future, with the public virtually excluded.
The rapporteur deserves the highest praise for this report because in it she has dealt with our existential societal, political and social questions.
The result should make compulsory reading for all MEPs who hide behind the day-to-day pragmatics of politics and ignorance of reality.
The report reveals how and where the chill of the economy and the rat race can be combated with social warmth.
Predictions of the way things will develop are there too, to open our eyes and develop a political philosophy of an inclusive society.
That relates to the ever-changing question of what constitutes a family, which needs to be revised, and the fact that in today's well-off society, having children is connected with the fear of poverty.
In industrial firms - and this is par for the course - parental leave is denied by macho managers who have never had a social life.
In addition, it is impossible to count the number of employment relationships and workplaces that make people wonder whether children are 'affordable'.
The additional measures listed in the report are necessary in order to turn a demographic development into a 'win-win' situation.
One thing is certain: the society of tomorrow will look different.
Whether generational conflict will become a socio-political apocalypse and potentiate the possibility of conflict between rich and poor depends on the here and now, and whether politicians are prepared to think politically and work sociopolitically.
This report is more than a bad weather forecast that we can put up with today because things might improve tomorrow.
This report is a clear call to change and develop our society, and most particularly it is an opportunity to improve our personal understanding of society.
My thanks to the rapporteur once again.
