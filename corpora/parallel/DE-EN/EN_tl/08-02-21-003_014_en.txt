on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vlasák is quite right to say that we have the task of preparing the cohesion policy for the period after 2013.
We have used these two reports in order to address this as an issue.
In fact, we have drawn together everything that we think is important in this context.
I would like to remind you, however, that we should be mindful of the strategic objectives of European cohesion policy, namely narrowing disparities in living conditions between the European Union's regions and supporting the Lisbon and Göteborg strategies.
If the European Parliament wishes to play a role in shaping the future cohesion policy, it must, in my view, concentrate on key strategies rather than reverting to the 'watering-can' principle.
We must face up to the new challenges arising in the context of cohesion policy.
Let me give you just a few examples: demographic change, climate protection, regional depopulation, and also, indeed, a modern European urban policy.
From my perspective, the 'equal opportunities for people and regions' approach is essential for solutions in this area.
I believe that more investment in education, research and innovation and their infrastructures is important, and increasingly so, and is genuinely sustainable, in my view.
However, this can only work if, in future, we involve European citizens more effectively in the development of programmes and projects, as the European Parliament has demanded for a long time and does again in these reports.
I would like to appeal to the Member States - I think it is regrettable that no Council representative is here - and point out that we are giving them some homework to do.
If we are to fund additional tasks in the framework of cohesion policy, the financial resources that are needed for this purpose must also be made available.
