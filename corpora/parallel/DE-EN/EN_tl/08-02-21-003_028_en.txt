Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion is of major political significance certainly does not need to be repeatedly underlined here.
I agree with the rapporteur on all the basic issues and congratulate him on his good work.
He rightly emphasises that the anticipated new challenges can be dealt with only if cohesion policy remains a Community policy, which is anyway in accordance with the Treaty.
His report clearly rejects, therefore, all attempts to renationalise this policy.
The prerequisite, however, is a balanced cohesion budget for the EU.
Yes, adequate resources must be available in order to safeguard the harmonious development of all regions in the EU and deal with the new challenges.
A different view exists, however, regarding the choice of wording in the report on the demand for financial resources for cohesion policy post-2013.
Like many of my colleagues, I do not feel it is right that at this early stage, in 2008, the report should contain anticipatory demands for more financial resources for the future, not least in view of the fact that we are quite rightly facing criticism that we do not always draw down, on time, all the funding which is already available.
The Committee has therefore found good compromise wording which, however, only applies to the text of the resolution and not to the recitals.
So we should not include any conflicting statements in the recitals, but should remain consistent with the wording 'adequate resources for a balanced cohesion policy'.
Ultimately, this is about credibility: in the past, cohesion policy has been able to achieve sustainable successes and can do so in future too if it is adequately resourced, without our calling for more financial resources at this stage.
Commissioner, you referred in your introductory statement to adequate financial resources to deal with future challenges.
That is a good formula.
