Mr President, when does the citizen need Europe's solidarity?
When does a Member State need Europe's solidarity?
Surely, in the first instance, during a disaster.
That is why I find it incomprehensible that a decision adopted by Parliament in 2006 to adapt the Solidarity Fund - as set out in paragraph 45 of the Cohesion Report - has still not been implemented.
So I ask everyone - Parliament and the Commission - to bring pressure to bear on the Council to resolve this issue very quickly, for the next disaster will come, that I can guarantee.
