Mr President, Commissioner, I am the rapporteur for urban mobility.
In our deliberations, the issue of the relationship between the urban centres and the municipalities on the periphery plays an especially important role.
We are also aware of the fact that the new Member States have particularly serious problems here in organising their infrastructure in such a way that we can maintain more environmentally-friendly transport options and do not move towards private vehicles again.
In this context, may I voice a specific request: that within the framework of its regional policy options, the Commission helps us to seek and identify solutions to the issue of transport in the urban periphery and to social cohesion in the new Member States.
