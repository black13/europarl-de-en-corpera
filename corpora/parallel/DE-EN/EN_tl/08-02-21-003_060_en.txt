rapporteur. - Mr President, I would also like to voice my thanks for the valuable contributions and support of many of my fellow Members.
I think it has been shown that on the one hand, we must maintain solidarity as a key European asset, and that on the other hand, we must target and deploy our instruments - in this case, cohesion policy - far more efficiently towards genuinely sustainable development, and thirdly, that we must genuinely communicate with citizens from the outset.
I would particularly like to thank Commissioner HÃ¼bner.
Commissioner, you have made it clear that, together with this House, you are interested in the practical steps: the integrated approach, indicators which produce measurable outcomes, the definition of the territorial dimension, the Green Paper.
I think we will particularly need your help in ensuring that the Council is on board.
Again, I think it is regrettable that no one from the Council is present at this important debate.
The conclusions drawn in these two reports must lead to an amendment of the Lisbon Strategy and must genuinely underpin the new Community objective, the territorial dimension, in practical terms; otherwise, they will be nothing but empty words.
Let me make one final appeal to my fellow Members before the vote: let us be practical.
Let's not only review and analyse again; let's make it a condition that we demand the integrated approach for the provision of funding from the Structural Funds, and let us establish clear commitments for the reduction of greenhouse gases as well.
Climate protection must be implemented in the cities; otherwise, all our pledges at European and national level have no value at all.
