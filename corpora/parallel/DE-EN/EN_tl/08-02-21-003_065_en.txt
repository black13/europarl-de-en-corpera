in writing. - The EU's enlargement on 1 May 2004 has increased the economic and social disparities within the EU.
In January this year, a new programming period for cohesion policy began.
This will focus on new priorities and objectives: environmental protection, competitiveness, and the creation of more and better jobs.
The EU's cohesion policy is intended, through its four separate programmes, to help make Europe and its regions more competitive, for example through innovation, the development of the knowledge society, and strengthening economic competitiveness.
It is also intended to increase the attractiveness of the regions for investors and residents through sustainable regional development.
Better and above all more jobs are to be created, and the regions developed further in order to promote opportunities and reduce disparities.
With its further enlargement, EU funding now has to be divided among 27 Member States.
The money must therefore be used better, more efficiently and transparently.
As regards the financial framework, the European Council has made EUR 307.6 billion available for the period 2007-2013.
This is a great deal of money.
It is important that regions with development problems in the wealthy Member States such as Austria also have a fair share of the funds.
Mountain regions in particular require further support.
