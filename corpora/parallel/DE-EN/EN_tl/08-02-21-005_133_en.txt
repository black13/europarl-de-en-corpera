in writing. - I am in favour of the Internal Market for Goods Package, because it is essential to have a common framework for the marketing of products abroad.
In an internal market which is based on the principles of technical harmonisation of rules governing the sale of products in the European market and the mutual recognition principle, we cannot have a situation in which the marketing of products which can already be put on sale in one Member State is substantially delayed or, in a worst-case scenario, actually obstructed due to excessive bureaucracy in another.
I therefore welcome the reports by our fellow Members, Mrs Schaldemose and Mr Brie, who advocate a reduction in red tape and a common legal framework for future sectoral provisions so that in future, as much coherence as is politically and technically feasible is guaranteed.
Finally, however, I would point out that both proposals require further refinement so that key definitions and especially the scope of the legal framework are properly clarified.
If these proposals themselves lack clear terminology, achieving the desired harmonisation will be impossible.
