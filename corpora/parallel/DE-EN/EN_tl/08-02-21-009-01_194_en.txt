on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I wish to add my voice to the expressions of solidarity with the badly injured President of East Timor, but also to the expressions of solidarity with the people of East Timor who had to struggle for a very long time for independence and their rights.
The European Parliament condemns the attempted murder of President Ramos-Horta in the strongest terms.
The attacks were carried out after the President had attempted to achieve a negotiated solution with the rebels.
As the precise sequence of events is still unclear, we call for a thorough and rigorous investigation into the attempt on his life and an inquiry into the failure of the security system.
We welcome the joint investigation by the United Nations and the East Timorese police which has already been launched.
We call for a ban on all paramilitary groups and armed gangs and for more financial resources to be provided to support the security sector reforms that East Timor needs.
