author. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Belarus is and remains the problem child in our Neighbourhood Policy.
Dictator Lukashenko continues to ensure that his country systematically distances and isolates itself from its neighbours.
He tramples human rights under foot and maintains the death penalty.
This is not only a concern for us; it is also encountering massive opposition among Belarus's own population.
More and more young people are leaving Belarus.
It is a dramatic situation for that country.
The European Union's task is therefore to help Belarus to return to the path towards democracy.
From my perspective, this will not happen with Dictator Lukashenko and his presidential apparatus, but only with the opposition, civil society and the young people who could form the country's future elite.
So I appeal to the Member States to change their visa policy for these people and give them the chance to engage in exchanges with young people in the European Union, a chance of democratic education and a chance actually to experience democracy for themselves by visiting the European Union.
Visa policy must not become an insurmountable obstacle which obstructs the path to democracy.
That is extremely important.
In negotiations with Lukashenko, however, there should be no concessions on human rights.
There is consensus on this point in Parliament, across all the parliamentary groups: we want the release of all political prisoners, a moratorium on the death penalty, media freedom and respect for all the basic principles of democracy.
That is the fundamental prerequisite for negotiations.
No concessions.
The crucial factor here is what happens at the next elections.
I hope very much for the Belarusian people that they take control of their own destiny.
