Mr President, twenty years ago, I spoke at the underground universities in Czechoslovakia and Poland.
It is very gratifying for me to hear, today, how much our colleagues from the Baltic countries, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland support the opposition in Belarus.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to them.
You are doing something important for the EU - more than the people who engage in talks which merely bolster and support a corrupt regime which needs to be abolished.
I agree with Mr Buzek: Russia has a responsibility here.
This is a post-colonial and pre-colonial situation and we should no longer accept it.
