on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, according to the aid agencies, the situation in North Kivu is in some respects even worse than in Darfur.
North Kivu is not in the spotlight, however, and no one in the international community is taking notice of what is happening there.
Since the official peace agreement in 2002, Kabila's government has attempted to integrate the regional militia into a national army, so far without much success.
The civilian population is still vulnerable to the impacts of the armed conflicts.
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) highlights the difficulties facing relief workers in gaining access to the civilian population due to the continued fighting and says that malnutrition is another major threat to the population in North Kivu.
We therefore urge the Council and the Commission to provide aid immediately and to launch comprehensive medical assistance programmes for the civilian population in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo without delay.
We also urge the Council and the Commission to ensure that the recent strengthening of the UN mission leads to substantial improvements in the security of the population.
