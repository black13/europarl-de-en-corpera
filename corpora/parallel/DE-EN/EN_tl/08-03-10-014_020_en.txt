Mr President, I rise to make the following request: on Tuesday afternoon there is to be a discussion on the Lamfalussy process.
I have heard that Mr McCreevy will be unable to attend.
We must accept that.
The Commission is a collegial body, and any Commissioner can stand in for any other.
I have a high regard for Mrs Fischer Boel as a Commissioner, but would it not be possible in this case to ask Mr Almunia, who is more familiar with the material, to represent the Commission?
Mr President, I believe you have had word that Commissioner Frattini will no longer perform his function as a Commissioner with effect from 14 March.
We observe a certain disparity between the Frattini case and that of Louis Michel, who ceased to perform the duties of his office from the day on which he became an election candidate.
Perhaps, Mr President, you can ask the Commission to inform us why this distinction has been made and to explain why in one case the Commissioner in question ceased to perform his duties on the day he became a candidate, whereas in another case the Commissioner will not relinquish his duties until about a week after his nomination.
That is the request I make on behalf of my group.
