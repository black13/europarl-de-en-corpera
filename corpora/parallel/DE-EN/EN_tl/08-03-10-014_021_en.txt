I believe there are no objections to the first request, namely that Commissioner Almunia present the Commission's views in that debate.
As for the second request, we shall look into that.
Wednesday:
No amendments.
Thursday:
We have received several requests for the debates on breaches of human rights.
The PPE-DE Group has moved that the second item, on Afghanistan, be replaced by a new item entitled 'Arrests of demonstrators following the presidential elections in Russia'.
