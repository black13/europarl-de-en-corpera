Mr President, this is not an item about the Russian elections themselves but about the fact that, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian elections, demonstrations were broken up by OMON security forces and 50 people were arrested, most of whom are still in custody.
That was a brutal act of aggression, and we take the view that it demands an instant reaction from this Parliament.
