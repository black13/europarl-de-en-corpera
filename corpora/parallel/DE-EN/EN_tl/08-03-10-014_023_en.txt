Mr President, we discussed this at last Thursday's meeting of the Conference of Presidents.
I do not believe it serves any purpose to discuss this matter now in isolation.
In the not-too-distant future, in the run-up to the EU-Russia summit, we shall have the opportunity to debate the overall state of relations between the EU and Russia.
This item could be incorporated into that debate.
Accordingly, we have recommended that, instead of consigning it to Thursday afternoon, when only 25 Members are present, we should deal with it as part of the major debate that we already intend to hold.
The delegation from our Parliament is due to visit Russia in a few days' time.
We should await their return and listen to what they have to report.
(Parliament approved the request.)
