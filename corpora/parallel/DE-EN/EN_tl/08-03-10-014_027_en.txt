Mr President, I do not intend to make a statement.
I should just like to say that I fully share the views expressed by Francis Wurtz.
The decision we took in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday was based in part on the point he has just made.
May I now ask you to let us avail ourselves of the possibility of adding this item to Thursday's agenda?
