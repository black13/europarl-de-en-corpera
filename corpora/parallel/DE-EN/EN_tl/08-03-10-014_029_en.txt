Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Schulz and Mr Wurtz have said.
Our purpose was not to prevent the House from addressing another issue but to put Russia on the agenda.
I would appeal to the chairs of the two main political groups to let us return to the old arrangement whereby we could deal with up to five topics.
The restriction to three items was a mistake, and that is the source of these difficulties.
