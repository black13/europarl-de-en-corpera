Mr President, Mr Schulz requested that this topic be added to the agenda as an extra item.
If that is not possible, I regret to say we shall have to vote against it.
We would like to put the Iraqi bishop on the agenda as well as supporting Mr Schulz's request.
That, after all, is what he himself was proposing.
