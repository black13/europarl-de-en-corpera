We already have two items on the agenda.
A third item may be added.
It can be this one, but it could also be either of the two others that have been requested.
We have agreed on two items, and three more requests are on the table.
Under our Rules of Procedure, we can only put three items on our agenda, which means that we have to choose between the case in Afghanistan, the Iranian case and the Archbishop.
We are bound by that rule.
This is why I asked you whether you were in agreement with the procedure of voting first on the Afghan case.
If that request is approved by a majority, the other two will lapse.
I have to inform you properly of the procedural consequences.
