It is indeed a difficult business, because we can only have three items.
It would also be possible, however, to regard the Afghan and Iranian cases as a single issue of 'individuals facing the threat of death'.
This would leave only one case uncovered, namely that of the Archbishop, which could be addressed in another item.
That, I believe, would certainly be a reasonable approach.
