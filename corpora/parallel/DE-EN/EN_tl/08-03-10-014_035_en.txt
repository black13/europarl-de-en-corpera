Mr President, we shall make an exception and support that proposal.
Let me also say to Mr Posselt that his group's request explicitly stated 'instead of Afghanistan'.
Rather than trying to talk one's way out of a tight corner at this stage, it would be better to consider the implications of requests before tabling them, but in this case, Mr President, we can support your compromise.
