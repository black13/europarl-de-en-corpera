on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in two minutes I cannot draft the peace plan, but I can make one or two points.
It is time we reviewed our vocabulary, for it is not dialogue we need but negotiations.
This term 'dialogue' tells us nothing.
War is being waged there, and it takes negotiation to end wars.
That is the point.
And how does one negotiate?
Graham Watson is right: if the European Union pursues a strategy of its own - and not the US strategy - it must do the following: firstly, it must negotiate with those who hold power in Gaza - and that means Hamas - so that they do what they have always said they would, namely organise a ceasefire.
Then the other side will arrange for humanitarian aid to be taken to Gaza.
That is called negotiation - you give something, and we shall give something.
Secondly, we must say tell the Israelis that, if they want to negotiate with the Palestinians, there is one thing they must do, namely put an immediate stop to any settlement-building and do so visibly, otherwise they will receive no more assistance from the European Union.
That is what I call negotiation.
I am in a position of power and try to exploit it.
Otherwise the whole business is pointless.
I believe in this dialogue, and we shall pursue it.
I believe in playing politics, in simply telling my interlocutor that things cannot go on like this.
Israel's colonial policy is endangering the State of Israel.
We must say that to the Israelis.
And we must tell the Palestinians that the latest attack has endangered the Palestinians and that the attacks must stop.
Once the European Union finally makes the transition from dialogue to political negotiation, which includes exploiting positions of power, there will be a chance of progress in the region.
In short, dialogue can wait - the political cards must be played first.
(Applause)
