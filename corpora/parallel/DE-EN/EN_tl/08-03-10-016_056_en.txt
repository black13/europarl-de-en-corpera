Madam President, the presidential election took place a week ago in Russia, and the result was as disappointing as we might have expected.
Dmitry Medvedev won, and the losers were democracy and human rights.
Three days before the election, I had a meeting with representatives of human-rights organisations in Moscow.
They reported flagrant obstruction of the opposition during the electoral campaign and harassment of independent journalists and human-rights activists.
Moreover, suspicions of electoral fraud cannot be dispelled.
The EU should now send a very clear signal that it does not accept this conduct.
Relations between the EU and Russia should be placed on a more honest footing.
The same applies to relations with China, particularly as today is 10 March, the date on which, in 1959, the popular uprising in Tibet against the country's occupation by the People's Republic of China was brutally crushed.
