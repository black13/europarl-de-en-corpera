Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have often discussed here whether the Olympic Games in Beijing will improve or worsen the general human-rights situation in China.
That is a fairly contentious point.
What seems certain, as far as I can see, is that these Games will have a disastrous effect on animal welfare in China.
I read today that there were plans to kill 200 000 cats in Beijing by caging them, starving them, letting them die of thirst or simply poisoning them on the grounds that some guests might object to the presence of cats.
This is something that cannot be tolerated.
I believe people should think twice whether they really want to be spectators at these Games.
Athletes should think twice whether they ought to take part in these Games, and organisers should think twice about the wisdom of their decision to award the Games to China.
We need have no second thoughts, however, about you, Madam President, being able to express the disapproval of this House.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
