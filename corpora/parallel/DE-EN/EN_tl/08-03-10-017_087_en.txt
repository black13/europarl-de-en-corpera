on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, the business of data exchanges between the United States and the European Union has been fraught with major problems from day one.
The debate on the transfer of passenger name records and the difficulty with the PNR agreement and its legal basis have been enough to show us that there is simply no such thing as balanced negotiations on these issues.
The US side keeps stepping up its demands and asking for more material, while the European Union finds it difficult to speak with one voice and continually resist these unreasonable requests.
These matters are arousing grave concerns among the people of Europe, particularly as regards the privacy of personal data.
They fear that their data will be misused, which is why the approach adopted by the European Union, whether on the transfer of passenger records or on visa policy, has been the focus of huge public interest.
We must not give in to the attempts being made here to create divergences between Member States, for we shall only weaken one another if we do.
Nor can we allow some Member States to be singled out by the United States for different treatment in terms of special demands and requirements.
The Commission has made two requests in this matter: besides the united approach, it especially asks for backbone, backbone and more backbone.
Constant kowtowing to the United States only leads to more onerous demands.
