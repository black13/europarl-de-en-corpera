Madam President, we also discussed this issue in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and there is no one on that committee who does not sympathise with the situation in which the new Member States find themselves, particularly with regard to visa policy and bilateral dealings with the United States.
Yet there are also older Member States - Greece was mentioned in this context - which are similarly waiting for a change in US visa policy.
No one, then, is questioning their right to break ranks, but we must ask whether what is legal is necessarily legitimate.
In this case it is not legitimate, because it undermines a united approach on the part of the European Union and thereby obstructs the conclusion of an agreement that would apply to the whole territory of the European Union.
A step-by-step approach is essential.
We have just managed to deal with the new members' accession to the Schengen Area.
The next step is to consider how we can obtain a general arrangement on the visa issue.
One final word: I find the threat with the Treaty of Lisbon utterly disgraceful.
