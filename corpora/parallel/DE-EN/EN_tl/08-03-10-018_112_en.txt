Mr President, I must admit that I like this 'catch the eye' arrangement, particularly the part before the countdown starts.
We undoubtedly have much to discuss in the realm of data protection.
Some members from the Greens Group addressed the subject of data pertaining to private businesses and individuals.
Mergers like the one between Google and DoubleClick certainly do raise some questions.
Nevertheless, care should be taken not to confuse one thing with another.
However many frogs croak, the result will only ever be a croaking sound.
What I mean is that we should not forget the need to understand the underlying technical processes too.
We - and my political group is certainly no exception - often take a particularly close interest in matters relating to the Internet and, of course, data privacy and frequently respond to them in a highly emotional way.
If I am to grasp how the Internet and data capture work, however, I must first understand the underlying technology.
In this respect, I believe there is much to be said for Mr Weber's approach of ascertaining first of all the extent to which IP addresses might constitute personal data within the meaning of Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications, for in some cases the IP address in conjunction with user data certainly can be the key to the collection of personal information.
On the other hand, given the state of technological development today, when fridges, for example, can automatically retrieve recipes from the Internet, the question whether the IP address of my fridge truly constitutes personal data is obsolete.
