on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, this has been a very long-running saga, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Costa.
In the negotiations, including those with the Council, he remained steadfastly committed to the position formulated and supported by the Members of this House in committee.
One of the points at issue, as has been mentioned, was the funding of security measures - the reason why is fairly obvious.
For example, these security measures lend themselves very well to the concealment of what would be less than entirely legal funding arrangements for the various national airlines.
I presume this is precisely why there were all sorts of resistance in the Council to a set of rules that imposed greater transparency in this area, and of course it was our Group's clear and unanimous desire to have transparent, straightforward funding provisions that were designed to help preclude problems.
The second point was the arrangement whereby Parliament was to be more closely involved in the continuing development of the security provisions.
This was fiercely resisted too, although I could not comprehend why, because the European Parliament, after all, had only tried to indicate an escape route that could be used, for example, to get out of measures that had once been adopted but had subsequently begun to prove inexpedient.
I can just about support the compromise, but I would have wished for more.
