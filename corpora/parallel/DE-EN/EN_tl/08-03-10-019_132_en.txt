Madam President, Mr Vice-President, passenger security is a fundamental principle, but how is it actually protected?
As top Italian football coach Giovanni Trapattoni would probably put it, 'Belts off, bottles empty, shoes off!'
Do these measures actually secure anything other than additional jobs for poorly paid and poorly trained security staff?
Besides, long queues at airports, hassle and economic disadvantages are once more being associated with Europe, even though in many cases these annoyances are the result of exercises in diligence on the part of bumped-up local and regional sheriffs.
Surely we can do better than that!
Let us revise the implementing provisions on liquids as quickly as possible, and let us replace them with more and better technology and with better cooperation between the security services.
