on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is producing its 2009 legislative programme from its strategic priorities of prosperity, solidarity, freedom, security and a stronger Europe in the world in a totally appropriate manner with our support, hence its priorities for 2009 of sustainable growth, jobs in an age of globalisation and a resource-efficient economic area with low CO2 emissions.
These are the common denominators for legislative work in 2009 and, Commission President, I wish to assure you of the express support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
If I were now to make any additional comments of a critical nature, these would be misunderstood in translation.
I wish to encourage you above all.
What for?
Firstly, next year is the year of the new Treaty.
Secondly, it is election year, when the citizens will be talking to us.
In your introduction you say what the new Treaty is about: were the national ratification processes to be concluded, the Treaty of Lisbon could also enter into force in 2009.
Commission President, why so aloof?
Why does it not say: the Commission will be advocating this new Treaty with all its power and all its might, of which it is already as good a guardian as it is of the existing treaties?
Nail your colours to the mast, Commission President!
Lead the way!
Second point: next year citizens are being called upon and not every detail of the legislation is of interest to them, but only the overall achievement, the line taken.
Here the trimming down of bureaucracy is in fact something by which you could secure the approval of citizens.
Therefore, show a new culture of subsidiarity!
Do not comb through the acquis until the end of 2009, but send out a signal before the election next year.
Here, too, you have our support.
