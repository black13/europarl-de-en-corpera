Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that today we are holding a debate on policy strategy for the last time in this form because we are to have a new model in the Treaty of Lisbon.
A plan is therefore already in place, at least here in this House, and I am already looking forward to this new model because it means that we can include the powers of the Council in this very important debate.
Please allow me, therefore, also to make a few comments for the last time from the point of view of budgetary control and to offer a few additional suggestions in keeping with the tone set by Mr Nassauer.
We are currently holding extensive discussions with the Commission on the protection of the Community's financial interests and the Commission has announced significant efforts in this regard.
We would like to have seen whether these significant efforts - for which we are grateful and which we also need - would also find their way into the annual programme.
The work you have promised to do would also have merited this.
We need new methods of retrieving the funds paid out illegally and we also need stronger cooperation between the Commission and the Member States.
All this is an impressive programme from Mr Barroso's Commission.
Our advice would therefore have been to include this, too, in the Commission's annual programme.
It would have merited this and it would also reassure us that you think it is as important as you are now saying.
