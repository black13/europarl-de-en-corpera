Mr President, the Commission is planning the successful introduction of the health check in the agricultural sector for 2009.
As rapporteur on the own-initiative report, I am assuming that with tomorrow's vote, the Commission will have a much better idea of Parliament's position on this matter and I expect that this position will be taken into account in the legislative proposal we are expecting in May.
I welcome the fact that the Commission is making a special effort to promote the concept of quality in agricultural production, particularly with its confirmation of what is referred to as the 2009 Green Paper.
We are of the opinion that the value added through high-quality standards will become an increasingly important starting point for our farmers, even with regard to increasing competition from imports.
I have also noted that the Commission will be putting forward new proposals on the subjects of food safety, animal welfare and health, together with better supervision and better rules.
I appeal to the Commission to be reasonable.
Our farmers cannot be confronted with more regulations if, at the same time, imports from third countries are not subject to these regulations.
Mr President, the Commission intends to put forward a raft of proposals in 2009 for reducing the administrative burden that will change nothing in the level of demand for existing regulations or the political specifications.
I very much hope that this will apply to our farmers, particularly with regard to the cross-compliance rules.
I believe an important subject is missing in the annual policy strategy, and this is the issue of food supply.
The Commission has often used the term but our citizens must have a secure undertaking as to how they can organise continued supply.
