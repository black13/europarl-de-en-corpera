on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I should like to apologise at the outset that I have to leave after my speech because I have to be at a meeting with President PÃ¶ttering.
I should like to thank my colleague Mr Paasilinna most sincerely for his commitment to this matter, and also the Commissioner, who has always strongly supported this.
I actually do believe that this EIT is an important European instrument.
Mr Paasilinna has already stated this: we spend too little in Europe on research and development and we spend too little on excellence in research.
In Europe as a whole, as in most countries - at least in most of the Member States - it could, should and must be more.
The EIT is not exactly a competitive institution, but it should be driving this research, it should be creating new initiatives.
I am thinking, for example, of how important it is in the energy sector alone that we make greater efforts in research to develop new energy technologies.
Because it is so important, I would ask the Commissioner to insist that the necessary decisions are made quickly.
One decision, of course, relates to the headquarters of the administrative office.
As someone who hails from Vienna, and as an Austrian, I would naturally want the headquarters to be in Vienna.
Whatever decision is made, however, it should be made quickly so that the EIT can start work soon.
