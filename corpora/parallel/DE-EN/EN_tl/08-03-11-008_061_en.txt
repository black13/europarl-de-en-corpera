Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, please forgive me that I was not able to be here at the start of the debate.
The previous speaker has just been speaking about Galileo.
I had to lead the negotiations on the Galileo trialogue and was therefore late.
My thanks go first of all, of course, to our rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, who has carried out outstanding work together with his shadow rapporteur.
My thanks, however, also go to Commissioner Figel', who has been heavily involved in the consultations so that today we are now able to vote on a report that will also find broad acceptance amongst us in Parliament.
Three years ago we began our debate with the question: do we need a European Institute for Innovation and Technology?
I say very firmly: yes, we do need this Institute.
We have backlog demand in the transfer of technology.
We have excellent scientists and researchers in all 27 countries.
What we do not have, however, is the conversion of the excellent results from research into marketable products and services.
The Institute of Technology - the Institute of Innovation - should be making its contribution to this.
The Commission's proposal currently goes some way towards building a new Institute in isolation.
We in Parliament have said no, we do not want that!
We want to build a network structure that integrates businesses, universities and research institutes in Europe.
We have created this with our report.
I hope for broad agreement.
We are on the right path here.
It was also good that during our debates we did not discuss the location.
Otherwise, Mr Chatzimarkakis, we would not be ready today, nor would we be able to complete this project, and in five years' time we would probably still be debating whether we needed an Institute of Technology.
