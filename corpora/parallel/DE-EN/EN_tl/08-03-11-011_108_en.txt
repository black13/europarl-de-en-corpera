Ladies and gentlemen, this is a wonderful day for the European Parliament, and that is because we are welcoming one of our former fellow Members here - one who is now President of the Republic of Estonia, our former fellow Member Mr Hendrik Ilves!
We would like to bid you a warm welcome to the European Parliament!
(Loud and sustained applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, when we experience an hour such as this, it is good not only to look to the present, but also to remember what a long, broad path it has been for us to acquire a fellow Member together with other fellow Members from Estonia - and from Latvia and Lithuania, if we are just confining it to the Baltic States in the first instance - who were elected Members of parliament and whose countries, free countries that were ruled for decades by totalitarian communism, have been represented here since freedom was gained in Estonia.
This fellow Member was elected by a democratic decision of the people to be President of his country.
He is a figure from Estonia who, more than most, is bound up with Europe's future and, of course, with her present.
Initially as his country's Foreign Minister, he led the negotiations on membership of the European Union and was subsequently an observer at the European Parliament for a year from 2003 until direct elections in 2004 and finally a Member of the European Parliament until his election as President of the Republic of Estonia in September 2006.
President Hendrik Ilves took office as President of Estonia on 9 October 2006.
President Ilves, it is a great joy to be able to welcome you here to the European Parliament, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary tomorrow.
Your visit is, as it were, the start of the celebrations and I should like to ask you now to address the European Parliament.
Once again, we bid you a very warm welcome!
(Applause)
