Ladies and gentlemen, by having risen from your seats, by having applauded so enthusiastically, you have thanked the President of Estonia for his highly congenial and, for us as a Parliament, friendly, but above all forward-looking speech.
President Ilves, you have been talking about something that lies at the heart of Europe, and that is an understanding of one another and that we know how we think.
When we know how we think, we know how we can also act together in the end.
When you spoke of the exchange of young people, I remembered - and I believe, ladies and gentlemen, we can be proud of this - that when the Financial Perspective was to be agreed and they wanted to slash the funds for the exchanges of young people, the Erasmus Programme and life-long learning, we raised our voices and said: the Financial Perspective will produce results only if we increase rather than reduce the funds for young people to meet in order to create understanding and a sense of community in the European Union.
(Applause)
Let me say in conclusion - and I do so with some stirring deep down: if the President of Estonia reminds us of history, we have to say that the history of Europe, of our continent, has been good at many points in time, but many periods have also been shaped by tragedy.
What we are doing here today, here in the European Parliament, too, is a response to the experience of history.
The fact that you are conveying this to us is turning today into a great day for the European Parliament.
We can follow the path into the future only if we look back on history, learn from its consequences and then act together on the basis of mutual understanding and community spirit, as you have said, President Ilves, for the sake of a shared Europe.
Many thanks, President Ilves!
(Applause)
