Mr President, I did not understand you at first.
I voted for this report because this new regulation creates a good balance between sensible anti-terrorism measures on the one hand and passenger rights on the other hand.
I should, however, like to focus on a point that has still not been satisfactorily resolved, and that is the rules on the carrying of liquids.
We know that the controls should be used for the prevention of terrorism, but these controls are causing a lot of anger among passengers owing to the individual airports' widely differing interpretations.
Whether or not this is an effective instrument is still unresolved.
I doubt it very much, because terrorists have long been developing other strategies and finding other ways.
I expect that the following assessment will be made: either the control procedures are standardised and improved, or else these measures are stopped, with the aim of not burdening passengers with measures that are in any case not at all effective.
