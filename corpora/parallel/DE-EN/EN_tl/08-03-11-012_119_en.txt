The new institute to be set up here seems to me absolutely justified and reasonable as far as its goals are concerned and I therefore support the report and the establishment of this institute.
The European Union - and therefore we - must work very hard to be able to hold our own successfully in technological competition with the other economic areas, but - and I now come to the crucial point - I should like to ask the Commission once again to check the 32 agencies, and this again is one of them, as to their purpose and efficiency, to carry out a sort of health check for agencies and also to shut down agencies that are no longer expedient and not working efficiently in the taxpayers' interest.
I hope - and this is a request to the Commission, which is present this afternoon and has this subject on the agenda - that the Commission will today finally bring itself to have this health check carried out for agencies.
