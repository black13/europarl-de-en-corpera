(PPE-DE). - Mr President, I voted in favour of the report because I believe firstly that it is a good one and secondly that it points in the right direction.
The transport sector must acknowledge its overall responsibility, particularly with regard to environmental targets, but also with regard to reaching the Lisbon target.
I am particularly pleased that Amendment 5, which demands that the European Union finally ratify, and not merely sign, the Alpine Convention, has gone through.
It is also pleasing that Amendment 1 was rejected and the original text retained, i.e. that we should begin internalising the external costs for road traffic.
It is, however, a shame that Amendment 7 was rejected.
This would have meant that the Seventh Research Programme would have had to be better integrated and geared towards transport.
Finally, I should also like to advise my fellow Members from the United Kingdom who rail so much against the Union to read the texts, therefore, with a little more care, because a great deal therein is worded in the subjunctive.
These are discretionary clauses and whether or not such a large country as the United Kingdom introduces these measures is within that nation's discretion.
