in writing. - It may indeed be quite sensible to look for new technologies supported at Community level and financially, by which CO2 emissions from steel production can be reduced.
As a result of rising demand in emergent countries and several natural disasters that have made reduction impossible, there have been constant shortages of this raw material, reflected in record prices for coal and steel.
It is now high time we finally started looking for alternatives to coal resources, which are beginning to run out.
It is also highly debatable how former consortiums such as the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and Euratom, which were fully absorbed into the EU a long time ago, can still have their own funds, programmes, etc., particularly in the context of Member States opposed to nuclear power, for instance, still constantly having to finance their research etc.
We should finally get around to giving this some thought.
