in writing. - I am voting in favour of the new air safety regulation, which creates greater safety in air traffic.
I am strongly advocating a joint vote on the standards and regulations at European level, since only efficient, rapid adaptation of the new directives will protect the safety of air passengers as well as their rights.
I very much welcome the possible use of accompanying safety officials, the 'sky-marshals', particularly based on the current threat from international terrorism on potentially vulnerable flight paths.
Furthermore, I support the safety regulations that allow weapons to be carried only in the hold and only in exceptional cases with consent issued by the state at the time.
With regard to the contentious issue of funding, I support the compromise that every Member State should make its own decision on this, in which the costs of the security measures are to be borne by the airport facilities, airlines and the users themselves.
It has been clarified, however, that costs should apply directly to the provision of security and only the actual costs should be covered.
The Commission is also being urged to submit a report by the end of the year on the financing of costs, together with a legislative proposal, if appropriate.
