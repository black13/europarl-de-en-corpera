in writing. - In the wake of natural disasters and the like, temporary accommodation must be provided quickly and makeshift repairs made to essential infrastructure such as, for example, power supply lines, roads, bridges and so on, so that hospitals can start running again, and the Solidarity Fund can be a great help here.
What cannot be paid for, however, are the thousands of hours of unpaid work carried out by the relief units.
Nor can the suffering of those affected be compensated.
A sensible balance must be preserved in the Solidarity Fund between disbursing funds rapidly and unbureaucratically and ensuring that these are not used for purposes other than those intended.
Prevention and better intergovernmental cooperation are particularly important for preparing for future natural disasters.
Under no circumstances, therefore, should these events be used to construct an EU civil defence agency or an EU rapid reaction force for disasters, since the latter would not be in a position to provide effective protection against natural disasters, but would simply inflate costs and increase bureaucracy.
