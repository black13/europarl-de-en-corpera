in writing. - I am voting in favour of the harmonisation of transport, environmental and energy policy within the European Union, because only coordinated efforts in these three sectors can bring about a lasting improvement in each one individually.
With my vote I should like to support in particular the development of a generally applicable, transparent and sustainable model for evaluating the external costs of all modes of transport.
I am therefore voting against Amendment 1 which, in my opinion, is aimed at delaying the internalisation of internal costs for road traffic.
Acceptance of the amendment would hinder the EU's efforts to achieve a sustainable transport policy and would furthermore create conditions for unfair competition between modes of transport.
Owing to the constantly increasing volume of traffic and the resulting ecological impact, intensive Europe-wide cooperation in the field of new technologies and alternative fuels should be strongly encouraged in order to stem greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the quality of life even in congested areas.
In this regard I am also calling for the average emissions for new vehicles to be reduced to 125g CO2/km through technological improvements in the transport sector and the use of biofuels.
