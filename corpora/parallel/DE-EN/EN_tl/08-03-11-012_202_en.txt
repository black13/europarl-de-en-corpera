in writing. - In order to detract from the fact that we are marking time despite innumerable action plans, car drivers are now to be driven to their bikes by congestion charges, vehicle tolls and the like, or politely asked to walk or make greater use of public transport.
We must, however, get something straight here: this is the result of badly coordinated, local public transport that has been economised to death, the boom in shopping centres on the edges of towns whilst local shops are in decline, the falling quality of living conditions in the inner city, the rising crime rate, neighbourhoods that are home to large numbers of foreigners turning into ghettoes and, last but not least, longer journey times to work owing to urban sprawl and greater flexibility in working hours and employment relationships and the associated role of the car as a prerequisite for gainful employment.
In these terms and in view of the fact that cars in themselves cause only around 10% of particulate emissions, the EU is wanting, 'just' wanting, here, to grab more competences for itself and set up futile monitoring systems.
It should instead be taking the bull by the horns itself and fighting causes instead of symptoms, by revising its policy on subsidies, for instance, so as not to abet the exploding volume of heavy goods vehicles any further, for which the proportion of emissions produced is much greater.
Piggy-back transport systems should finally become economically advantageous and the euphoria of privatisation should not be allowed to reduce public transport to an unattractive patchwork rug.
