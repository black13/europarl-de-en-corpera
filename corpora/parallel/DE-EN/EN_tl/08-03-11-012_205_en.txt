in writing. - The Albertini report states that better internalisation of external costs can help to eliminate market disturbances and an increase in emissions.
I therefore voted against Amendment 1 because its aim is to delay the internalisation of external costs for road traffic.
This is the wrong signal, since road traffic is primarily responsible for emissions from the transport sector.
I hope that the review of the Infrastructure Charging Directive announced by the Commission will bring rapid progress in this sector.
