Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, I should also like to thank Elisabeth Jeggle for having worked so ably on the report.
The present quota system has been agreed up to 2015.
It will therefore remain in force for a further seven years and a few days, to be exact.
I think it is wrong, Commissioner, to raise the milk quota now by 2%.
I would have understood completely if the quota had been raised by 2% for the new Member States because consumption of milk products there is way below the EU average.
Commissioner, however much I may respect you, I think the Commission's proposals are wrong.
Over the last few months our dairy farmers have been obtaining a fair milk price for the first time in many years.
Our dairy farmers, who milk their cows morning and evening, 365 days a year - 366 days this year - deserve to earn a better income than has been the case in recent years.
Increasing the quota now therefore means that milk prices will be put under enormous pressure and they are already under pressure without any increase.
We talk here of a soft landing, which for me means pulling the wool over the milk producers' eyes.
There will be no soft landing; there will be a rough landing when it is realised what the Commission has in mind as regards quotas.
I believe the Hoelgaards and Rasmussens in the Commission, who would like to see a sudden fall in milk prices, must be stopped.
You should not let them get away with this.
Even without any increase we have problems and we must try to counteract this here.
The Bavarian CSU Members will be voting against the report tomorrow because they are against the increase.
This is not directed against Elisabeth Jeggle, but against the increase in quotas.
