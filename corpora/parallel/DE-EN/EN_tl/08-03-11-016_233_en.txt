Mr President, Commissioner, two weeks ago, four and a half thousand dairy farmers descended on Brussels from all corners of Europe.
They joined forces to form a European Milk Board and are now demanding fair prices.
This has already had a considerable impact in Germany.
We have producer prices that were around 40% and are now coming under some pressure again.
Dairy farmers are therefore demanding a volume-based market policy.
If this development were to grow, if it were to influence agricultural policy, can you imagine that a Commission in the year 2015 would be able politically to resist the demands of this movement to increase or again apply the dairy quota system in a flexible manner?
