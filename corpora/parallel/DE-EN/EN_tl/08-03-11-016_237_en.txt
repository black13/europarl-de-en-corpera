Mr President, milk is a highly sensitive product and I should like to thank Mrs Jeggle most sincerely for an effective compromise.
I particularly welcome the voluntary increase in milk quotas in the Member States.
I should like to point out the following, however.
Anyone who continually cites the price of food as justification for an increase in quotas or overproduction completely overlooks the fact that dairy farmers do not receive even 30% of the sale price in the shops.
I believe we ought to be discussing this.
It is also essential that milk production can continue in mountainous regions and disadvantaged areas because it is often the only form of production taking place there.
We need a special programme here.
