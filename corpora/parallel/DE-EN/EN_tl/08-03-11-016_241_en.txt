rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard a wide range of opinions.
We were also able to detect that, for everyone here today, this is a serious issue not to be trifled with, that everyone has many concerns and that we are all, of course, accountable at home - to consumers on the one hand and to milk producers on the other.
To come back to the markets once again: whether I ought to believe in the Chinese market, I do not know.
We see a great deal in this European Union and on this market today.
However, we have an internal market here and this internal market helps us to be strong, even in the face of globalisation and general liberalisation.
Let us therefore make a European internal market out of this milk quota.
We used to be able to do this.
The agricultural markets can face up to the challenges and particularly the routine fluctuations of the world market only from a strong, stable and organised internal market.
For sustainable management, the economy, ecology and social aspects must be in harmony.
All three components must be equally to the fore of any action we take.
The European agricultural model represents sustainability and consumer safety - and that still applies!
Farmers do both very well.
They look after the landscape and therefore form the basis of tourism, contribute to energy security, produce top-quality food and maintain the economic basis for rural areas by providing employment.
The social benefits are offset less and less for farmers by what are referred to as compensatory payments.
Foodstuffs must increasingly have their fair price!
Our overall political responsibility is greater than merely treading the path of liberalisation with open markets!
