Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work.
It also appears that the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development came to 82%, even with the 17 major compromises it has created.
The reforms in 2003/2004 were important stages in the CAP reform process.
An exhaustive check of the CAP, which does not involve any fundamental reform of the existing policy, however, is another important step towards securing a modern, multifunctional and competitive common European agricultural policy.
It has been scientifically documented that good agricultural practice is the basis of this, regardless of whether large or small enterprises are involved.
The first priority is still food production, the second priority animal feed production and the third priority the supply of energy.
As regards the environmental relevance of biomass energy, it can be said that Austrian agriculture, for example, has reduced CO2 output by 14% since 1990 and has therefore actually reached the Kyoto target.
I also welcome the abolition of degressivity.
The model of progressive modulation is the right path and I also support the figures here.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for her statements on milk.
I should therefore like to say on this that we need not only a soft landing and a gentle transition towards 2015, but also sustainable solutions after 2015.
For mountainous regions and disadvantaged and peripheral regions, we have to ensure that a form of agriculture involving dry-feed livestock units is able to exist beyond 2015.
I therefore eagerly await the Commission's legislative proposal on 20 May, Commissioner, and I hope that we rediscover a great deal therein that the Goepel report now delivers, so that we do not have a repeat of this long discussion...
(The President cut off the speaker)
