Mr President, I welcome the Goepel report because the time is finally ripe for abolishing or thoroughly reforming instruments such as quota control, livestock premiums, export refunds and intervention prices.
Looking at the global increase in demand for foodstuffs, a greater market economy in agricultural policy also offers more opportunities in European agriculture.
I am anxious about the wording of some of the compromises.
The talk here is of headage premiums being decoupled for now, sector-related systems of protection are being demanded and a whole series of derogations - on milk, for instance - are to be funded via the first pillar.
This all runs the risk of us hanging on to the old market regulations via the back door.
We must really limit exceptions to structurally weak regions and define them for very tightly limited production quantities.
If we are too generous here it will lead to distortions of competition that we are not able to calculate in political terms.
I therefore encourage the Commission to give the market a proper chance in the upcoming legislative proposals.
