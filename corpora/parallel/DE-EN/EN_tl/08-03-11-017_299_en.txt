rapporteur. - Mr President, with this discussion the sport of figure skating comes to mind.
When judging figure skating, we discard the highest and lowest marks and then award the score.
If I therefore remove the far right and far left views in this House, we shall then have a result with which we are all very satisfied and with which we can all live very happily.
Thank you very much for your support and cooperation.
I would emphasise this once again beyond the limits of the groups.
I am looking forward to what will be exciting cooperation on the legislative package.
