Madam President, financial stability through crisis management must now be the standard when developing regulatory convergence.
It is about drawing lessons from the financial crises and developments in the finance industry that get out of hand and are no longer compatible with an adequate macroeconomy.
This means that a sustainable basis for the Lamfalussy Process still needs to be created in 2008.
The requirements of the market operators call for a flexible regulatory procedure.
The requirement here has to be that supervisory action is provided for by parliamentary control and Parliament's rights are protected.
There is no transparent control without parliamentarianism.
Our path leads straight into a system of European supervisory authorities via the lead supervisor.
Only in a European system of supervisory authorities can a balance be found between European financial centres that takes account of all the political and economic interests.
The Commission must be a player, not just a moderator, in the intermediate stages here.
