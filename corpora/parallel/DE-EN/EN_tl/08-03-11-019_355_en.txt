Many thanks, Commissioner, for your reply.
A little while ago you spoke at length about events in Brussels.
However, events in the regions are also very important and I therefore have two short supplementary questions.
Firstly, you have just been talking about bilateral programmes.
Does this allow for German-Czech programmes only, or should three countries be included here?
Along with Austria, this could also be Slovakia or Poland, for instance.
Second supplementary question: does this also cover the Euroregions?
