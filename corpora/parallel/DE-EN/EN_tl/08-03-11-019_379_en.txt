Commissioner, I would be interested to know whether strategies are being conceived for partnership agreements with the developing countries in the field of renewable energies, because it is, of course, important for us that costs are reduced to a minimum wherever production takes place in an exemplary way, while the consumption of dangerous goods is also taxed accordingly.
Could you envisage incorporating this into such an agreement?
