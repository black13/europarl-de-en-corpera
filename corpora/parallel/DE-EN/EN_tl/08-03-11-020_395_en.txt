Mr President, Commissioner, nothing that we are hearing today and are tabling in terms of demands is new.
We repeat that it is nothing new, whether in the reports on 'Women and industry', 'Women and health' or 'Women in rural areas'.
We have not yet achieved equal pay for equal work, nor do we have more women in positions of leadership and more flexible child care.
All these problems are multiplied in rural areas.
The distance from home to work and poor transport links are a major problem here.
The shortage of local continuing and vocational training is also a problem.
As already mentioned, broadband access is a must today, but it is scarce in rural areas.
This means we need measures but primarily we need to raise awareness of what it is like for women in rural areas.
This also means, however, that we have to take greater account of the gender aspect in all EU support programmes - whether for the development of rural areas, the Social Fund and the like - and make the programmes contingent upon how they continue to be used.
Austria, incidentally, leads the way in this and will have a law in place as from 2009 - gender budgeting - in which all gender aspects are included.
I think this would be worth emulating.
