draftsman of the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Madam President, I am reporting the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which bears responsibility for energy policy.
I have no personal opinion on this, but the committee has accepted my draft opinion by 45 votes to 0, with 0 abstentions.
The Committee on Industry is aware of the positive contribution of biogas not just from manure - as the rapporteur thinks - but from all organic waste.
We have pointed out that competition in foodstuffs is becoming increasingly problematic, that there must be discussion on the fact that the feeding of biogas into the gas network must be free of discrimination and that new processes for second-generation technical biogas should be proposed.
We have discussed the role of green gene technology in connection with biogas and we are of the opinion that the young, innovative biogas sector admittedly needs start-up financing, but not a permanent subsidy.
In addition, we want uniform support instruments across the EU and this is expressly stated in our 13 points: we want a simplified planning permission procedure for biogas installations.
The Committee on Industry has not demanded that four new directives should be put forward, as my fellow Member has done in his draft report.
I share the Commissioner's opinion that we do not need any new directives, but that we should give biogas a fair role in the existing directives on renewable energies.
In this respect the Committee on Industry has formed a somewhat different opinion from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is responsible for the report.
