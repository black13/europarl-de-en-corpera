on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am able largely to endorse this report.
The rapporteur has produced some good work.
I am able to agree with what has already been said: biogas can make a substantial contribution towards achieving our goals for renewable energy sources, using fewer fossil energies and thereby also reducing CO2 emissions.
The prerequisite, of course, is that biogas potentials are used.
In Germany there are many biogas plants, in which only electricity is produced.
Only about 38% of the available energy is being used here; over 60% of energy is unused as lost heat and pumped into the environment.
This cannot be the purpose of biogas production!
I therefore believe it is right for this report to demand that biogas also be fed into the gas network.
We must follow both these directions: either use the heat lost when producing electricity or feed biogas directly into the network.
We can then achieve a high degree of efficiency with both these processes.
I am also of the opinion that even better plants can be cultivated with modern plant production.
I am definitely not of the opinion, however, that genetic engineering is required to do this.
Plant growers tell me that yields for biogas plants can be doubled on good acreage with traditional plant cultivation.
We are able to harvest the equivalent of approximately 5 000 litres of fuel oil per hectare for biogas.
With good plants, which in future will be created by plant cultivation, we shall be able to harvest up to 10 000 litres per hectare.
This is a good way for biogas to contribute towards countering climate change.
