on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Tabajdi on his balanced report.
I think he has succeeded in pointing out the significance of biogas for a sustainable energy future mix.
As an MEP representing Northern Germany, I am aware of the potential of biogas as an important and versatile form of biomass energy produced by agriculture.
Germany - and particularly Lower Saxony, where I come from - is a leader as far as biogas plants are concerned.
We should not miss the opportunity to develop strict, clear criteria for biogas technology when introducing an EU certification system for biomass fuels.
This should apply specifically to imports as well.
There should be no extra administrative burdens for our producers, however.
Only in this way can concerns about the use of cereals and foodstuffs for biogas production be effectively dispelled, because food production must continue to remain agriculture's overriding responsibility.
Only in this way can and will biogas technology make a meaningful contribution to a secure energy supply, to reducing our dependence on foreign imports, to climate protection and to rural development.
European research and development programmes will also then be able to generate greater efficiency.
