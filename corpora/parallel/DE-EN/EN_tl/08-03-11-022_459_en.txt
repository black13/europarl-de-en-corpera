Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important for us all because the details naturally form the basis for political decisions.
It is therefore also important to differentiate in future between financial and product transactions.
We all know how energy prices are influenced by the different sectors.
However, the difference between production, trade and consumption also plays a major role.
We should begin here specifically with intelligent metering, not only with the consumer, but also with the various measuring points available.
The choice of method used to get a grip on the various costs for the statistics is also important to us.
We very much want to eliminate bureaucracy as well as to achieve greater efficiency in the statistics.
The choice of method here will therefore be important in terms of future use - random sampling, fully automated analysis, just-in-time, non-decrypting, comparable across the EU, but also globally.
The proportionality is also important for the different agencies.
We need to ensure that security of supply is transparently available as a universal criterion, that there is differentiation between costs and prices and that the entire system is sustainable.
