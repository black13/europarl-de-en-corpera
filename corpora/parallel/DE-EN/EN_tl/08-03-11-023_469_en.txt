on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would like to offer the rapporteur my sincere congratulations.
We, too, currently offer advice here in the EU pesticides package on how we can protect people, animals and the environment from damage caused by harmful pesticides - and this is our aim.
Having sufficient data is the basic requirement for this aim.
I hope that this vote sends out a strong signal for the protection of the environment and health.
Confidential operational information is not involved in the collection and publishing of the data, but the right of consumers to information and transparency is safeguarded.
I am in favour of as much data as possible being made accessible on the Internet.
This would also be totally in keeping with my report on the authorisation of pesticides.
Experience from the authorisation process shows that we need reliable figures on the use of pesticides in Europe and harmonised data collection methods.
Only when good data is available can we hope to have fewer misunderstandings and false information.
In conclusion, there is something else that is not contained in the statistics report, but is nevertheless close to my heart.
At the last reading on pesticide authorisation, we also resolved upon a pesticide passport for the wholesale and retail trade.
This also requires data on the application of pesticides.
The wholesale and retail trades want this data and I hope the Member States will not stand in their way.
This is also a good endorsement for the statistics on pesticide data.
I hope the aim unites us in achieving better protection of people, animals and the environment through more reliable figures and data.
