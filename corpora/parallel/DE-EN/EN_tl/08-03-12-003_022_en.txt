Mr President, the Socialist Group is of course right to say that wealth distribution in Europe has not worked well over the past few years, and of course Robert Goebbels is right to demand a different approach to speculation and the squandering of billions of euro.
Nevertheless, I would caution against playing off social affairs against environmental affairs, as the Socialists and others in this House are once again attempting to do.
We are currently faced with the existence of a lobby, a lobby of steel barons, aluminium barons and chemical industry barons.
What do these men want?
As a rule they are men!
These men want to undermine the 'polluter pays' principle.
It is clearly unacceptable for the very industries which pollute the most now to be exempted from the pollution tax, and the auctioning of CO2 allowances is nothing other than that.
What would happen next?
What would happen is that there would be no modernisation of the steel, aluminium and chemical industries internationally.
We therefore need the following model.
First, there must be 100% auctioning.
Second, these funds must be hypothecated so that, as happened in Denmark in the early 1990s, the proceeds from a CO2 tax levied on industry are reinvested in the modernisation of the steel industry and other energy-intensive companies in Europe.
Third - and I think we shall have to work with the French Presidency on this point - we naturally need penalties for environmental dumping outside the single market, on other continents.
It is a misconception, however, that every steel plant outside Europe has poorer environmental and energy standards than steel plants located in Europe today.
That is not true, and so any such sanctions will only work if they are transparent.
Social and environmental policies operating hand-in-hand: that is the future.
