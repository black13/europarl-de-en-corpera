You have stated before this House, Mr President of the Commission, that you have moved closer to the European Parliament's way of thinking.
My specific question is this: in what respect has this move towards Parliament's stance led to any new emphasis, or to the setting of a single new priority in the economic and social policy guidelines that are to be adopted by the Council over the next couple of days?
I take a different view.
I think you are using the Council, which was not prepared to take up various ideas, as an excuse.
I think the Council is using as an excuse the messages that you, Mr Barroso, have been sending out for months, namely that no changes are needed.
I believe that this team effort has produced a policy-blocking cartel with a shared mantra: business as usual.
That is not, however, in the interest of the European people, it is not in the interest of European firms and it is not in the interest of the European Parliament, which has issued many resolutions calling for greater attention to be paid to the economic, social and environmental circumstances in the European Union.
As our own studies have shown, we are falling behind in terms of research and development.
We have remained at a level well behind that of the US.
We have been at this same level since the early 1980s, and in the meantime we have not only been left behind by Japan but we are being overtaken by the Chinese, whose R&D expenditure in the economic sector is now greater than that of companies in the European Union.
When will you waken up?
When will you adopt a positive attitude to the quality of finance and investment in the European Union, for the sake of the EU population?
It is high time!
