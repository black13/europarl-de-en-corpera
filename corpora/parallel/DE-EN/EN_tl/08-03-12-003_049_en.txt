Mr President, anyone who takes a look at the draft Council conclusions can see that the language on the internal energy market is extremely weak.
There is no agreement in the Council on the question of unbundling, and the Commission's package comes in for criticism.
I wish to put on record here that we consider it right to pursue the strategy of systematic unbundling, but the unbundling must benefit consumers.
It must result in fair prices and security of supply.
The Commission has in fact been too quick off the mark with its proposal on the complete unbundling of ownership rights.
We therefore believe that an attempt should first be made to achieve effective unbundling, but that ownership unbundling should not be taken off the agenda for the future.
I should like to raise a second point on the Council conclusions for reasons of principle.
The Council states that it looks forward to the social agenda that the Commission will present.
That agenda includes the topics of youth policy and education policy.
I always thought the Member States were responsible for such matters; in my country, Germany, it is the Länder.
I merely wish to put this on record here, because the Parliament, Commission and ECJ will undoubtedly be criticised yet again for appropriating powers.
The Council looks forward to the Commission's proposals on youth policy and education policy.
We should draw attention to this important point when these matters are discussed at home in the German Länder.
