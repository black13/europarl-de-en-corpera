Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, unemployment is falling, the European Union has gained from globalisation, we are doing better than the United States, and the EU is on the right course.
Let us pursue this course with determination, commitment and self-assurance.
Let us make the Member States take their responsibilities more seriously.
Let us make the public aware of our successes and goals.
Secondly, climate protection and a reduction in energy dependence must give a new lease of life to research, innovation, growth and employment.
Thirdly, let us be frank about the fact that the euro/dollar exchange rate is attenuating energy price rises: they are up 160% in euro, 340% in dollars.
Fourthly, the euro, enlargement, the internal market, the Lisbon Strategy and the Treaty of Lisbon, which strengthens the social market economy and enshrines fundamental social rights: these form an overall package which should help the European Union along the road to success.
Fifthly, education, training, research, innovation and reform of our social, health and pensions systems are the biggest challenges still lying ahead of us.
Sixthly, Mr President of the Commission, the Barroso EIT must feature in the conclusions of the spring summit, with a date set for deciding on its location.
Parliament has given the financial green light.
Seventhly, the Small Business Act will trigger a further initiative in this House, without any doubt.
The SME Intergroup will put forward the principles we have in mind by the end of this month.
My final point is this: Mr Schultz, the Commission President and the Commission are not our opponents.
Our opponents are the lack of power, political capacity and leadership of some governments and parliaments in the Member States.
Our opponents are egotism, nationalism and protectionism, not more Europe and not a strong Commission.
