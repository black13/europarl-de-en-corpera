Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EP's policy department has commissioned a study on the problems that climate change will pose for us.
The damages in Europe are estimated at between EUR 24 and 194 billion.
I would suggest that, in accordance with the Barcelona objective, we take 3% of this sum - in other words between EUR 1 and 6 billion - and use it to give the European Institute of Innovation and Technology a head-start in the field of climate change.
It should focus on energy efficiency, specifically in the fields of generation and consumption.
