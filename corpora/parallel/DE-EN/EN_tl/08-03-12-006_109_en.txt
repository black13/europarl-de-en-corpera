Mr President, like the Green Group, I voted against the report on national quotas for milk.
I object to the 2% increase in quotas because such measures lead to an erosion of milk prices and threaten farmers' livelihoods.
I am in favour of quantitative controls on milk production after 2015, because otherwise cattle rearing in mountainous areas and disadvantaged regions, where the rearing of dairy cattle helps to preserve the countryside, would be jeopardised.
Liberalisation would cause milk production to be concentrated in just a few regions and intensive farms.
Those who lose out will be small producers, who can no longer cover their production costs owing to such low prices.
