Mr President, I should like to give an explanation of vote on the Jeggle report.
I voted against the report because, like my Bavarian CSU colleagues, I am against raising milk quotas.
We already have a situation where milk prices are dropping sharply.
Prices for some products have fallen by over 30%.
Our dairy farmers' earnings have been inadequate for years, and now for the past six months they have obtained reasonably decent milk prices.
If the quota is raised, it means that milk prices will come under pressure and our dairy farmers will once again have to expect to be underpaid for their work.
In Bavaria we have 48 000 farms employing 90 000 people in the rearing of dairy cattle, and another 50 000 jobs in upstream and downstream sectors, making a total of 140 000 jobs.
I cannot understand why quotas should be extended in this important sector, since it is to the disadvantage of the farmers concerned.
I could have agreed to an extension in the new Member States, because the quantities available there are indeed inadequate.
