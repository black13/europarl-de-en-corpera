Mr President, I voted enthusiastically for the Goepel report.
The rapporteur's work was very comprehensive and very positive.
We could not of course include everything we would have liked, but the most important thing is that the preconditions have been created for introducing the relevant derogations in mountainous areas.
The situation there is not comparable with others and hence requires special protection, special consideration and special support.
May I also take this opportunity to refer briefly to yesterday's vote on the Albertini report?
It appears from the voting list that I voted against Amendment 5.
It was in fact my intention to vote in favour, since over the past few parliamentary terms I have been very active on this issue of the Alpine Convention and the Commission's signing of the Transport Protocol.
