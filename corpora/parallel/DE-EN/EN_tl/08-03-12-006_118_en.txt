Mr President, for the same reasons that I gave in the case of the Jeggle report, I and my CSU colleagues voted against Lutz Goepel's report.
Both Elisabeth Jeggle and Lutz Goepel have delivered excellent reports, and we could certainly agree with 98% of the points made in the Goepel report.
However, the key question is this: it says in the report that milk quotas should be increased by 2% on a voluntary basis, and I cannot agree to that.
Furthermore, I must energetically contradict those who have said that dairy products are too expensive.
I have some statistics here, stating that in 1970 a German industrial worker had to work for 22 minutes to buy 250 grams of butter; today he only needs to work four minutes.
In those days he had to work nine minutes for a litre of milk; today only three.
Food is cheap, and the danger of raising quotas is that milk prices will fall again.
