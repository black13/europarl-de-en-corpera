Mr President, the situation of women in rural areas deserves our undivided attention.
By improving their situation the full potential for development in rural areas can be tapped.
New communication technologies and hence new jobs must be created.
The relevant infrastructure is needed, in other words transport routes to open up rural areas, but good training opportunities are necessary above all else.
All of this and much more can halt the population exodus from rural areas.
Over half of the EU population lives in rural areas today; 45% of European gross value added is produced in rural areas and 53% of available jobs are located there.
Women assume greater responsibilities in rural areas than has so far been acknowledged, especially in respect of their obvious social commitment.
