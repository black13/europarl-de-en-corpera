Mr President, I had originally intended to vote against this report.
However, after Mr Tabajdi made an oral statement on paragraph 41 I finally voted in favour.
I voted against paragraph 18, where it says that biogas has led to competition over feedingstuff.
I cannot go along with that: 4 000 biogas plants in Europe certainly do not lead to a distortion of competition.
Besides, biogas enables us to turn surplus agricultural land in Europe to good effect.
Our colleague suggested that the common agricultural policy should be abolished; well, biogas is also a way of helping out developing countries.
What is more, Europe receives 80% of Africa's agricultural exports and 45% from Central and South America.
We are not the ones preventing these countries from exporting, therefore; other countries entirely are responsible for that.
