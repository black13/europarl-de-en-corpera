in writing. - Droughts and feed shortages, for instance in Australia, have led to a rise in milk prices.
Some Member States have not exhausted their original milk quotas even now, while others are reaching the limit or even struggling to remain within it.
For that reason milk quotas have in any event been raised by 0.5% in some countries.
If a further 2% rise in the quota were now to be applied simultaneously, the delicate balance between supply and demand would be severely disrupted and milk prices would fall as a result.
The main losers would be small farmers in rural areas, who have a role as guardians of cultural heritage and are dependent on milk production but have no opportunity to produce in bulk.
Farmers, not unjustifiably, feel they are being exploited, while consumers are being expected to pick up the bill for increased milk and food prices, none of which reaches the small producers.
It is high time we did something about this.
A temporary market situation must not result in these planned measures with their long-term effects.
Consequently I have voted against the Jeggle report on a further increase in milk quotas.
