in writing. - In order to prevent high-quality food in Europe from becoming scarce and very expensive, many people must now come to understand that agriculture in the EU needs to be competitive, sustainable, multifunctional and comprehensive, as well as being competitive internationally.
We still need the CAP, and it must ensure that agriculture is reliable, predictable and stable in the future.
The compromise we are voting on today represents a commendable job of work by our rapporteur, Lutz Goepel.
This compromise does not fully satisfy me, however, particularly because the proposed modulation of over EUR 10 000, even if it is apparently only 1%, cannot reasonably be expected of farmers in my country.
The fact that these resources are to be returned to the regions in which they accrue is small consolation for individual farmers.
Just imagine if we were to impose pay cuts on employees, for example in the public sector.
The proposals on a basic safety net and a crisis management system are welcome.
It must also be clear that Article 69 is not a panacea, even though it is acceptable to make more use of these facilities to finance measures to assist, for example, young farmers, afforestation and early harvests.
Even though we still have no right of codecision on agricultural policy, I would nonetheless caution the Commission against being too obstinate.
