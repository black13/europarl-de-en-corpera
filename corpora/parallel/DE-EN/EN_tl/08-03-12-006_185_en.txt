in writing. - I am in favour of measures to assist women in rural regions because this particular group is severely affected by unemployment and, as a result, by poverty and possible social exclusion.
As mentioned by Mrs Kla√ü in her report, regional policy and the development of these often disadvantaged regions and their populations are among the European Union's political priorities.
Given that women's rights to equal opportunities are being undermined even in economically prosperous regions, it is essential to provide support for women in poorer rural regions and develop their opportunities to participate in working life.
I would like to draw particular attention to the current inadequate regulations on insurance cover for assisting spouses, most of whom are women.
Here, a swift and efficient amendment of the law is required.
The lack of legal status in relation to the right to maternity and sick leave, especially for self-employed women and assisting spouses, must also be improved.
