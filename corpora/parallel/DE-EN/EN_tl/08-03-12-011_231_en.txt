Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Gomes, ladies and gentlemen, in the Committee on International Trade we of course focused primarily on aspects relating to trade and economic relations, but in some areas we went beyond that remit.
May I therefore comment on two points.
First of all, we are very pleased that we have this report, which makes it clear that the European Union has a visible role and commitment in Iraq.
We think it is absolutely vital that Iraq be integrated into the trade system and it goes without saying that the WTO is the right arena for that.
We will have to provide far more technical assistance than we have done up to now.
This technical assistance must focus on moving Iraq towards the European economic system and, to some extent, towards European business.
As for funding, we are rather sceptical about the prospect of everything being organised solely via the UN, the World Bank or the Multi-Donor Trust Fund.
We would very much like to see own capacity being built up, at least to a certain extent, and own project administration, which would then enable us to build up a store of data and expertise to assist with that effort.
We would very much like to see this aspiration being reflected in your decisions.
