in writing. - The report by Mrs Gomes on the European Union's role in Iraq unfortunately sidesteps the two main issues of relevance to the situation in Iraq.
There are currently occupying troops from the US, the United Kingdom, other Member States and many other countries stationed in Iraq.
These troops have been there since the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003.
As we now know, the reasons cited in justification of this military action were entirely spurious (such as the lies uttered by Colin Powell before the UN Security Council about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction).
All the proposed amendments, including those tabled by my Group, the GUE/NGL, that make clear reference to the many casualties of this war and the ongoing occupation and criticise the completely inappropriate military action against Iraq have been rejected.
As a result, this key aspect of the situation goes largely unmentioned in Mrs Gomes's report.
I have therefore voted against the report because as it stands, it denies the real situation in Iraq.
That being the case, it would be disastrous to demand a more comprehensive role for the European Union, as this would make it part of the military and occupying regime.
Nonetheless, a number of the statements made in the report merit our support, but anyone who fails to speak out against war and occupation makes themselves an accessory.
