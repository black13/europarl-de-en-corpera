on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, we all sit here at least once a year and discuss the issue of arms exports, while the rest of the time these exports carry on quite happily.
For years Parliament has been calling for a legally binding code of conduct and the Council has been unable to reach any agreement on the matter.
I would appreciate it if you could tell us quite frankly which of the Member States is obstructing this process.
The fact that this Code of Conduct is not legally binding is a disgrace.
While this has dragged on, the EU and its Member States have become the world's number one arms exporter.
Weapons are designed to kill!
All arms exports are wrong.
Naturally, the Member States supply arms to crisis and conflict regions as well.
The Turkish invasion of northern Iraq, for example, which violated international law, was carried out with weapons from Germany, among others.
EU countries also wage wars, notably in Iraq or Afghanistan, and supply weapons to friendly countries that are engaged in warfare.
We have to put a stop to this once and for all.
Let us stop all arms exports.
Dual-use goods that have civilian and military applications must also come under the Code of Conduct, as must re-exports.
We have tabled amendments on both these topics for tomorrow's debate, and I am very keen to see whether they will be adopted by Parliament.
As I have said, arms exports kill people every day, and they must be stopped as a matter of urgency.
