on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, the EU has deployed a EUFOR mission in Chad and one EUFOR peacekeeper has already been killed.
That was exactly what we feared would happen.
It is alleged that the French elite troops accidentally crossed the border into Sudan.
Is there any point at all to this EUFOR mission?
We say no!
These troops cannot possibly be neutral.
The majority of the EUFOR troops come from France, and France has a military agreement with Déby - who seized power in a military coup - and has aided him by supplying him with weapons and securing the airport against the rebel attack.
This rebel attack was launched shortly before the start of the EUFOR deployment.
In other words, the mission escalated the conflict and has thus been counterproductive.
Idriss Déby exploited the situation after the rebel attack to quell the democratic opposition.
The EU has become embroiled in this mess.
We urge you to pull out the EUFOR troops!
France - and therefore, indirectly, the EU - is working hand in glove with Chad's military ruler, Déby.
The democratic opposition in Chad is calling for more civil society pressure on the government, and that should really be our position here, not the further militarisation of the conflict.
