Mr President, my question relates to the compiled text, in other words, the consolidated version.
I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for elucidating the important difference between private and official texts.
I would also welcome it if, in parallel to the publication in the Official Journal, a concerted campaign could perhaps be initiated via the Member States in order to give interested citizens access to the full text.
We do not have to turn out vast quantities, but if citizens wish to see a copy of the text, they should be able to request it from the national governments.
