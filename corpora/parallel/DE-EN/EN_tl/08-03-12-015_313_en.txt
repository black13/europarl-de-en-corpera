Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in relation to the development of a common asylum procedure, one objective is to expedite the decision-making process that determines whether people are granted refugee status or not.
One thing that I have been calling for repeatedly is the compilation of a list of safe third countries in order to speed up decisions.
Could you tell us what progress you have made in your discussions on compiling such a list?
My second point is this: we have often asked for information campaigns so that people know how asylum procedures work, what legal immigration means and what the consequences are of a rejected asylum application or illegal immigration.
