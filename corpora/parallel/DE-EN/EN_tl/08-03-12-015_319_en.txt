Mr President, we are always calling for appropriate measures to be taken in respect of our response to, and especially prevention of, terrorism, which is why this particular measure was initiated.
However, is this instrument really still effective, or have the terrorists already found ways of sidestepping these controls?
What could be done to harmonise the controls?
Although we have a single set of provisions, their practical implementation varies widely from one airport to another, and this creates problems and annoyance.
