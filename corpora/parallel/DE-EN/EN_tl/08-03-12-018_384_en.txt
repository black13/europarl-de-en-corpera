on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, on his good work and his commitment.
The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund is an active contribution from Europe to combating climate change.
As shadow rapporteur in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to address two points.
Firstly, it is important to ensure that sustainability has absolute priority in the context of the projects to be supported by the Fund.
Greenhouse gas emissions must be analysed across the entire lifecycle and no funding should be provided to projects with an unsatisfactory record on CO2 emissions.
This analysis is particularly important for projects that have a biomass component.
Secondly, I am an optimist, so I assume that the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen next year will be successful and we will be able to take the next step towards a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol.
The use of renewable energies will then play an important role for the developing countries.
The Commission must take account of that factor today and adapt the Fund accordingly.
