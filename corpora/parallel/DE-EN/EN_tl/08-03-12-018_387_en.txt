Mr President, many thanks to you, Claude.
You held a great many meetings on this topic.
It is a very complex issue and I would like to thank you particularly for being so consistently transparent throughout these negotiations and for making it possible for us to look at the project from a holistic perspective.
The challenge worldwide nowadays is to think about efficiency, in energy consumption, but also in production.
However, this cannot only apply to the macro level; we must always be guided by the maxim 'think small first': look at the micro level first, and if it works there, it will work at the macro level too.
We must focus on ensuring that we apply the best available technology that exists globally.
This can be simple, clearly structured technology; it does not need to be electronics and nanotechnology.
We have to try and make this technology financially accessible, as far as possible, so that everyone can afford to use it.
On the other hand, of course, we also have to penalise those who squander our Earth's resources.
This is a major challenge for our Commissioner as well, to look at the global structures: punishing those who waste energy and rewarding those who operate using the best and most efficient technologies.
This is a core principle in climate policy as well.
Studies in the European Union show that the costs of climate change will run into billions and billions of euro.
That is why it is essential not only to do something for countries outside Europe; the Council should also be thinking about providing new funding for research and development in the field of energy efficiency, especially in the new European Institute of Technology.
