Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your contribution.
The European Parliament welcomes this Fund.
Commissioner Dimas, you have launched the right kind of initiative at the right time.
If, as Europeans, we are committed to cutting CO2 emissions, it does not matter where CO2 is emitted.
CO2 emissions must be reduced all over the world, and that is why we have to apply the new technologies everywhere.
However, I see this Fund as being not only a development instrument but also a strategic instrument.
It is not just about providing development aid.
Rather, Europeans must not only be trailblazers when it comes to the issue of climate change; we must also encourage others to join us on our journey.
They must be able to follow the route we have taken.
That is where I think this Fund can make a crucial contribution.
If we set overly ambitious targets and end up isolated and alone, this will spell the end for our industrial base as well.
That is why there is a need for global governance here.
Bali was a good approach and Copenhagen will be another.
However, in a global governance system, it is not only about power play; we must creative incentive systems and I believe that this Fund creates the right kind of incentive.
Claude Turmes referred at the start of his speech to Martin Luther King's dream.
As Europeans, we can only make our dream of saving the climate a reality if we pursue this path consistently.
Claude Turmes, you will secure a very substantial majority in favour of this report tomorrow and I would like to congratulate you here and now on that achievement.
I am very pleased for you.
