on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, this own-initiative report is important because the situation of women in prison needs to be put under the spotlight at last and problems identified.
Women's rights apply even, and especially, in prison.
Fortunately, in the European Union, we do not yet have a situation like the US, where prisons and locking people away have become a lucrative business, but the number of women in prison in Europe is growing and so we need to take account of their specific situation.
First, there is the issue of health care, which we have just been talking about.
Women in prison have experience of violence, sometimes of a sexual nature, either in prison or beforehand, and need adequate psychological support and therapy, often because they are addicts as well.
There is also a risk that women will be sexually exploited in prison.
The situation of mothers merits our particular concern.
We cannot have any repetition of the situation in Germany, for example, where babies only a few months old have been taken away from their mothers because there are no mother and child places available in prison, leading to months of separation.
We also need more money for the reintegration of women after they are released.
One issue of particular concern to me is highlighting the specific situation of girls and women with a migration background.
It is essential that we consider the situation of women who have entered Europe and are being held in detention centres.
Many of these women refugees, asylum-seekers or irregular migrants are being held in prison-like conditions in these detention centres, and there is currently no EU legislation stipulating the maximum length of time they may be detained there.
Finally - and the European Parliament has produced a study on this - we call as a matter of urgency for improvements in the protection of particularly at-risk groups, especially women who have been the victims of sexual violence.
