Mr President, I would like to come back to a remark the Commissioner made in his introductory statement, namely that we should not just give development aid but could and should also link it to general concerns - not in the sense of the kind of power politics and strings-attached policies once pursued by the USA and the former Soviet Union and pursued by Russia and China today, but in the sense of aiming at good governance, human rights and fighting corruption.
Those are concerns that we should all emblazon on our banners - and I am not referring only to the new Member States and their development aid policy but to all of us.
Perhaps we could take this as a practical opportunity to place even more emphasis on those concerns.
