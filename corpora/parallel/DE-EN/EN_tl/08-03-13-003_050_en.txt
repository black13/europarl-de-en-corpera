Mr President, I too want to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report and also congratulate the Commission on its communication.
The challenge now is to be consistent.
Ten days ago I went to New York, together with several colleagues from national parliaments, to visit the Commission on the Status of Women, at the invitation of the European Parliamentary Forum.
It is interesting to find that countries that are our ACP partners say one thing when they are talking to Brussels and the various capitals and then say something quite different in New York, when it comes to discussing the matter at global level.
That is why I call on the Commissioner to be consistent, to advise his delegations that there is also talk in the respective capitals about the attitude taken in New York, because our goals in regard to women's policy and development policy are often contradicted in New York.
In that connection, I am very glad that UNIFEM is now opening an office in Brussels; that will certainly raise the level of the debate between the United Nations and the European Union in this area.
I am particularly glad that micro-credits are being named as one means of empowerment, of liberating women.
There are some relatively obscure arrangements...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
