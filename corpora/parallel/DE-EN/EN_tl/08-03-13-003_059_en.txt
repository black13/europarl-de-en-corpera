Mr President, I congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur.
I am sorry this debate has focused so strongly on sexual and reproductive rights, because there are many other important issues in this context.
It seems to me that the UN and a number of conservatives are acting as though sexual and reproductive rights relate only to abortion.
In that case I would advise them to check the facts and look at them closely: to be against contraception, against information, against giving women access to these services will only further increase the number of abortions.
I find it more than cynical that those same people stand up and pretend they have a monopoly on ethics and morals.
In view of the statistics we hear from the United Nations and the World Population Monitoring Report every year, it is unethical and immoral to come out against sexual and reproductive rights here.
(Applause)
