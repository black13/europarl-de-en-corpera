rapporteur. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am most grateful to all the speakers for their interesting contributions.
My special thanks go to Mrs Cre≈£u who drafted the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
Her clear analysis and proposals for greater coherence have enriched the report in many important areas.
For reasons of time I cannot, unfortunately, discuss all her contributions and I hope she will not take that as a sign of disrespect.
Many thanks to Mrs van Lancker, Mr Berman, Mr Lambsdorff, Mr Hutchinson, Mrs Scheele, Mrs Doyle, Mrs Weber, Mr Varvitsiotis, Mrs Hassi and Mrs Gomes.
They are quite right to say that reproductive health in the developing countries has absolute priority and it is important to fight for it boldly and consistently.
I vehemently disagree with Mrs Krupa's view that the sexual freedom of women provokes violence.
That is an appalling and discriminatory kind of logic!
(Applause)
I say to Mr Deva that I did not expect anything different from him.
Please forgive me for that remark.
My dear Luisa Morgantini and Mr Romeva i Rueda have, as ever, found strong words to make it clear that women do not want handouts but simply what is due to them as half of humankind.
Many thanks to all those who support my report.
I am also glad that NGOs in the field of development and women's rights have given a most positive assessment of the report.
I am very grateful for all the cooperation and support I have received.
(Applause)
