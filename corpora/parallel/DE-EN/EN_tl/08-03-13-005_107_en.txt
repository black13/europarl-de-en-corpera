Mr President, I was a sharp and clear critic and opponent of the Iraq war and I still am.
I believe, however, that we must also make up for the mistakes we committed there.
We in the western world - both Europe and the USA - therefore have a duty to do our utmost to secure peace and stability, which will be difficult enough.
That is why the Gomes report is an outstanding one.
We really should use the opportunity to support Mrs Záborská's initiative for the release of the kidnapped archbishop.
I am sorry that as a result of a management mistake on the part of this House the resolution on the subject is not on this afternoon's agenda.
It is our duty to do our utmost to help this representative of a minority whose existence is under threat, which has lived together in peace with its Muslim neighbours for centuries, and which is threatened with genocide precisely at a time when we are responsible in Iraq.
That is not acceptable and that is why we must take strong action here.
