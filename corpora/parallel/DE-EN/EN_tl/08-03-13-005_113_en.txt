Mr President, like the majority of my Group I voted against this report, not because of the subject-matter but because this important issue keeps being exploited for ideological battles about the concepts of sexual and reproductive health and rights.
I want to appeal to all the Groups in this House to put an end to this ideological dispute, which is detrimental to the matter in hand.
We must make it clear that reproductive health is important, but that it has nothing to do with abortion, because that does not come within the European Union's remit and each state has the right to decide its own laws in that area.
That is in line with the principle of subsidiarity, which is why the European citizens' money may not be used for purposes that some EU Member States do not find acceptable on ethical, moral and legal grounds.
We should, therefore, very definitely leave this subject out of our deliberations and concentrate on neutral concepts that actually have something to do with the question of health and nothing to do with the question of abortion, on which opinions differ in this House and where I am strongly in favour of protecting the unborn child.
