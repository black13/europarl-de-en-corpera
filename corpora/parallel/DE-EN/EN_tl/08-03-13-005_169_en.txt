in writing. - I vote for gender equality and the empowerment of women in development cooperation.
The way women in developing countries are disadvantaged by religious rules, cultural practices and poverty is usually further worsened by the lack of education.
In that regard I want in particular to draw attention to the potentially enormous social pressure that could come from raising public awareness of women's basic rights, which could in the final analysis improve the situation of women in the regions concerned.
I further support the idea of regarding 'violence against women' not purely in terms of female victims but of also developing practical programmes addressing the 'male abusers' aspect, as proposed in Mrs Uca's report.
I too am highly critical of the Commission's failure to include a strategy against culture- or religion-based violence against women in its list of measures.
Poor access to education leads to disadvantages in other areas of life for the simple reason of lack of information.
To be poorly informed in this respect can have lethal consequences in developing countries in which health provision and standards of hygiene are often appalling.
I need only refer to the alarmingly high percentage of HIV-infected women - south of the Sahara the figure is 57%.
One extremely positive point is the call for 'gender-sensitive performance indicators' to be developed, which would also make the controversial subject of quotas less acrimonious.
