in writing. - This report on equality and participation, on the role of women in development cooperation, covers a great number of different aspects and also includes important practical demands.
As a whole, therefore, it should definitely be supported.
One theme that runs through the entire report is sexual and reproductive health and violence against women, together with promoting women's right to self-determination.
It is important to expand the micro-financing networks, because micro-credits can help improve women's economic situation.
I cannot understand why people are trying to table various draft amendments that weaken the report and are simply dismissing UN documents that are on hand.
