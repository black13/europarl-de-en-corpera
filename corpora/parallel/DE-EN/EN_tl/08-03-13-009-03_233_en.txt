Mr President, my Group is quite definitely in favour of protecting Mr Kazemi and, naturally, against his being deported to Iran.
Yet we are against this resolution because it does not concern, as intended, an urgent case, but asylum law in the European Union in general and the relationship between two EU Member States, the Netherlands and the UK, in regard to that difficult question.
This is not what these urgent resolutions are about.
Here they are being used as a means of raising domestic policy issues.
We want Mr Kazemi to be given protection and we will support every initiative to that end, but not this resolution, whose title bears Mr Kazemi's name but whose content is about something entirely different.
