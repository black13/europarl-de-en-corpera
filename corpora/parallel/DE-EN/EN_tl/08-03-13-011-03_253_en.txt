Mr President, the information is so contradictory in this case.
What the Commissioner said was also different from what it says in the motion for a resolution.
He said the UK would not hand him over.
That is why I propose to my Group that we should not vote against, as we originally intended, but should abstain and that in future we should look at cases of this kind in more detail in this House.
They really are not a matter for urgent debate.
