Mr President, China has been violating human rights on a massive scale in Tibet for years.
Whenever a communist dictatorship runs out of ideas, it sends in the tanks and troops.
I learned this harsh lesson myself 40 years ago in Prague, and now we are seeing the same thing happen in Lhasa.
The struggle for freedom and democracy in Tibet, in China, in Burma and elsewhere continues.
We must consider using all the instruments at our disposal, perhaps even a phased boycott of the Olympic Games.
We also urge the Council to appoint an EU Special Envoy for Tibet at last.
Long live free Tibet!
