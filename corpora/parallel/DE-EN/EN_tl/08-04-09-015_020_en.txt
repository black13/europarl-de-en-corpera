on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, that is indeed our wish.
This is not because the report is a bad one - I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group, too, on a very good report - but there are still one or two critical issues unresolved.
We should like to be able to discuss these in peace, which is the reason for our motion; and, as the President has just said, if the House were to agree to it, we could then vote at 11 a.m. - but this is not the reason.
Mr President, for form's sake, I should like to notify my fellow Members on this occasion that I shall also be putting forward a motion - not now, but tomorrow - that the vote on the report on FYROM, or Macedonia, likewise be postponed until the Strasbourg sitting.
I shall state the reasons for this tomorrow; I just wanted to let my fellow Members know now.
Here, too, there is just one small unresolved issue.
This is our group's wish.
