on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - I am delighted with this very good, balanced report by Mr Swoboda, which is a positive sign for Croatia and for the region as a whole.
Despite all the tangible efforts, however, we must not forget certain problem areas that still require comprehensive reforms before Croatia is able to join the EU.
Ultimately, the facts are the only reliable benchmark for a country's readiness for accession.
Examples are the clarification of unresolved border issues, the fight against corruption, administrative reform and respect for human rights.
Cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is another benchmark for the country's readiness.
The political parties, civil society and the media must make longer-term efforts to gain the support of the population.
The same applies to the integration of national and sexual minorities into social and political life.
I very much welcome the decision to appoint a representative of the Serb minority as Deputy Prime Minister.
A great deal still has to be done in the environmental protection sector, however, in order to ensure ecologically sustainable development in line with EU targets.
Supporting Croatia in this is a task I shall be glad to promote.
