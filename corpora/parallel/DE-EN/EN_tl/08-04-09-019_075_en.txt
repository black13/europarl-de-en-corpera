Mr President, not only is Croatia culturally and historically anchored in Central Europe, but also it already meets all the accession criteria.
Therefore, we should not be putting any unnecessary obstacles in its way.
With the settlement of the fisheries dispute, Croatia has once more affirmed its readiness for EU membership, and the Croatian Government is also strengthening its efforts to combat corruption.
Nevertheless, Croatia's rapid admission, which has now come within its grasp, should not in my view lead to automatic entry for any other states.
As is generally known, Macedonia is having to battle with not only corruption, but also economic problems and the rule of law.
Particularly with regard to Kosovo's declaration of independence, it remains to be seen whether the ethnic peace with the Albanian minority can continue in the long term.
We must not repeat the mistakes of past enlargement rounds.
The EU must in my view finally wake up to the fact that unresolved conflicts, cultural differences and socioeconomic problems do not vanish into thin air with accession.
