Madam President, Mr Swoboda's report is encouraging, realistic and balanced.
I congratulate him on it.
It shows the progress Croatia has made, such as its exemplary legislation on minorities, its constructive cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, its increased commitment to fighting corruption, and above all the agreement of Parliament and government regarding the fishing zone, which has been particularly difficult to achieve.
Croatia and the European Commission now have to bring all their resources to bear to negotiate the forthcoming chapters quickly and satisfactorily.
An international arbitrator should have the opportunity at long last to resolve the border issues between Slovenia and Croatia.
Croatia has a key role to play in the region and should be admitted to the European Union soon.
Bilateral issues must not be an obstacle.
With regard to Macedonia, I can tell you that I was at a conference there at the weekend and the mood is really very agitated following the rejection by NATO.
People feel they have been unfairly treated.
Mr Meijer's report shows the stony path the country has already successfully trodden.
There is certainly a great deal still to do, but when the naming issue continually hangs over everything like the Sword of Damocles it is difficult to move on in other areas of policy.
I have been monitoring the situation there since 1992 and would like Macedonia and Greece to find a solution at long last to the dispute regarding the name, particularly for the young generation.
Both sides have made concessions in recent weeks and both must take another step closer to each other.
I would find it incompatible with our European values and actually irresponsible if a veto were once again to provide the opportunity to bar the country from joining the European Union.
This must not happen!
