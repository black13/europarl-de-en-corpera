Madam President, Commissioner, the media in my country are noting Germany's successful record on mammography screenings.
Once again the EU guidelines on quality assurance have proved their worth.
However, demands are already being made to offer this to younger women as well.
This shows how important European guidelines are.
Therefore, in its motion for a resolution, too, this House will tomorrow be calling for the further development of evidence-based EU guidelines on early detection, diagnosis and treatment of all widespread cancers and the formulation of an urgently needed accreditation and certification procedure for relevant facilities.
Criteria on their own are not enough here.
Only in this way will we manage to put quality above populism and above class and market interests when it comes to the early detection and treatment of cancer.
I would ask all my fellow Members - and the Commissioner, too - to continue to persuade and bring on board the Member States still doubting the need for an accreditation procedure.
