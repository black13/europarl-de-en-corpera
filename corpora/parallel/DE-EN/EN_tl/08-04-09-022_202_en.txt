Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should carry out these evaluations from time to time, and in particular publish the findings from the Member States in a register, as conflicts do occur on the individual issues, of course, over the years, for example in the case of the Water Framework Directive, where we are going to great lengths on the one hand to promote renewable energy, but on the other hand are wasting unused water.
There are also problems with Natura 2000.
We should be listening to citizens here and adapting the programmes accordingly from time to time.
