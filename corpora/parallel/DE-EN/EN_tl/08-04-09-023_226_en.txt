rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, in summary we can say that we have again set ourselves an objective here that focuses on the Lisbon Agenda.
Implementation of research results in the short-term will, we hope, create new jobs and lead to higher net wages.
Of course, an essential feature of innovation is that new products are offered, and thus also success is achieved on the market.
I am also pleased that, together with the European Investment Bank, we have succeeded in providing an additional instrument for risk sharing, and that these sums can therefore be spread significantly further.
We have also devised an evaluation in order to see whether the funds are actually being claimed and check that the European Parliament is not having to make cutbacks again on account of the funds not being completely exhausted in the previous year, as happens with other programmes.
I believe this programme can ensure that the funds are exhausted, and I would ask my fellow Members to ensure in the Member States, too, that cofinancing works as intended.
It is in the interest of all of us that the take-up of this programme be good.
I believe that it should also be communicated accordingly.
I would also ask Commissioner Potočnik to arrange with Commission Vice-President Wallström for this programme to be presented to the public as exemplary: this is part of the process.
I should like once again to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency: this is a product and a project that is really worth showing off.
