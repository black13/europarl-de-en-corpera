in writing. - Commissioner Potočnik, talking about the role of SMEs is the done thing in this House.
Indeed, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the EU economy.
In Germany alone, almost 20 million people are working, researching and developing in more than 3.3 million small and medium-sized enterprises.
Whether Europe grows or stagnates mainly depends on them.
Small and medium-sized enterprises produce more patents, innovations and jobs than the large conglomerates.
Yet the SMEs continue to have too little access to loans and funding programmes.
Eurostars is a good example of how things work.
Unlike the Seventh Framework Programme, which is based on a top-down approach with central funding by the EU, Eureka and Eurostars are bottom-up approaches.
The programmes are managed by the Eureka Initiative.
This is a good thing, and could also perhaps be a model for our Seventh Framework Programme.
The advantages of the Eurostars programme are as follows:
• research-intensive SME required in leadership role
• eligibility checking and evaluation by international experts
• harmonised invitations to tender and workflows in all Member States
• fast decision making regarding funding: 14 weeks after the cut-off date
• the Commission awards additional top-up
• funding exclusively in the form of non-repayable grants (cash allowance)
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on his work.
I wish the programme every success.
