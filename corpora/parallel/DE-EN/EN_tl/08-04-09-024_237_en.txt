on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who championed the irrelevant amendments in committee.
Yet in line with what Mrs Laperrouze said about coal, it is not at all clear to me why the Commission should stipulate subsidising coal ad infinitum, as it were.
Coal has been subsidised to an unbelievable extent for 50 years, and continuing this is contrary to all the EU's statements on climate policy.
We believe that, on the contrary, these coal subsidies should be replaced with more consistent support for renewable energies and energy efficiency.
Otherwise Europe will not be in a position to meet its targets on climate policy.
Steel is another story.
Yet the Commission has omitted to make it clear that steel continues to be subsidised and coal does not.
In my opinion sufficient provision has already been made for coal, a dirty energy source, in the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
