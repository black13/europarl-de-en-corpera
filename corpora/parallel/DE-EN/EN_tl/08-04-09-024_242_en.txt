Mr President, Commissioner, I am particularly pleased that today the European Parliament is already discussing the second research project.
I believe that steel research, in particular, is particularly important, especially in the face of climate change, because we are naturally striving to make production as efficient as possible and to make efficiency criteria an essential component of consumption.
I should therefore like to reiterate my particular congratulations to the rapporteur on this report, and I can say that today is a real day for research.
