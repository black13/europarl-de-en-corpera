on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new technologies are gaining ever greater weight in Europe's cultural industry.
Particular attention must therefore be given to protecting intellectual property.
The task of the European Union, and of the Member States, should be to provide the necessary resources to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected and protected.
Combating piracy is particularly important in this regard.
All those involved should be aware of their rights and obligations regarding a common solution to this task.
In its report, our committee has argued in favour of awareness-raising and education campaigns, particularly with regard to consumers.
Preparatory and education measures explaining the value of intellectual property should start among young people in schools.
In this context I should like to emphasise once again the committee's opinion that criminalising consumers who are not seeking to make a profit is not the right solution to combating digital piracy.
We have repeatedly emphasised that free information structures such as the World Wide Web are of great significance to the European creative sector and that we have to strike a balance between the openness of the Internet and the protection of intellectual property.
In this context, Mr President, allow me one final comment on the revised version of Amendment 22a tabled by 40 Members.
My group - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - has clearly stated that it is prepared to support the first part of the amendment, and to emphatically reject the second part of this amendment.
