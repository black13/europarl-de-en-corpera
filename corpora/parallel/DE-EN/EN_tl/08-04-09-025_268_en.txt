Madam President, I should just like to rule out any misunderstandings once and for all.
This report is not about barring anyone in any way from access to the Internet.
The Committee on Culture and Education has unanimously rejected this.
It is about achieving a balanced relationship between open access to the Internet and the protection of intellectual property, and here we do indeed still have a large number of tasks to resolve and instruments to find that take account of both objectives.
I should therefore like to specifically ask for this approach to be followed in the votes, too.
