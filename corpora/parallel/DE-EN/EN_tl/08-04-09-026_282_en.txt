on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura most sincerely on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for his excellent report.
Thank you, too, to the Commission for presenting this communication on the European agenda for culture.
It can count on Parliament's support for culture as a horizontal task, for increasing artists' mobility, for increasing regional cooperation and for strengthening international cooperation.
However, we also note the absence of something on this agenda.
This is a subject we discussed in detail a little while ago.
The cultural industries and their growing significance also mean that the economic aspects are becoming considerably stronger than has been the case in the past.
The agenda for culture is not only about issues of better cooperation on the cultural agenda or of increased funding, but also of the legal framework.
In that regard, it is indeed true even within the European Union that, if culture is in competition with internal market law or competition law, it always draws the short straw in case of doubt.
You will all remember the Lévai report: the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services described collective management societies for online music as obstacles to competition on the internal market.
Here culture clearly draws the shorter straw and is in a weaker position than European internal market law.
Hence the urgent need, and tomorrow Parliament will decide the same way as the Committee on Culture and Education.
The Unesco Convention must be applied not only to securing cultural diversity with regard to third countries, but also as a matter of the utmost urgency in our own European law.
Our heartfelt plea to the Commissioner, therefore, is that we have just one time slot, and therefore need a proposal quickly for strengthening cultural diversity in European internal market law.
