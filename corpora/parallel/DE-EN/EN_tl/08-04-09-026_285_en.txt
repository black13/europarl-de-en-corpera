on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, the interesting thing in this paper on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world is that it really asserts the strategic claim not only to organise cultural policy as a sector, but that culture should be an integral part of various European policy fields, such as foreign policy, urban development policy and Structural Funds policy.
This really is a new quality.
It changes the European Union's self-image regarding the importance of culture and its strategic importance to policy as a whole.
Culture is always a double-edged sword, and this is what is particularly interesting.
It is always a product, but it is more than a product because it carries meaning and purpose.
This evening I should like once again to put it in graphic terms: I am anticipating that this dual nature of culture will really have an effect in all policy fields, particularly regarding internal-market logic.
Besides, Commissioner FigeÄ¾ will be very strong if he is successful in imparting the strategic importance of culture to the other Commissioners.
