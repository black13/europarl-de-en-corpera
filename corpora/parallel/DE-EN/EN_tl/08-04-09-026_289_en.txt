Madam President, thank you to the rapporteur and also to the Commission for this document.
Once again the central role of culture in European integration and in the worldwide image of the European Union is being highlighted.
How we choose to deal with this recognition, which is not new but is extremely important, and integrate it into every area of policy - as is already specified in Article 151 - has been well defined in the present agenda for culture.
It is pleasing that, during the preparatory work, a wide consultation process took place with various cultural stakeholders who do essential cultural work, for which we must thank them.
We urgently need this cultural strategy in order, for example, not only to be continually referring to our cultural diversity with pride, but also to be able to cope with the challenge of dealing with this diversity and the problems that arise.
Implementation of the strategy will be crucial, however.
President Barroso announced a task force for culture back in November 2005 in Budapest, which could be an important signal to the outside world, but has not so far been implemented.
I hope this will not be the case with this agenda for culture.
Promoting culture is a return on investment in the areas of intercultural dialogue, of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and of internal relations, and it is also above all a social value added.
We use art and culture.
It offers us great benefit in almost every social and economic field.
It should not be exploited, taken advantage of or starved out, however, and we should also therefore be thinking of an appropriate budget.
