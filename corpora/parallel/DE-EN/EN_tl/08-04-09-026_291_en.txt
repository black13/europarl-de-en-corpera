Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome this report because it shows that this Europe is growing together and that culture plays a very special role in this.
If we think of the Capitals of Culture alone - next year it will be the city of Linz in Upper Austria - these give many creative artists the opportunity to get to know another new part of Europe.
Later on there will also be a lot of visitors travelling from Linz to the other Capitals of Culture.
This programme contributes a great deal to mutual understanding.
In the case of Vilnius, in particular, we have a very good opportunity to show how strong cooperation can actually be.
This should also be an example for the future.
