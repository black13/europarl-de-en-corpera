Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity to canvass support for the amendment by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the secretarial allowance.
I know that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have tabled another amendment; ours has the same wording as the decisions of the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, which all group chairs voted unanimously to support.
I do not actually think it fair what is now being said about the Committee on Budgets living up to its reputation of doing its own thing again.
The amendment by the Verts/ALE Group talks of a statute for Members' assistants.
This will be the result if the Bureau's amendment, that is, the result of the negotiations with the Council, become available.
We, too, are striving for this statute for Members' assistants, but we do not yet know whether we shall obtain it, whether we can even come to an agreement with the Council.
I should therefore like to request that this phrase not result in the rejection of all the Bureau's wording.
I think it is very important that we proceed in this House with as much agreement as possible and do not needlessly quarrel over details we do not have the power to establish.
Hence my heartfelt plea to endorse our amendment.
Not a single word has been added or left out.
