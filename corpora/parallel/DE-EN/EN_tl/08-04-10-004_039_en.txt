Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is on the way; that is a scientifically proven fact.
The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report states quite clearly that no region of Europe will be spared its effects.
It is important to keep increases in temperature under 2°C. However, even global warming of less than 2°C would have negative economic and environmental consequences for certain regions of Europe.
That is why Europe must act now.
We must initiate adaptation measures now, and in many policy fields.
However, climate change also presents opportunities; one of these opportunities is for us to prepare ourselves for climate change by means of adaptation measures.
As we think about adaptation measures, we should also adapt the Lisbon process to the demands of climate change.
This offers an opportunity to create an environmentally driven industrial policy: an economic and industrial policy which decouples economic growth from CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions.
This will be the key to success.
Let me pose a question to the Commissioner here: to what extent is the Commission discussing the Lisbon process in the context of climate change?
The second point is this: it is also important to ensure that local and regional decision-makers are informed about the effects of climate change on their areas.
How will climate change affect the individual regions?
This will be very important in terms of development planning, for example, which is why I support the proposal in the motion for a resolution which calls for the establishment of a European database that is accessible to regional decision-makers as a guide for their development planning.
