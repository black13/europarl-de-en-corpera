in writing. - It is clear to all of us that climate change is a major challenge.
Many parts of the world are already struggling to cope with the negative impacts of the rising global average temperature, and this trend will continue in the coming years.
People in Europe, too, will feel the threatening effects of climate change on their environment, economy and everyday life.
A coherent strategy to combat climate change is therefore desirable.
We must try to tackle climate change on two fronts simultaneously; that is essential.
Europe must not only drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions; it must also adapt to global warming.
This is the only way for us to curb the impact of climate change in future.
More efficient use of energy and our already scarce water resources is one of the measures which must be taken.
I think it is important that Member States which have already done more than others to combat climate change are not put at a disadvantage.
All states should be compelled to make an appropriate contribution to mitigating climate change.
The price of inaction would simply be too high.
