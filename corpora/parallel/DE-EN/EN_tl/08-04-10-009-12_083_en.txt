rapporteur. - Mr President, as I understand it, the PPE-DE has withdrawn Amendment 4, but would like to vote on paragraph 8 in two parts, which I fully support.
The first part would go as far as 'on public opinion in Croatia' and the second part would begin with 'urges the Croatian Government'.
As I say, the withdrawal of Amendment 4 would mean that we would take the vote in the two parts mentioned.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 12
