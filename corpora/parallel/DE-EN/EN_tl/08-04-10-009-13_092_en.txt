on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, forgive me for rising too early a moment ago.
I will be brief.
We fully agree with the basic thrust of Mr Meijer's report; he has done a very good job.
There is one sensitive issue and that is the question of the name.
We want to make it easier for Macedonia to navigate through these rocky waters, which is why, between now and the next Strasbourg part-session, we want to work with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur to find a solution so that we can take a vote during the next Strasbourg part-session.
That means postponing the vote today.
