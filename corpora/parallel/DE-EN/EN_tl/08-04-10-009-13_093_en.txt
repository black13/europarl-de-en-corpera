on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr Swoboda, this is laughable!
Everyone knows that we cannot find a solution within a week.
This row has been going on for years, and the decision has to be taken: Macedonia is called Macedonia is called Macedonia.
Greece has to accept that and then we will take a vote.
It will make no difference whether we do so today or leave it for a week; Macedonia will still be called Macedonia.
(Applause)
