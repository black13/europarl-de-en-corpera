Mr President, I announced yesterday, and notified the parliamentary services accordingly, that I wished to table a motion requesting a postponement of the vote on FYROM, in other words, on the Macedonia report.
It is not that we take issue with the line pursued by the rapporteur, but on such a sensitive matter we do not want to add fuel to the fire.
We would prefer to find a formula which is capable of securing the widest possible support in this House.
I therefore request that we vote to postpone this vote until Strasbourg: not beyond that, only until Strasbourg.
