Given the EU's weight in the international arena, 'go-it-alone' approaches by the EU are highly unlikely to have any effect.
If the EU presses ahead and makes itself a laughing stock in the eyes of the world, that would help no one, especially not the Tibetans.
Even if the situation calms down, new and perhaps even more violent unrest can be predicted.
Together with allies, however, the EU can make efforts to improve the life of the minorities in China on a progressive basis and gradually bring about a change in attitude in the government and the majority population.
