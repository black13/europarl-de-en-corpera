on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I do think we should wait for this Parliament's delegation to visit Georgia in a week's time, when it will look in particular at the Abkhazia question.
After all, a number of delegation members are present here.
We can put this item on the agenda after the delegation's visit in a week's time, not perhaps as an item for urgent debate but certainly as a matter for serious discussion.
First, however, we should wait for the report from the parliamentary delegation.
