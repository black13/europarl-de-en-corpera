Mr President, according to Amnesty International's annual report, more than one third of all death sentences worldwide are carried out in China.
The exact number is probably much higher and therefore a state secret.
Sixty-two states apply the death penalty, sometimes for non-violent crimes such as adultery, tax evasion, prostitution or homosexuality.
Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen also execute young people under the age of 18.
The European Union must therefore do all in its power to uphold the elementary human right to life and seek a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty.
It should address China in particular, heading up these sad statistics, in an endeavour to bring it closer to applying these universal human rights, in accordance with the Olympic motto 'One World, One Dream'.
