rapporteur. - Mr President, I thank all the speakers in this debate.
I am, of course, also grateful for the good wishes and praise I have received.
Let me also thank the Commissioner.
If I have understood correctly, the Commission is supporting us all the way and promising a preliminary draft budget that will take account of everything we want taken into account.
We have once again made our priorities plain.
They are neither few in number, nor are they exactly small: tackling climate change, creating growth and employment, a social Europe, research, training, education, aid for the poorest countries in the world, fulfilling our tasks in the world.
It is not easy actually to finance all that.
I wish the Council had been listening, for then it would have seen that - thank God! - all, or at least nearly all the parliamentary groups stand united here.
For that, I warmly thank all concerned.
