Mr President, Commissioner HÃ¼bner has just said that the Commission and the Council are both already working on matters relating to transposition of the Lisbon Treaty.
That is wonderful!
However, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to insist on behalf, I believe, of all fellow Members that Parliament is treated as an equal, including in regard to the forwarding of documents and non-papers on everything that will have to be discussed and negotiated jointly in the coming months, rather than as a second-rate institution.
Unless we are certain of that, we will face major problems at the end of the procedure, at the end of the year.
It is in the interest of the Commission and of the Council to ensure completely equal treatment in information policy too, in regard to documents and matters under consideration.
