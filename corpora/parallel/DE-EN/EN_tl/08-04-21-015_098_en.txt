on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think our duty in this matter is threefold.
First, we must manage to formulate a uniform European interpretation of war and the reasons for war, that is to say a common European memory.
There is no point in continuing with this unending discussion and comparing Stalinist crimes with Nazi crimes.
Those are two separate examples of totalitarianism, two separate criminal systems, although they do sometimes have structural similarities.
Surely we can take the whole debate about openness, democracy, etc., as expressing a common interpretation.
The common response is, for example, the European Union, or the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which basically reflect the lessons learned from those two totalitarian systems that created such destruction on our continent.
Secondly, if we look around us in the world, we see Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, and so on.
That means the destruction of human beings is continuing.
What we need - as Baroness Ludford rightly said - is the International Criminal Court, and common rules.
Today we must seek to ensure that all civilised states recognise the International Criminal Court so that crimes of that kind, which differ, which are not all the same, but which are all crimes in some form, really can be brought to justice.
We will only be able to counter such crimes if we can bring those responsible to justice, wherever they are, whether in Guant√°namo, in Darfur, or in Bosnia, among Bosnian Serbs.
Justice will prevail only if those responsible can be taken to court.
Those are the lessons of history and that is why I believe that Commission initiatives of this kind are interesting if, in the end, they lead us to formulate a common, anti-totalitarian position.
