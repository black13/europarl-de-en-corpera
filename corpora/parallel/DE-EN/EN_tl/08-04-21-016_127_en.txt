on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are few issues on which the citizens of Europe broadly agree that Europe is making serious efforts on their behalf.
What we are debating here today is a significant issue of that kind: cooperation among Member States in order successfully to combat cross-border crime and terrorism.
I am very glad we managed to reach a consensus in committee too, thanks to the preparatory work and the very fair cooperation with the rapporteur.
That means that while we may not agree on every single point, we are broadly in agreement and want to play our part in making headway in this matter.
The Prüm Agreement process was very laborious and took a long time.
We only advanced bit by bit.
Yet it is a good thing that we now have European agreements on the exchange of data, that national databases are being linked up and that we can use those national databases to pursue and prevent crime.
I would have liked to see more progress in certain areas of this whole project.
That is why I am taking this opportunity not just to talk about what we have achieved to date but also to say this: of course this decision also includes a few points that may apply tomorrow and the day after.
For instance, we want to use joint police forces more efficiently and quickly and we want police forces from one Member State that have specific skills to be able to operate in another Member State.
Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has just pointed out that there are certain difficulties.
Yet it is important to drive this process forward, to ensure that we have more European responsibilities here and carry out more joint actions.
In the end we may find that a very good way to promote the European idea is by demonstrating to people that we are trying to resolve important issues in a manner they too consider positive.
