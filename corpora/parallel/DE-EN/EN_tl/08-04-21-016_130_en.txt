Mr President, Commissioner, since the 9/11 attacks if not before, the EU has concentrated its technical security measures almost entirely on combating terrorism.
Now, it is certainly right actually for us not to make it easy for potential assassins to download bomb-making instructions from the Internet and of course closer cooperation among Member States is to be welcomed.
Yet, in the fight against terrorism we cannot allow innocent citizens to become targets or awkward critics to be silenced.
I believe there is a dangerous trend worldwide constantly to erode the basic liberties for which our forefathers fought so hard.
We are running the risk of becoming a profoundly illiberal society, by passing on passenger data, by Internet surveillance.
I hope we do not soon find that every nonconformist who attends a demonstration supports a referendum, or even dares to criticise the EU is branded a potential terrorist.
Of course it is important to be vigilant - but not to the detriment of civil liberties.
And of course we must not allow other areas, such as combating organised crime, to suffer as a result.
We must not underestimate the dangers of ever-expanding parallel societies, migration-based violence and potential ethnic and cultural conflicts.
