Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Adamou, we know that demand for organs outstrips supply.
We also know, however, that the only way to increase supply is to secure the principle of non-commercialisation.
So there can be no trade in organs, and we cannot permit expense allowances and reimbursement of costs to turn into covert forms of payment.
The problem of organ trafficking is not taken seriously in the European Union.
I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner that organ trafficking is to be included at last in the report on trafficking in human beings.
However, what happens if a European citizen comes, with an organ, from a third country such as the Philippines?
No doctor or hospital will query the origin of the organ.
The European citizen will not be required to prove that it did not come from trafficking.
That is why we need traceability if we are to eliminate organ trafficking effectively.
It is here that the European Union has a big responsibility because we cannot permit a situation where people in China, Ukraine or other countries have to live in fear of an organ mafia.
It is tragic that poverty and desperation should drive people to sell their organs.
It is equally tragic, of course, that people should have to die because there are too few organs available for transplants, but we do need to consider both sides of the coin.
