Today, almost a thousand patients are registered for transplants in Austria.
Unfortunately not all these seriously ill patients will get the transplant that may save them.
Every year some 150 patients die while awaiting a transplant because of the very limited number of available donor organs.
Organ shortage is a major challenge facing Europe.
That is why we need a directive on the quality and safety of organ donations.
Equally, however, we need cooperation between Member States and an exchange of good practice.
There are, currently, considerable differences within Europe in the number of organ donations and in the transplant quota.
Cooperation among Member States should focus on discovering the most efficient systems, exchanging experience and promoting well-established procedures.
Member States must learn from one another.
I am convinced that live donation should always remain complementary to post-mortem donation.
Moreover, it is important for donations to remain voluntary and unpaid.
Transfers of money between donor and recipient are unacceptable.
The Commission and the Member States must take measures to combat transplant tourism and the illegal trade in organs more effectively.
