on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too would like to thank Marian Harkin very much indeed for her balanced and comprehensive report.
It is the product of a shared effort to give greater recognition at European level to the aims, substance and social significance of voluntary work.
There are countless voluntary initiatives currently in place in the Member States which make important contributions, not only economically but also socially and in terms of integration.
However, the European dimension so necessary for networking is often lacking.
We are already familiar with the European Voluntary Service for young people, and we need similar programmes for all age groups, particularly for the growing numbers of retired people who are active, healthy and experienced.
They too could contribute significantly to making the European Community more meaningful, and existing measures under our regional and cohesion policies could be used to make this possible.
We need appropriate framework conditions and definitions that are as clear as possible, in the interests of long-term and short-term development for all the voluntary sector partners.
Initial steps have been taken by the Commission and also by the Council.
My hope is that both those institutions will take up Parliament's proposals and suggestions, so that we can make the European Year of Volunteering - jointly proposed for 2011 - a real success.
