Mr President, President Maystadt, I would like to congratulate Mr Audy, because he made the point very well that trans-European networks have particular significance for us.
I can imagine that, in this respect, the EIB also provides an incentive instrument for ownership unbundling.
We now have the Commission's proposals before us, that is, to increase the focus on ownership unbundling in the energy and telecommunications sector.
My suggestion would be to concentrate on creating incentives here rather than focusing on making statutory obligations.
My second point is that the export industry is currently having difficulty in maintaining its performance, especially now the euro is strong.
Would it not be possible to focus on special programmes to provide guaranteed support for the export performance of our European businesses?
