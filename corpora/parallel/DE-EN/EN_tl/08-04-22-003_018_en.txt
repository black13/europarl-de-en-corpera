in writing. - Mr President, President Maystadt, Mr Audy, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur most warmly and congratulate him on the good, balanced work he has carried out.
I congratulate the EIB on its successful activities and ambitious business plan.
When it comes to energy and innovation, the EIB is helping the EU to implement its policy.
Without the EIB we would not have got the CIP off to such a good start.
The EIB's strategy for 2007-2009 provides for reinforcement of the value added, the gradual increase in risk taking, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the Commission.
I heartily endorse this strategy.
The evaluation of the activity by the EIB rapporteur and the suggested next steps are correct.
However, we must not forget that the role of Parliament is limited.
Although the EIB is one of the Community's institutions, its power is exercised internally according to intergovernmental rules, which means that the Member States are the most influential shareholders.
The European Parliament has been commenting on the EIB's activity reports regularly since 1999 and this has developed into a close, trusting, successful relationship of cooperation.
I would particularly like to praise the cooperation with President Maystadt, which is exemplary for relationships with other institutions.
