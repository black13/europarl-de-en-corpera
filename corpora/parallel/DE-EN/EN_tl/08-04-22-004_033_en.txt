draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, I would like to state that our goal is to promote cultural diversity in Europe.
Our culture programme reaches citizens where they live, which is our stated goal.
Accordingly, we expect extremely good management from our national cultural agencies, and I would like to add that the revision of financial regulation will improve our ability to target finance and support for small projects that citizens apply for in their own areas.
However, this also means that we have to find the right balance between cutting bureaucracy and preventing fraud which, in turn, means that we need rules that are appropriate.
If citizens who need small sums in order to be able to carry out their cultural projects are not to have to fill out endless application documents, we need to simplify procedures and move to flat-rate financing.
That way, we will find greater acceptance amongst the citizens of Europe for our culture programmes.
