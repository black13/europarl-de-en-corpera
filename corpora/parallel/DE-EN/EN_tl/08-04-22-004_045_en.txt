Mr President, I would like first to thank everyone who worked to prepare this important discharge for 2006 and supported our rapporteur.
It is perhaps the most important discharge that we have undertaken during this term.
We see the problems, and we still have time to resolve those problems.
I would like at this point to convey our particular thanks to the European Court of Auditors, the authority of whose reports grows from year to year.
It would just be good if, from time to time, the Court of Auditors could withstand the temptation to populism.
We remember the stud farm associations and the golf clubs, and all that goes with them.
Those were more political assessments than the assessments of a court of auditors.
I would like to thank the European Commission which, in the end, negotiated a tight follow-up with us, also under pressure from a tough-talking rapporteur from this committee.
Commissioner Kallas has already mentioned how we want to proceed in the coming months.
National declarations by the Member States are important.
Council is not here today - we can see that - they are not paying attention to how their taxpayers' taxes are being used, so we have to do it.
We will make progress in structural policies.
Commissioner Kallas, we will continue to have difficulties in external policy.
We pointed out the first time that this external policy was not sufficiently monitored, even though we are spending billions on it.
In the world of international finance, it is usual for voting rights to be allocated according to the obligations to make contributions.
If the European Union contributes more than 40% to rebuilding Iraq, for example, I would have liked us to have more than 40% of the participation rights and codecision rights.
There is still a long way to go, so there is much to be done here.
Today we will be voting on good reports and it is now a matter of giving them good support.
