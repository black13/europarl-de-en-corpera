rapporteur. - Jutta Haug described my critical comments in the explanatory statement and in the main text as abhorrent and as scandal-mongering.
I would like to read out a few quotations: 'The Heads of State and Government are inventing one agency after another.
The agencies are eating up our money.
There are no proper checks as to whether the agencies are really necessary.
There is an extensive area free of control where nobody is really accountable.
No planning is apparent.
One agency after another is created, in order to be paid for consent to difficult topics by an undertaking for an interesting agency.'
These are all quotations from Herbert Bösch.
They are much more critical than what I wrote.
Aha!
When I write it, it is called 'scandal-mongering', but Herbert Bösch, or course, is a member of the party and fits in with it.
Yes, I have experienced this before.
This is what I mean when I talk about the 'doublespeak' that rules here.
This is the hypocrisy of the 'special' class, that people say 'it is dreadful to mention a scandal explicitly in an official Parliamentary paper' but then make critical comments publicly.
This is one of the fundamental problems in this Parliament.
Naturally, people may have different opinions on whether or not to grant discharge, but that is not what these passages, which I read out at the beginning, were about - not at all.
Rather, they were about basic considerations where, when it comes down to it, there is a real opportunity to show their true colours, people once again cover up what is going on here.
That is the truly great problem for democracy in Europe, that the system here is not self-regulating, that it merely involves mutual backslapping.
Mr President, I would also like to ask to be allowed to make a personal statement under Article 145 at the end of the debate.
