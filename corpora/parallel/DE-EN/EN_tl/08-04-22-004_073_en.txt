Mr Martin, we are a free Parliament.
Therefore, as is my duty, I allowed you to speak, in accordance with Rule 145.
I do not wish to pass judgement on your explanation, merely to observe that I applied the Rules of Procedure fairly in order to give you the opportunity to say what you have said.
On my own behalf, I would say that I try to be just and objective - and that I achieve that - in my dealings with all Members of Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.35 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 p.m.)
