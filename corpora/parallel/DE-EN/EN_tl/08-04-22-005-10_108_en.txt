Mr President, even if it is too late to say so, I think that the Member's objection may have been misunderstood.
He wanted a vote on Paragraph 65, fifth indent.
You had a vote on whether family members may be employed.
Paragraph 65, fifth indent does not regulate that, but whether payments can be suspended in the event that there is suspicion of malpractice.
We did not vote on that, or you announced something incorrectly.
Just so that we clear that up, so that everyone knows what is happening.
