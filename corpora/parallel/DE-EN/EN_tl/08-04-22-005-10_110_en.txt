Mr President, I would like to point out that those who prepared the voting lists were aware of the problem, so that the marks that you have in the voting list already take into account the different linguistic problems.
That is to say, it was totally clear how the groups were voting.
It is not the case that nobody knew what was being voted upon.
We tried to correct this in the Tabling Office, and it was corrected.
