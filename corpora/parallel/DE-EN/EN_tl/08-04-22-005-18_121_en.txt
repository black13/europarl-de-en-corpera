Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - Mr President, I would like to point out to the chamber that the resolutions on discharge of the agencies will be adopted without explanatory statements.
As Chairman, I have deleted the explanatory statement, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, under Rule 48, because the rapporteur's explanatory statement bore no relation to the text passed by the committee.
Just for your information.
