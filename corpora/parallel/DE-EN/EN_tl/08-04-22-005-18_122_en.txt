rapporteur. - Mr President, I would not have done this to you if Herbert Bösch had not spoken.
It is simply not true.
You can read it for yourself in the relevant resolutions: At first, it was proposed to censor only a small part.
I objected, based precisely on the Rules of Procedure, whereupon Mr Bösch - I believe completely arbitrarily and wrongfully - deleted the entire explanatory statement, which related to points of criticism which, by the way, have been expressed in exactly the same words by his group in public.
This is a double standard, when to say it oneself is acceptable, but it is not permissible for another to say it.
