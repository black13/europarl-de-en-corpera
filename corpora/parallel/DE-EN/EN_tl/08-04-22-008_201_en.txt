in writing. - Hundreds of thousands of people in Europe are living their lives on a waiting list, waiting for a second chance at life.
It would certainly be helpful to improve the common structures and cooperation by way of a European Organ Donor Card, a joint organ donor pool and a transplant hotline.
Austria, like certain other countries, is exemplary in this respect because every Austrian who does not, while they are still alive, register their objection to the use of their organs after death automatically becomes an organ donor.
For those countries where this is not the case, there will need to be a change of awareness, for the spectacular shortage of organ donation is closely linked to a lack of awareness amongst people in the street, but also amongst health professionals.
Only when we address this problem, improve structures and undertake promotional measures can we increase the number of organ donations and transplants, and also bring a halt to the illegal trade in organs.
