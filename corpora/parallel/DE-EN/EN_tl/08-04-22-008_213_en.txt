in writing. - Unpaid work by voluntary helpers is vital for the public good.
It would be impossible to deal with disasters like flooding or major fires, in particular, without unpaid, unsalaried workers.
We must realise that, without voluntary labour, a great deal would simply not function and also could not be financed by the state.
In many voluntary organisations, the number of active members is continually falling.
The reasons for this include a shorter period of community service in lieu of military service, families relocating and pressure at work or school.
For example, as a result of staff shortages voluntary fire service members are not being allowed to leave their workplace, even if the country reimburses their employer for their wages.
Companies need a strong message that they also benefit from voluntary labour and we must make best-practice comparisons as to how voluntary activity can continue to be made attractive, so that we can achieve our goals.
