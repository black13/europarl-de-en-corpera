in writing. - I voted against the discharge of the Commission's accounts because, in many areas, budget funds were not used frugally and efficiently in 2006.
This applies particularly to money from the Structural Funds, the corruption in many areas that was exposed in 2007, and contracts for building security.
I have submitted several written questions with regard to the latter, which have not been answered satisfactorily by the Commission.
