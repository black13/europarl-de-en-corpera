in writing. - We have struggled to get the wastage and misuse of money under control ever since the EU began.
It is time for the fight against corruption at the top level to begin at long last, such that demands are actually made for monies wrongfully paid out to be paid back, and we have to make the most of opportunities to save money.
This would include, for example, limiting ourselves to one location for Parliament, as well as more sensible use of funds by EU agencies.
We are authorising a duplication of some things, like the Agency for Fundamental Rights, while at the same time, worthwhile agencies such as Frontex are being starved out.
This cannot be allowed to continue.
