Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two reports on today's discussion.
Firstly, there have been violent protests against high food prices in Haiti, Bangladesh, Egypt and other countries.
Secondly, European farmers are demonstrating against the fall in prices in the dairy sector.
To all appearances, there are two conflicting reports, but they do belong together and prove that there are many sides to the crisis.
We need a package of measures because the temptation to resort to protectionism through food producers and retail chains is an aspect that should be taken seriously and policy must be determined here first.
Unlike Mr Borrell, I do no believe that we should be regulating, but that we should be providing greater competition.
That is the key!
I do not therefore see the often quoted connection between food prices and the cultivation of renewable raw materials.
This is disproportionate and not targeted.
The fact is that demand for foodstuffs has increased, particularly in China and India.
We cannot avoid this, but we do nevertheless have to state that there is still no shortage of food to justify this increase in prices.
I do think, however, that we must introduce measures to increase food production.
Our farmers' benefit payments should therefore be increased along these lines.
I believe the revision of our agricultural policy is wrong; it has to be developed further - that is an important principle.
We should also, however, be looking at our legislation to see whether it is at all appropriate for increasing production.
We have a lot of regulations, which restrict the use of fertilisers and pesticides, which cause stresses and strains in the Water Framework Directive.
These are not now causing price increases.
Here we should once again be thinking about whether major developments are necessary.
The issue of set-aside must also, of course, be developed further.
Set-aside must be removed.
We should be cultivating food in these areas.
