Mr President, there is a great deal of euphoria regarding Galileo.
However, there are two enormous downers.
Firstly, the high costs, which EU taxpayers are taking on almost exclusively in the meantime.
The talk is of at least EUR 3.4 billion, but it will certainly be even more.
Secondly, the foreseeable military use of Galileo.
Galileo has always been promoted as the civilian alternative to GPS.
Its exclusively civilian use has even been agreed by contract.
Funding now being planned in the EU budget does not allow any military use according to the contracts in force.
Some are therefore waiting for the Treaty of Lisbon, which would make this possible, but which will hopefully be rejected by referendum in Ireland.
Military use was planned long ago, however.
Here we are hoping for funds to be made available for Galileo from the armaments sector.
The fourth function of Galileo, to offer a public regulated service, is obviously planned as a dual use for military operations, just as for the police, coast guards and intelligence services.
Please say something about this!
Nobody needs a second military satellite programme unless it is used for EU geostrategic and military interests.
Therefore, Galileo should simply be a civilian project.
