Mr President, I wish to drop a few more flies into the ointment.
After the major crisis we now have a good and balanced proposal for a regulation, which in my view will secure the construction phase.
To do this, however, we should not run over the agenda.
The project has been put back five years, with the operating phase planned to begin in 2013.
Our industrial policy strategy is therefore failing, as regards being ahead of GPS 3 on the market with Galileo and setting the standards worldwide.
I therefore believe that we still need a detailed analysis of the crisis the Commission itself has created, because we have to learn from the breakdown of the PPP model, since another PPP model is available with Caesar.
We now no longer have any competitive edge with Galileo, so marketing the system is clearly becoming more difficult.
For this reason we must have a discussion in sufficient time about the public costs of the operating phase after 2013 and we should concentrate on how we can establish publicly funded systems for Galileo such as tolls, eCall and Caesar.
Finally, we are now already in need of a programme for the combined use of Galileo and GPS signals.
We have to concentrate on this because therein lies the added value.
(The President cut off the speaker)
