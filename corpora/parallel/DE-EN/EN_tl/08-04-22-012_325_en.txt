Mr President, I should like to join my fellow Members who have specifically commended Commissioner Barrot and our rapporteurs Mrs Barsi-Pataky and Mrs Niebler for their staying power.
We need a functioning Galileo system as soon as possible and, what is more, our own European system.
We have dozens of tasks that we want to handle with this system.
We want to control our traffic flows more effectively, whether on the road or on water, and we also want to organise our air traffic in such a way that we save as much energy here as possible through better organisation, thus doing what is sensible to slow down climate change.
Against this background, every month in which we speed up is an advantage for us all.
We should therefore be proceeding along this path in a more concentrated fashion.
