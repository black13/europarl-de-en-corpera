Mr President, I think the European Union is on the right lines with this system.
We must also, however, take very critical account of the concerns that Mr Pfl√ºger, for example, has expressed.
We have to find out as a matter of principle which dazzling array of satellite navigation systems are currently in operation and how dependent we have already become on the United States in this area.
It will therefore be good when we are able to compare this with something.
It is particularly good and important that this system is being adopted on a massive scale when imposing tolls on heavy goods vehicles and when shifting traffic flows from road to rail because there are so many possibilities associated with it.
We can impose tolls according to the number of kilometres travelled or according to types, or we can impose tolls uniformly for the whole of Europe.
I think it is important for transport in Europe and important for us all.
