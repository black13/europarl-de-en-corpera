Vice-President of the Commission. - The honourable Member's question can be answered with a simple no.
The systems we currently have are not watertight; we know this.
We are therefore making efforts to improve them.
Specific regulations to combat money laundering are definitely open to improvement and we are also making efforts in cooperation with European countries that are part of the European Economic Area but not part of the European Union to achieve these respective improvements.
The Commission has requested and also received a negotiating mandate from the Council authorising it to negotiate specifically with Liechtenstein with regard to how existing weak spots in the system for combating money laundering and tax fraud can be eliminated.
My hope is that the strong public opinion we have witnessed recently in Europe on this issue will help us to reach the necessary agreements.
We are working hard on this, but as you know, tax issues are extraordinarily sensitive.
Even within the Member States, there is definitely still room for improvement here.
