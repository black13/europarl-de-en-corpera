Vice-President of the Commission. - To the first question I should like to reply that it is surely not the Commission's job to deliver a judgment on which methods a Member State uses to combat tax evasion by its citizens.
I have pointed out that the general rules also apply in tax matters to the protection of personal data, that the Member States are entitled to restrict these rules if this serves to protect their financial interests.
I think the question you have asked is one that should be put to the German Government.
To my knowledge it has investigated the issue of the legality of proceedings in the case you have described in great detail prior to the decision and has reached the conclusion that the German tax authorities were entitled to secure the data involved here.
With regard to the second, very general question, I agree with you that it is annoying that we do not have to guarantee the possibility in the existing EU Treaty that tax avoidance and tax evasion will be pursued in the same way everywhere in Europe and that it still cannot be guaranteed that nobody will aid and abet tax evasion or tax avoidance.
We have in recent years achieved a great deal, particularly against the background of the necessary battle against money laundering and all forms of international crime and terrorism.
I have already pointed out, however, that the Commission believes that there are opportunities for improvement here and what we want to achieve with Liechtenstein - as with other countries - is completely clear.
We should like to maintain the same cooperation and the same exchange of information in relation to Liechtenstein as already exists between the EU Member States.
