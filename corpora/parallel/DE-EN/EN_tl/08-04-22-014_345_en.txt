Vice-President of the Commission. - I understand the honourable Member's question very well.
We are concerned here not with an arrangement with industry brought about by the Commission, as was once the case, for example, with the reduction of CO2 emissions from motor cars, but rather with a sort of automatic development.
As I have said, the manufacturers of two-wheelers cannot adhere to the tight limits already in existence for hydrocarbon emissions with conventional two-stroke engines.
They are simply not able to.
This is the reason why they are switching over to four-stroke engines, which raise a different problem.
The study I have been talking about will reveal the results of this technical development and I repeat once again: if it were to transpire that the problem about which I have just been speaking could not be resolved automatically, so to speak, then it would in fact be necessary to put forward a legislative proposal.
I repeat once again: I am prepared to do this.
