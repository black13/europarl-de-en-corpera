Mr President, Commissioner, I disagree with you in that there would be no discrepancy between strong social protection of employees and a strong internal market.
An EU internal market that complies with the system of global competition is ultimately the incarnation of this kind of opposition.
I do agree with you, however, that Member States bear responsibility for the transposition of EU law into national law.
At least in the RÃ¼ffert case, the rulers in Berlin and Lower Saxony do not simply point the finger at the European Court of Justice.
They have failed in general to explain the law on collective bargaining authoritatively and to demand the legal minimum wage.
Commissioner, I demand that you discharge your responsibility and openly demand the necessary requirement to amend the EU legal bases.
This concerns Article 50 and Article 56, for example, of the consolidated version of the Lisbon Treaty of 15 April, the sharpening of the Posting of Workers Directive, the granting of the right to take industrial action and the cross-border right to take industrial action.
I also refer to the fact that the review of the political problems should not simply be left to the ECJ, but that here both the EU Institutions - the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament - and the nation states bear responsibility for this through their legislation.
