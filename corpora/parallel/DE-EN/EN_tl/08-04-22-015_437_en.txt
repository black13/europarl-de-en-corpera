Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, closer cooperation between national administrations is, of course, right and proper.
I welcome this.
It is even essential.
However, if we all genuinely want to avert a race for the lowest minimum wage in Europe, we need more, and you know that, too, Commissioner.
According to the RÃ¼ffert judgment, there is only one solution in my opinion.
We have to improve the Posting of Workers Directive.
The Commission is also required to do this.
We have to draw legislative consequences from this judgment because it reverses the intention of the Posting of Workers Directive.
The freedom to provide services is placed higher than the protection of employees here.
Even the planned change from minimum to maximum protection is explained.
In my country, Germany, 8 out of 16 federal states are directly affected by this judgment.
The regional governments just wanted to serve as models here on wage dumping matters.
Based on the Posting of Workers Directive as well as on the procurement directives, they wanted to ensure compliance with certain social criteria, at least when awarding public contracts.
They have therefore demanded compliance with local standard wage rates as a social criterion, since these are above the minimum wage.
It is difficult for me to understand the decision of the Court of Justice.
If we really want social criteria - and I think we all want this - then it must be possible to achieve even more than a minimum wage.
The judgment should not entrap us into continuing to authorise minimum standards alone in future for posted workers.
This is not the social Europe that my group wants.
To be on the safe side, we also need to examine the procurement directives carefully.
Back in Germany, the judgments of the European Court of Justice on employment addressed this evening have created a back flash in Europe's acceptance.
We are all now being asked to change tack again here.
