Madam President, renewed interest in Africa throughout the world is attended by a change in perspective.
Today Africa is more than just a continent of poverty.
There are growth rates of up to 10% in some African countries.
Now to the heart of the matter: what is China looking for in Africa?
Its most important motive for commitment there is energy resources.
In the battle for access to raw materials, however, Western value-based policy draws the shorter straw increasingly frequently.
Europe's most important motive is Africa's sustainable development.
A joint EU-Chinese plan for Africa would be ideal in theory.
We should not be claiming to be the good guys here, because the countries of Africa mistrust the EU just as much as China.
The EU cannot provide solutions for either China or Africa.
In any case the EU must carry on tying commitment to conditions.
At the same time it should be promoting governments, institutions and civil society more strongly than it has hitherto.
Dialogue with Africa is necessary, but should not overlook grievances.
On this note I can but support Mrs Gomes's report.
