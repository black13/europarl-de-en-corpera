Madam President, I should also like to extend my congratulations on the report.
It very clearly demonstrates that China can also be an example.
Development in China, particularly economic development, can be an example for Africa.
Market relations and the growth being achieved are remarkable.
China is also our partner in the WTO.
We can indeed see that when negotiations in the WTO on standard wage and quota reduction are successful, it can lead to a win-win situation for both sides.
Africa and China need Europe.
Europe is currently the world's most powerful purchasing forum.
I can imagine a good partnership developing.
