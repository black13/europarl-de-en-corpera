Spo≈°tovani gospod predsednik Republike Slovenije.
It is a great pleasure to welcome the President of the Republic of Slovenia to the European Parliament here in Strasbourg today.
Welcome, Mr President.
Slovenia joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 and currently holds the Council Presidency.
Mr President, four months ago, you took office as President of Slovenia and we have met three times already during that period: for the first time, two days before you officially took office in Ljubljana, then on 8 January at the official launch of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and finally in New York in February during the UN General Assembly's thematic debate on climate change.
Mr President, you are the third President of Slovenia since your country gained its independence.
You can look back on a long and distinguished career as a Professor of International Law and, above all, as a diplomat, for you have dedicated much of your career to the service of the United Nations.
For eight years, you were the Republic of Slovenia's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Representative" \o "Permanent Representative"
to the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" \o "United Nations"
and for five years, you were the UN http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Assistant_Secretary-General_for_Political_Affairs&action=edit&redlink=1" \o "Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs (page does not exist)"
.
Now, Slovenia has the great honour to be the first of the new Member States - the countries which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 - and the first former communist country and the first Slavic country to hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
This privilege entails a great deal of responsibility for Slovenia, which you are facing up to, because the new Member States, in taking on this commitment, now also bear a responsibility towards the large family of the European Union.
For Slovenia, the Council Presidency entails another responsibility as well, towards the countries in its neighbourhood, the countries of the Western Balkans.
Slovenia is a model for these countries, demonstrating to them that success is possible, that membership of the European Union can be achieved and that accession brings stability, development and prosperity.
Mr President, it is my great pleasure to invite you to address the House.
Izvolite, prosim!
