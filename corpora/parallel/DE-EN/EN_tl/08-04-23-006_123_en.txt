Mr President, today's vote is a breakthrough for Macedonia's early accession to the European Union.
This success is due to the efforts of the late President Boris Trajkovski, who was a personal and a pan-European friend and who charted this course, but it is also a major success for the current Macedonian Government under Prime Minister Gruevski and Foreign Minister Milososki, who have built friendships throughout Europe for this European country: a country which has an excellent minority policy, which is achieving excellent development, and to which we want to give massive support.
Let me send out a clear message: I call on our fellow Members from Greece finally to give ground on the name issue.
This House has said very clearly today that it rejects any blockade due to the name issue and that bilateral issues should not be an obstacle to accession.
That is the message that we have sent out with a massive majority of the House today, and it is a hefty shot across the bows of those governments which are blocking progress here.
I appeal to everyone to abandon this blockade in the interests of Europe.
Macedonia is a European country, and we hope that a date can be set before the end of this year for the start of accession negotiations.
