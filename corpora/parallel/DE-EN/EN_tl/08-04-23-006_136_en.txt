in writing. - GPS currently already provides many of the services that would be offered by the European satellite radionavigation programme Galileo.
However, we should not allow ourselves to become dependent on a satellite-based radionavigation monopoly that is dominated by the US and was set up by the US military.
Even the routes of the GPS satellites are drawn in a way which ensures, first and foremost, that the areas in which the US is conducting military operations have good coverage.
Our own system will enable us to define the best possible constellation of flight paths for Europe.
In view of the strategic important of the project, I voted in favour of the report, although the issue of funding has not yet been fully resolved.
