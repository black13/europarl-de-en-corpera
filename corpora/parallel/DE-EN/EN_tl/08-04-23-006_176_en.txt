in writing. - I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this explanation of vote to express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Ana Maria Gomes.
The report being voted on is a very successful one.
I would also like to voice my thanks for the fact that numerous aspects of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade have been incorporated into the report.
In my view, it is very important to assess China's policy in Africa fairly without generalised condemnation of its engagement there.
Instead, the EU's own engagement should be stepped up via the approach centred on 'More Europe in Africa'.
This could improve European visibility and achieve a stronger European presence, thereby strengthening the contacts between the EU and Africa.
Closer economic ties between the two continents could be of great benefit to both sides.
