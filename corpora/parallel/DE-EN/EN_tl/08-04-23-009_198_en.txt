Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time, the Council will decide whether to maintain its common position on Burma and whether to maintain sanctions.
In Burma, there have been no substantive changes with regard to democracy, the rule of law or respect for human rights.
Almost 2 000 political prisoners are being detained there.
Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for years.
In short, there is not the slightest reason to ease the sanctions.
Admittedly, a constitutional referendum has been announced and a draft constitution has been published, but this lacks any democratic legitimacy.
The public has not been consulted, and neither has the democratic opposition.
The draft constitution is full of democratic shortcomings.
It is absurd that a quarter of the seats in parliament will go to the military.
It is absurd to exclude candidates who are married to a foreigner or have children who are foreign nationals.
All this testifies to a lack of democratic progress.
What is to be done?
I endorse the appeals voiced by previous speakers, especially the measured comments of my colleague Geoffrey van Orden.
However, we cannot address the issue of Burma on our own.
Without the support of the Chinese, the junta would not survive.
That is why the Chinese also have a responsibility for what is happening there.
China has moved in to fill the economic vacuum created by the West's sanctions and is reaping the benefits.
That is why an approach must be made to China if we want to see any change in the situation in Burma.
I would also like to appeal to my friends in ASEAN.
I know that my ASEAN friends regard any comment about Myanmar as interference in their domestic affairs, but I am also aware that the situation in Myanmar makes them uneasy.
My message to them is that Myanmar is blighting ASEAN's image in the world, so ASEAN too must bring pressure to bear.
