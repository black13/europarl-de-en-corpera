on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, the European Union and its institutions always claim that the struggle for human rights is of key importance.
However, this does not seem to apply to the EU's own Frontex agency and the policy behind it.
The EU wants to use Frontex to ward off people coming in from outside; it does not want to save lives.
Aid organisations believe that more refugees are dying since Frontex was established as they now have to travel further.
Frontex is militarising the EU's system of repelling refugees.
The question is this: why do the refugees want to come in the first place?
This has a great deal to do with the prosperity gap, and something needs to be done.
Climate change will exacerbate the situation, with even more refugees attempting the journey to Europe.
Frontex is exempt from all parliamentary control.
I recall a hearing organised by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, when the Executive Director of Frontex did not consider it necessary to turn up.
The EU's strategy is clearly to 'cherry-pick' the best of the migrants and refugees and keep the rest at bay, using Frontex, among other things.
Overall, Frontex is worsening the situation of refugees.
My Group's position is therefore very clear: Frontex must be dissolved, and instead, more must be done to provide practical help to refugees.
That would be the right approach, not ever more isolationism and constant reinforcement of Fortress Europe.
