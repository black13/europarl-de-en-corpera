Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to discuss Frontex and that is what we should be focusing on.
Frontex must of course be viewed in the context of a comprehensive migration strategy which on the one hand manages legal immigration but, on the other, combats illegal immigration.
In this overall context, Frontex is the security instrument on which the campaign against illegal immigration and human smugglers depends, and it is being deployed in those areas where the Member States are finding it difficult to cope.
That is why we must ensure that Frontex can indeed evolve into a successful security instrument.
Parliament has managed to achieve a doubling of the budget, with the timescale for joint operations being greatly expanded.
I am pleased that the Hera and Nautilus operations have already begun and that Poseidon will start in the next few days.
However - and this point is directed at the Council - any operation will only be successful if the Member States put the requisite conditions in place and make the requisite instruments available.
This, then, is my request and my urgent appeal to the Council: please do your utmost to ensure that we do not have the same situation as in previous years, when the Member States dragged their feet.
They should understand, at long last, that we need this security instrument and that we are enabling it to function effectively through the requisite supply ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
