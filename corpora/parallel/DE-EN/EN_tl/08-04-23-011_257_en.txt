Mr President, all those of us who have spoken here have voiced our commitment to more species protection and more biodiversity.
We know that the nature conservation Directives and the network of nature conservation areas created by Natura 2000 are a success story for the European Union.
However, all these fine words and all these commitments must not distract attention from the fact that - as you have said, Commissioner - it is not only the climate issue that has dominated the headlines; so, too, has species and nature conservation, unfortunately.
All too often, endangered species are portrayed as nuisances which halt or obstruct building projects.
That is why I think it is shameful that in Germany, of all countries, which will be hosting the Conference of the Parties, conservative-led Land governments such as Hesse and Lower Saxony have launched an initiative in the Bundesrat which constitutes an assault on this EU success story.
It lacks all credibility for Germany to call for more nature conservation areas and more protection for endangered species in poorer countries while attempting to water down nature conservation in the European Union.
Unfortunately, it is not only Germany!
Quite suddenly, the Liberal Group in the European Parliament also held a seminar on this issue.
Mr Stoiber's attack on nature conservation in Europe was conducted in exactly the same way, under the guise of 'simplification'.
I expect you, Madam Commissioner, to give a clear commitment once again to the European Union that any attempts ...
