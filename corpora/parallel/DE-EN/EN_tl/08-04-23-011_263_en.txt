Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would be interested to hear whether the Commission, in respect of the CAP Health Check, has already given some thought to how we can go forward here, especially in the next financial perspective.
The fact is that renewable energy and biofuels are of course major challenges for us, and they should be incorporated into the financial framework of the health check.
This will play a major role in relation to CO2 developments as well, which of course we are obliged to reduce under the Kyoto Protocol.
My specific question is this: which proposals will the Commission be making here?
