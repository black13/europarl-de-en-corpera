Madam President, the expansion of the Schengen area in December last year has led to more, not less, security.
This is borne out by the statistics, and we should be pleased about that.
In the next stage, Switzerland and Liechtenstein are now to be included in the Schengen area, but I hear that there could be problems because some Member States may wish to enter reservations about the accession of Liechtenstein.
I have heard various comments from the Czech Republic to that effect.
I therefore have a question for the Council: are you aware of these possible reservations, and what will you do to avoid any problems associated with the non-accession of Liechtenstein?
