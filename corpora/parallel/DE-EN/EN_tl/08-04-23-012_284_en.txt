Minister, may I take issue with your last comments.
Of course, the competence lies with the Member States here, but the European Union also has a responsibility for the depopulation of these regions; this is happening because of what we face throughout the European Union, namely liberalisation.
Post offices are being closed down in small communities because they are no longer making a profit, local savings banks are being closed down, and local swimming pools are being closed down, in some cases, because public services are being privatised.
All this makes life in these communities slightly less worth living.
I come from a mountain region and I have seen it happening.
My question, then, is whether any thought has been given to this issue at Council level.
Madam President, may I also make one brief comment in response to the previous question: in Graz too, you have to get on a bus to travel five metres, so you are not the only one.
It is the same old nonsense: they claim that Schengen is to blame, which of course is completely untrue.
