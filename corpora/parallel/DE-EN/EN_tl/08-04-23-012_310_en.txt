Mr President-in-Office, you rightly said that in practice, dialogue can contribute to resolving conflicts.
My question is this: can you imagine creating new fora with China, whether it be in education or research?
Learning from each other and understanding each other must be a key focus of attention.
After all, at international level, we not only have sport, music and business; there are the personal human relations as well, and we need new fora here.
