Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that it is very important to make improving our relations with the Gulf states a priority.
Europe and the Gulf states have many interests in common: on the one hand, Europe is the world's strongest market, and on the other, the Gulf supplies us with resources which are unique.
From that perspective, it is essential to intensify our relations with these countries with an eye to the global context.
In the WTO, we have the 'Everything But Arms' issue, and that should be the standard.
We must achieve a sensible solution as quickly as possible here, as this is in both sides' interest.
We should also do more to foster exchange in research, knowledge and know-how, and try to build closer links in the education sector.
Joint conclusion of the Energy Charter is also important.
