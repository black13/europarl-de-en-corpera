Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the agriculture debate, we currently face the challenge posed by the Health Check.
I would be interested to hear whether the GMO debate plays a role, and to what extent it is being discussed, in that context.
We all know that there is a heated debate worldwide about the food/energy security issue at present.
We need to see what implications this debate has for us.
I myself am always in favour of zero tolerance when it comes to labelling.
It should be clear to the consumer what he or she is buying.
From that perspective, we should ensure that the legislative bodies at regional level also have a chance to decide on this issue.
