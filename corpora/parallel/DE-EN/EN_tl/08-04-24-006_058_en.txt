Madam President, I can entirely endorse what our colleague has just said.
The underlying premise here - and Mr Radwan pinpoints it in his report - is that an institution without a political mandate should nonetheless lay down a relatively large body of measures affecting the economy, some of which are binding.
It is not enough to call for improved governance, or better framework conditions; political bodies also need to become more involved in this matter than they have been in the past.
What we are doing here in Parliament constitutes a step in the right direction, but further steps must be taken.
There is also another aspect to consider.
What is done here at the level of a regional organisation - in this case the European Union - should also be mirrored in the global context.
So it is not a simply a matter of seeking to apply these rules to our region of the world alone.
