Mr President, in the old Rhodesia there used to be a tourism poster urging people to 'Come to Rhodesia and see the ruins of Zimbabwe'.
In later years, the slogan was turned around to make a double-edged joke: 'Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Rhodesia'.
Today the poster might well read: 'Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Zimbabwe' - referring not to the famous stonework, but to ruined hopes of prosperity and democracy.
I believe the European Union has a duty to use the current situation - in which, despite manipulation of various kinds, the Zimbabwean Opposition's courage has, after all, won it a major victory - to advance democracy and the rule of law in this important African state.
The people there have suffered enough.
We must, however, find ways of supporting them that are not liable to be interpreted as neo-colonialism.
So it is important that what we do should also have the backing of neighbouring countries and of the Zimbabwean people themselves.
That is why I welcome the first positive steps on the part of the African National Congress - although it needs to do more!
That is why I particularly welcome the brave example set by the dockworkers.
We need to state very clearly that it is the shared task of the European Union, the African Union and the various powers of southern Africa to ensure that the opportunity now created, following the elections, is properly used.
Mr Mugabe already has his place in history; each day that passes merely makes it a less impressive one.
