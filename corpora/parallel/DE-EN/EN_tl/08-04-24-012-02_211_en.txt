on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, this imposing building here in Strasbourg is named after Louise Weiss, who fell foul of the police and the courts in the democratically enlightened France of the inter-war years because she campaigned for women's suffrage.
We cannot, of course, compare that situation to the totalitarian dictatorship in Iran, but the memory should serve to teach us Europeans a certain degree of humility.
The regime in Iran is an unacceptable, totalitarian one, but Iran is a big, multifaceted country, where the forces of reform are steadily gathering strength.
The initiators of this petition, for example, are among the reform movements to which we must lend our emphatic support, and which have now spread to include even members of the Khomeini family.
There are already more women to be found in politics, in administration and in the academic world in Iran than in most other Islamic or Asian states.
That may not tally with the clich√©d view but it is a fact.
We need to build on this plurality in Iran in order to bring about the ultimate downfall of the unacceptable, totalitarian regime there.
That is a tremendous challenge for us as Europeans.
I am therefore very grateful to my colleague, Albert Dess, for helping me on Monday to keep this important item on the agenda - because, ladies and gentlemen, we need to make Iran one of our priorities in the context of Parliament's work to support human rights!
