on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we have no other option but to agree.
However, you said that the Council 'could not' be present.
I doubt that it is unable to be present.
I do not mean to say anything against the Slovenian Presidency, which is always very helpful.
As I have said several times before, since political life does not run according to the Council's timetable, it ought to be possible to tell the Council, when the agenda is set, that some flexibility is required, so that, when new topics arise, they can be discussed with the Council.
This is what I would like to ask for.
Secondly, Mr President, I would ask that we put it on the agenda for the next sitting, because it is an urgent matter.
If those prerequisites are met, then we can agree.
