Madam President, Commissioner, it is appropriate to celebrate the introduction of the common European currency as a success story.
Although some points have already been mentioned, there are a few question marks, two of which I would like to mention.
Firstly, there is one country in the European Union that, unlike many of the candidate countries at the time, deliberately opted to stay outside, which it has the right to do, according to the provisions of the current Treaty.
Let the British stay on their island.
However, there is another country - Sweden - that did not reserve this option in its accession conditions but has since been consistently behaving as if, like the United Kingdom, it had the right to make its own decision on accepting the euro and joining the euro area.
This contradicts the undertaking made at the time.
Perhaps a bit of tidying up is needed here too.
