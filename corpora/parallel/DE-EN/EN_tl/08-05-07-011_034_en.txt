Madam President, Commissioner, the euro's founding mandate has more than been fulfilled.
The euro and the internal market are our most successful answer to globalisation.
The euro makes the internal market the domestic market and the euro, the flag and the anthem are the three symbols that cement our identity.
The Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact motivated the necessary reforms in the Member States and supported and therefore enabled the euro's success story.
However, I would like to make two points in closing: the criteria are meant to be observed, and Slovakia must be treated in the same way as Lithuania.
We must not create the feeling, with each individual decision, that we interpret the criteria inconsistently.
What we are saying here is not anchored firmly enough in the public consciousness.
I would like to see a 'Ten years of the euro' publicity campaign that highlights the advantages of the euro for citizens in the Member States, and I call on the Commission, the ECB and the Member States to communicate the additional value of the euro to citizens this year in concrete terms.
