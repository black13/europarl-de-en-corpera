Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, Europe has made great progress towards a common market.
However, even today there are still markets, even within the European Union, that are being opened only gradually, for example in the area of financial services, where we do not really have a common European market.
For vehicles, too, although there is a common market within Europe, we stopped half-way through the process in the transatlantic area.
Progress towards a common market in the area of security and defence has been achieved.
A first step in this direction was the introduction of the European Defence Agency, and another step was the decision to make EUR 1.4 billion available for defence research as part of the Seventh Research Framework Programme.
However, the most important step forward is the current directive proposals by the Commission, firstly for procurement in the area of security and defence, and secondly in the area of the internal shipment of defence goods.
These are decisive steps towards a common European market in the area of defence, but how does the transatlantic market fare in this area?
Here there are two important changes.
One becomes apparent in that the United States recently decided to purchase refuelling aircraft from a European firm.
Secondly, the proposed directive put forward by the European Commission for the procurement of defence goods does not contain any 'Buy European' rules comparable with the present 'Buy American' rules.
The crux of the matter is to obtain the best equipment for our armed forces and this involves intensive dialogue between the European Union and NATO.
It is equally important to seek direct discussions between the European Union and the United States in these economic matters, however.
The Transatlantic Economic Council will therefore have to discuss this matter - either this time or perhaps at some later opportunity.
