Mr President, Commissioner, it seems that, once again, the Commission is merely paying lip service to the idea of a social Europe.
You are responsible for the fact that we still do not have a proposal to reform the works councils, because it is the Commission, and nobody else, that is disregarding the ETUC's statement that it does not want to enter into negotiations with BUSINESSEUROPE unless they are genuine.
You are establishing completely new rules of play, as Article 138 of the Treaty does not provide for a third phase in the consultation process.
There has never been such a phase.
The Commission's tactics are obvious - it is stalling for time.
Is the Commission really siding with the employers again?
Basically, nobody wants substantial reform of the works councils, certainly not before the next European elections.
May I remind you that Jacques Delors already presented us with a proposal, just two weeks after the employers had refused to negotiate.
You could have done the same.
The end of June is far too late, not to mention the fact that a 'balanced proposal' means something else.
