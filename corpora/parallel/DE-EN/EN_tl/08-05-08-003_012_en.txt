draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Mr President, without transparency, there can be no European democracy.
Brussels already has a reputation for allowing the major corporations to call the shots and pull the strings.
That is dangerous for the European project, and it is an issue which is of great concern to me on a personal level and to the Greens as a whole.
As the European Parliament, we therefore have a responsibility to show our hand to voters in the run-up to the next European elections.
We have a good report in front of us, but there are dark forces at work and they want to suppress two of its core elements.
Firstly, they want to prevent financial transparency.
Without financial transparency, we can never be sure who is really behind the campaigns.
I am astonished to find that it is actually the Socialist Group which is opposed to financial transparency and is thus undermining one of these core elements.
As for the second core element which is being undermined, there are people in Parliament who assume that lawyers should not be regarded as lobbyists, even if they are not defending people in court, but instead are trying to pull strings to influence legislation in Europe.
Let me quote from the website of a law firm in Brussels.
It says that because we are not currently regarded as lobbyists under this legislation,
'Therefore lobbying by lawyers will be more and more effective and goals are more likely to be achieved with legal support.
Alber & Geiger as a law firm exclusively specialised on lobbying and government relations will be at your side to assist you in reaching your goals within the EU.'
As you see, even the law firms themselves are admitting that they are lobbyists.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is unacceptable.
If we allow that to happen, we will undermine our own credibility.
