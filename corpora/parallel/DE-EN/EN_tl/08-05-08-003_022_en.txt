on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, of course lobbyists should not be made a scapegoat.
Of course it is perfectly legitimate, in a thriving democracy, for the various groups in society to represent their interests and concerns pro-actively and bring these interests to bear on social processes.
It is also entirely legitimate for them to address these issues to the men and women in the institutions which prepare and take the decisions.
Indeed, as legislators, we have a duty to inform ourselves as fully and accurately as possible before taking decisions on any legislative initiative that we are dealing with, and take account of the concerns of stakeholders with all their conflicting views.
It is also clear, however, that transparency is essential to ensure the fair representation of interests, and is crucial for the European Union's credibility.
That is why our Group believes that the three institutions must at last set clear rules which must apply to all interest representatives.
In our view, this is long overdue.
We have a duty to demonstrate very clearly to our citizens that the European institutions are not acting as accessories to 'dark forces'.
Lobbyists should therefore be required to disclose publicly whose interests they represent, what their objectives are, and above all, where they get their funding from.
