Mr President, it is no secret that we live in a European Union in which events are bypassing citizens and increasingly benefiting the major companies.
This is undoubtedly due, first and foremost, to the influence of lobbyists in Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Who would be surprised to hear, then, that the Alpine-Adriatic Convention which is so unpopular with the freight lobby is still not being implemented?
Who would be surprised to hear that more and more small and medium-sized enterprises are being forced to throw in the towel because they are snowed under with paperwork and regulations, and because they are literally being starved of any support from the funding opportunities available, while industry giants - the multinationals - understand only too well how to exploit these opportunities and, grasshopper-like, constantly relocate from one Member State to another, leaving a trail of devastated jobs in their wake?
Let us take the debate and the decision-making process on the much-discussed and contentious topic of the REACH draft legislation, which aims to improve safe use of chemicals, as an example: if citizens hear that out of 132 proposed amendments, 32 were identical and were accompanied by written recommendations from the chemical industry associations, if citizens hear this, they will of course steadily lose faith in Europe, and they will have the feeling that European policy-making is simply there to do the multinationals' bidding.
If we want to prevent that, if we want to curb the growing Euro-scepticism, we must achieve a situation in which it is clear who is influencing decision-making in Europe, who is lobbying on behalf of donors and who these donors are, and who is seeking to bring influence to bear on the legislative process.
