Mr President, I have been a Member of the European Parliament for twelve years.
I must say, I feel I should thank many of the lobbyists, for they have proved to be a source of considerable expertise in our day-to-day work.
In my view, it is always good for Members to listen to all sides and keep their door open to citizens.
If we currently have 5 000 lobbyists registered with Parliament - all of whom we can recognise by their badges and who are accredited or certified, as it were - that works out at an average of six lobbyists for every Member.
I think it is extremely important for us to utilise this expertise appropriately in our legislative work, for the fact is that Members cannot be specialists in every area.
That is why it is important to listen to the practitioners and recognise that in reality, lobbyists do enhance our parliamentary work.
