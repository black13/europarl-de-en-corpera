rapporteur. - Mr President, thank you for what has, for the most part, been a focused and well-informed debate.
Serious and transparent lobbying activities help to enhance the efficiency of the decision-making process.
Mr Turmes, you were not correct in what you said: financial disclosure is covered in paragraph 21.
To that extent, you were wrong to attack the Socialist Group.
I feel compelled to point that out.
Secondly, as regards the issue of lawyers, we cannot make the sweeping assertion that every lawyer is by default a lobbyist because he or she has studied advocacy and all that it entails.
We have the correct definition before us: anyone who seeks to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions is a lobbyist, and that includes lawyers.
May I point out one error in the translation: 'municipalities' has been translated as 'Städte' in German.
The US system is very detailed; indeed, it is so detailed that some senators produce 300-page reports at the end of the year, with the result that it is almost impossible to gain a clear insight into what is really happening in terms of lobbying activities in the US.
From my perspective, it was interesting that the ultra-left and the ultra-right virtually converge in their fundamental criticism.
'Les extrêmes se touchent', as the French would say, and this situation is typical.
We want to arrive at a serious solution which is an improvement on what is happening in America, and also improves upon what is happening in most, or indeed all, of the Member States.
Many thanks, once again, to Mr Stubb.
Minister, we are thinking of you!
Thank you, too, for the serious debate.
