Mr President, I am not sure under which rule I should rise at this juncture, but I will do so nonetheless.
I would ask you to inform the Bureau that for me personally, at least - but I am sure I speak for all the Group chairmen here - the atmosphere in the Chamber at present is totally unacceptable.
We cannot even hear people through the headphones, there is so much noise; it is quite appalling.
Much of Commissioner Å pidla's speech and Mr Mavrommatis's comments were largely inaudible because of the dreadful noise in the House.
That is quite unacceptable.
Would you please make sure that the Bureau leaves at least five minutes between the end of the debate and the vote, because we should not have to put up with this situation here in the Chamber.
(Applause)
