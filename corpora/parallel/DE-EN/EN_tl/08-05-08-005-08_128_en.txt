Madam President, in consultation with the two rapporteurs, I propose the following addition:
'Pays tribute to the participation of observers from third countries, such as Switzerland, Norway and Canada, in EU electoral observation missions'.
Those concerned had requested that, and I think this encourages them to take part again next time.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
