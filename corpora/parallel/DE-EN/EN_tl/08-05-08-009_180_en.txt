Madam President, may I begin with the Mavrommatis report.
I voted in favour of the report because it particularly emphasises the contribution made to the financing of sport by the lotteries and Austria's casinos.
I welcome the paragraph in question.
I voted for the Friedrich report because it rejected the attack on the unique and wide-ranging role played by the recognised churches in society, and also offers a more nuanced view of the role of lawyers.
I attach great importance to the expertise and information that we derive from our exchange of experience and dialogue about possible solutions with citizens, interest groups, lawyers and lobbyists.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the hundreds of discussions, as well as the countless e-mails and ideas that I receive.
A few of them are irritating because they simply take up valuable time, but I have found the majority to be both informative and useful.
Once again, I would like to express my thanks for that, but I would also like to say that the responsibility for the way we deal with lobbyists ultimately lies with us.
We decide who we want to talk to, how much of our time they take up, what we talk about, and how we develop a working relationship.
I say 'yes' to clear and transparent rules, but 'no' to overregulation which makes this working relationship more difficult and bureaucratic.
