in writing. - I voted in favour of the report on the state of human rights in the world in 2007 and the EU's policy in this area.
Human rights are universal rights and must apply without restriction.
The EU has the opportunity to champion the cause of human rights globally.
An accurate analysis of the current situation is the prerequisite here, which is why I welcome Mr Cappato's initiative.
Harmonisation of the EU's human rights policy is especially important in order to achieve a common approach, for example against the death penalty or torture.
A unified stance is also desirable in the international arena.
Certain countries such as China, Russia and Iran appear to be making little effort to tackle the grave human rights violations occurring on their territory.
The EU must present a strong and united front in its dealings with these countries, and that is only possible with a common human rights policy for the EU.
