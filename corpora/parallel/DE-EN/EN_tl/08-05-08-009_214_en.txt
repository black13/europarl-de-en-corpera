in writing. - It is bizarre that the European Union is proposing to declare a 'European Year of Non-Violence' while the EU itself is deploying missions in Chad, where French interests make it impossible to achieve the requisite impartiality.
When it comes to the CIA's secret prisons and rendition flights, too, just how non-violent and respectful of human rights was the EU's action then?
To say nothing of the fact that accession negotiations are in progress with a country which tramples minority rights under foot, treats the female section of its population as second-class citizens, and cheerfully follows the US example and, with the US's blessing, embarks on a war of aggression against its neighbour.
To say nothing, too, of the flouting of democratic rights - notably by disregarding the outcomes of referenda - and the sacrifice of more and more fundamental rights on the pretext of combating terrorism.
If the EU is genuine and serious in its intention to champion human rights, then it must shed light on all the still unanswered questions regarding the US's torture prisons and the CIA's 'extraordinary rendition' programme, and immediately halt its negotiations with Turkey, for a key element of the EU's human rights policy must also be to uphold democracy and democratic values at home.
