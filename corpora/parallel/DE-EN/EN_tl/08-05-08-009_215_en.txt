in writing. - The reasons why I did not vote for the motion for a resolution on the human rights report are as follows:
1.
The report contains a number of points which are worthy of support.
However, it completely ignores the absence of social and economic rights in much of the world, as a result of which millions of people are dying of hunger or lack housing and employment.
The report reduces human rights to civil rights alone, and thus neglects the principle of the indivisibility of human rights, as enshrined in the UN Charter;
2.
The report does not deal with the human rights violations perpetrated or endorsed by EU Member States.
However, in order to avoid any accusations of hypocrisy, the EU must investigate and shed light on the human rights violations committed with the participation or compliance of EU Member States in third countries or against third-country nationals; these include, for example, the accusations of torture levelled against troops engaged in the EU's Operation Artemis in Congo;
3.
War is still the worst of all human rights violations, but is completely ignored in the report.
However, with the Lisbon Treaty and the announcements made in connection with France's assumption of the Council Presidency in the second half of 2008, there is a real concern that the EU will be involved in more military missions.
Human rights should not be used as a pretext for these operations.
This aspect is completely absent from the report.
