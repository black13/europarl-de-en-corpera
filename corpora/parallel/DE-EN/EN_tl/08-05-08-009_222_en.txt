in writing. - I did not vote for the human rights report, for the following reasons:
1.
Human rights are inalienable, indivisible and universally applicable.
Nonetheless, social and economic rights, and the massive violation of these rights worldwide, barely feature in the report.
The fact that millions of people are deprived of their most basic rights, the fact that - partly as a result of the EU's highly problematical policies - they have less and less food available, and that hunger, disease and a lack of decent housing are their cruel reality, that many people have no access to education, and that workers' rights are being trampled under foot: all this is largely ignored.
2.
The report fails to make any mention of the human rights violations that are occurring in the EU itself and in which the EU is involved around the world, partly as a result of its military and armaments policy and its ever-expanding military missions.
Only the human rights violations taking place outside the EU are criticised; the EU's own omissions and responsibilities are ignored.
The internal and external effects of the EU's neoliberal policies, with their negative consequences for human and fundamental rights, are not mentioned in the report.
3.
The report adopts a highly selective approach to the voicing of criticism, as the choice of countries selected for criticism and the scope of this criticism demonstrate.
Human rights policy cannot be based on political exigencies, however, if it is to retain any credibility.
