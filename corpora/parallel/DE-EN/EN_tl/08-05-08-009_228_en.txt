in writing. - I am in favour of strengthening the EU's election observation missions in order to provide effective support to young democracies.
In this context, I welcome the call for a European consensus on the promotion of democracy, which could boost the effectiveness of election observation missions.
Elections are an important step towards stable democracy and have great symbolic significance both for the country concerned and for the wider international community.
The EU has taken on a leading role in election observation and should now develop this role intensively.
In this context, improving post-election follow-up is especially important, in my view.
The EU must identify the key challenges arising from the conduct of the elections and respond in a unified and comprehensible manner.
It would also be sensible for the European Parliament to provide support for the newly elected parliament.
I fully endorse all these objectives, especially as my own experiences as an EU election observer in Guatemala testify to their necessity.
