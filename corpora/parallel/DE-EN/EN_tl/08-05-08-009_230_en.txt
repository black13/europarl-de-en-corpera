in writing. - This House flies the flag for democracy and sends its observers to various elections.
For the citizens of the country concerned, it is vital that these elections are conducted fairly and in a proper manner.
Our influence here also makes an important contribution to democratic progress, provided, of course, that our recommendations are genuinely taken to heart.
However, let us not delude ourselves about our own adherence to democratic standards here in the EU: not as long as someone who voices unpopular truths is written off as a right-wing radical; not as long as a Treaty which was rejected in referenda in two Member States is pushed through the parliaments in a cosmetically enhanced form; not as long as the population is allowed to vote repeatedly until the desired outcome is achieved; and certainly not while there are plans to allow Turkey's accession to the European Union against the popular will.
