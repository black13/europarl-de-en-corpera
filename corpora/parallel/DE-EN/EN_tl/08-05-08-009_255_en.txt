in writing. - I am voting in favour of the report on the establishment of a framework for the activities of interest representatives in the European institutions.
In order to safeguard the transparency of the European institutions, a structured framework for the activities of lobbyists is required.
I agree with the definition of lobbying as all areas of activity carried out with the objective of influencing the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions, and that all players falling within that definition should be considered lobbyists and treated in the same way.
