in writing. - I am voting in favour of the White Paper on Sport in order to underscore the importance of sport in the European Union and foster dialogue on this issue.
Sport is an effective means by which to promote social integration and mutual understanding at national and international level.
Sport also has an important economic dimension.
For these reasons, it is important to create a framework in which the Member States can support sports organisations and events.
As sport operates to a large extent at national level, Member States must have the possibility of self-regulation.
The White Paper underlines this point and is also an appropriate basis on which to deal with aspects of concern to all countries, such as youth development, anti-doping programmes and anti-discrimination in sport.
I also welcome the creation of a special Sports Fund to support sporting activities and facilitate people's access to sport.
