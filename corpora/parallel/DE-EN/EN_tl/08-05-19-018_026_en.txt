Mr President, once a year - in May, for some inexplicable reason - it is customary for all the committees to meet in Strasbourg.
There appears to be no logical justification for this.
As a result, we have committees meeting this evening at the same time as subjects within their sphere of responsibility are on the plenary agenda.
This is an untenable situation.
The only possible solution, really, is that the committees meet in Strasbourg in future and that we move the plenary sittings to Brussels to resolve the conflict!
Seriously, though, committees meetings here in Strasbourg cannot continue to clash with plenary sittings and group meetings to the extent that this has been happening, especially over the last two years and in spite of all the declarations that such clashes were to be avoided.
Now we even have a cooling-off period.
There is no practical reason whatsoever why committee meetings here in Strasbourg need to clash with plenary activities.
I should be grateful if you would do everything in your power to put matters right.
(Applause)
