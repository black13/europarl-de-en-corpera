on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to clarify the nature of our motion.
We are requesting a statement from the Commission not only on the situation of the Roma in Italy but on their situation there and in Europe in general.
At our group meeting today, we discussed the fact that there is a very difficult situation in Italy at the present time.
We have no wish to imply, however, that the situation is confined to Italy or that the protection of minorities and the social integration of the Roma are specifically Italian issues.
We have merely referred to Italy because that is where the problem is currently surfacing on a huge scale.
We want to know from the Commission what it has done in recent years with the substantial funds we have allocated to it to support local projects effectively with a view to avoiding the sort of scenario that we are now experiencing in Italy.
What we are requesting, then, is a general debate.
Its starting point would be the situation in Italy, but please let me stress categorically that I do not want it to focus on Italy alone.
We have many other factors to take into consideration, not just the Italian situation.
Above all, we want to know from the Commission what it has done in the past and what further action it intends to take in the future.
We would therefore be grateful if the Commission could make such a statement on Tuesday.
