Mr President, for the sake of good order, I wish to announce that we intend to move a postponement of the vote on the Grosch report, which deals with rest periods and the question of bus drivers.
There is agreement in principle between the employers' and the employees' sides, and we want to see this reflected in the Grosch report.
I only wish to forewarn the other groups that we shall be asking for this postponement of the vote.
