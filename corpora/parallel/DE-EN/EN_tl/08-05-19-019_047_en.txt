Mr President, the Conference of Presidents recently decided to curb the influence of the Intergroups.
Our meetings can henceforth take place in Strasbourg on Thursdays only.
On that day, human rights experts, for example, cannot attend Intergroup meetings, because they are on the speakers' list for debates on matters of urgent importance.
Moreover, most Members set off for their constituencies on Thursday afternoons, and many have to travel for several hours before they reach home.
While I fully understand the need to devote sufficient time to legislative work, the Intergroups are indispensable.
We have voluntarily joined forces to examine issues that there is not enough time to deal with in committee, such as Tibet, the family and child protection, the Fourth World, the Baltic region or animal welfare.
We are visible, we are audible, and we are responsible for many of the initiatives that emanate from the European Parliament.
Now these most active of MEPs are being singled out, muzzled, stopped in their tracks and presented with a fait accompli in the form of a decision that they must no longer meet on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.
Please ensure, Mr President, that this unwise decision is reversed.
