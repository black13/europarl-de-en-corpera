on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the group of the Greens/ European Free Alliance warmly welcome Mrs Van Lancker's report because it would be fatal if the Council were to announce full-bodied reforms in employment policy guidelines for 2008 and then say: actually, we don't want a reform!
Commissioner, you are absolutely right when you say that reform fatigue seems to have occurred at the Commission and also particularly in the Council.
The Van Lancker report, however, clearly sets the right priorities.
I should particularly like to emphasise the setting of new priorities in social integration.
It is vital that the message goes out from here that we cannot forget the people outside and that they are important to us.
Secondly, we Greens have made a considerable contribution to ensuring that this Parliament report has a substantial gender mainstreaming dimension - consistently - and that family policy is not completely sold out as gender mainstreaming policy.
Gender mainstreaming is broader and concerns women - not men and women, as is the case in family policy.
We Greens, however, will continue to take a discerning look at the flexicurity sector until social protection is guaranteed.
I should once again like to point out that we need reform and not stalemate.
