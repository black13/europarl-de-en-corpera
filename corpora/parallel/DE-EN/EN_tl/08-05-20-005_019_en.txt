Mr President, Commissioner, while we are pleased about the 6.5 million new jobs that have been created in the last two years, we should not remain silent about the fact that 4 out of 10 employees have in the meantime been living in precarious employment relationships.
In many countries temporary employment agencies are rising in rank to become the largest employers.
Increasing globalisation and the relocation of production to countries with lower wages brings massive job losses.
Temporary jobs can only partly compensate for this.
Meanwhile, 78 million Europeans have to live on the poverty line with temporary work, 1-euro jobs and mini-jobs.
You cannot, however, feed a family on a McJob.
Even the erstwhile employment guarantor, a good education, is rarely any help nowadays.
Gross wages have fallen by almost 5% within three years in Germany, for instance, whereas the cost of living has risen massively since the introduction of the euro.
While we can be pleased about a net increase in employment figures in the light of these facts, it is in my view a mockery for every individual among the millions of unemployed and anyone who, despite doing honest work, has to live in poverty.
