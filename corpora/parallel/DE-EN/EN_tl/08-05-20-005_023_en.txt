Mr President, the Commission refers to the fact that as a result of employment policies agreed with the Member States in the last two years, 6.5 million jobs have been created.
This sounds good, particularly for those who want to adapt the European Union increasingly to global competition, but it is not as good for those who have taken these jobs but for the most part can barely make a living from them.
The report on poverty published in Germany yesterday has also clearly shown that more and more employees need benefits on top of their earned income in order not to slide into poverty and that the disparity between those on high incomes and those who draw as good as no income is becoming ever larger.
It is therefore urgently necessary for the European Union's employment strategy to become much more strongly and practically involved in combating social exclusion and poverty, creating good jobs, increasing income and providing social protection for the employed.
This practical involvement, however, is not consciously forthcoming, for whatever reasons.
The European Union should ultimately be focusing its attention on the concept of good jobs, an idea that the EU's Employment Ministers were propagating even a year ago in order to move a step further forward here.
The flexicurity concept is not sufficient in this context.
