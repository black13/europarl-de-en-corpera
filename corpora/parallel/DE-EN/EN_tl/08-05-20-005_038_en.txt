Mr President, I believe that small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular play a major role in employment.
After all, two thirds of our employees work in small- and medium-sized enterprises, which generate 50% of gross national income.
Therefore, in drawing up our strategies, we should be focusing on promoting continuing vocational training in small- and medium-sized enterprises and creating new opportunities for writing off emerging costs and ensuring that higher net wages will ultimately become possible for our employees.
Ultimately, we should also create the infrastructure to enable our employees to enjoy job security.
The European Union could provide a best practice model here.
