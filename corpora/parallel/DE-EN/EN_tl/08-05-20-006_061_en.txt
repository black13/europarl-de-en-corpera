Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs in 't Veld has said it clearly and I can only point out once again: we need the framework directive in order to grant everyone the same protection against discrimination.
It is not acceptable that homosexuals or the elderly, for example, are allowed fewer human rights than people from a migrant background.
We must end this situation as a matter of real urgency.
Moreover, I can but remind you once again that Mr Barroso himself promised here - when he was canvassing for Parliament's approval of the Commission - to launch this framework directive.
As a German I have to say that I find the conduct of the German Government cynical.
There is a law in Germany that protects all attributes equally, but the government is leading a campaign here at European level against the framework directive without any plausible reasons.
In my view this is sheer populism at the expense of human rights.
