Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Lynne for her report; it comes just at the right time.
A word to all Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: wage discrimination against women has been included in the Treaty for the last 40 years, yet, nothing has essentially changed.
If you in the PPE-DE Group wish to abide by your rejection of a horizontal directive, it is very clear to me that your values and principles relate to fine words and celebrations in the European Union.
You do not want equal treatment at all!
You accept discrimination against gays and lesbians, for example.
You want this to be a political culture.
No, that will not do for me!
Equal opportunities encompass all the criteria of Article 13, and multiple discrimination ultimately has to be included, too.
Anti-discrimination policy can only be credible if it itself does not discriminate further.
There has been a flood of proceedings and actions in the European Union.
This was all propaganda aimed at avoiding certain minimum standards.
The Member States that have stopped short of this just have to make haste.
Infringement procedures have been initiated, even against my own country, Germany.
I now appeal to the Commission, to each individual Commissioner, to state clearly that they are in favour of a clear horizontal directive and putting paid to a hierarchic arrangement of human rights in the European Union.
We have to implement our EU policy in accordance with the Treaty.
Article 13 is part of the Treaty and must therefore encompass all this, as stated in the Lynne report.
