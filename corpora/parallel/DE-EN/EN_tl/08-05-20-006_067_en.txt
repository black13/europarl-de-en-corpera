Mr President, I thank Mrs Lynne for spending time on the subject of anti-discrimination and I am completely on her side up to a certain point.
However, dear Mrs Lynne, Mrs Schroedter, Mrs Gr√∂ner and Mrs in 't Veld, you mean well, but you are not doing yourselves any favours in the end if you are now calling for another directive against discrimination that goes beyond what we already have in Europe.
I say this quite deliberately and quite bluntly here as a homosexual: you are not doing the people you want to protect any favours.
There will ultimately be a far-reaching anti-discrimination regulation against the people whom you want to protect here.
How can this be?
If we extend anti-discrimination to access to goods and services and to a shifting of the burden of proof, we will create a climate of concealed discrimination.
Very few employers will be openly willing to discuss discrimination.
Job applicants who represent a potential risk, perhaps because of their passport photograph, will no longer be contacted by the employer in case of doubt.
We are not doing people any favours in the end.
We ought instead to be worrying about the fact that the anti-discrimination directive we have today is being changed and watching to see how it pans out.
If we generate a tangled mass of bureaucracy and lawsuits as well as legal uncertainty, the acceptance of anti-discrimination regulations will decline among people in the European Union.
