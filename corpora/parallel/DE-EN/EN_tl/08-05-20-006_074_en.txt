Mr President, we are all very much in agreement that every conceivable measure has to be taken against discrimination.
Therefore, the European Parliament has also repeatedly declared itself in favour of adopting a new directive.
There are already four such directives and one is virtually complete at draft stage.
This means we are covering a very broad spectrum in anti-discrimination measures.
These measures will now finally be implemented.
There are 28 infringement proceedings, which means the appeal is going out to the Member States ultimately to implement what has been decided here in this House.
I am against taking a second step immediately before the first has been taken, namely adopting another new directive with a wealth of new barriers where equality authorities are being demanded.
This again means more bureaucracy.
The fact that NGOs must by law be included in all legislation does not get us any further forward with consultation etc.
If we advocate anti-discrimination, then we have to argue in favour of implementing what is currently the law once and for all in the Member States.
