Mr President, what is effective against discrimination and supports the protection of people with disabilities?
Awareness-raising campaigns, information, action, but not the centralising of legal issues through new EU legislation.
A paper tiger instead of a comprehensive horizontal directive perhaps?
It is important to implement the four existing directives.
Only in Germany have training courses that were required as part of the general Equality Act cost over EUR 1.7 billion a year.
I think the Civil Rights Act is right.
It provides regulations for firms with 15 employees or more and a high administrative and financial cost is avoided - an SME protection clause is appropriate.
Moreover, I think it is important that our doubts, which Mrs Lynne was unfortunately still not able to dispel because she has not taken our amendments into account, are becoming clear: we cannot vote in favour of this report, which states that public money should be used to support victims of discrimination.
Mrs Lynne should have listened to us here, but unfortunately she did not do so.
