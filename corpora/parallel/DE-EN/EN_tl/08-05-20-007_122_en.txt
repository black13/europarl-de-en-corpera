rapporteur. - Madam President, this is unfortunately the problem in the end.
I hope that at least the Commissioner can understand me.
I would first like to thank all those who have taken part in the debate.
I am convinced that integrated maritime policy, as the Commission has put forward, from shipyards via ships, ports and fisheries research to tourism, can be an enormous opportunity for Europeans if they, too, take advantage of it.
Commissioner, you have heard: the Commission has Parliament's full support to proceed a little more boldly, a little more energetically.
I know about the difficulties you have with the Council, but this should not prevent you from boldly putting your own ideas into practice and promoting them.
You have approached the IMO.
It is good, of course, if the IMO has resolved upon something in terms of climate protection and reduction, but you know how laborious it also is for the Member States to sign IMO resolutions.
Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned to the coastguard.
If we both persuade our government that it should first have a coastguard itself, I hope that we shall achieve this.
The Commission incidentally still has one more job to carry out here, namely to produce a modest survey on this.
Lastly, we still know far too little about the seas.
A great deal of research and funds are therefore required from Europeans in order to learn more about the seas, and if we now bring these into being in connection with the European Maritime Day, we have done something good.
As Mrs Stihler has said: next year we hope to be able to record some progress.
(Applause)
