Mr President, I voted in favour of this report mainly for two reasons: firstly, because this report quite emphatically demands that the Member States finally implement the Lisbon Strategy and therefore measures on employment policy as well, and secondly, because it demands that good and affordable childcare arrangements finally be set up in the Member States.
This is a very important precondition for compatibility between family life and work.
This is particularly in the interest of single mothers because employment opportunities are thereby created and poverty can be combated.
These are therefore positive strategies that are needed in order to translate the appropriate employment policy measures into reality.
