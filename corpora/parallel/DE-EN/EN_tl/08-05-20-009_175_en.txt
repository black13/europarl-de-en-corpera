Mr President, we are all in agreement that every conceivable measure has to be taken against discrimination.
Therefore, we have also declared our faith in four directives.
A fifth is being prepared.
There is support for this one, too.
I have, however, voted against this report because it chooses a wrong strategy, because it does not advocate the implementation of existing laws, but instead immediately demands another new directive, which includes new authorities, new bureaucracies and new test procedures.
This means barriers are proffered instead of solutions.
All in all, this does not lead to discrimination being abolished.
My entire delegation is pursuing a different path.
My delegation would like the Member States to be asked ultimately to implement everything that already exists in current law and not, as the report suggests, taking the second step before the first.
