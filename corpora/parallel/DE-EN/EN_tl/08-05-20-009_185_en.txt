in writing. - In practice we have not always managed to smooth out all the difficulties regarding the mutual recognition of vocational training qualifications and maintain the quality of work here on the one hand, without creating unnecessary hurdles on the other hand.
In this regard it is alarming that the Services Directive granted foreign service providers a certain freedom to do whatever they want in the absence of the possibilities of effective control and unexplained sanctions, whereas domestic service providers still have to comply rigorously with the law and standards.
In a few years' time our domestic enterprises will be demanding a re-evaluation of the regulations that apply to foreign enterprises so that they do not go under in the face of merciless competition.
Undercutting competition is therefore still being encouraged in the case of wages, working conditions and social security.
Nor should the EU be encouraging this development with the 'blue card'.
We have enough skilled workers if only we are prepared to pay them a decent wage.
