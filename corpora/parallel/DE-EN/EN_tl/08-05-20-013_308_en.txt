Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cabotage sounds like a good idea.
Preventing unladen journeys also reduces emissions and, after all, the transport sector also has an obligation to finally start reducing emissions.
It is just a pity that, in the past, this regulation was frequently abused, to disregard social standards and to use dumping prices to gain market share.
The rapporteur has therefore generously chosen an approach that takes this into account.
Monitoring of everything that is decided here is crucial - and that is also my appeal to the Member States.
Otherwise, none of it will work.
I can therefore agree with this part of the package.
That is not quite the case with the report on coach transport, however, where some members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism expressed a wish to include the famous 12-day rule on driving and rest times again, and the very well organised bus lobby has been providing us with an excessive amount of information for months on end, in order to achieve this.
However, far too little effort was made to canvas the opinions of employees working in this industry.
I could not support this regulation, purely because of the amendments.
However, if an agreement between the social partners comes about - I mean between the companies and the others who are affected, because this includes people who are not part of any union, as this sector has a particularly low level of union membership - then I would like the regulation to be accepted as well.
We will just have to wait and see.
It is only fair to do so, if we recognise social partnership.
Therefore, let us postpone this part and find a better, prudent solution later, so that we do not have to renegotiate afterwards and find ourselves in a position where we may not be able to achieve anything further.
