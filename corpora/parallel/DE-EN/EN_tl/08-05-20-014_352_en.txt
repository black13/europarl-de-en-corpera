- Madam President, more than 10 million Sinti and Roma live at the margins of society within the European Union.
The Decade of Roma Inclusion, which began in 2005, has so far changed little about this.
The incidents in Italy clearly show that measures taken so far against exclusion and discrimination have had little effect and have not been implemented.
In January we called again for an integration strategy for the Roma, and today we have debated and passed the Framework Directive on Anti-discrimination.
The pogroms in the Romany areas of Italy show how urgently we need a genuine, comprehensive political solution.
We do not need confrontation.
True integration of the Roma into our society would be good evidence that the cornerstones of democracy, the rule of law and human rights form the foundation of the EU.
