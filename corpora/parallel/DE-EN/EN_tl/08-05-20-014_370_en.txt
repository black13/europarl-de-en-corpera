- Madam President, I fully understand that often it is not possible to allow everyone to speak under the 'catch the eye' procedure.
However, I do not understand why selection should then come down to allocating the right to speak to each group.
This distorts the political weightings in the European Parliament significantly.
Basically, it means that the small groupings are repeatedly given a much greater weighting.
That is a legitimate political concern, but it is not what was intended by 'catch the eye' in the Rules of Procedure.
I would also like to ask that in future, when somebody registers to speak in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, they are in fact given the opportunity to speak.
