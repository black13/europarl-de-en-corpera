- Commissioner, you know my position - that Croatia should have become a Member long ago, if justice prevailed.
However, I am not expressing my personal point of view here, but that of this House.
Parliament said that negotiations should be completed by 2009 at the latest.
At its meeting in Croatia a few weeks ago, the Joint Parliamentary Committee said that all chapters should be opened under the Slovenian Presidency and closed under the French or, at the latest, the Czech Presidency.
Does the Commission believe that this schedule is realistic and what is it doing to speed things up?
