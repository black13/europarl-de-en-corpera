draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Mr President, I too, would first like to thank Mrs Hall for her extremely ambitious efforts to achieve a timely result for this difficult report.
She did it!
The report was difficult because it had to establish rules for the special case of Europe-wide mobile satellite services before the Telecom package was revised.
It is to Parliament's credit, and most especially to the credit of its rapporteur, that we have succeeded in finding ways to make a preliminary ruling like this, which nevertheless makes a sufficient degree of transparency possible and actually links exceptional decisions to exceptional circumstances.
I am very glad about this, therefore, and can say on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education that we support the result that has been achieved, because it includes three points that are important in our committee's view: firstly, the decision respects the competence of the Member States to decide how to allocate frequencies.
Secondly, the decision is also linked to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and thirdly, this will also strengthen media pluralism and cultural diversity within these services.
All we can do now is hope - and this is our wish - that this work is also worthwhile and that there really will be pan-European mobile satellite services, as this decision leads us to expect.
