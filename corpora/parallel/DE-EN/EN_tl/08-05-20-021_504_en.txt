- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Schlyter has just said, 10 thousand tonnes is a very large amount.
Just to give you an idea of the scale, it is enough to poison approximately 4 million people a day.
About a year ago, we discussed the dossier at first reading.
Sufficient regulation of metallic mercury compounds and mercury has been arranged.
It has been ensured that this material does not return to the European Union.
Safe storage has also been sufficiently evaluated.
The actual restrictions make sense given mercury's increasing toxicity, although I would have liked to see more far-reaching restrictions in many areas.
The compromise works very well, and at this point I would like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his work.
It does not meet all expectations, but it does meet a great many of them.
As a former local and regional politician, I also have a great deal of sympathy for our Spanish Members, who have to find a solution to the Almad√©n problem that will be workable for everyone.
The compromise is so worthwhile, however, that we must not allow it to miscarry because of this issue.
There ought to be enough time before tomorrow's vote for the Commission to make an appropriate statement of some kind.
It is important to accept the compromise now, because otherwise, there is a risk that we will not reach agreement in this parliamentary term.
I would like to mention one further matter: the mercury strategy is not yet complete.
The Commission's two panels of experts continue to rate amalgam as safe.
I cannot agree with this opinion.
