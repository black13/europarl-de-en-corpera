Many thanks, Mr Florenz, also for your kind words to the President.
It is the exception rather than the rule for such kind sentiments to be expressed.
As my role here is to be objective and neutral, I will refrain from making the point that very little praise tends to be forthcoming, especially from one's own political family.
What has happened this morning was therefore quite an event!
