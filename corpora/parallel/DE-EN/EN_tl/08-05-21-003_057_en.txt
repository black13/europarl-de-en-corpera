in writing. - I voted in favour of the report.
The debate about climate change, which is urgently required, must be underpinned by sound scientific facts.
These are provided by Mr Florenz's interim report.
This report should play an important role both in the public arena and in the Commission and the Council.
Scientific findings on the 'greenhouse effect' have been available for more than 180 years.
It was due to specific social conditions that this knowledge about the threat to our natural and climatic bases of life was ignored, preventing timely action and continuing to do so today.
Either we start acting now on the basis of international cooperation to limit further damage and avert the disasters that are predicted and which will impact with full force on the world's poorest people first, or we continue along the road to destruction.
The facts convincingly demonstrate that prompt action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is required, and that we must limit warming to less than 2Â°C through changes in our lifestyles and consumer behaviour and through the adoption of political and social criteria and frameworks.
I support the rapporteur's assertion that it is not a matter of arguing over emissions values; now, the debate must focus on sustainability.
The EU Sustainable Development Strategy must take account of these problems and finally establish policies on a sustainable basis.
This requires a change in political priorities.
Every day lost is potentially devastating and cannot be justified.
