Madam President, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her fair cooperation and very balanced report.
The report highlights the critical points being identified by the people in Turkey themselves: for example, the solution to the Kurdish problem on a consensus basis while safeguarding the rights of all ethnic groups in Turkey, the headscarf problem in Turkey, which includes respecting the interests of those who do not wish to wear the headscarf, and the issue of religious freedom which must apply to everyone in Turkey, including Alevites, Christians and the Ecumenical Patriarch of Istanbul, for example.
We are saying all this because we are friends of Turkey, and because we want to see a European Turkey within the European Union.
That is why we are expressing this criticism, as one friend to another.
The European Union can also do more.
Signals such as those sent out by Mr Sarkozy - that Turkey, regardless of what it does, will never join the European Union - certainly do not help.
