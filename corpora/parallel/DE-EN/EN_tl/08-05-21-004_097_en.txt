Madam President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has presented a sound and objective report.
She has highlighted some progress and drawn attention to many questions and unresolved problems.
The key question which has only been touched upon in passing is this: if Turkey were reformed, would it then have a right to membership?
Our current EU law offers a political alternative at the end of the negotiating process, both for the European Union and for Turkey itself.
That is why in Austria, and elsewhere, we are calling for open-ended negotiations.
Accession is one option, but it is not a foregone conclusion.
