, in writing. - Regrettably, since the start of this year, tragic and worrying reports have continued to pour in to us about cross-border incursions by the Turkish military, about deaths and injuries caused in combat in the south-east of the country and on Turkey's border with northern Iraq, and about disproportionate and brutal assaults by the security forces, especially on children and women, during this year's Kurdish Nevroz festival.
The report by the Dutch Member, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, makes some important points but is far too timid a response to the seriousness of the political situation in Turkey.
So as to avoid giving offence to the country's political leaders, it fails to demand, with the requisite clarity, the core elements of the reforms that are necessary in Turkey.
In my view, these core elements can be clearly defined:
1. civilian measures to restrict and control the influence of the military in Turkey;
2. a conclusive break with the notion that the Kurdish question can be resolved by military means, and a clear commitment to a political solution and reconciliation;
3. the unconditional repeal of Article 301 of the Penal Code and all other articles which curtail freedom of thought and freedom of opinion;
4. a declaration of a clear political commitment to the full emancipation of women.
The report should have expressed itself in less equivocal and far more resolute terms on these issues.
