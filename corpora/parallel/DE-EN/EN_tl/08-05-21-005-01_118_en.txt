Before we proceed to the vote itself, there is just one point which I would like to make.
I would ask you to listen very carefully now, and then some of the chairmen of the parliamentary groups will be given the floor.
There is an amendment which has been proposed by Mr Trakatellis, Mr Varvitsiotis, Mr Papastamkos, Mr Lambrinidis and other Members regarding one particular week in the year 2009, namely week 16, from 13 to 19 April.
This is the week directly before the Orthodox Easter.
It is not Easter itself, but the week before.
However, no proposal has been made for a part-session in this particular week, as it is the group week.
That means that this amendment is not admissible because there is no proposal for the European Parliament to meet in this particular week.
However, this does not imply a preliminary decision concerning the proposed part-session from 20 to 23 April.
