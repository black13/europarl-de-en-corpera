Mr President, I assume that this is an oral amendment.
That was not stated, but if it is an oral amendment, my Group is in favour of voting on it today.
It is also a fact that many Catholics work here on religious holidays; tomorrow is one such day, despite the strike.
That situation also arises, but I would nonetheless recommend that we vote in favour of this motion or at least put it to the vote.
Mr President, if you find that it is not admissible, the groups should try afterwards to achieve a consensus in this spirit.
