Mr President, before the vote, I would like to point out a problem which affects the vote and which may need to be discussed and resolved.
In the calendar proposed, there is a reference to the date of the elections in 2009.
We are not voting on that now, we are simply noting it.
However, because of the date of the elections, the constituent sitting of Parliament will take place in July 2009.
That being the case, Members from some countries have concerns because, if you look closely, it is clear that, if the constituent sitting takes place on 14 July 2009, some Members will not achieve the requisite five years for pension rights.
In some Member States, they do not use the legislative term but a fixed period because the legislative terms in the Member States vary in length.
I think that there are good grounds to consider and resolve this problem, either as regards the date of the election or the date of the constituent sitting.
I would therefore ask Parliament's Legal Service to look at this issue.
