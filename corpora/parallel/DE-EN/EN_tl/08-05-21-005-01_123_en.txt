Mr President, I would like to make a similar proposal.
I am astonished that the right of minorities is being deployed in such moralistic terms.
There are around seven Jewish festive days which cannot be observed because they are working days.
The same applies to 13 Protestant festive days as well.
The constituent sitting is being held on 14 July.
This is one of the most important secular holidays.
Can we work in France on 14 July as we commemorate the French Revolution?
I think that is impossible and inappropriate.
That needs to be changed as well, please!
(Applause)
