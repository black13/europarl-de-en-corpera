rapporteur. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two declarations prompt me to point out, for the benefit of those fellow Members who may not have fully understood what is going on, that these declarations form part of the compromise which we have agreed.
We asked for clarification of two or three problems which has been provided in this way.
However, the subject of the legislative procedure is of course solely the text as agreed jointly by us.
I have the letter here from the Chair of Coreper - which is currently chaired by Slovenia - which confirms that this text, if we adopt it today, will also be approved by the Council.
That means, of course, that we will have agreement at first reading which will give us the legislative success that we want to achieve.
