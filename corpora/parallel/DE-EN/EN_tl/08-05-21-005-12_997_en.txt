On the Florenz report, I should state that Amendments 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are inadmissible for this report.
However, they may be tabled when we deal with the main report.
I have received a number of e-mails on this issue.
All the services and the Legal Service have looked at this in detail and have concluded that these amendments are inadmissible for this report.
They are, however, admissible for the final report.
