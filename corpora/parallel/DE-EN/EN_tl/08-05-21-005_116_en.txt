Ladies and gentlemen, these two contributions have made it clear how pluralistic the European Union is in nature, and I think that in principle we should be grateful for that.
However, I would like to add - and I say this in all seriousness, not as a criticism but as an example of how the law of the European Union works - that if someone starts to question applicable law, we will end up in chaos.
I therefore suggest that we now proceed to the vote and respect the law of the European Union.
We all know who decides on the seat of the European Parliament, so I would ask all of you, please, to allow us to proceed calmly to the vote on the calendar of part-sessions.
Mr Stevenson, you will receive notification from the administration, as will everyone else, on the situation with regard to travel conditions tomorrow.
