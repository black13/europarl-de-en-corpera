Mr President, this was the last calendar vote in this legislative term and we have averted five attempts to challenge Strasbourg as the seat of Parliament, and as the sole seat of Parliament, through irrational amendments.
Nonetheless, may I say that we should have a comprehensive reform, because it is after all a matter of money and CO2 emissions.
May I make the point that, if we were to concentrate on the 12 plenary weeks in the year and fully utilise all five days in these weeks once more, we could then do away with the expensive and unnecessary mini-plenaries in Brussels and replace them with constituency weeks.
This would bring us closer to our citizens and give us more time for our real work.
It would also be much cheaper, we would cut our CO2 emissions, and all this could be achieved through our own decisions without an amendment of the Treaties.
As long as there is no Treaty amendment, we should use the current Treaties as rationally and efficiently as possible.
That is why I believe that we should adopt the approach that I have proposed.
