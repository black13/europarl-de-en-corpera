Mr President, first of all, may I comment on Mr Florenz's report which, in my view, has summed up the current scientific consensus very well.
Nonetheless, I voted against the report.
The climate is an important issue, and I agree that we must take action here.
However, the scientific consensus is only a provisional consensus, just as every scientific consensus of the past hundred years was short term in nature.
In every case, we move on from them.
The report before us does not offer us enough opportunities here.
What is more, the specific measures outlined are one-sided.
We must ensure that Europe does not forfeit any of its economic capacities.
Europe cannot save the world on its own.
Other countries need to be involved as a matter of urgency in addressing this global problem.
That is the only way to implement the scientific consensus.
We cannot bear this burden on our own.
Against this background, what I feel is lacking in the report is the catalogue of measures which are required to mitigate climate change.
We probably cannot stop it altogether.
That being the case, I believe that measures that will permanently alter our industrial structures cannot be adopted on the basis of what is only a provisional scientific consensus.
