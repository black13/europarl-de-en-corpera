Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report although it contains many compromise phrases.
I did so because, at the start, it contains a crucial sentence, namely that the opening of negotiations is the starting-point for a long-lasting and open-ended process.
That is the only reason why I was able to vote in favour of the report.
Let me make it quite clear that my party, the Christian Social Union, has always been, and continues to be, pro-Turkish.
We campaigned and worked hard for the Customs Union which was adopted by this House by a majority of just one vote.
It could be argued that, at the time, it was my vote.
We have supported Turkey in NATO and on a wide range of issues.
Let me also make it quite clear, however, that Turkey is not a European country, and I share Mrs Roithov√°'s view that a privileged partnership, a tailor-made special status, is the right solution.
This is the solution which will ultimately be achieved.
We should finally stop pursuing this blind alley towards supposed accession.
This accession is not going to happen, so it would be more honest and better for both sides if we could get together as soon as possible and agree to pursue another route, a route towards a partnership of equals, without common institutions but with common interests and a practical and agreed programme of cooperation.
