Mr President, although Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report contains many criticisms of Turkey, I voted against it because, in my view, full membership for Turkey cannot be the aim of the accession negotiations.
Mr Posselt has already made this point.
I believe that we should start as quickly as possible to offer Turkey this privileged partnership.
Turkey is not part of Europe nor does it perform a bridging function to the Islamic countries.
In Sudan, persecution of Christians has been taking place for years in Darfur.
Turkey has had the opportunity for many years to play a part in ending these crimes against Christians in Sudan.
However, I have yet to see Turkey make any moves in that direction.
That is why I voted against the report: because Turkey does not belong as a full member of the European Union.
