in writing. - Harmonisation of the existing rules in this field is important as a means of optimising road transport in Europe.
Moreover, a regulation is more expedient than a directive in this context.
The rules governing the occupation of a road transport operator must fulfil precisely defined criteria if we are to achieve the highest possible level of safety on our roads.
These rules must encompass both requirements and sanctions.
A key element is the monitoring and checking of data, which must be carried out with due respect for personal privacy.
It is very important that the national electronic registers containing the data should be interconnected so that data can be compared and the regulation therefore serves its intended purpose.
I am opposed to Amendments 7 and 102 which seek to water down the six-day rule.
A reintroduction of the 12-day rule, which has already been rejected, would be inconsistent with the substance of this report.
