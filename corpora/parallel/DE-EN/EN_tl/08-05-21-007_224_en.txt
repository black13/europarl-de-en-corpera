in writing. - I voted for Mathieu Grosch's report on access to the international road haulage market.
The merging of the existing Regulations and Directive 2006/94/EC will simplify and improve access to the road haulage market.
I endorse the rapporteur's view that the restrictions on cabotage must be eased and that the rules governing cabotage must be brought into line with those that apply to cross-border haulage within the internal market.
It is therefore important to define cabotage clearly in order to guarantee a uniform approach.
Although empty runs must be avoided for the sake of the environment and efficiency, and although cabotage on the homeward route from other countries should also be supported, subject to the restrictions set out in the report, it must not be forgotten that such measures also weaken the position of the railways.
