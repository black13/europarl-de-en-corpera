in writing. - I voted in favour of Britta Thomsen's report on women in science because women remain under-represented in the world of science.
The report outlines important steps towards a balance between men and women in the academic sphere.
The promotion of academic careers for women must play a key role.
Great significance is attached to the elimination of gender stereotypes.
The current tendency to assign male and female attributes to individual academic disciplines is detrimental to a fair balance between the sexes.
With the aid of new programmes and recruitment procedures, it is possible to ensure that the skills and qualifications of candidates are paramount, not their sex.
The same must apply to promotion opportunities and pay levels.
A non-binding target quota of at least 40% women and at least 40% men on selection panels is one way of ironing out imbalances between the sexes in academic occupations, but applicants' skills and qualifications must always be paramount.
