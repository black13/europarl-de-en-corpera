in writing. - Climate change is a serious issue and presents mankind with a formidable challenge.
The extent to which it is the result of human activity, however, is completely unclear.
The latest scientific findings certainly cannot yet be regarded as hard and fast evidence and are still in a state of flux; they are not the be-all and end-all.
Besides, the report refers to some alleged facts which are actually fallacies.
Assumptions and false assertions, however, cannot serve as a basis for the development of any rational, effective, affordable and socially acceptable measures.
This is why I voted against the report.
