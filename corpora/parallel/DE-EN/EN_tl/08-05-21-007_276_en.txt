in writing. - I voted against this report in the final vote because I take the struggle against climate change seriously and cannot subscribe to dogmatic and apocalyptic formulations that would spread alarm among the people of Europe.
The report presents scientific findings with a 60-70 % probability as proven facts.
If I were one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in John's Book of Revelation, I would rather be sitting on the white horse than on the pale one.
Climate change is a sensitive issue that cannot be reduced to slogans.
