in writing. - I voted in favour of the report on Turkey's progress towards EU membership in 2007.
I must express my dismay, however, at reading in the German newspaper Die Welt that Turkey, which likes to be portrayed as a moderate Islamic country, has enacted a law prohibiting the purchase and public serving of wine in glasses.
Wine is a European cultural asset which is legally manufactured in most Member States of the EU and which can be sold and consumed in all Member States.
Such a law is incompatible with full membership of the EU.
All legally manufactured products - and that includes wine - are goods, the free movement of which within the internal market must be guaranteed.
Such a ban also infringes the anti-discrimination rules of the EU.
A country that restricts the free movement of any legally manufactured good from other Member States cannot be a full member of the EU.
The Prime Minister, Mr ErdoÄŸan, pledged that 2008 would be the year of reform, designed to make Turkey a modern democracy based on a secular state and a pluralist society.
In view of the Turkish ban on the sale and consumption of wine in glasses, I have to ask whether this pledge amounts to 'words, idle words'.
