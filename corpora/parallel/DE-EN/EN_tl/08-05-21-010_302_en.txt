on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner has provided us with a persuasive and graphic portrayal of the way in which the ruling military government in Burma is cynically and brutally betraying its own people.
I wish to address myself here to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the ASEAN Member Countries.
For many years, the European Parliament has maintained friendly relations with the parliamentarians of the ASEAN countries.
Not too long ago, those countries signed a new ASEAN Charter in which they explicitly affirm their adherence to the principle of respecting and protecting human rights.
It goes without saying that ASEAN bears some responsibility for Burma, which is one of its Member Countries, and that the global reputation of the ASEAN countries will suffer if it continues to let the Burmese military junta act as it is acting at the moment.
I appeal to the Member Countries of ASEAN, in their own best interests and for the sake of their good and friendly relations with the European Union, to do whatever they can to persuade the Burmese military junta that it must let the outside world help its country's population.
As I have indicated, this lies within the power and responsibility of the ASEAN countries.
They will be asked how they are exercising this responsibility, and whether or not they use their scope for action in this matter will influence our relations with ASEAN.
They need not act by means of public appeals - there are other ways - but the European Union expects that Burma's neighbours in particular will do whatever they can to change the attitude of its ruling regime.
