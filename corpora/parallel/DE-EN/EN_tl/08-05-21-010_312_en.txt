Madam President, the scale of the crisis in Burma is horrific: 100 000 deaths, 200 000 people missing and more than two million homeless in a country of 54 million inhabitants.
The Irrawaddy Delta is Burma's largest rice-producing region and plays a key role in food production.
The tidal wave swept inland for 22 miles, flooding fields and leaving many of them heavily salinated.
In other words, the present humanitarian disaster is set to be compounded in the medium term by a food production crisis in the Irrawaddy Delta.
The people of Burma urgently need immediate as well as long-term help from the international community.
That help, unfortunately, must be forced through against the will of the generals, come what may.
A government blocking emergency aid is a scandal without precedent in the history of international relations.
The victims of the cyclone are being held hostage by a paranoid and murderous band of soldiers that has ruled Burma for several decades.
Last September the popular pro-democracy movement led by Buddhist monks was brutally crushed.
Thousands were killed or abducted, and now tens of thousands are dying because the government is not letting aid through.
Its refusal to accept aid for the people is killing them.
This murderous regime belongs at the very top of the United Nations' blacklist, and the members of the junta belong in the dock at the International Criminal Court.
