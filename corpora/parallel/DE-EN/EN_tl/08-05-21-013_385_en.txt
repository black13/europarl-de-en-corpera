I would like to ask a question about a different type of discrimination.
In July, your country, Slovenia, is planning to introduce motorway toll stickers and intends to issue two variants: a yearly and a half-yearly sticker.
This amounts to discrimination against tens of millions of EU residents travelling to the Mediterranean for their summer holidays.
What proposal does the Presidency intend to make to the Slovenian Government to resolve this problem?
