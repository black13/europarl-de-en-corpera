Mr President, it baffles me how the Council can simply leave without batting an eyelid.
I have been a Member of this House for a long time.
Question Time with the Council used to begin at 9 p.m., and the Council was with us until half past ten.
Then the Council asked that Question Time be brought forward to 6 or 7 p.m., and we deferred to its wishes.
That was our first mistake.
Since then, Question Time has always started late, and the representatives of the Council have had to leave on the stroke of seven, regular as clockwork.
It is not the fault of the Slovenian Presidency; it is a general problem that we must discuss with the Council.
For half of the year, the representatives of the Council can surely stay until Thursday in this beautiful city of Strasbourg and be available to us on Wednesday evenings too.
