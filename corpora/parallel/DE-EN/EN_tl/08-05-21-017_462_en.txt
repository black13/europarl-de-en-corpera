on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sacconi, ladies and gentlemen, my Group supports the motion for a resolution.
At the same time, I would like to thank Mr Sacconi for his work.
REACH, as you have just said, is intended to be the world's best, most dynamic and most advanced chemicals legislation; that is precisely how we envisage it in our Lisbon Process.
That is why it is also important now that implementation should proceed with the same dynamism and at the same pace.
We can also help to eliminate a great deal of red tape by streamlining structures and speeding up procedures.
It is the wish of all parties that animal experiments remain a last resort and that the number of animal experiments be sharply reduced.
Vertebrates and primates enjoy special protection.
It is imperative that the validation of alternative and non-animal tests be speeded up and simplified.
In order to save time, there must be scope for decisions on individual cases, for example.
Accordingly, implementation must involve the pre-selection of test methods, ranked by quality; in other words, the method that seems to have the greatest likelihood of success would be validated first.
It is important that phase-in periods be shortened and that the number of stages in the phase-in process be reduced, that Directors-General be involved in the decision-making process, that our agencies be more closely interlinked, that procedures be transparent and that information, including information to Parliament, be imparted without delay.
I am very hopeful at the present time, partly because of the content of the letter you wrote to us, Mr Verheugen, along with Commissioners Dimas and Potoƒçnik, that we can make rapid progress in this matter and that REACH really will prove in practice to be the world's most dynamic chemicals legislation.
