Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, besides implementing the Lisbon Agenda, one of our objectives is, of course, to live long and healthy lives, which means having a healthy diet.
To this end we need healthy animals so that we all have the necessary basis for a long and healthy life.
For this reason, I believe it is very important that we reflect on how we can establish new principles for the food industry which quite simply guarantee food safety, prioritise sustainable production and ensure consumer-friendly prices.
Europe, as we know, has benefited greatly from international trade.
The average family in Europe saves EUR 5 000 a year because of international trade.
We should certainly take that benefit into account.
