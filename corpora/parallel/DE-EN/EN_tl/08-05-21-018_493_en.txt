in writing. - I very warmly welcome the initiative of the European Parliament to deliver a detailed opinion on the Commission's Animal Health Strategy for the period from 2007 to 2013.
Clear expectations are important in the context of both human and animal health.
The motto of the Animal Health Strategy is 'Prevention is better than cure', and preventive inoculation is the best contribution to animal welfare.
For this reason we strongly urge that sufficient provision be made in future for protective vaccination and for adequate inspections when outbreaks of disease occur.
In order to guarantee the prevention of animal diseases, care must be taken to ensure that research, science and innovation receive support and that new findings are disseminated.
The Animal Health Strategy must extend to all animals in the EU.
For this reason, we need a common legal framework that is less complex, clearer and more transparent than the existing legislation.
Lastly, biosecurity is an important subject in the context of the Animal Health Strategy; the need for biosecurity begins at the external borders of the EU and concerns all stakeholders.
The risk of spreading pathogens by importing or bringing animals from other countries into the European Union must be minimised.
Importers, holidaymakers and consumers must all be aware of their responsibility in this respect.
The EU has the important task of conducting the requisite inspections so as to ensure that the risk to animal health, and hence to human health as well, is kept as low as possible.
