on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by commending the European Training Foundation in Turin for the valuable work it has been performing since 1994.
The work of the agencies and foundations is often regarded as nothing more than a cost factor.
I firmly believe that what our Foundation in Turin is doing constitutes very useful neighbourhood aid, whether it be in the Balkans, in Eastern Europe or in North Africa.
The practical assistance that the ETF gives our partner countries in the development and creation of high-quality training systems can scarcely be prized highly enough.
May I therefore express my thanks and appreciation to its senior management.
I must address some frank words of criticism to the Council, whose negotiating tactics, following the achievement of consensus in the first round, involved topping up the Council representation to 27 and then initially failing to understand why we in Parliament also wished to be represented on the Board and then, finally, agreeing to three specialised representatives, but as non-voting members.
The Council's attitude was simply incomprehensible.
I can only repeat that the uptight, defensive attitude of the Council Presidency is beyond me.
It is further proof of the difficulties encountered by the governments of our Member States when it comes to gauging the importance they should attach to the European Parliament, the only democratically elected institution of the Union.
My thanks go the rapporteur.
