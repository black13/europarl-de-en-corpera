Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are discussing today is particularly important, because it concerns a special responsibility of the European Union.
We in Europe are in no doubt that our small and medium-sized enterprises represent a highly successful structural model, and we must ensure that per capita GDP can grow on the basis of that model in the least developed countries.
Great importance attaches in this context to the concept of helping people to help themselves.
We must also see to it that our energy-efficiency and food-security strategies are at the heart of these efforts.
Those countries need income from employment, and small enterprises and family businesses can help to provide that, and they need purchasing power for consumers.
I believe this chicken-and-egg principle simply has to be pursued to a successful conclusion.
