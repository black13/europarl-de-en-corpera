author. - Madam President, Commissioner, the use of force against non-governmental organisations, opposition activists and independent journalists in Minsk and other Belarusian cities at the end of March represents a drastic deterioration of the political situation in a country that is already in the grip of an authoritarian and dictatorial regime.
The only German political foundation that had been allowed to function in Minsk has had to close.
Newspaper offices are raided to intimidate critical voices in the press.
Free elections and freedom of assembly and expression are being severely restricted.
Opposition politicians are being systematically prosecuted and given lengthy prison sentences.
The authorities are taking repressive measures against movements within civil society, either by invoking obscure laws on NGOs or anti-extremist legislation or by using force to break up peaceful gatherings.
We, too, must move to promote the culture of political pluralism in Belarus.
Encounters with democratic structures, especially for young people, are particularly important for the future of the country.
The reopening of the European Humanities University in Vilnius, a Belarusian university-in-exile that offers a place of refuge for students who are victims of political persecution, was a wise move.
The next step must be visa facilitation, for which this House has called on several occasions.
It is not right that the EU should further restrict people's freedom of movement by charging a fee of EUR 60 to issue a visa.
That is almost a third of a monthly income in Belarus and is therefore unaffordable for many people.
What we have managed with Ukraine, Moldova and Russia we should also be able to do with Belarus.
(Applause)
