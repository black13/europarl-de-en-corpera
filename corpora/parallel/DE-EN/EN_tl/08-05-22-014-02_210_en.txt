Madam President, I believe this is already the ninth time we have dealt with Belarus, and we shall have to keep doing so until Members representing Belarus are sitting with us here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
We urgently need three crucial advances.
Firstly, we strongly urge the Government of Belarus to release its political prisoners at long last - not only the political prisoners who have already being detained for some time, like Mr Kazulin, but also the many new ones who have recently been jailed for exercising elementary fundamental rights such as freedom to practise their profession as journalists, freedom of expression or the right to demonstrate.
Secondly, we call for amendment of the Religion Act and for absolute freedom of religion.
There are European Christians who are being repressed here in the heart of Europe, and we in the European Parliament cannot tolerate that.
We must therefore resist this with all our might.
Thirdly, there is an urgent need for us to ensure that Belarus finally opens up to us as Members of the European Parliament and European citizens, that the wall of isolation is breached with which the Belarusian regime has systematically enclosed its people, that we can be present there and discuss matters and that we can help to foster something like a Belarusian Spring, 40 years after the Prague Spring.
