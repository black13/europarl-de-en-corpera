Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, I believe that the debate has shown very clearly that the European Union can truly be a political union only under certain conditions.
Firstly, only if the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified and, secondly, only if there is an actual European Security and Defence Policy worthy of the name, that is, when it develops into something better.
Then the European Union will have the opportunity to move from being a global payer towards becoming a global player.
There is no doubt that our initial efforts in Chad were not our finest hour, but it is a case study from which we as the European Union have been able to learn because, quite simply, the shortcomings became very obvious.
This showed once again that the European Security and Defence Policy requires compatible systems and new and rapid mechanisms for making troops available.
The time for debate is over; now is the time for us to act!
