Mr President, a fundamentally positive relationship with the United States does not preclude differences in interests and opinions.
I believe that a partnership on equal terms is possible only on such a basis.
Only in this way can we also convincingly counteract anti-Americanism.
For this reason we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of a direct dialogue on security policy with the United States on those issues in which the European Union has jurisdiction.
I would put forward two examples of this: the credibility of Western values when combating terrorism and the subject of stabilisation and reconstruction.
For precisely these reasons we are against the EU's open or hidden links to the US National Security Strategy, as we see them in one of the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to the report on security strategy, on which we shall be voting tomorrow, because it is perfectly clear that no President of the United States will ever accept that a third party, whether or not it is the EU, becomes a cosignatory to this National Security Strategy.
Why should we therefore tie ourselves to this same thing with a blank cheque?
This is not equal terms and we are therefore against positions such as these.
