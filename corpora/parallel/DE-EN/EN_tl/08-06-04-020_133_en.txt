Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to address two issues briefly.
First of all, cooperation on security issues, which Mrs in 't Veld has outlined very succinctly and which concerns how we find the right balance between the security requirements of our American friends and the demand that we ourselves are making on individual freedom and the individual rights of our citizens.
I should like to say quite clearly to you, Mrs in 't Veld, that the Commission fully shares your concerns and I shall, of course, be informing the relevant colleague of the criticism you have expressed on the lack of transparency in the process and asking him to ensure greater transparency.
We shall be talking to the Americans before we can accept anything regarding the principles that must lead us to cooperate on these issues.
If there is no understanding on these principles, there can hardly be any understanding on individual issues.
This is, of course, one of the subjects to be addressed at next week's meeting in Ljubljana.
It gives me no pleasure to say anything more here about poultry, but the subject has been addressed by several speakers here.
It is always good to know what we are actually talking about.
It is therefore also important to know that we are not talking about a food safety issue here.
For many years now the competent European Food Safety Authority has been explaining that there is not the slightest risk to consumer health from imported American poultry.
We are not talking about a veterinary problem; we are talking about an issue of pure trade policy, which must be dealt with from the point of view: what are our interests and how do we best defend our interests?
I think I have said what I needed to say to you.
Nor are there any differing opinions in the Commission.
The Commission has from the outset been explaining - as I must say - how not to allow this somewhat bizarre dispute to become a burden and how to rid ourselves of the problem.
