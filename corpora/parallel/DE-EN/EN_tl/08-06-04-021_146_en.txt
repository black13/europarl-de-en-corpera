There is still discrimination against gays and lesbians on a massive scale.
In recent years, the German Green politician Volker Beck has been beaten and arrested at rallies.
It cannot be emphasised often enough how badly organised civil society is in Russia.
At the end of June a new EU-Russia Agreement is finally to be negotiated in Siberia.
We owe it to the people of Russia and of other autocratic regimes not to allow the issue of energy security to overshadow all other sectors.
Human rights and basic democratic freedoms must form the basis of this new agreement.
