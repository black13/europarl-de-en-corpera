on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the system under debate here serves to combat poverty and backwardness.
Three points seem to me to be important here.
First, since this is now the continuation: there should be flexibility both on entering the system and on leaving it, if parameters were to be changed in one state.
In other words: must a state that was once a beneficiary always remain a beneficiary?
This does not appear to be the case to me.
We should not forget that the EU also has a duty to its own citizens, workers and consumers.
There must be a reciprocal advantage; it should not always be one-sided.
Secondly, we welcome the fact that the European Parliament is to be informed during the next term.
We would also like an assessment of this system, however.
This assessment should provide a comparison with other preferential measures such as the EPA, for example.
We would realistically state that statistically, a gap is continually opening up between rich and poor, despite the EU's diverse measures and despite the measures of the Member States.
Are our certainly well-intentioned efforts still leading to the right results?
We ought to be asking ourselves this question quite deliberately.
Thirdly, preferential measures such as, for example, the GSP system we are discussing here, should be linked to the following criteria.
We need a certain strictness here.
First, the promotion of democracy and the rule of law.
Second, the construction of a minimum framework on social and environmental standards in the beneficiary states.
We want to provide assistance with this, which is also clearly stated in the report.
We should not be backing down, however, for the sake of our own credibility.
My thanks at this point go to the rapporteur for his effective cooperation.
