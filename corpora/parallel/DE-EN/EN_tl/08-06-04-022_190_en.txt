rapporteur. - Mr President, we could say that there was major agreement in this House over the fact that the GSP+ system is a very positive one.
I would, of course, have been happy to ask the Commission or Mr Mandelson, who is not here, however, how he would in fact be pressing the Andean countries, for example, two countries that very much want to retain GSP, to conclude free-trade agreements as part of the Partnership and Association Agreements.
Ecuador and Bolivia want to retain this GSP+.
We shall then be able to get involved with it.
It will indeed get them somewhere.
The second question is whether or not we should be considering developing the GSP+ system further into a GSP++.
The challenges ahead of us are entirely new.
We have climate change, we have rising food prices.
We could perhaps consider whether to introduce new paragraphs and new assessment standards.
I am very happy, Commissioner, that you have made some very clear statements on Sri Lanka, because this was also my Committee's concern, and Mrs Mann has carried this out with determination once again.
Finally, my thanks once again to all those with whom I needed to work.
We enjoyed good cooperation.
I think that we are a small step further ahead and that this GSP+ system is very valuable and necessary as part of the European Union's trade agreement.
I also think that we do not always have to concentrate solely on free-trade agreements.
