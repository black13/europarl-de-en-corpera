A good relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries is very close to my heart and I am therefore delighted that the ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly continues to take on a more political form and quality.
In negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement and very generally in cooperation between the EU and ACP countries, subjects such as sustainable development, human rights, democracy and the creation of functioning constitutional systems must all definitely be on the agenda.
On no account should we disregard environmental protection and specifically the fight against climate change.
Even in the regions of the ACP countries, the effects of climate change could turn out to be disastrous.
The EU must set a good example here and meet the aims and obligations of 2007.
Only then can we expect this from the ACP countries as well.
Another subject we definitely have to deal with is water.
Water shortage and drought are a major problem in the ACP countries, for which solutions have to be found so that there is no environmentally induced migration.
