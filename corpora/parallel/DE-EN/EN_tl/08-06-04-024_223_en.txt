rapporteur. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to reiterate the thanks I expressed at the outset to all those involved, and to ask the Commission to include Parliament's proposals in full in its legislative deliberations.
The second point is a tip.
I should like to point out to my fellow Members that the report on consumer education - we have spoken a great deal about this today - in the financial services sector is being debated in the House and will be discussed in plenary in the autumn.
Another point is that we should not forget that the different tax systems of the Member States are a major obstacle to the provision of cross-border financial services and that this also creates low interoperability, particularly where financial products are promoted for tax purposes.
I also wish to appeal to the industry and the banks to carry out self-regulation in order to do the preliminary work for the objective of this Green Paper.
On the issue of standardisation and product diversity, we also have to say yes to standardisation as long as it does not jeopardise product diversity.
As regards bank charges, which Mrs Roithov√° has addressed, the Commission has already referred to SEPA.
However, we also have many other obstacles, namely the obstacle that rights earned in one country often cannot be transferred to another country and the obstacle that an account can be opened if the domicile is given.
Then there is the missing definition of e-commerce: cross-border money transfers are working, but there are barriers when opening an account and to other rights, which we must remove.
We have enough work to do to get proposals onto the table.
We should be seeing results and continuing to work consistently.
