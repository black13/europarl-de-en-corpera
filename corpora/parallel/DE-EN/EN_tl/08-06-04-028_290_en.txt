on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, a few days before the European Football Championship gets under way, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - and I hope the entire European Parliament - is showing forced prostitution the red card once again.
Up to 800 000 women throughout the world become victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation every year.
This is one of the worst human rights violations today and even at major sporting events, quick sex around the venues of football matches is also linked to this modern-day slavery.
Two years ago at the football World Cup in Germany, we initiated a wide-ranging debate here in Parliament and launched a campaign to ensure that the huge wave of forced prostitution the experts initially feared and the corresponding negative spin-offs were able to be prevented thanks to the support of the fans through the opinioned public.
However, the subject then disappeared from sight again.
We have introduced legal initiatives and, with the experience we have gained from the German campaign, supported very extensively by the women's organisations, have managed to set up victim protection measures and demonstrate the plight of the women who usually come from Central and Eastern Europe.
They are in dire straits as criminals on the one hand, since they do not have any residence permits, but as victims, on the other hand, because they are mercilessly exploited by the human traffickers.
We have moved on a step further with the victim protection measures, cross-border cooperation and the legitimate issuing of residence permits.
We now want to use the public at matches in Austria and Switzerland to highlight the subject again.
In Germany the Socialist Minister of Justice has announced draconian penalties for punters of forced prostitution.
There are still, however, many loopholes, and Parliament has to ensure that these loopholes are closed.
I would ask the Commission to support us in this.
