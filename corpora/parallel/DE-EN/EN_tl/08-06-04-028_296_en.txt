Madam President, many are delighted about the European Football Championship in June 2008.
We should not forget, however, that aside from the matches, human trafficking, forced prostitution of women and child abuse are on the increase and the crimes committed by traffickers transcend all borders.
The matches will take place in Austria and Switzerland and the role of neighbouring Central European countries as transit countries is being strengthened for this extremely lucrative criminal trade.
The EU is being asked here for preventive measures, cross-border monitoring and law enforcement to be better organised and coordinated.
The European mechanisms for joint investigation must be improved.
Every Member State is being asked to protect victims more effectively and to actively make use of these instruments.
This is the only way that we will be able to catch the perpetrators out and show them the red card.
