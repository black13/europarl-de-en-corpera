Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said about the French President's idea to equip and arm the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with a nuclear capability for civilian but also military use within the framework of the Mediterranean Union.
Let me quote Asterix the Gaul here: 'They must be crazy, the French!'
However, I am now even more concerned about this development, given that these plans have been taken up and are fervently supported by the European Commission as well.
Around two weeks ago, a meeting took place between Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Commission.
Mr Barroso was in attendance.
An agreement was signed between the IAEA and Euratom, or the Commission, which aims to drive forward the proliferation of nuclear energy.
There is apparently a desire to equip the same developing countries that Mr Sarkozy has his eye on, and put them on track and support them in all manner of ways so that they can deploy nuclear energy.
This raises a great many questions, in my view.
First of all, Commissioner, you were originally supposed to be a co-signatory of this agreement.
I have the relevant draft agreement available to me.
Why did you distance yourself from it?
Could this be because there is actually no basis for this agreement in the Treaties?
Secondly, what is Mr Solana's position on the signing of this type of agreement?
I cannot imagine that from a security perspective, and especially in view of the difficult situation with Iran, this agreement could possibly gain Europe's backing.
Since this all appears to have taken place in secret, I would be very pleased to receive an explanation from the Commissioner, particularly as she comes from a country, namely Austria, which has a highly critical stance towards nuclear matters.
