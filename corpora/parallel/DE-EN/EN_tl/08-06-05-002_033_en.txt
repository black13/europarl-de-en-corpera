Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate President Sarkozy for once, albeit reluctantly, at this juncture.
With the rumpus that he has created over EU-Mediterranean relations, he has actually managed to give the Barcelona Process, which has existed since 1995, the higher profile and visibility that it deserves, and has unleashed a new debate about our neighbouring region to the South.
Looking at the outcomes, however, it is clear that Mr Sarkozy's original idea, launched in February 2007, has failed on three counts.
Firstly, a possible alternative to EU accession for Turkey was effectively banished by Spain and Italy with the declaration adopted in Rome in December 2007.
Then Chancellor Merkel ensured that EU-Mediterranean relations would be developed further within the existing EU structures.
Finally, the Commission has now applied the brakes to Mr Sarkozy's ambitious plans for the secretariat and leadership structure of the project.
It is apparent, in other words, that go-it-alone approaches by Mr Sarkozy will not be tolerated in the European Union.
