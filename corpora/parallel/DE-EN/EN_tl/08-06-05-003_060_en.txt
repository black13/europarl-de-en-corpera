Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, food and hygiene go together; there is absolutely no doubt about that.
Everyone has at some time in their lives eaten something that was 'off'.
On the other hand, over-caution and excessively stringent regulation do not give us a cornucopia of foods which meet exemplary hygiene standards.
A small producer is more likely to close down his shop because he cannot afford to pay the additional workers required to fill in forms rather than bake bread.
My host, who serves the bread rolls, does not have to keep a record of whether he has wiped the counter and washed the dishes.
After all, if he failed to take these basic precautions, he would have no customers anyway.
What is happening is that responsible legislation is sliding into regulatory zeal that does more harm than good.
That is why I am completely in favour of easing the administrative burden on companies, especially micro-enterprises, which find it more difficult to cope with this burden than the major corporations.
I would like to see this greater awareness of the impacts on micro-enterprises being carried over into other areas of legislation that we discuss in this House as well, especially environmental and consumer protection.
