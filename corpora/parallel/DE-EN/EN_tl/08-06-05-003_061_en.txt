Mr President, we have opted for a system in which every enterprise which produces, processes or sells food must continuously and consistently monitor and document every step in its operations.
While we are sitting here debating whether food hygiene is guaranteed, however, consumer confidence is being undermined by BSE and scandals involving rotten meat, adulterated olive oil, and wine containing glycerine.
The fact that more and more GM foods are coming into the EU, even though these are rejected by 70% of the European population, also does very little to boost people's confidence.
That is why we must give very careful thought to today's decision, and we must ensure that the health of our citizens is not sacrificed through our kowtowing to the food corporations in advance of the EU-US Summit.
We cannot demand compliance with more stringent provisions from our own producers while allowing imports of foods which are not produced in accordance with the same rigorous standards, given that this after all offers advantages in terms of price and competitiveness.
At some point, domestic producers will start demanding exemptions as well, and they would be quite justified in doing so.
