Mr President, Commissioner, we are not talking about whether we want more hygiene or less hygiene.
We are talking about easing burdens and cutting red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The question which we need to address once again, then, is this: is HACCP appropriate and necessary in every case and in every company, large or small, and regardless of who is responsible?
In the case of companies which are engaged predominantly in the direct sale of food to the final consumer - such as bakeries, butchers, food stores and market stalls, and indeed, farmers' coffee shops, wine bars and the seasonal wine taverns run by the vineyards, where the owner or manager is known to the customer and is generally available in person - we must undoubtedly apply different criteria from those applicable to a major corporation.
This is about the dismantling of bureaucracy and it is about accountability.
I think we should certainly harness the principle of subsidiarity here, but not by demanding the opportunity to introduce significantly different requirements in individual Member States.
We must have a level playing field in terms of competition.
I therefore support the Commission's proposal and Mr Schnellhardt's report.
