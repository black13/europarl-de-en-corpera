Mr President, I wish to point out that I abstained in the vote on this report, but not because I disagree with the view that young farmers need support.
I strongly believe that they do indeed require support, for young farmers undoubtedly face greater problems than many other farmers.
The reason why I abstained had to do with the vote on paragraph 4, which makes reference to the situation of young farmers in the so-called new Member States.
In my view, now that almost an entire legislative term has elapsed, it is surely time to drop the reference to the so-called 'new' Member States and treat them as full Member States of equal value, for in my opinion, they are now well-established as such.
