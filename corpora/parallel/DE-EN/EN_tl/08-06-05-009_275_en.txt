in writing.- What questions do young people nowadays ask themselves when deciding on a career?
Do they ask about the nature of the occupation, the prospects it offers for the future, or making a fast buck?
The answer to all these questions is often negative when farming is one of the options.
Only 7% of farmers are under the age of 35, with the result that this occupation is an alarming state of decline.
There are many young people who would enjoy farming: working in the open air and close to nature, surrounded by plants and animals.
That is a given.
So what deters young people?
Is it the lack of prospects, or the general insecurity surrounding the profession?
Once, inheriting the family farm provided a very good and very secure living, but today, the heirs are often at a disadvantage due to the many burdens and conditions imposed on them.
We know that only well-trained and highly motivated farmers can guarantee our high standards of healthy food and a healthy natural environment here in Europe.
However, we must also be aware of the challenges facing young farmers today.
We must involve young farmers in political discussions and decision-making to a greater extent.
They are the bearers of Europe's hopes!
They are the ones who are facing up to the numerous economic and ecological challenges and ensuring a good and well-balanced social environment in the rural regions.
They therefore need reliable policies to support them.
