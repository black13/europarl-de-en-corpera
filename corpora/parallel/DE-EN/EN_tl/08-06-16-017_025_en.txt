on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we have just amended the title of the debate, and because of the implications - on which there are divergent views - of the decision in Ireland, it would be reasonable to give the House some time to discuss these problems.
For this reason we move that the second item on the morning agenda be moved to the afternoon.
Now I know that we shall be pushed for time in the afternoon, but in view of the urgency and the importance of this meeting of the Council, postponement makes good sense.
We would have no objection to one item or other being deferred to a later sitting, but our motion at this instant is that we devote the entire morning to the substance of the renamed debate to give us enough time to discuss the issue.
