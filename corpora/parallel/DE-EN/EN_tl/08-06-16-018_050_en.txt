Mr President, last week China demanded an end to the Tibet protests as the condition for further talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama.
According to the Chinese Foreign Minister, the Tibetans must ditch their attempts to ruin the Olympic Games.
The protesting Tibetans, however, surely cannot be expected to accept meekly the crushing of their demonstrations in March.
The Chinese Government has the opportunity to change the situation in Tibet radically.
Given an honest dialogue without prior conditions, the Tibetan people will take part in a constructive process of change.
The first priority is to send out a clear signal, not least by allowing foreign observers into the country to assess the situation for themselves.
