Mr President, I listened very attentively to the Member who spoke before Mr Szájer and attacked my colleague Magda Kósáné Kovács in a totally inappropriate manner.
Mrs Kovács is my deputy on the executive of the Socialist Group.
She is not present here, which means that she cannot defend herself against that attack.
I know that Mrs Kovács is a convinced democrat and a committed campaigner for European unity.
She certainly does not deserve to have any Member abuse the privileges of this House in order to settle some domestic score or other that may exist between them in Hungary.
I consider the remarks in question to be totally inappropriate and a grievous slur on the character of Magda Kovács, a slur which I reject with the utmost repugnance.
