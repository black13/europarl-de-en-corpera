Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal is a disappointment.
It is nothing short of a failure to meet the need for more efforts to tackle climate change and conserve resources.
We know that the European Environment Agency has predicted a 50% increase in the volume of waste by 2020.
In this respect, the fact that binding stabilisation levels or binding recycling targets have not been prescribed represents a flop, a caving-in to pressure from the Member States.
The instrument that was needed has unquestionably been watered down in response to that pressure.
It is also disappointing that waste incineration is increasingly becoming the ultima ratio at the expense of waste avoidance.
It was precisely to redress this imbalance that these recycling quotas and the stabilisation of waste volumes would have served.
I hope that, by adopting amendments, we can still make some improvements to this draft and actually do what is necessary, namely to formulate the sort of ambitious waste-management policy we need in the European Union.
