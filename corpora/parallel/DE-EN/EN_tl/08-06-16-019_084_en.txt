Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jackson, we shall be tabling a cross-party amendment that attracted majority support in this House at first reading.
It addresses the following problem: in many countries of the EU untreated, unsterilised food scraps are repeatedly fed to livestock or fly-tipped.
Time and again, this kind of behaviour poses the risk of diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease.
It is therefore essential to ensure that food waste is sterilised and safely disposed of by approved companies using suitable methods.
Member States should only be allowed to authorise its use in pig feed if it has been sterilised for 20 minutes at a temperature of 133Â°C and a pressure of 3 bar and if all other requirements of Regulation 1774/2002 have been met in full.
I firmly believe that, if Parliament adopts this amendment, the Council will incorporate this rule into the compromise.
