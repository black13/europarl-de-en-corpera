Mr President, as we know, water is the most precious of all resources, and we must not let our water drain away by choosing not to adopt an ambitious water policy.
It is very regrettable that the momentum imparted by the European Parliament at first reading to the protection of our water resources has been dissipated by the doubling of the list of hazardous substances subject to control and the obligation imposed on EU Member States to reduce their pollutant emissions.
The result is therefore a missed opportunity to do more to protect our water.
In the context of water protection, it is important to ensure consistency across the various fields of legislation.
We need a ban on carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductively toxic (CMR) pesticides and endocrine disrupters.
That is why I find it regrettable that the Commission constantly plays the role of a shunting yard at the expense of the environment and public health.
In 2006, the Commission said that, in its draft instrument on environmental quality, it did not intend to make any proposals on the reduction of the volume and toxicity of priority hazardous substances.
They should be made in REACH and in the framework of pesticides legislation.
But what actually happened?
It was a parliamentary report, our proposal from this House, that established consistency with the Water Framework Directive and with pollutants legislation.
Parliament did that, not the Commission, which had promised to do it.
Our demand, then, is that no pesticides that feature on the list of priority hazardous substances should be authorised.
The simplest solution is to ensure that these hazardous substances cannot get into our water in the first place.
