on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, since we are aware that the general public are increasingly sceptical of the European Union, it is particularly important that we celebrate such symbolic days, and this 40th anniversary of the Customs Union is, of course, a red-letter day.
As you indicated yourself, Commissioner, it is noteworthy because major steps towards integration were taken forty years ago, when the foundations were laid for the single market and for the free movement of persons, goods and services.
I believe it is important that we keep telling people, showing them clearly, how they benefit from the European Union and what we achieved back then to make it possible.
For this reason I will continue to speak in glowing terms about that event, because it was truly a good thing.
The work you mentioned that you do with China and other countries outside the European Union is also important to our economy as well as to consumers in the European Union, for we naturally want safe products and secure services that we can develop.
That is very important.
In the most recent directives we formulated for the Customs Union, we also legislated for modern technology, introducing the electronic customs system.
I believe this points the way forward.
If we manage to highlight such positive aspects of the policies of the European Union and make people clearly aware of the benefits they derive from the European Union, we shall begin to restore public confidence in the Union.
That is what we should be doing together.
May I express my sincere thanks to you, Commissioner, for the work you are doing in this context in the European Commission.
