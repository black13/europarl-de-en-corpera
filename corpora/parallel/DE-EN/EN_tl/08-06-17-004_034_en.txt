Madam President, my thanks also to the rapporteur, Mr Weber, although he might like to overlook me and particularly my colleague Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, who, together with the other rapporteurs, have pushed this difficult process forward over the last three years through rough seas and into calm waters.
At this point I would just like to be allowed to say that I find it mischievous and dishonourable for people to link the tragedy of deaths in the Mediterranean with this Directive, as, realistically, they have nothing to do with each other.
This must not be allowed!
This Directive creates legal certainty for people where there is none.
The lot in life of people currently living in undignified conditions, who do not know when they are going to be returned to their countries, and do not have access to judicial authorities, will be improved.
It sets minimum standards for 27 Member States, and for one third of the Member States, which have no standards at all, this is better than the current situation.
It is the first step towards an urgently needed common asylum policy and Europe-wide respect for human dignity.
I believe that everyone who wants to take that step with us should take that responsibility seriously and vote in favour of this report.
