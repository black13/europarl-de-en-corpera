Madam President, we have been calling for an overall plan for all aspects of migration for years, and the Returns Directive quite clearly forms part of this package.
Legal immigration into the European Union can be regulated sensibly only if we do not continue to accommodate millions of illegal immigrants and put this situation on a par with legal immigration.
When Mrs Roure points to the 'right' of illegal immigrants to escape poverty, I must remind her that there are 922 million people on the continent of Africa alone, most of whom live in poverty, and that there are 1.1 billion people in India, many of whom would like to come and join us in Europe.
That is the wrong way of regulating things.
Therefore, support this Returns Directive to open the way for us to have really good regulations for legal immigration at last so that we can truly help people.
