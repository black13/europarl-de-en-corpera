Mr President, it is a good thing that Slovakia has the opportunity to join the euro area.
You only have to imagine what it would have been like in Europe over the last year without the euro.
The currencies of the individual states would have been a target, just as in the days of Soros.
However, as Italy has shown, sometimes being bound so securely to the euro is not quite such a good thing.
If it were possible to advise Slovakia - which, of course, would have to make its own decision - then I would be giving some thought to an opt-out clause, especially because of what is now happening at European level.
We are running the risk that the EU Summit will not read the signs of the times, that it will carry on as if it is 'business as usual'.
The distance between the citizens and the European elite is growing in such a way that the entire European project is put at risk, whereas instead everyone should be working towards true democracy.
