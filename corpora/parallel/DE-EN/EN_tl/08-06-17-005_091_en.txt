Mr President, Slovakia has experienced an economic upturn and, after this very controversial debate about its fulfilment of the criteria, we will vote on whether it should join the euro area.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Casa, because in his report, he took into account the objections that were raised.
The reform process and reflections on it do not come to an end when a country joins the euro area; rather, that is when the real challenge begins.
Inflation is and will continue to be a problem in Slovakia.
Not for nothing have there already been two revaluations - most recently of 17.65% - and I say in advance that before the exchange rate is finally set, there will be a further revaluation of the Slovak koruna.
Therefore, we must all play our part to ensure that real convergence occurs.
I hope that the Council and the Ministers of Finance take Parliament's concerns seriously and that the Commission will conduct an open discussion on the process in future.
