Mr Farage, I gave you the chance to speak because you asked for it, but I have to tell you that your request has come too late.
It is the Conference of Presidents that decides whether there is a resolution.
The matter can be raised again in plenary, although that should have been done earlier.
You are now too late, so there will definitely not be a resolution.
That is the situation according to the Rules of Procedure, and we keep to the rules.
Your loudness does not make up for your arguments.
