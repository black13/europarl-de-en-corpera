in writing. - In a European Union with open borders, good cooperation between the authorities is necessary in order to be able to keep up reasonably well with the fight against crime.
The goal of a European Internet portal that citizens and businesses can go to to obtain information about their rights as a consequence of criminal proceedings seems worthwhile.
The setting up of an electronic register that simplifies the exchange of criminal records across borders can be welcomed only when data protection requirements are sufficiently incorporated.
In practice, much will depend on the management of acts that are liable to prosecution in one Member State but not in another.
In my opinion, these questions were not dealt with properly in the early stages, so I have abstained from voting.
