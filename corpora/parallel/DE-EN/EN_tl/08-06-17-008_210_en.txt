in writing. - There is a constant stream of fake banknotes of excellent quality from Eastern Europe.
After all, the European Union is, by its very nature, very attractive to counterfeiters, because the people are not particularly familiar with the new currency and even cash machines are not immune to fraud.
Improving the protection of the euro against fraud is a welcome development, which is why I, too, voted in favour of the Diaz de Mera report.
Constantly working on making the euro safer is one thing, but it achieves nothing if people still know very little about security features.
The European Central Bank and the Member States therefore need to increase their efforts in the area of education.
In addition, we must also see to it that it is possible to catch professional counterfeiters quickly anywhere in the EU.
Continual retrenchment in police services at the same time as borders are being eliminated is counterproductive, and not only in this area.
