in writing. - When it comes to water, our liquid gold, it is essential for the future that we preserve its quality and never slacken our efforts to protect it.
If, in practice, it turns out that water quality in the new Member States is lower, and that there are problems with non-Member States, we here in Parliament will have to intensify our efforts to find solutions including, in particular, putting a stop to the illegal dumping of waste and dealing with waste water.
Since intensive fertilisation in agriculture can put a strain on water, this should provide an incentive to adjust measures to promote agriculture in such a way that greater support is given to traditional, environmentally friendly growing methods, such as those used by organic farmers.
I believe that this report will lead to better monitoring of water quality, and that is why I voted in favour of it.
