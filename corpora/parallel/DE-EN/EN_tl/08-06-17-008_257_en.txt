in writing. - At the end of April, 53% of Slovaks were still against the introduction of the euro.
Their fears, such as loss of sovereignty to the European Central Bank, and price rises, should be taken seriously.
A later entry to the euro area gives the countries affected the opportunity to carry out the necessary reforms at a more leisurely pace and allows people more time to adjust.
If countries such as the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden retain independence in terms of currency policy, then we should accord this right to other countries too.
In any case, the sovereign - the people - should decide.
This decision should then be respected and not tinkered with, as happened with the Constitution, which is being discussed yet again.
In my opinion, not enough consideration was given to the will of the people here, so I have abstained.
