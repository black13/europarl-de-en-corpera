Madam President, whether you like it or not, Ireland has voted.
Now you must respect their decision.
Europe has the opportunity of the century, by which I mean that Europe must finally become democratic and efficient.
For the energy market, this means not holding back.
Get stuck in to the big tigers, the RWEs, the EDFs - get right into the thick of things, where the problem lies, unbundle and apply subsidiarity.
It is possible, it would be visionary, but it has nothing to do with the EU to date, controlled as it is by lobby interests and their centres of power.
On the other hand, if you do not change anything in this area, and if you do not take the vote in Ireland into account and pronounce the Reform Treaty dead, then the chance of the century for a democratic Europe and for a fair energy market will become a world in which extremists, on both the left and the right, call the shots.
