Madam President, in the last few minutes we have talked a lot about industry.
I am glad that Mrs De Vits addresses the rights of energy consumers very directly in her report.
Indeed, it is vital to ensure that consumers are aware of their rights and that they can also be certain that their rights will be observed.
Unlike Mrs De Vits, however, I do not believe that we need completely new laws -certainly not at European level.
It is more a matter of properly and appropriately implementing existing legislation into national law.
We therefore need strong supervisory authorities that take care of this, and we must ensure that we have sufficient transparency so that consumers really do know their rights.
The Charter can provide a meaningful supplement to this, not in the sense of becoming a binding legal document, but simply in the sense of providing a point of reference for politics and the economy by summarising consumer protection legislation relating to energy.
We all know - it is a matter of course - that our citizens can play a meaningful role in society and the economy only if they have access to appropriate provision of energy.
To that extent, it is certainly important that we ensure that everyone, even the poor and the poorest of the poor, gets what they have a right to.
However, I do not believe that it is for Brussels to prescribe social tariffs.
We should leave that to the Member States and industry in the Member States.
Otherwise we are not introducing anything more than a redistribution mechanism.
The best scenario would be to link protection of the poor with the efficiency measures that are required to achieve our climate protection goals.
Intelligent solutions such as digital counters can be very useful here.
In that respect I have nothing against encouraging the industry to introduce these within 10 years.
Then consumers will know exactly how much they are using and can plan around that and economise.
