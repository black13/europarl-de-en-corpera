Madam President, surely, given the record prices for petroleum, energy independence for Europe finally has to be a top-priority issue!
The EU must reduce its current dependency on the Gulf States.
We need to improve our relationship with other countries besides Russia without becoming excessively independent.
We will also need to consider what to do about Iran in the long term.
If a study comes to the conclusion that we are putting too much faith in the vague promises of Central Asian dictators and unconfirmed reports of petroleum stores in relation to the Nabucco pipeline project, then we will have to develop a constructive relationship with Iran which, after all, has the second-largest petroleum reserves in the world.
It must not be forgotten that the ever-increasing profits of the Gulf States, thanks to rapidly rising petroleum prices, are also used to promote Islamic fundamentalism around the world.
This is another reason why, in my opinion, we in the EU must invest more in alternative energy suppliers.
