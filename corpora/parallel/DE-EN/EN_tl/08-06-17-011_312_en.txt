Madam President, I am delighted that, in the De Vits report, we have a very good report before us and I am delighted that all our fellow Members are of one mind regarding solidarity, transparency and consumer protection.
I think this is wonderful.
However, I must say one thing: I find those on the right of the Chamber both cynical and hard to believe.
It is hard to believe them because they are not in favour of a binding charter on the rights of consumers - something that is incredibly important if citizens are to know what rights they have.
I find them cynical because everyone in this Chamber was united in backing the idea that air passengers should be aware of these rights, and air passengers are not exactly the poorest people in our society.
For the poorest, however, who really do need to be aware of their rights, this will not be provided.
Therefore, I ask you earnestly to reconsider.
Please ensure that we make this Charter obligatory.
