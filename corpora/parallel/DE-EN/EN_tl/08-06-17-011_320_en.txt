Madam President, what particularly surprises me about this debate is that even though some of our fellow Members want to prescribe in detail how competition should take place - and there are several possible ways of doing this - they are not prepared to talk about more transparency, more incentives to save energy, opportunities for energy consumers to lodge complaints or the fight against energy poverty.
These are precisely the points that I believe are crucial in the Morgan report and naturally also in the De Vits report.
This is the signal we need to give to the citizens of Europe tomorrow: we have to say that people must not be affected by the full force of price rises but that there must be opportunities to avoid them by increasing the amount of energy saved and particularly by having more transparency in order to be able to choose other energy providers.
I believe it is crucial to give citizens this freedom of choice and also to give them the opportunity to complain when malpractice occurs.
I am very thankful to Mrs Morgan for this part of the report.
