Madam President, the European Energy Agency in Paris has determined that we will experience an energy shortage in 2012.
It is therefore vital that we devote our urgent attention to creating incentives and investing more in transmission networks and production.
The present Electricity Directive provides a good incentive to also shorten the approval periods so that it does not come to a blackout in 2012.
It is also important to strengthen the national regulators so that we can accordingly push for the interests of our own industry in neighbouring countries.
It would also be good if we had a regulatory agency for nuclear matters that could make pronouncements on safety and security according to the French model.
That is something that ought to be discussed this week in the Council too.
