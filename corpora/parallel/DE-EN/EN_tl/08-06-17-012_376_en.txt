Madam President, Commissioner, at the close of your speech you indirectly mentioned eco-labelling.
The question that I also wanted to ask, indirectly, was whether we have any guarantee that not only the origin of the fish but also the production and production description will be transparent for consumers, so that consumers know where the fish come from and where they were farmed.
This is not about whether this process has biological merit, but rather about the question of origin as such.
Are there consistent regulations on this?
