Commissioner, on the same matter, I would immediately add the following: I have recently been approached by several Austrian consumer protection organisations regarding the apparent increase, particularly with regard to shellfish imported into the European Union, which also come to Austria, in the treatment of these shellfish with antibiotics and other undesirable medications for economic reasons - perhaps because it makes it easier to farm them.
These substances are then passed on to humans through the food chain.
Is the Commission taking measures designed to limit or prevent this in future?
