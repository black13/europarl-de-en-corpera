Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mobility is a fundamental right of every individual.
It is also the foundation of economic, cultural, social and ecological dynamism in a society.
However, it does not become a blessing until it minimises danger to life and health for all road users.
Better protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users has not lost anything in topicality in the last decade.
Traffic density has increased appreciably, but the number of accidents and the seriousness of injuries to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in collisions with the front section of vehicles both with and without frontal protection systems decreased over the same period, albeit not to the desired extent.
I very much welcome a regulation to extend the efforts of vehicle manufacturers to improve passive measures for pedestrian protection - for which, my particular thanks - by using active vehicle components.
Brake Assist systems are capable of resolving conflicts in connection with goals relating to energy, the environment and safety.
The Brake Assist systems currently available will bring with them a major boost to accident prevention.
Developing them further technically and combining them with information and communications technologies will open up even further potential.
It seems the 'intelligent car' is just around the corner.
Be warned, however: we can call for as many good safety measures for vehicles as we like, but if Joe and Josephine Citizen cannot afford a new, safe vehicle, then we have achieved nothing, absolutely nothing!
Already the average age of our vehicles is more than 10 years old.
Young people in particular are finding that new, safe vehicles are further and further out of reach.
Yet that is what we want, is it not?
