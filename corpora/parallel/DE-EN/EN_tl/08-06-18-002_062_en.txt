Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the people of Ireland and also to the CAEUC, which campaigned against the Treaty of Lisbon in Ireland.
There have now been three rejections of this Treaty: one in France, one in the Netherlands and now the rejection of a slightly modified version of the Treaty in Ireland.
We really do have to accept this at last.
I am reminded of Bertolt Brecht, who once said: 'Would it not be easier in that case for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?'
That is my understanding of a number of statements that have been made here.
The substance of the Treaty was indeed debated in Ireland, especially its neoliberal orientation, its focus on militarisation, and above all, its undemocratic character.
We really should just accept this vote.
The Treaty is dead and we need a different Treaty.
For our part, we will certainly be noting and documenting the various undemocratic statements that have been made here.
