on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, the compromise reached between the European Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Weber, and the Home Affairs Ministers on the so-called Returns Directive is a bad compromise which casts doubt on the European Union's credibility in the field of human rights.
My group therefore resoundingly rejects the Directive.
As a co-legislator, Parliament had a legal and moral duty to work to achieve rules which are acceptable but above all, are compatible with human dignity.
It should have exercised this responsibility in full and fought for such rules.
Instead, a majority in Parliament has allowed the Council to impose its own rules, purely and simply so that the Directive can be pushed through at first reading.
Even though the Directive might improve the legal position in some individual Member States, perhaps because national law does not set an upper limit on the period of detention, it is the overall context which is crucial.
The Directive legitimises up to 18 months' detention for people whose only 'crime' is to seek a better life for themselves and their family in Europe.
In our view, current deportation practice in the Member States does not justify or excuse treating the needy as criminals now or in future.
Instead of giving their blessing to the current practice - which violates the human rights of 'illegally staying third-country nationals' - at European level as well, the Member States should be looking for a lasting solution to the problem of migration.
For our Group, this means, above all, finally establishing a common legal immigration policy which safeguards the human rights of migrants and offers prospects to people in great need who enter Europe, often risking their lives to do so.
The European Parliament has missed the opportunity to act on its responsibility here and stand fast against the Council.
The urgent appeals of numerous human rights organisations and the churches have unfortunately been ignored.
