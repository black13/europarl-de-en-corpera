Mr President, I rejected this report because it misses the target on three important points.
Firstly, it was not possible to secure the adoption of Amendments 170 and 171, which were particularly important in terms of regional networks and would have created exemptions which are justified on grounds of size.
Secondly, the third way was also not accepted.
It is important to have planning predictability in the energy sector, but unfortunately, the Commission prevailed with its legal unbundling and total unbundling.
In my view, this is unlikely to move us in the right direction.
Thirdly, we failed to establish liability for the nuclear industry in the event of accidents.
For all these reasons, the Austrian People's Party (Ã–VP) opposed the report and was unable to vote in favour of the package.
