on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I voted in favour of this report.
I think it is sensible to have a European internal market in the energy sector, so we need a network of transmission system operators.
However, we must ensure that when it comes to implementation, we genuinely create a level playing field but provide leeway for regional exemptions at the same time.
It must be possible to provide cross-subsidies between various energy sectors in order to secure the energy supply in Europe's most remote regions and valleys and on its islands.
We can assume that supplying energy here is far more expensive and therefore less financially attractive to companies, so we need to be able to strike a proper balance here.
I have one brief comment for my British colleagues: as I understand it, there has only ever been one referendum held in Great Britain, namely on accession to the Community.
Perhaps you should change your national constitution to allow the introduction of this instrument of direct democracy.
That is something which I would greatly welcome.
