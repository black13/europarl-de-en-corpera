in writing. - As the rapporteur, I welcome the European Parliament's overwhelming endorsement of the resolution on missing persons in Cyprus.
It is the right of every relative of the missing persons to know their fate through the exhumation and identification of the remains.
Locating the remains of their relatives, who have been missing for decades, and giving them a decent burial is the only way for Greek and Turkish Cypriots to close this painful chapter in their lives, for it finally gives them certain knowledge of the fate of their loved ones.
I am convinced that this can make an important contribution to the positive moves towards the reunification of Cyprus.
Through the provision of funding, the EU is already actively supporting the work of the Committee on Missing Persons (CMP) at the exhumation sites, in the anthropological laboratories and with the families concerned.
It is important, in this context, that the Committee on Missing Persons should carry out all the necessary investigations and analyses while there are still eyewitnesses available who can provide information about this humanitarian problem of missing persons.
I therefore consider it essential to provide for an additional amount of EUR 2 million in the general budget of the European Union for 2009, and would urge the Council and the European Commission to reach agreement on this extra financial support.
