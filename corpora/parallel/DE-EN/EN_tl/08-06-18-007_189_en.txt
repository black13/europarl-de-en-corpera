in writing. - I voted in favour of the Weber report because I believe that the European Union can only combat and prevent illegal immigration with common rules which are tough but fair.
This Returns Directive is a successful start to a common European immigration policy.
Europe can only open up to legal immigration if illegal immigration is clearly defined and can be tackled effectively on the basis of common rules.
In my view, the Directive takes due account of humanitarian concerns about the deportation process, notably through the introduction of a maximum detention period of six months.
Given that nine Member States, including Luxembourg, previously had no maximum limit on detention, this is a major step forward.
Persons affected by a deportation procedure will now also have the right to judicial remedy before a court or tribunal in order to appeal against the process, ultimately including the European Court of Justice as the last resort.
It also ensures that free legal aid is available for persons who lack sufficient resources.
This will put an end to the arbitrary deportation policy pursued by some Member States and strengthens the rule of law.
I also wish to make it clear that a maximum detention period of 18 months, which can be imposed by extending the six-month period for a further 12 months, may only be applied in extreme and exceptional cases.
This is envisaged only if the person poses a threat to public security or in order to prevent the imminent risk of absconding.
