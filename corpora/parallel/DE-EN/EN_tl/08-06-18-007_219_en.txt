in writing. - It was not only because of pressure from the Commission that E.ON and RWE sold off their transmission systems; due to the unbundling which has taken place, the strategic function of network access, namely to shut out new competitors, has largely been lost.
Across Europe, there is a massive need for investment in old power plant and system infrastructure, some of which is decades old.
As experience with the United Kingdom's radical rail privatisation has shown, investors have very little interest in upgrading infrastructure.
It is quite possible that the new network access provisions aimed for will have the same effect.
For that reason, I voted against the Vidal-Quadras report.
