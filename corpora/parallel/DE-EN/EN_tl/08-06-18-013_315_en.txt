Mr President, there are many of our fellow Members in this House who come from countries with a bad experience of the Soviet Union.
The Commissioner and I come from a country which had both good and bad experiences of the defunct Soviet Union.
Today's Russia is reminiscent in some ways of the old USSR.
Nonetheless, it is a new Russia and it has new potential.
The task now is to do our utmost to ensure that we achieve a new Russia which no longer reminds us of the Soviet Union of the past.
Two things are needed for that: a clear and unequivocal stance, and a willingness to engage in dialogue with this new Russia.
On the Kosovo problem, for example, we have a different position from Russia, but we still have to talk to Russia so that we can solve the problems.
Neighbourhood policy is another example: we have a different offer to make to the neighbour countries, whereas Russia often still adopts an imperialistic stance towards its 'near abroad'.
If we want to help these countries, then we must give clear support to countries such as Georgia, for example, but we must also talk to Russia about ways of achieving a peaceful solution to these conflicts, whether we are talking about Abkhazia or South Ossetia.
When it comes to energy issues, we must ensure that we find our own resources; we need a Nabucco pipeline, for example, so that we are in a stronger bargaining position vis-Ã -vis Russia.
Nonetheless, we do need to negotiate with Russia on energy and other issues.
My Group and I therefore do not rule out the possibility that we need both these things - a clear and unequivocal position, and an independent policy - so that from this strong position, we are able to engage in negotiations and talks with Russia.
I hope that we can achieve our objective.
