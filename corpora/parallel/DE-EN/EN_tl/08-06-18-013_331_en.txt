Mr President, I also take the view that the pipeline between Germany and Russia should only be built if the other EU Member States concerned agree.
However, those Member States should not then negotiate with another major power, namely the US, on missiles or visas.
Europe will only be able to stand firm vis-Ã -vis the US and Russia if it finally adopts a united front.
Let me make one thing very clear: it is our job to tell the Russians that it is in their fundamental interests to build a good partnership with Europe.
However, this means that they cannot speak on behalf of other countries that Russia happens to have occupied in the past, such as Ukraine or Georgia.
These countries are sovereign states and are entitled to make their own decisions about their own destiny.
Mr Medvedev said in Berlin that he wants to see an improvement in relations.
That being the case, he can start on two fronts.
The first is the rule of law, which means taking action in the matter of the Yukos prisoners.
The second and very important area is this: Mr Medvedev, please stop blocking the largest peace mission in the history of the EU, namely the Kosovo mission!
