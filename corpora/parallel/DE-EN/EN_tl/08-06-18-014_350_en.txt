I have a question for the Minister.
I have heard that when it comes to the airlines' treatment of passengers with restricted mobility, there are indeed discrepancies, and that the so-called 'low-cost' airlines leave something to be desired here compared with other airlines.
I would be interested to know whether the Council has any hard facts available on this issue, or whether these are simply individual perceptions of the situation.
