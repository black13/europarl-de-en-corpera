I thank the Council for that important clarification as this matter also featured largely in Ireland.
I would just like to ask a brief, clear, additional question concerning Croatia.
Is it also true that the applicant countries do not have to amend their legislation on these matters but rather continue to be sovereign because this is not an area of EU competence in relation to the applicant countries as well?
