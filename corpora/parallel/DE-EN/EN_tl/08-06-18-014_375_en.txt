Mr President-in-Office, I would like to pick up on this question.
This week, a number of reports of relevance to road safety have featured on our agenda: the Ferrari report has been mentioned, and tomorrow we have Mrs Gurmai's report as well as the Markov report tonight.
From the Presidency's point of view, is the outcome of our work satisfactory, or would the Presidency have liked to see more being achieved?
