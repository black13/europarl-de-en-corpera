We obviously have different interpretations of the law.
In my view, this system discriminates against EU citizens from outside Slovenia.
I would ask the Minister whether there is any possibility of the European Commission initiating an infringement procedure against Slovenia.
The first steps, I think, have already been taken.
My question to you is this: as President-in-Office of the Council, would your advice to Slovenia be to introduce a ten-day vignette, perhaps, in order to restore peace and avert the possibility of an infringement procedure?
