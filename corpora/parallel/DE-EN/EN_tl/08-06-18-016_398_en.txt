Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, may I offer you my warm congratulations on your new post.
We will undoubtedly have many opportunities to discuss the issue of transport with you in the future, and I very much look forward to that.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for ensuring that we have a good legal text.
We must now make sure that this legal text is implemented as swiftly as possible in the Member States, and even more importantly - as has already been said today - we must ensure that the relevant national legislation and regulations are applied correctly at local level.
Here, we need commitment and a meticulous approach from the relevant authorities.
What we do not need is carelessness or any turning of a blind eye by those who are responsible for monitoring.
It is also important - as previous speakers have said - that the declaration of dangerous goods takes place in such a way that inspections and escorting can be undertaken as appropriate.
This will improve safety on our roads and also on our inland waterways.
