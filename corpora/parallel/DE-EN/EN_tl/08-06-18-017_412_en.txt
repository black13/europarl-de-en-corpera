on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, in your comments on the directive, you mentioned the fact that the statistics have shown a deterioration of the situation as far as fatalities in accidents are concerned, specifically over the past year, whereas previously there had been a decrease in the number of deaths.
This probably has very little to do with the infrastructure itself, for it is unlikely that within just one year the state of Europe's roads has deteriorated so rapidly that suddenly many more people are dying in traffic accidents.
You will gather from my introductory remarks that I am somewhat sceptical about this directive.
I too would have thought that guidelines would have been quite adequate.
I am still not entirely clear about the added value generated by this directive, and I will be looking very carefully at the implementation process to see precisely how this is being achieved.
I always have problems with the fact that, as I see it, there is an imbalance in relation to road safety.
On the one hand, in terms of technical measures, we move very quickly to prescribe remedies, even if it is simply a matter of making things more expensive and the safety benefits are not entirely clear.
We are generous, too, when it comes to infrastructure and adopt very comprehensive prescriptive measures here.
However, when it comes to human beings, who are still a key factor in the context of accidents, there is an extreme reluctance in this House to even talk about the issue.
I still believe that if a driver cannot adjust to weather conditions, it will be very difficult for him, for the weather is something that we cannot yet control at EU level and the weather always has a major impact on accidents.
I am waiting to see what happens during implementation, and will be following this very closely.
