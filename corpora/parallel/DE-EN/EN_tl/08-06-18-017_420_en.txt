Mr President, road safety is an important subject in Europe.
There is still a lot to be done to ensure that we achieve the high level of safety for road users, and for the environment along our transport routes, that we all would like.
To this end, we also need rules and regulations.
However, paper, as we know, is patient, and too much paper can be harmful.
Apart from introducing a great deal of new red tape, the first draft presented had precisely that flaw: it was heavy on rhetoric and light on substance, which is why we referred it back to committee at first reading.
The second time round, things look rather different and - being cautiously optimistic - they look a little better.
Mrs Sommer has already talked about the basic content of the current text.
What we would like is something which is more of a guideline and is not binding in nature.
We want to have an exchange of good practice, but we do not to be prescriptive.
Above all, we do not want the annexes to be binding on the Member States.
We are quite deliberately limiting ourselves to the TENs.
Many of our fellow Members have said that a great deal happens, and can happen, in the other road networks too, and in response to that, I would point out that there is nothing to stop Member States taking action here.
On the contrary, we would all be delighted if the Member States were to do their job and not simply sit back and wait, in every case, for Europe to take action.
From that point of view, I think that if we have reduced red tape, we have made a constructive contribution to this subject, and can continue to do so.
What is more, as a consensus was reached with the Council in the informal trialogue, we can conclude this matter at first reading.
All that remains is implementation, and that is a task for the Member States.
