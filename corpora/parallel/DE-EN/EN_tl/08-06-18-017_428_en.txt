rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank all our fellow Members once again for the debate.
There are at least two things which have become clear.
Firstly, road safety is something that we are all concerned about, and secondly, the question is how far do we go to tackle this at European level, and there are very different views on that.
Of course, I was very pleased to see that other colleagues were also calling for binding annexes.
Unfortunately, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism I was unable to achieve an extension of this directive to road infrastructure outside the trans-European road network.
One of the recitals now states that this is possible, and I hope, of course, that the Commission will bring forward a new proposal at a later date, as I believe this is necessary.
This, then, is the first small step.
If we were to compare it with a person, it is not a large step, a step that you or I could take.
It is, perhaps, a small step that a six- or seven-month-old baby might take on its tiny feet.
Let us hope that the directive produces results very quickly and minimises the number of road fatalities, for that is our main concern and that is what we are seeking to achieve.
Once again, thank you to everyone, and congratulations on your appointment, Commissioner.
