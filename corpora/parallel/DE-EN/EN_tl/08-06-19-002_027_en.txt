Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to Zita, our rapporteur, for this report.
I know you, Zita, as someone who, when she tackles anything, does so with a ready wit, determination, intelligence and vigour.
In my opinion, that is precisely the spirit that underlies this report.
I should also like to take the opportunity to follow up a point that Mrs Grabowska made.
I do not believe that cars are something that should be mainly for men.
I am more inclined to take the opposite view.
If we can trust the statistics that exist on this subject, women drive with greater foresight and care and more safely.
In other words, they drive more intelligently, and I believe this is one of the reasons why it was only right that a woman drafted this report.
To come to the point, we are all aware that road traffic consumes a great deal of energy and emits huge volumes of exhaust fumes throughout Europe.
It is one of the main risks to human life in Europe.
Large numbers of people die or are injured in road accidents every year.
It is therefore important that the European legislature should try to reduce these figures.
Accordingly, it is imperative that vehicles should be made more intelligent in the truest sense of the term, so that these things do not happen so often in future.
I believe this report points in the right direction.
The key to success, however - and I agree entirely with Mr Rack here - is that these systems should be available to the great mass of car owners, that they have a general impact and do not remain the privilege, as it were, of a small class of people.
I believe the report expresses that view quite clearly too.
This is why I believe it is right for us to adopt it today.
