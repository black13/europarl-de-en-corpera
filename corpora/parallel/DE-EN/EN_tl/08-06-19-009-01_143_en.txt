author. - Mr President, the military junta in Burma is persisting in its attempts to isolate the country and its people from the rest of the world.
In September 2007, after the Buddhist monks' protests had been brutally crushed, a news embargo was imposed.
Last month, international organisations were prevented from helping the victims of the cyclone.
There was a lengthy delay before aid workers were able to reach the people in distress, and for some the aid came too late.
Now other reports of an equally alarming nature are filtering out, such as the news of the arrests of cyclone victims who had sought help from UN offices.
In addition, security forces shot dead or seriously wounded inmates who were trying to flee from a prison destroyed by Cyclone Nargis.
The EU did not turn a blind eye.
It imposed a trade embargo, although that has not yet had the desired impact.
It threatened to apply tougher sanctions if the human rights situation did not improve.
Yet the Burmese leaders have not moved an inch.
Let us not relax our demands.
The country's political prisoners must be released.
The house arrest in which Aung San Suu Kyi has been living for decades must be lifted.
The courageous commitment shown by that Nobel prize winner would be anathema to any dictator.
The Burmese generals must ultimately be held to account for the way they have dealt with their own country's citizens, many of whom are still missing.
The dialogue with the United Nations' Special Rapporteur and the assurance that he would be allowed to visit the country constitute a first step.
The governments of the Member Countries of ASEAN should also use their influence to bring the junta to its senses.
There is a need to increase pressure on China too, which is probably the only remaining supporter of Burma.
If necessary, the Council and the EU Member States must tighten their sanctions.
Commissioner, we are truly waiting for you to act - the people of Burma need our solidarity.
