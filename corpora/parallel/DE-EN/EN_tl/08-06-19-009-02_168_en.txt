Mr President, rarely has a resolution in this House ever had such a gruesome title as 'Routine killing of civilians'.
We cannot make a routine response, ladies and gentlemen; we must bring our full weight to bear.
One in eight of the population have been displaced in the past twelve months, and by the end of the year half of the civilian population could be dependent on humanitarian aid.
I am grateful to Mr Dess and others for the food aid and medical aid that are being dispensed there, but now we must also target a political solution that has not been in place since 1991.
The only option, in my view, is for the UN force to be deployed, but it must be supplemented by appropriate civilian structures.
As far as the Transitional Federal Government is concerned, we have to ask where the transition is leading.
It is either a transition to a viable autonomous structure, or else it is necessary to establish an international civilian structure, as has happened in other countries.
If we do not get this right, we shall ultimately have the entire nation dependent on humanitarian aid.
That cannot be the way to eradicate murders, rapes and famine.
