Mr President, I should like to add my voice to the praise given to the Presidency.
I believe that it has achieved a great deal of good.
The example that I would give is the launch of negotiations with Russia on a partnership agreement.
That will be no easy task, as we have many different opinions, but these negotiations and this dialogue are absolutely necessary.
I should also like to offer my thanks for the preparations that have been made as far as the Mediterranean Union is concerned and also for what, in my view, will become a 'Union for the Black Sea'.
I hope that this 'Eastern dimension' will be strengthened, especially - if the Commission is devising the strategy - since it is a region that is extremely important for our energy supply, as well as a host of other issues.
However, allow me to focus on the issue of south-eastern Europe and the Balkans.
I think that we need to clarify two points.
The process of integration in this region, for which you have done a great deal, must continue.
We would do ourselves harm, were we to put a stop to this integration process.
However, it should also be understood - and I expect a clear statement from the Council in this regard - that enlargements can be completed only after institutional reforms.
In our view, that is now the purpose of the Lisbon Treaty.
These are two issues that we must address in parallel.
We must not suspend these negotiations.
We must promote stability in this region, but we must also state very clearly - and here I am concerned by the different views held at Council level - that we must first implement institutional reforms ourselves, so that we, too, are fit for enlargement, and then the new states - Croatia and the other countries - really will be able to join.
It is also essential for the Council to make a clear statement in this regard.
In any event, that is our opinion!
(Applause)
