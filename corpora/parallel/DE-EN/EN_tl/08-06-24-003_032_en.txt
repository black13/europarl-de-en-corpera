Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Irish 'no' vote must be respected; the Irish are perfectly entitled to vote as they have done.
However, the other countries are also perfectly entitled to continue the drive for a more democratic, more transparent and more effective Union.
The Lisbon Treaty is a step in this direction.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that ratification will continue.
I also think that it would be good if we were also to talk frankly about a multi-speed Europe.
This multi-speed Europe already exists, and it reflects both national sensitivities and the wishes of the EU Member States to allow for different stages of integration.
It enables those Member States which would like to do more things together to do so without, on the one hand, being held back by those countries which are more hesitant and, on the other, disregarding the principle of free choice, namely that those countries which want to do something together may do so by their own choice.
In a multi-speed Europe, further accessions to the EU are also simplified, as it is wrong to punish Croatia and Turkey for the fact that the majority of Irish people have voted 'no'.
The blame game between the European institutions is getting us nowhere.
The problem lies in the fact that the major European projects of recent years - as right and proper as they are - and the enlargement of the EU have been insufficiently anchored in democracy.
Now we are having to pay the penalty: always little by little, that is.
The good thing about the Irish 'no' - trying to see the positive side - is that Europe is being talked about once more.
If this opportunity is used to discuss or explore other avenues, I believe that we may then come a little closer to a 'Europe of citizens'.
