Mr President, as an Austrian, I am delighted that our neighbouring country of Slovenia has run such an excellent Presidency.
Congratulations, President-in-Office of the Council!
However, if you will allow me, my congratulations do come with a request, one that concerns the little details on which the citizens of Europe judge Europe and its value.
In the coming days, a great many Austrian and European citizens will be driving through your country, where they will encounter a motorway toll system that is utterly discriminatory.
The Directorate-General for Transport has also already written you a letter.
Can Slovenia, as the country holding the Presidency, exert its influence on Slovenia as a Member State so that something is done about it?
