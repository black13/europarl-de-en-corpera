, in writing. - Ireland's rejection of the Reform Treaty may have been a setback for European development, but it is no reason for the Union to grind to a halt.
We must take the Irish 'no' seriously and we cannot simply revert to 'business as usual'.
We should be working towards improving communication with the citizens of the EU.
Especially in times of economic turmoil, it is important that we offer solutions to the people.
The challenges facing Europe are not diminishing.
Rising oil and food prices signal that the era of cheap fossil fuels and food is over.
Europe will have to adapt not only to climate change but also to high energy prices.
Energy efficiency and a sustainable energy supply must become long-term EU objectives.
If a household's energy consumption is reduced on a sustainable basis, then its costs will also be reduced.
This will benefit both the climate and the people.
