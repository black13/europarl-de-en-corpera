Mr President, I had already tried at the Conference of Presidents to convince the chairs of the groups that this agenda item is totally inappropriate at this particular time.
It is based on mere supposition by Amnesty International.
According to Amnesty International itself, there is a suspicion, but no tangible proof of the existence of these mass graves as yet.
The Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Mrs Flautre, responded to this very intelligently.
She invited representatives of Amnesty International to visit the committee on 16 July to substantiate and define the accusations.
Therefore we believe that it makes a lot of sense to wait until this hearing has taken place before we decide what to do about this agenda item.
In addition, I should like to point out that this is not just any old region but a part of the world in which the European Parliament too, as an international political entity, must proceed with scrupulous care, and not make decisions based on assumptions that could perhaps trigger the opposite of what we intend, which is to achieve more stability in the region.
Therefore, we request that this item be removed from the agenda.
