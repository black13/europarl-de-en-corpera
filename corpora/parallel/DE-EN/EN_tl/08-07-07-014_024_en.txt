Mr President, based on the Rules of Procedure, I think that is impossible.
My group decided, about 25 minutes ago, to assign me the task of tabling the motion.
Therefore, I think it is utterly impossible for a request for a roll-call vote on the motion I have only just tabled to have been submitted in the meantime.
If it has been submitted, then it was not submitted within the deadline, and it is within your discretion to reject it.
