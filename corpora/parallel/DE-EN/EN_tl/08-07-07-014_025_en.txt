Mr Schulz, I have been informed that this motion was tabled an hour earlier, from which I conclude that it was done as a preventive measure.
That is my hunch, anyway, Mr Schulz.
Why is it such a problem?
You have your conviction, others have theirs.
Let us all have our own convictions.
According to my information, an hour ago - on time, in other words - a proper request was made for a roll-call vote, should it come to a decision.

You can each decide whether to bring your documents or not - it is up to the individual to choose.
