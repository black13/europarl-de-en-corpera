Mr Lambrinidis, there is a proper procedure for distributing the Minutes.
It is no different on a Thursday from any other day, and it is your group's task to allocate the group's speaking time as it sees fit.
Everything else is done according to the d'Hondt system, and nothing out of the ordinary is planned for Thursday.
