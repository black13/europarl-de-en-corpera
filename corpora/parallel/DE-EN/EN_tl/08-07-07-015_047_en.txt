Mr President, the location for the EU-Russia Summit was not chosen at random.
Khanty-Mansiysk is the centre of Russian oil extraction.
In the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, Russia puts the focus on the economy.
From the point of view of the EU, there should be a closer focus on human rights.
Under Dmitry Medvedev, Alexander Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky are still in prison.
For the last week, both have been under the threat of new charges with a potential prison term of up to 20 years.
The Russian authorities are playing for time until Mr Medvedev takes a clear position.
Progress and binding commitments by Moscow are needed urgently on this matter, including in terms of solving political murders and clarifying the situation regarding restrictions on freedom of the press and of opinion.
In the future, the EU must present a united front and speak with one voice to Moscow so as to build up the political pressure.
This is about nothing less than the credibility of the EU.
