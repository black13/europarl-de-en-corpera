draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, essentially, I can only agree with the statements by the rapporteur, Mrs Haug.
They also apply, in my opinion, to the budget available for transport.
The proportion of the budget allocated to transport has certainly grown - but that, of course, is due primarily to increases in the Galileo programme.
The reasons for these increases are a never-ending story, and have something to do with policies on industry in Europe.
The criticism I have to make of the Preliminary Draft Budget before us, however, is that we need more money for passenger rights, as this area concerns the rights of European citizens.
Most importantly, however, we need more money for research and for new transport strategies, so that we can finally arrive at mobility that is not detrimental to the climate.
Trans-European networks also need very strict monitoring, because large amounts of money are to be spent in this area.
