rapporteur. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many kind words, for your appreciation of my work and, of course, for your support.
However, you know as well as I do that the work can only be done, and done properly, when all Members pull together on this.
Only then are we strong enough in relation to the Council to be able to push through the things that we believe are essential.
I particularly liked the way that Mr Surján described the Commissioner and me when he said that we were like two interlocking cogs.
I find it a particularly good image because when two cogs mesh, they move something, and that is exactly what we want.
We want to set something in motion; we want to avoid a static budget and, above all, we want to move the Council.
As the President said, the Heads of State or Government can issue communiqués about all manner of wonderful things at their summit meetings but, in the end, the Commission and Parliament have to get the whole thing moving.
Of course the Council is part of it too, as one arm of the budgetary authority, but mostly I get the impression that it is always up to us to drag the Council along with us in this movement because the Council itself does not take the initiative in providing impetus.
We have analysed the Preliminary Draft Budget yet again, exchanged views on it and clearly carved out what we want from the budget for the European Union in the next year at a very early stage - before the summer recess.
This gives us a good basis on which to move into the preparations for our first reading after the summer recess.
I hope that all Members will support it as soundly then as they have done today.
