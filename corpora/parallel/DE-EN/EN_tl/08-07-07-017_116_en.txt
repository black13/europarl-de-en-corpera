Madam President, I should like first to apologise on behalf of my colleague, Mr Sturdy, who has been delayed and cannot be here for the plenary session.
I should like to say in advance that both the United States and Europe - at least most of the Member States - are NATO partners.
This is a conflict between groups that are on friendly terms.
I would also say in advance that the United States and the EU signed an agreement on large civil aircraft in 1992.
It actually functioned very well until the United States departed from the terms of the agreement by calling upon the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in 2004.
We know that, to a certain extent, State aid is common practice, particularly in this market for large commercial and military aircraft.
Nevertheless, it is important that very strict controls and conditions be imposed on this State aid.
The European Union has so far held strictly to these, and EADS Airbus, too, has paid back most of the subsidies or even paid back more than it received from public funds.
We have documented this in detail.
In contrast, the United States has still not come up with such documentation and it is not exactly clear to what extent Boeing has complied with these obligations.
Overall, I should like to say that, whilst the European Union naturally advocates free trade, this resolution should not result in us calling for anti-American rhetoric.
It is important that we seek fair treatment for both partners, and I assume that the WTO body will take its decision in this spirit.
Straight anti-Americanism would be too narrow an approach, but we must still call upon the United States to keep to the rules that we all agreed upon.
