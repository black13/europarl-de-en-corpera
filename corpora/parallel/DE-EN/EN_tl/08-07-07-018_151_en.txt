Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, much of what has been said is true, but much is also false.
There are three things we must hold to.
Firstly, randomly selecting groups of people in order to collect personal information about them is unlawful, both generally and under the Italian Constitution.
Secondly, this means that protective measures taken for children, such as Roma children, must be taken within the framework of the legislation in force in the European Union and in Italy.
Thirdly, Italy's Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini phoned me an hour ago to tell me that he wants to indicate - at least to my group - that Minister for the Interior Roberto Maroni has met Commissioner Barrot in Cannes.
I know that a meeting with Mr Deprez, the Chair of the competent committee, also took place there.
By means of Mr Frattini's phone call and of statements by Mr Maroni, the Italian Government has signified that it does not want to take any legislative measures that contravene European legal standards in any way.
Commissioner Å pidla, I assume, therefore, that you will make contact with Commissioner Barrot when he returns from Cannes, and I would ask you please to report to Parliament immediately afterwards, because the Italian Government has apparently understood that the initiatives it has taken so far are not compatible with European law.
If it is now drawing the correct conclusions from that, I find this a very welcome development.
(Applause)
