Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to all the rapporteurs, especially Mrs Drƒçar Murko and Mrs Ayuso, for their constructive cooperation and trust.
The Food Improvement Agents package will lead to uniform, harmonised rules on the use of additives becoming applicable throughout Europe.
In the future, too, when additives, enzymes and flavourings are used in food, there will be a high level of consumer health protection - which is the way it should be.
The package adapts the current legislation to the technical and scientific developments in the area of food additives.
Where there is a scientific basis that indicates health risks, threshold values must be set so as to prevent all hazards.
However, we must not become hysterical or incite unwarranted panic.
There are food additives such as konjac, a humectant, and beeswax, an anti-caking agent, which have been used in the preparation of food and drink for centuries.
In addition, certain stone fruits such as cherries, peaches and apricots naturally contain small amounts of hydrocyanic acid, yet we have been eating these fruits for thousands of years without any problems.
Similarly, some herbs and spices naturally contain substances which, in high concentrations, can cause health problems.
Yet we have been using herbs and spices such as basil, tarragon and nutmeg in the preparation of our food since the year dot without any problems, but only in small, safe doses, of course.
I therefore welcome the compromise in the new Regulation on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods.
Where there is no cause for concern, exceptions are made to the threshold values, although only when exclusively fresh or dried herbs are used for food preparation.
This way, we promote the use of natural products and natural ingredients, so that recipes with thousands of years of history, such as Italian pesto, will be maintained into the future.
