Mr President, I should very much like you to support the proposals put forward by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, because we want a ban on azo dyes.
European consumer policy is characterised by safety, but also by the application of the precautionary principle.
Without a ban, the precautionary principle would be trampled underfoot.
Furthermore, there is technically no need for azo dyes because alternatives exist.
This therefore amounts to deceiving the consumer; it leads people to believe something that is not really the case.
I would urge you again to take this alarming study seriously and really apply the precautionary principle - which, after all, we have enshrined in European law.
I would also urge you once more to also close the labelling gap for additives manufactured using genetic technology - we are currently trying to close the labelling gap for GM products of animal origin, and it would be downright ludicrous if we did not take this opportunity.
What we need is a well-rounded authorisation procedure that takes due account of the precautionary principle but has no labelling gaps, and in which consumers have the right to make a free choice about what they eat.
