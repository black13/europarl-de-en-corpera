Mr President, 'Let us risk a bold democracy' was the title of a major article I wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung two weeks ago.
It was people from social democratic circles who came to me and said 'exactly!' - and not only because the title echoed a famous statement by the great Willy Brandt.
What are you doing here now, Mr Corbett and Mr Leinen?
You are turning the thing on its head, and you know what you are doing.
I remember well what you said when the last increase in the access barrier for groups was discussed.
I remember Mr Leinen from the days when he was still an upstanding democrat.
He should pull back and think carefully about which cause he is serving.
With what you are doing here, you are destroying democracy.
You are looking after the Haiders and Straches, the extreme left, people cut from a cloth that makes even Mr Lafontaine look middle of the road.
Shame on you!
Stop and think, and withdraw this amendment for Europe's sake.
Do not be the 'anti-Europeans'.
