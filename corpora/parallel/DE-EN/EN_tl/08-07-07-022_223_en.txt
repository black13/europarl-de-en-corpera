Mr President, own-initiative reports are certainly justified in this Parliament.
We are a parliament of 27 countries and peoples, and there are many questions preying on people's minds, both within the EU and in our relations with other parts of the world.
However, I also agree with those who have said that Parliament has increasingly developed from being an advisory assembly to a legislative body.
The Treaty of Lisbon will take that a big step further.
Therefore, we must set priorities.
I hear that we spend only 17.4% of our time on legislative work: this is not enough.
We are under stress, under time pressure.
We want better lawmaking, so we need more time and priorities.
It is also a good thing that we are now saying that not every report has to be discussed again in plenary.
It is possible to vote without first debating, and Members can make a written statement if they want to express their views on the report.
It does not have to be done orally in a plenary session.
Madam Vice-President, I feel it is right that the rapporteur has both the first and the last word in Parliament because, as a kind of 'chamber of the citizens', we must express ourselves at the beginning and the end of a debate.
That is a good innovation.
Last but not least the subject of the questions.
This system is very good, until it is abused.
We have heard the figures - that eight Members are putting 25% of the questions.
That makes nearly 1 700 questions from eight members.
We can observe that they are very hardworking, but it looks very much as if the EU system is being wantonly abused here, as in many other cases, by opponents of the EU.
We must introduce a rule for this, and the guidelines are a benchmark, a framework that we can work by.
Congratulations to Mr Corbett for knuckling down time and again to further develop Parliament.
Thank you very much.
