Mr President, I feel much the same way as Mr Duff.
I should like to say at this point that we as a group can support the report overall, in contrast to the previous report, because it reflects the proposals of the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform and implements them as amendments to the Rules of Procedure.
What we cannot support, which I should also like to mention briefly here, is the proposal to no longer allow amendments to own-initiative reports.
In our group, we are of the opinion that amendments are very much part of the political culture and political debate and, particularly, of the rights of individual groups - and this right of the groups should not be curtailed.
To finish, I should like to add that I believe that Amendments 13 and 15 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are worthy of support.
Even if we do not need long, detailed debates on individual reports here in plenary, there should be some discussion, and it should be brief - either one speaker per group, as the Verts/ALE Group suggests, or via the catch-the-eye procedure.
Not having any debate at all would be doing ourselves a disservice.
If we do not allow debate then we are not taking ourselves seriously, and I do not think that is good either.
