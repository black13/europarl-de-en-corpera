Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions represent precisely the range of information that citizens want from the EU.
Since Commissioner Wallstr√∂m is here today, I call on her to allow these questions to be worked through, and perhaps to have a brochure made in which the results of the questions and answers are also made available to the citizens of Europe, including on the Internet, so that they can see how the questions put by their MEPs to the Commission and the Council are answered.
It would be fantastic for journalists and the citizens of Europe if that could be done before the elections.
