Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked for the floor in response to Mr Leinen's speech.
Mr Leinen, if you would listen for a moment: I want to speak about your remarks on own-initiative reports.
The quality of the own-initiative reports that are tabled and then adopted here is open to question but, if you stop allowing amendments, how can own-initiative reports be improved?
I should like to remind you that Parliament does not have the right of initiative on legislation.
We are dependent on the Commission for that.
How can we tell the Commission what initiatives we should like to see if we trim the own-initiative reports down or do not take reports in a direction that improves things?
If I understand rightly, according to the Treaty, or what used to be called the Constitution, we ourselves do not have the right of initiative in the area of legislation.
All we have is the ability to make known what we want in own-initiative reports.
I think it is unfortunate if you devalue that, because it robs us of an opportunity.
I believe you should think again - both you, Mr Leinen, and the rapporteur.
