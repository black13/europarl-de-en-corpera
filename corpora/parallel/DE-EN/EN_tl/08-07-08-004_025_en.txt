- Mr President, of course the construction of pipelines - whether they are oil or gas pipelines - has an impact on the environment, and it matters not whether this pipe runs through the North Sea from Ekofisk to Emden, as exists today, or whether it runs from Russia to Germany via Poland, which also exists.
Environmental impact audits must be carried out; planning approval assessments must be undertaken.
All this is regulated at international level.
We have the Espoo Convention, which means that the countries through whose territory the pipeline is to run are responsible for checking whether the construction work can be carried out there or not.
I have trust in these countries and I am confident that this Convention will be observed, and only then can we debate whether there is some alternative version that will go this way or that way.
What we are now doing sometimes appears to me to be very much like a case of political partiality.
Because we have political influence we absolutely have to lay the pipeline there.
This means getting around the environmental impact assessment.
Please let the countries and their authorities decide whether the environmental imperatives are being properly met or not.
It is our job as Europeans to say that we have faith in the Member States concerned.
