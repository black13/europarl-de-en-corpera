- Madam President, the month of June was the bloodiest for foreign soldiers since the end of the Taliban regime in 2001.
More than 48 coalition troops were killed, which is more than lost their lives over the same period in Iraq.
Since the beginning of the year violence in Afghanistan has cost the lives of more than 2 200 people.
What we have in Afghanistan is not a solitary conflict but a regional war that could develop further.
The situation is now more serious than it was in 2001.
In view of this alarming state of affairs, Afghanistan must remain an absolute priority for Europe.
The presence of European troops and the EU's civil operations in the country is playing a key role.
After lengthy negotiations in committee, I support the final version of our motion for a resolution, which contains many key elements, including the systematic training of the Afghan security forces, greater focus on the rebuilding of civil society and enhanced coordination between the international bodies.
