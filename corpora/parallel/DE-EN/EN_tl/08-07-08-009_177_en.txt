Mr President, I am very disappointed that in Mrs Westlund's recommendation for second reading it was not possible to impose a ban on azo-dyes.
This is indeed very disappointing because labelling does not guarantee safety.
Parliament has now lost control in this area and has simply given in, and has unfortunately not applied the precautionary approach.
That is very regrettable.
In exactly the same way we find it very disappointing that we were unable to include and regulate genetically modified additives, which would really have signalled how seriously we take the subject of consumer protection.
However, the most regrettable thing is that we have failed to protect children from azo-dyes.
The alarming findings of the Southampton study make it quite clear that we must call for a ban and that we need a ban.
What indeed does the precautionary principle state other than that we have to accept the conclusions when there is an indication of risk?
In this case the conclusions clearly point to a ban.
Moreover, while the general ban ultimately failed I find it very regrettable that we have still not succeeded in obtaining a ban on products that are mainly intended for children.
