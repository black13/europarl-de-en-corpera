- Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am against the common position on including aviation activities in emission allowance trading for all kinds of reasons.
Aviation accounts for less than 5% of the total emissions in the transport sector and in this respect we are to some extent playing token politics here.
Besides, we have not been able, as Europeans, to find a global approach to this issue, which means that our measures will put European airlines and airports too at an unfair disadvantage.
What is more, we have basically failed - as would have been made clear - to carry out a proper cost-benefit analysis.
This means that the measures we have agreed on today are neither sensible nor necessary and we have created here a situation that is not convenient and that basically runs counter to the Lisbon Strategy.
We have not in fact strengthened Europe's position; we have handicapped it and we have done it one-sidedly, which is why I am against the common position.
We would have done better to put more into our infrastructure and create a common European airspace.
This could have produced cost savings that would have been much more beneficial than the measures we have now set in motion here today.
