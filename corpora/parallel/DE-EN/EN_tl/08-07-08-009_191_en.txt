- Mr President, like lemmings the majority of the Members of this House stumble from one Corbett reform to the next and each of these Corbett reforms means less democracy and fewer rights for the Members of this Parliament.
Yet the opposite is being claimed.
It is being maintained that people want to see more debates, while at the same time the debates on the own-initiative reports are being abolished and are being replaced by written statements.
However, the word Parliament comes from parlare and not from 'minute keeping'.
That is for bureaucrats.
People talk about having more time for legislative work.
We could have this on Thursdays and on Fridays.
The problem is that we do not use it.
That is the reason why we do not have enough time for legislative work.
True parliamentary reform - and here I concede to Mr Sumberg - would be something completely different.
We are taking away our own rights, we are reducing the amount of speaking time, we can no longer table amendments, which means that we are giving up our own capacity to compromise.
There will henceforth only be ideological arguments over rigid texts.
I consider this to be a decidedly black day in the history of this Parliament, where I have worked for some 29 years: 15 years as a staff member and journalist and 14 as a Member of the House.
I think that this process of Parliamentary self-castration has gone far enough.
Even the Committee on Foreign Affairs has now lost much of its powers and potential.
I regret this profoundly.
