- Mr President, I believe that we now at last have found a text that we can reasonably accept.
However, I regret that a number of coherence problems still exist.
Most of all I regret the actions of those, in particular, who today complained that the display panel was not working.
Four weeks ago we saw in committee how voting ruthlessly went ahead in spite of the fact that 22 languages were not present.
I am therefore particularly opposed to the procedure that we have found.
This all has to do with economic matters and with historical issues, and it also certainly involves energy and probably the environment too.
However, the environment is being paraded like a monstrance and it is indeed remarkable that the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, which really should have been the first to take action, refused to deliver any opinion at all.
The procedure that we have opted for was not right.
We should have been able to produce a better text.
For this reason - and more especially on procedural grounds and because of the various dealings in the Committee on Petitions - I ultimately did not vote for the report.
