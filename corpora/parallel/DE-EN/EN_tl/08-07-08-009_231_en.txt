Hitherto Switzerland and Liechtenstein have maintained a privileged partnership with the EU through various bilateral agreements, which is something that could certainly be commended to any state that wishes to preserve its sovereignty and its identity.
It does not exactly say much for the EU that Liechtenstein's participation in the Schengen programme was made conditional upon agreements relating to the taxation of savings income.
This is reminiscent of the Schengen-Dublin threat that was intended to make the Swiss see reason.
It cannot be right to use millions in aid and various illusory promises to lure in new members or bind countries closer to the EU in order to deprive them of the opportunity of going their own way outside the Community.
