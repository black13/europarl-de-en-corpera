As a democrat I am particularly struck by two amendments relating to the Corbett report, for I do not think these could have been meant seriously.
It is part of the democratic rights of a member of parliament in practically every country that is democratic in character to be able to question the elected rulers on their jurisdiction and responsibilities.
Restricting the number and content of these questions notionally derives more from the procedures of a court hearing than from the rules of a democratically legitimate institution and the proposal should therefore be totally rejected.
For this reason I can only vote against the report.
