Mr President, I will in a moment be presenting the decisions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a somewhat insane undertaking and just as insane as the way in which some of our debates were organised, with such results.
For this reason I would just make one comment, for there is not enough time for anything more.
The Commissioner has again just pointed out that in the Commission's opinion ownership unbundling is somehow - to use his words - the most efficient solution.
We doubt that, because it cannot be verified either empirically or theoretically; certainly not empirically, for there are plenty of examples to show that even after ownership unbundling undertakings do not operate so smoothly.
Neither can it be verified theoretically.
It is and remains a monopoly, a natural monopoly, and monopolies do not have much to do with free competition.
What therefore matters is not so much the question of ownership but rather of regulation.
The sector has to be strictly regulated and this has to apply to unbundled network operators just as much as to non-unbundled network operators.
We have made a number of proposals to this effect in the ECON Committee and we would hope that these proposals could also be taken on board.
