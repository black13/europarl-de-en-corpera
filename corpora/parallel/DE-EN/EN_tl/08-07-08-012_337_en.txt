- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy is the resource of the future and for that reason it is important that we take a long-term view when debating the subject of Europe's energy supply.
It is also especially important not to exclude long-term contracts but rather to ensure that these are considered when planning for stable energy supplies to Europe.
We should also be thinking about the production and supply conditions for the trans-European networks.
By providing support and incentives on one hand we could, on the other, demand that unbundling, even ownership unbundling, serves as a basis for setting the production and supply conditions.
There are countless models that could be used here to safeguard the future markets.
A key issue - and one that has already been discussed today - concerns the operation of nuclear power stations.
It is high time that the European Commission plays an active role in this area by setting up an agency or regulator that would be responsible for the safety and security of nuclear power installations.
This regulator should also have the authority to remove unsafe nuclear power stations from the network.
The French agency could serve as a model in this respect.
France has provided us with an excellent example of how to set up an independent regulator.
It would be useful if this French regulator were given a say in the activities of the regulators in the other 26 countries.
This would strengthen the national regulators and take care of health and safety issues in Europe.
We all share responsibility for this.
We must give some thought to a long-term strategy on how to protect the people of Europe in the years to come.
