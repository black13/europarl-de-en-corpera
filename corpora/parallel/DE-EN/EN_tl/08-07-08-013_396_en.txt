Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I really want to thank you once again for the broad support you have given to the Commission's approach in the course of this debate.
I did perceive some differences in priority, but not in the political stance and for that I am particularly grateful.
Someone asked how this work is proceeding at international level.
Let me just say that while the activities in the IMF and OECD are running in parallel they are not dealing with exactly the same themes.
They could more be described as complementary.
The Working Group in the International Monetary Fund, which meets monthly, is attempting to establish how the conduct of the sovereign wealth funds themselves can be influenced in the ways that we have been discussing.
The OECD Working Group, on the other hand, is seeking to determine how we ourselves should behave in response to the influence exerted by sovereign wealth funds.
This subject is being tackled from two sides and once again I can say that the progress made to date has been satisfactory.
We are quite confident that we shall really achieve something and that - to pick up on what Mr Schmidt said - we will indeed have an umbrella, should we need one.
