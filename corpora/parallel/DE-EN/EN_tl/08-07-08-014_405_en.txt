- I would like to break this question down a bit more.
There is now apparently, within the European Union, a classic case of ethnic discrimination, and that is happening in Italy, where people are being criminalised because of their ethnic background.
How does the Council view this practice?
Does it consider it appropriate that measures should be taken against the Italian Government?
