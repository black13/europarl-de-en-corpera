- Mr Jouyet, we have for some considerable time had a money laundering Directive in the European Union that has been quite deliberately put in place in an attempt to siphon off the proceeds from illegal activities, especially drug trafficking and similar criminal operations.
Is the decision you mention to be seen in any way as competing with this Directive?
Might the Directive and the experience that it has given us not perhaps be a better solution than the one you are now proposing?
Could we also envisage adopting a tougher approach with measures that are legally more binding?
