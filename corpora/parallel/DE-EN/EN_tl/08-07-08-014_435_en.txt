- Mr Jouyet, the parents of the abducted child Madeleine McCann were here at the last part-session in Strasbourg in an attempt to enlist Parliament's support for the development of Europe-wide actions designed to ensure that greater attention is henceforth given to the prevention of child abduction and to the protection of abducted children as part of a European Union approach.
Can the Council envisage giving support to appropriate actions in this area in conjunction with Parliament and the Commission?
