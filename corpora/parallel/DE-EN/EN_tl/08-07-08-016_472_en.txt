Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in times like these when we may talk about shifting traffic from road to railway but have been presented with a directive on costs that will probably not entirely achieve that, it is good to find a report that actually aims to strengthen a transport mode we regard as important, the train, to ensure that in future it will have the same rights and the same opportunities in many respects as the heavy goods vehicle.
Interoperability works, the systems are being harmonised and safety improved.
Both are, therefore, very good reports.
I congratulate Mr Costa on another step towards strengthening the railway at European level.
