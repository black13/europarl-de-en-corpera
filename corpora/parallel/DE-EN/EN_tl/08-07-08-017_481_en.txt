on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank Mr Degutis warmly for the good cooperation on this liberalisation package.
We have achieved good compromises and will support his report tomorrow.
Consensus was soon reached on the broad lines of the aviation regulation we will be voting on tomorrow.
As he said, that regulation takes us a big step forward towards reducing red tape.
Three existing Regulations have been put together into a legislative text that is easy to understand.
Thanks to this common position, existing EU legislation on air services has been brought in line with current practice.
In addition to the licensing of airlines, the regulation covers technical questions and price transparency, which is the subject I want to address in particular on behalf of my group.
From the outset we urged putting an end at last to the misleading adverts offering absurdly low air fares.
We want to introduce substantial simplifications for the consumer, which are long overdue.
This EU regulation will bring an end to the advertising tricks and inducements that often confuse the consumer.
Airlines may no longer con consumers by advertising flights - especially on the Internet - at ridiculous fares of, for instance, EUR 9.99, and then face them with large extras in the form of taxes and charges.
In future air fares are to be set out in a comprehensible and transparent way.
The consumer must be able to identify what proportion of the price goes to the state and how much goes into the pockets of the airline and airport.
That applies above all to Internet offers.
That is why we have also called for price transparency.
We will be happy to vote for the report tomorrow.
