on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank Mr Degutis for his good work and, of course, for the good cooperation.
We are at last adopting the necessary update to the third liberalisation package.
This recast text injects new clarity and efficiency, especially in regard to authorisation for placing in service, aircraft leasing, traffic distribution and air service safety.
It also makes it clear that EU and national social legislation must be applied properly, regardless of the Member State in which the airline has its operational base.
Nevertheless, the social and working conditions in European aviation remain a problem and need to be put back on the agenda.
The text could not resolve the question of the insurance model in the event of airline bankruptcy either, because of its complexity.
That is another task for the Commission.
The adoption of rules on price transparency is a great success.
In future, it will no longer be possible to con European citizens with tempting offers.
All customers will now be able to see not just the final price but also the proportion of the cost that goes to the airline, airport and state.
That is a major contribution to consumer protection.
Once again, I thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation.
