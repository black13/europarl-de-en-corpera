Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me congratulate Mr ArÅ«nas Degutis warmly on this balanced report.
It is particularly important today, in the age of the Internet, to provide greater price transparency in air fares and thereby prevent misleading offers, while also ensuring equal conditions of competition.
That is the only way to achieve a minimum quality and, in the name of consumer protection, to protect people who have little or no experience in booking trips from being lured by misleading offers.
In a sense, it is creating interoperability.
The need to observe social legislation is the second major point in the report and there is no doubt that Member States must ensure that both Community and national social provisions apply to airline employees if aircraft and their crew are leased out to cover peak season traffic or make up for the shortfalls of airline operators based in other countries.
That responds to the needs of the airline operators, the needs of the employees and, in particular, the needs of the consumers.
