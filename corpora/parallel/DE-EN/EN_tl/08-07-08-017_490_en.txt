Madam President, I want to take up a subject nearly all speakers have addressed, namely greater transparency in pricing, and emphasise what Mr Simpson rightly observed.
Anyone who has ever booked flights on the Internet - and many of us do so - knows that problems may arise not just in relation to price transparency but also if you do not fill in some little detail of the booking correctly.
In that event, it all backtracks and you end up with far more insurance than you actually wanted and not a cheap ticket but one at an over-inflated price as a result of extra charges and insurance.
The airlines themselves should not be promoting this practice and the Commission in particular and we in Parliament should monitor such behaviour.
That is the only way to organise a sensible, customer-friendly system for our citizens.
