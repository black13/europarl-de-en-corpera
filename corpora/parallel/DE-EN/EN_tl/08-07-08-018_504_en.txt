on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if Europe is at all rich, it is rich in its variety.
We must always remember that when we talk about urban transport, so that we preserve and maintain that richness for the long term.
I am, therefore, a little worried, after hearing the first speakers, that we will lose the balance that our rapporteur set out in his report between what can be decided locally, under the subsidiarity principle, and the little we can contribute here as a European Union.
If that happened we would have uniform European towns and lose the richness of Europe.
Let me put it quite plainly: local and regional authorities that have already tackled the problems of organising transport do not need the Green Paper, while local and regional authorities that have hitherto refused to address this issue will not be more likely to do so as a result of the Green Paper or our resolution.
We must realise, however much we love going into details, that Europe will succeed only if its citizens accept it at local level.
They will not accept it at local level if they feel that it is interfering in all areas of their local life.
That is why I expressed strong criticism, in committee too.
I very much regret that the Committee on Transport and Tourism did not accept my amendments in committee because I fear that in the end - starting of course with best practice, with Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund incentives - we are doing something we should really be keeping out of.
My request is, therefore, that we take the compromise now agreed in committee as the furthest we will go.
Let us not go beyond that as a result of the many amendments that have now been tabled.
Europe will not be successful if it interferes in every area of people's lives.
