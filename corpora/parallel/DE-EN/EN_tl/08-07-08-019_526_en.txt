on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, if there is any chance of a risk to human life, we have to take rapid and preventive political action.
There is no other option.
Obviously that also applies to children under the age of two in aeroplanes.
First, I want to thank Mrs Lichtenberger warmly for giving us access to the video showing crash tests of loop belts.
I also want to thank the Commissioner for delivering an opinion that is very much in line with our question, although a few points remain to be clarified.
These new requirements for the transportation by aeroplane of small children will be entering into force at the end of next week.
Member States will then have the choice between child seats and loop belts.
As we have seen, however, loop belts can be life-threatening.
My first question is: when at the latest will the Commission present a proposal making it mandatory always to use child seats in aeroplanes?
That follows the same line as Mr Jarzembowski's question.
My next question is: what is the Commission's current implementing strategy?
Will it present a regulation or how does it intend to implement whatever findings the survey may produce?
Thirdly, if we continue to allow parts of the necessary EU OPS regulation to be adopted under the new comitology procedure, how can we be sure we can still get and consider a regulation on safe child seats during this legislative term?
