on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I have availed myself of the opportunity to respond to what the Commissioner said in order to put a few further questions.
It is crucial to implement the strategy in good time and I too would very much like to see an interim solution.
The reason is that the current EU OPS requirements are being interpreted to mean that all airlines that already offer child seats must revert to using the loop belt.
That needs to be clarified.
That is the way they are being interpreted.
I know that because I have asked around and I have asked people to ring up airlines to inquire about their child safety systems.
That is the information I received.
That is important.
It must be made clear and I believe it really is important.
Secondly, there are child seats on the market that fit into traditional aircraft seats and there are fairly cheap airbags for accompanying passengers that fit into anything and could prove useful.
Clearly, a child is occupying a full seat here.
Let me tell you, however, that mothers have to pay even if they hold the child on their lap - I can show you the bills, which come to more or less 60% of the adult fare depending on the airline.
I want those who already use a better system to be allowed to go on using that system.
I ask the Commissioner to tell me whether that is or is not the case.
