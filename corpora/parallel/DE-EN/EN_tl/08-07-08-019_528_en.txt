Madam President, the reason I am asking for the floor again is not because I have not spoken enough today but because I believe we really are dealing with an important issue, on which Members have also asked pertinent questions.
We expect the Commission to give us a prompt answer and then to take the appropriate action.
I want to address the question of costs.
Basically, I assume, although I do not know if my group fully supports me here, that safety is a matter for the state and must, therefore, be decided and also financed at state level.
At present we have a great many aeroplane safety belts that are not used and are not meant for anybody specific.
In the interest of the safety of our smaller citizens - a matter the Commissioner addressed specifically - we should, therefore, definitely decide to take action, to do so rapidly, and not to let funding prove an obstacle.
