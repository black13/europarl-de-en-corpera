Madam President, Commissioner, you have not answered the crucial question.
What are you doing in the interim?
There is a positive solution.
What will you do if a child is fatally injured in the meantime and you are partly responsible because you delayed taking action?
How will you deal with that?
You have to ask yourself these questions, as we do, too.
In terms of costs, there is a comparable parallel.
In the case of the rights of persons with disabilities in air transport, the costs are spread across everybody, which is only normal.
To conceive, give birth to and bring up a child is not just a private matter but a public task, a state task.
Everybody has to be prepared to take it on and also to fund it.
In my view at least, that is a matter of course.
Where children up to the age of 14 can travel by train for free, it is also the other passengers who contribute to that cost.
In the sector of air transport in particular, which is exempt from fuel tax - i.e. EUR 14 billion a year - we can surely raise a few euro to give children the best protection they need for the future.
