in writing. - I am very glad that the directive on strategic environmental assessment (SUP directive) was adopted.
Environmental compatibility assessment at the initial stage, when a project is being developed, means that any adverse effects can be prevented at once rather than having to be contained or combated at a later stage.
For the future, the SEA procedure promises to take even more account of environmental protection and health aspects when it comes to project decisions.
Sustainable development planning must, from beginning to end, include not just economic and social aspects but also environmental effects.
