on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I should like to say something about the Lambert report on the implementation of the regulation, which relates to the details of coordination of social security systems.
As the rapporteur has said, the purpose of the regulation is coordination, not harmonisation, for which we in the EU do not in any case have any legal basis.
However, some of the amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go beyond coordination and form the basis for new competencies and services.
In our opinion, for instance, it is not necessary for the Commission to be given the power to establish its own neutral central database and manage it independently, in order to ensure prompt payments to citizens.
That is the task of the Member States, which have already been performing it up to now and which, furthermore, now have to designate a liaison body for it.
For citizens seeking advice too, it is also more convenient and closer to go to the authorities of the Member States and not to a remote and anonymous Commission database.
I should therefore like to take issue with the Commissioner specifically on that point.
Nor do we consider it appropriate for every disabled insured person to be entitled to the costs of travel and stay for an accompanying person.
The payment of travel expenses for an accompanying person should be linked to the severe disability concept, which is in any case largely defined perfectly by law in the Member States.
We also believe that unemployed persons who have failed to fulfil obligations in their country of employment, in particular have not taken all the required steps to find a job there, should not be able to claim benefits in their country of residence as if they had always complied with the law.
That is not right.
The other three amendments by my Group concern periods, for all of which we consider six months sufficient.
They should not vary between 12 and 18 months.
