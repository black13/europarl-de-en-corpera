in writing. - I voted in favour of Paolo Costa's report concerning the amendment of Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community's railways.
Safety on the European rail network cannot be achieved without common objectives and joint action, which is why I very much welcome the railway package.
One of its key aspects is the authorisation of rail vehicles; according to manufacturers and railway operators, there is little technical justification for the current authorisation requirements imposed by the competent authorities.
The directives relating to the interoperability of railway systems must also be consolidated and merged.
Another good thing is that the new legislative proposal provides for clear rules on the maintenance of vehicles.
The next step is therefore a decision by the Commission in favour of a binding regulatory system for maintenance.
