in writing. - I voted in favour of ArÅ«nas Degutis's report on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community.
Moves to strengthen and improve the existing legal provisions are to be encouraged, especially as regards the transparency of air fares.
Passengers are entitled to a full breakdown of the price of their air tickets.
The new instrument will make fares more transparent and comprehensible.
In this way the European Union is acting to combat misleading advertising and to create a level playing field based on quality, not on the apparent attractiveness of deals, particularly on the Internet.
The measures to ensure compliance with welfare provisions represent another improvement made by the new instrument, giving employees better cover and more uniform working conditions.
The common rules will safeguard consumers' and employees' rights and guarantee the necessary transparency and disclosure of information on the part of air carriers in the Community.
