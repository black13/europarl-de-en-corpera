in writing. - There is no plausible reason, in my opinion, to increase the minimum number of MEPs required for the creation of a political group.
On closer inspection, the arguments advanced by the rapporteur are spurious, particularly his reference to supposedly higher thresholds for the formation of a political group in the parliaments of Member States.
If a fair comparison is to be made with the European Parliament, the equation should include only directly elected chambers.
Second chambers generally comprise delegates from federal states or regions, and for this reason they are not comparable.
The average value used by directly elected national parliaments for the formation of political groups is virtually identical to the threshold used by the European Parliament.
In any case, this move to increase the cut-off figure for the formation of political groups is evidently driven by a different agenda.
In committee, for example, the rapporteur referred to the formation of the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty (ITS) Group as an unfortunate circumstance and emphasised the need to prevent any future recurrence.
Because of this attack on democracy and freedom of expression and on the equality of MEPs which is enshrined in the Treaty and in the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, I naturally voted against this report.
