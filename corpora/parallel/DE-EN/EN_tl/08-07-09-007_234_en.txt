in writing. - As we know to our cost, the EU's aim of rapidly increasing the percentage use of biofuel has had adverse repercussions.
Monocultures, the felling of rainforests and competition with food and feed crops, which has contributed to the current food crisis, have seemingly prompted the EU ministers to think again and have dealt a blow to their target of increasing the share of renewables in the production of motor fuel to 10% by 2020.
While we should welcome the fact that biofuel is no longer to be produced from food crops and that there is a general desire to wait for second-generation biofuels such as those obtained from waste products, this must not lead in any way to a relaxation of EU efforts in the domain of renewables.
The alarming upward trend in the price of oil makes it more important than ever to promote the production and use of energy from renewable sources.
All those billions that are being spent on nuclear power generation, with all its problems, must be invested in renewables.
