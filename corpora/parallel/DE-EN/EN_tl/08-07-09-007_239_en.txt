in writing. - I voted for Reinhard Rack's report on a new culture of urban mobility.
The draft report on the Green Paper is an important contribution to the subject of urban development.
The economic development of a town or city and its accessibility depend on better mobility, but the latter must not be achieved at the expense of people's wellbeing or the environment.
For this reason, the report ought to give more consideration to social factors and employment policy.
It must also be rooted in awareness that the diversity of the Member States will not permit a uniform European solution and that strict adherence to the subsidiarity principle must therefore continue to prevail.
I also believe that, in the countries where liberalisation has already taken place, its impact on employment should be assessed.
In addition, I call for a certification system for the retrofitting of particulate filters to cars, goods vehicles and off-road vehicles.
While the Green Paper highlights most of the problems that affect urban mobility today and also presents some new and innovative ideas for solving them, it falls far short of covering all the aspects that need to be addressed and so can only be regarded as a starting point for the discussion of this issue.
