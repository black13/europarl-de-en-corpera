Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through this public signing of the legal instrument on the Galileo programme we are emphasising the importance we attach to the European satellite navigation programmes EGNOS and Galileo.
The regulation being signed today is a signal reminder that many aims can only be achieved in the framework of the European Union and not by individual Member States acting alone.
EGNOS and Galileo can and will give the European Union the means to establish a European alternative and complement to other systems.
At the same time, they will enable us to enhance the competitiveness of our industry in major strategic technological fields.
Galileo is to comprise a network of 30 satellites and a ground-control infrastructure.
The text of the regulation we shall be signing today is the result of negotiations between the European institutions which were brought to a successful conclusion at first reading.
The institutions found solutions that made it possible to establish such a highly complex technical system, particularly by agreeing on Community funding of EUR 3.4 billion.
As a result, Galileo can become operational from 2013 at the latest.
As President of the European Parliament I would like to express my very special thanks to the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Angelika Niebler, and the rapporteur of the European Parliament, Etelka Barsi-Pataky, for their successful efforts, as well as to the Slovenian Presidency for its significant commitment to this very important strategic dossier.
(Applause)
I also hope that this public signing will underline that we intend to go on working with vigour and dedication to achieve tangible progress for our citizens.
Thank you for being here today, and thank you for your attention.
I now invite the representative of the Council, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, to address us.
(Applause)
