Mr President, there has been a wave of global sympathy for the victims of the devastating earthquake in China on 12 May.
A considerable amount of international aid has poured into the country, yet within its borders distinctions have been made, anti-separatist measures going hand in hand with disaster-relief efforts.
It is utterly irrelevant whether people belong to the majority or a minority - they surely need to receive aid.
There should be no more calls to celebrate differences; that is an impracticable notion.
China would be well advised to open up at long last.
This would include free access to all parts of China for foreign observers and journalists.
NTDTV, the only uncensored television station in China, must be allowed to resume its transmissions without delay.
Many Heads of State or Government have not yet acted on the recommendation made by our European Parliament that they refrain from attending the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games.
We support the position adopted by Angela Merkel in Germany, by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, by our own President, Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, and by other leading public figures, who have decided to stay away from the ceremony on 8 August.
The President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, has said that his position will depend on the outcome of the negotiations between the Chinese and the representatives of the Dalai Lama.
The negotiations have been fruitless and will remain so; it follows that he will have to stay in Paris.
(Applause)
Before the Games, let me remind you of the Tibetans' plight.
There were more than 200 dead following the protests of 14 March, and 5 000 Tibetans have been imprisoned, most of them without trial.
Thousands have sustained injuries as a result of physical violence used in the process of patriotic re-education.
That, Mr President, is meant as a reminder to those who still intend to set off for Beijing.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
