Mr President, when President Sarkozy spoke out in the wake of the unrest in Tibet, I had a great deal of admiration for France in its role as guardian of human rights.
Since then the situation has become far worse, with the number of detainees reaching record levels.
The situation in Tibet has never been so tense.
Censorship of the media has never been so rigid as it is now.
And in my view the President's reaction is a slap in the face for those who are campaigning for human rights.
We are thwarting the hopes of all those people in China who are relying on our pressure to help them in their efforts to introduce democracy in China.
