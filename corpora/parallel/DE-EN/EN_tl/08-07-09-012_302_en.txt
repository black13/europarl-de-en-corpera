on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, let me also thank Elmar Brok, who has taken the process concept on board in this report.
I see a change of strategy between the working paper and the present report, and that is right and proper.
Past enlargements have been a success for the entire Community, even though some criticism is necessary here and there.
That, too, is only right and proper.
Nevertheless, the enlargement process is not finished.
Like many other speakers, I should like to mention the Western Balkans, which must not be consigned to a black hole, surrounded by Member States of the Union.
It is in our interests to avoid that.
We need an unequivocal enlargement strategy, not one that varies according to circumstances.
The EU must be a reliable and trustworthy partner.
This also means that we must be willing to effect reforms ourselves.
If there is currently a question mark about that willingness, we need to engage in critical self-analysis.
It is careless and erroneous to ascribe every sign of Euroscepticism to previous enlargements and fatigue.
So let us wake up!
Let us work for balanced economic, social and environmental development, and let us communicate the extent of the economic, cultural and historical enrichment that comes with enlargement.
Let us also tell people what it would cost if there were another conflagration on our borders or within Europe.
Having clear objectives and discussing them fully and openly create trust.
The Union also nurtures trust by keeping its promises, and I expect us to do that by approving this report.
