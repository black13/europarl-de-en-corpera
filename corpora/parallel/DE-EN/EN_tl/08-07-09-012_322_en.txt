Mr President, in my view the European enlargement policy has been a great success story.
Within fifty years the EU has managed to create a peaceful, democratic and prosperous continent.
What strikes me about this report on the EU enlargement strategy, however, is that it also focuses on relations between the EU and countries with no accession prospects.
This attempt to water down the enlargement strategy and blend it with the European Neighbourhood Policy poses problems.
Although the report deals with many very interesting substantive issues and makes good points, these would be at home in a report on the ENP but are out of place in an enlargement report.
I am thinking, for example, of the proposals for a Mediterranean Union and a Black Sea Union.
The enlargement policy of the EU should remain quite separate from the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Instead, I regret to say that the report contains some very vague and even confusing statements which leave room for diverse interpretations.
