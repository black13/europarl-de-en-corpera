Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Brok report the European Parliament demonstrates very clearly that it has learned the lessons of the last major wave of enlargement which saw the accession of twelve new Member States and that it has been able to catalogue all the resulting problems while effectively highlighting all the benefits that enlargement has brought to both the new and the old Member States.
The main thing, however, is to draw the appropriate conclusions, and this it has done, particularly in two areas to which I attach importance.
First of all, we shall have to examine the absorption capacity of the European Union prior to any future enlargement and, secondly, candidate countries really will have to meet the criteria before they are admitted.
When we come to discuss the absorption capacity of the European Union, I believe there are important points to consider, such as the principle that new accessions must not jeopardise the European integration project.
By this I mean that the Union's development impetus and the pursuit of its aims must be boosted, not deflected, by the admission of new Member States.
The institutional framework of the Union must first be created and consolidated.
The fact is that we need a treaty, be it the Treaty of Lisbon or another adequate treaty, and enlargement must also be affordable for the European Union, otherwise it would jeopardise the integration project.
Our overarching aim is continued progress.
Subsequent accessions of additional countries should not be excluded, but everything must be done in accordance with rules and conditions.
