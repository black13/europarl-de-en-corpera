Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr Ryan, as I said it is an official proposal, which the Commission agreed as early as 2004.
Since then, the Council has still not adopted the proposal.
I pointed out that we have now put the proposal forward again, in the context of the Small Business Act; basically that means we are presenting it again.
It is not an announcement; it is something the Commission has already proposed.
It regards it as necessary.
A short time ago Mr Å pidla referred, in the context of another answer, to the need for unanimity on certain issues.
Here too we need unanimity and unfortunately it was not achieved.
I am sure I need not tell you, who represents Ireland, that a whole number of Member States regard questions of tax in the European Union as a taboo subject.
