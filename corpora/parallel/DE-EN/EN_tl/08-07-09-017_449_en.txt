Vice-President of the Commission. - The measurements we are conducting now and that are nearly concluded will give us exact information about which European rules give rise to which costs.
We will then be in a position to say which specific European rule gives rise to precisely which costs for enterprises.
Of course we already know quite a lot.
For instance, we already know that most of the costs go back to a very small number of rules.
The vast majority of rules come from no more than some 42 directives.
We also know which area gives rise to the highest costs, namely European company law, which is why we have now put forward the first proposals relating to that area.
We also know that the distribution of costs varies widely, depending on the size of the enterprise.
As a rule of thumb we can assume that the smaller the enterprise, the heavier the relative burden of administrative costs.
Those costs may easily be far higher than 5% in the case of very small enterprises, while being considerably lower for very large ones.
We know all that anyway and it will be taken into account in the proposals.
Let me take this opportunity to make a request to Parliament.
Whether this whole project succeeds will, of course, depend very much on whether Parliament deals with the Commission's proposals rapidly.
We do, after all, have a general political agreement on them.
I just wanted to point out that it certainly involves amending existing legislation, which requires the assent of both co-legislators.
Subject: Price of fertiliser
The price of fertiliser has gone up dramatically over the last 12 months.
Ammonia phosphate, for instance, has increased from EUR 181 per tonne to EUR 800 per tonne in wholesale markets.
Does the Commission plan to take any action to counteract this price hike?
