Vice-President of the Commission. - As regards Russia and Ukraine as major supply countries, I must point out that we are applying trade protection instruments to fertiliser exports from both countries.
To put it quite simply: both countries can of course offer fertiliser at low prices because they know that the energy required to produce fertiliser is particularly high and they apply different prices for exported energy and for energy used in their own country.
That price difference leads to dumping, which is why we have applied the appropriate measures in relation to Russia and the Ukraine.
On diversifying supplies, the Commission has little margin for influence here.
I can tell you, however, that as far as I know the large European producers and distributors are naturally seeking to diversify their raw materials basis.
I am quite prepared to look into this question again in more detail.
