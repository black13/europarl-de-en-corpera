Vice-President of the Commission. - Mrs Fischer Boel is here, which is why I will answer very carefully, because she is the one who really knows about the prices that European farmers can achieve.
On the basis of what she has told the Commission to date, I assume that producer prices are indeed rising for all important EU products.
I do not deny, however, that you may be right in saying that the higher harvest prices do not necessarily make up entirely for the rises in costs.
That is a point the Commission will certainly address.
Regarding developments in the food sector in general - and here we are not talking just about producer prices but are also concerned with what the consumer eventually has to pay - a few weeks ago we launched an initiative and set up a high-level group to consider the future of the European food industry, which, and not everybody knows this, is the biggest European industry.
Many people actually think the automobile sector is the biggest European industry, but that is not true.
The food industry is the biggest one of all in Europe.
In this high-level group we are looking very specifically at price trends and we will conclude our work by the end of the year, when we will make the appropriate recommendations.
Subject: Policy in favour of small enterprises
