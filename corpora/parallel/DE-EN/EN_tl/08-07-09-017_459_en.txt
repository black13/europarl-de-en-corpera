Vice-President of the Commission. - Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I am very grateful for your support.
Of course, I knew I would be able to rely on you entirely in this matter, just as you can rely on me entirely.
Regarding the density of the network, I must admit that we have not yet achieved the desired density throughout Europe.
When we complete the project, as we will do over the next five months, every region in Europe will have one of those facilities.
There will be contact points in every region, located near enough to the enterprises to ensure nobody will have any difficulty in accessing them.
