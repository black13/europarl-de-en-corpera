on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, I am in favour of introducing uniform conditions for issuing visas in order to prevent what is called visa shopping.
I am, however, opposed on principle to including biometric data in visas, especially in the case of small children.
I find that totally inappropriate.
Moreover, we cannot propose to fingerprint six-year olds without, for instance, first being able to produce a broadly-based independent study on the use of fingerprints of children of that age and without knowing how long such children's fingerprints can be kept in the first place.
I do not think we can or should pass laws on that kind of basis.
I also see problems with implementing the proposed new regulation.
All applicants, including children, are now supposed to appear in person at the consulate in order to be fingerprinted.
That may be too much to expect of people living in remote areas in large countries.
It could mean that the less well-off, especially families, will find it almost impossible to apply for a visa to travel to the European Union.
Is that really the image the European Union wants to project abroad?
The Council and the Commission are trying to counter that by looking to the private sector.
They propose giving external service providers the right to receive visa applications and biometric data and forward them to the appropriate consulates.
The costs involved are then actually to be passed on to the applicants.
And that is not all!
In my view that is not the way to ensure that all these extremely sensitive data are kept safe and confidential.
It is, therefore, essential to ensure that outsourcing, which should in any case only be allowed under the most stringent conditions, is permitted only on premises that enjoy diplomatic protection.
On this issue, I emphatically support the rapporteur.
