Madam President, this House has a strong tradition of human rights, of which we can be proud.
This applies not least to our policies on China and Tibet.
That is why I find it all the more regrettable that our resolution today does not live up to these requirements in any way.
In an historic moment, it did not have the strength to raise what should have been raised in the run-up to the Olympic Games in China.
Therefore let me state categorically: our President, Mr PÃ¶ttering, has represented our human rights principles unequivocally over the last few months.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has done the same, clearly and impressively.
I should therefore like to call upon this House to return to the clear statements of its policy on China and Tibet in past years and decades and regard this resolution as a moment of weakness before the summer recess.
