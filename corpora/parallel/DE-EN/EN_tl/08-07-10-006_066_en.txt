Madam President, I voted in favour of the Brok report, as I believe that it is an important step in the right direction.
I also endorse the communication policy it calls for.
However, communication also involves truth and clarity.
It is time we finally stated clearly that Croatia can and should join the EU within the current decade.
The countries of South-East Europe have definite prospects of joining the EU in the next decade, but truth and clarity also require an acknowledgment that pushing ahead with the accession of Turkey would undermine the EU.
We should therefore be honest with our partner, Turkey, and say at last that we shall have to find other ways of cooperating.
Although the Brok report does not actually put it this way, this is the logical conclusion from its contents, which are as they should be.
