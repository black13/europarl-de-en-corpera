Madam President, I am of the opinion that the way we are doing this is not consistent with the good reputation this House enjoys.
It is unacceptable for the whole Chamber to be chatting when speakers rise to speak.
I would exhort you, Madam President, to keep the Chamber quiet and to ensure that those who are not listening leave the room.
