As coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like to give an explanation of vote on my own behalf and that of my group colleagues.
All groups are united in the fight against racism and against every form of ethnic discrimination, and in promoting human rights.
There is no question but that the PPE-DE Group shares the desire to see light shed on the events in Italy.
In the resolution, we refer mainly to press reports and to documents and testimonies from a range of organisations and individuals.
Most Members were unable to form an idea of the situation using their own resources.
The Italian authorities have invited representatives of Parliament to travel to Italy to find out more, and have also offered to provide further information.
The Commissioner responsible, Jacques Barrot, has promised to present an informative report by the end of July, and our group was keen to wait for this.
Our aim was, and still is, to clarify the facts properly first of all.
That is why we wanted to postpone voting on the resolution until the September part-session.
Unfortunately, our motion was rejected, along with a series of amendments that had been tabled, which is why we voted as we did.
The PPE-DE Group continues to hold the view that a thorough investigation would have been more worthwhile than this resolution, which was adopted in haste.
Our opponents were aiming only to hit the headlines and did the people concerned a disservice in the process.
