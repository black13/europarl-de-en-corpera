Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were to summarise this morning's debate, I would say that it is good that France holds the Presidency at this time, and good that you, President Sarkozy, occupy the position of President-in-Office of the Council.
This has been a good day for Europe and for this Parliament, as for the first time in a long time we again have before us somebody who speaks for Europe with passion, not just with good arguments.
Perhaps that is just what we need to win over the Irish and to win back our citizens: passion and good judgement, and good judgement includes Europe confining itself to certain limits.
I should like to give you the 'secret of success': we need not only the Treaty in Ireland, but also a new culture of subsidiarity.
We need boundaries for Europe in relation to the rest of the world, but we also need boundaries within Europe.
A new culture of subsidiarity will bring renewed approval to Europe; I am in total agreement with President Barroso on that.
Good luck, President Sarkozy.
