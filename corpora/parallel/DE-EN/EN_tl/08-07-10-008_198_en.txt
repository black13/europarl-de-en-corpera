Thank you very much, Mr President, you are most kind.
President Sarkozy, it is nice that you want to draw closer to socialism in this way.
Having strongly supported the positions of the German Social Democrats in your speech just now and thus distanced yourself from Chancellor Merkel, I propose that you proceed as follows.
If you feel so comfortable within the European social democratic fold, come first to German social democracy and we shall take you gradually closer to French social democracy and, by the end, you will be a really good comrade.
