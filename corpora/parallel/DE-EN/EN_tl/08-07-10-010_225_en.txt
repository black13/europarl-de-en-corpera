Mr President, I have just looked it up, and it is true that Rule 149(3) states that, provided 40 of them do so together, Members may request that it be established whether or not the quorum is present.
The quorum shall exist if one third of Parliament's Members are present in the Chamber.
The President responds to such a request by establishing whether or not the quorum exists.
Then comes paragraph 4, which you mentioned, which states that 'Members who have asked for the quorum to be established shall be counted as being present [...], even if they are no longer in the Chamber.'
We are presently in a sitting that has resumed and, in my view, Members who were present and said they wanted the quorum established should be counted as present even if they are not here in plenary this afternoon.
That is how I understand paragraph 4.
I hear that you have received a request from 40 Members of this House for you to establish this afternoon whether the quorum is present or not.
You can look around - one third of 785 is a little over 200, and there are about 30 of us here.
Try as we might, we are unlikely to reach 200 this afternoon unless everybody turns up.
Mr President, we can discuss the matter but, if you determine that the number of Members present does not reach one third, then we cannot vote.
That is what the Rules of Procedure say.
