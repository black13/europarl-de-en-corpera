Mr President, Mr Onesta asked me how I read Rule 149(4).
I do understand that Mr Posselt and others are saying that we should act anyway, even if we do not keep to the Rules of Procedure.
I am delighted with the Member's argument: either we have Rules of Procedure and keep to them, or we do not keep to them and therefore do not need them.
I may be Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but it was Members before me who made this rule and adopted it in plenary with an absolute majority.
Paragraph 4 is quite clear.
It states: 'Members who have asked for the quorum to be established shall be counted as being present [...], even if they are no longer in the Chamber.'
That is clear.
If 40 Members, who were present at the sitting in Strasbourg, request that the vote or quorum be established, then they will be added to the number of those present.
That is how I read it.
If you wish to have it otherwise, then you have to change paragraph 4 but, as for now, it reads as it reads.
Mr Posselt, anyone who reads it must understand it that way; there is no other way to understand it.
Therefore, Mr President, now it is up to you to take a decision.
