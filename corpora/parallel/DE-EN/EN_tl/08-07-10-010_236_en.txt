Mr President, Mr Leinen has accused me of suggesting that we ignore the Rules of Procedure.
I was present when it was adopted, and you were not.
The context was that, previously, 40 Members used to come into the Chamber, ask for the quorum to be established, and then leave.
That is what the rule is about.
