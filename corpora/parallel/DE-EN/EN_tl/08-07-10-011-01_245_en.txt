author. - Mr President, we have often discussed the conflict in Kashmir here, and I must add that there was a time of hope, of rapprochement between Pakistan and India.
It was hoped that the situation would ease.
Alas, the domestic political crises in both nations have brought a renewed hardening and we, the European Parliament, are working very hard to get the situation moving again.
I am very grateful to Mr Gahler, who, as Chief Observer of our Elections Observation Mission in Pakistan, has worked so hard for democracy in Pakistan and to ensure that our contacts with India serve the same goal and that we are supporting confidence-building.
One might wonder why we are addressing mass graves, as this will not bring the dead back to life and may worsen the climate between the two countries.
We are doing it because real peace can only be created when there is justice for the victims - and there are victims not just with Pakistani or Indian passports.
There are victims on both sides, and the main victim is the Kashmiri people.
That is why we must investigate these mass graves, we must determine where the many people are who have disappeared and are being mourned by their families.
Only then can the confidence be established that is necessary for a truly peaceful solution that people also feel they are part of.
Kashmir belongs first and foremost to the Kashmiri people themselves.
We should therefore support a solution that finally gives the Kashmiris some breathing space, finally creates political freedom and provides a sensible compromise solution, for this is one of the longest-running conflicts of all.
It has been raging since the Second World War, and it is scandalous that nobody has yet managed to bring the problem under control.
We therefore support all efforts to carry out these investigations and help give the victims the dignity and justice they deserve.
