Mr President, the European Union has a major interest in democratic conditions and respect for human rights in Bangladesh.
I also join the call for free and fair elections and the lifting of emergency measures in the near future.
Clearly, there cannot be any democratic debate in a climate of fear and intimidation.
We make our demands to the caretaker government, that is true, but we must also point out that the political powers that be in Bangladesh also have a rather uncultured style, and that things do not happen peacefully, but very violently, particularly during election campaigns.
Election campaigns are invariably used to intimidate minorities.
Thus our message is directed to all the actors, primarily to the government, but also to the parties.
Nevertheless, Mr President, I respect your decision, but I should just like to point out that our Rules of Procedure state that, 'If the vote shows that the quorum is not present, the vote shall be placed on the agenda of the next sitting.'
(Rule 149(3)).
I should hope that such votes take place not with 30 Members present, but 600, which is always the case for midday votes.
