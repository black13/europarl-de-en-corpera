Mr President, looking at the agenda and assuming that the debate on Georgia takes place today, we do not have any specific requests.
However, if there are delays and the sitting overruns, with the result that the debate on Georgia cannot take place until tomorrow, then we would move that the debate on the social package be postponed until the September II part-session for, in my view, it will be impossible for us to debate the social package and Georgia in a single morning.
I just wanted to give the House advance notice, as it were.
