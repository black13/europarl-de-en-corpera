Thank you, Mr Swoboda.
There was no interpretation, I believe, particularly into English, if I have identified the colleagues concerned correctly.
Let me repeat what Mr Swoboda has just said.
Mr Swoboda said that, if the debate on today's Summit does not take place today but happens tomorrow, the debate on the social package should then be postponed until the September II part-session, as the time allocated for this debate will then be taken up talking about today's Summit.
That is as I understand it.
Do we agree on that?
It seems we do.
That brings us to the one-minute speeches on important political issues under Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure.
