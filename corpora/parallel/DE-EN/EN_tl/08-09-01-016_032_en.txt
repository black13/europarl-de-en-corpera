Thank you.
The Lisbon Treaty is explicit: I would ask you to bear with me as I have just made the same point in my speech to the European Council.
Solidarity between the Member States in the energy sphere is a principle laid down in the Lisbon Treaty.
This means that should one EU Member State be faced with a threat to cut off its energy supplies, all the other Member States would have a duty to support it.
For this reason, it is particularly important that the Lisbon Treaty be ratified.
I apologise for reiterating the point, but the Treaty is very important for the energy sphere in particular.
