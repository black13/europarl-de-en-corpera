Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after yesterday's Sunday service in my home town, our Indian priest reported on the atrocities being committed in his home country.
For the last week, Christians in the state of Orissa in East India have been subjected to a campaign of persecution, humiliation, abuse and murder.
By the end of last week, this had left 26 people dead, with 41 churches destroyed, four monasteries in flames and many Christian homes in ruins.
People are taking refuge in the forests, praying for safety from the Hindu fanatics.
This is not the first attack on Christians, which is why some 60 000 Christians in Orissa have now fled their homes.
The present conflict was triggered by the murder of a spiritual leader and member of the World Hindu Council on 23 August.
Father Saji from my village has asked our parish to pray for the victims, but we can do more than that.
I utterly condemn these crimes against humanity.
The European Parliament must urge the Indian Government to guarantee the right to life and liberty of Christians in Orissa.
