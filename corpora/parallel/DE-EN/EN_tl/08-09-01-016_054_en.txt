Madam President, on 14 August 2008 the departure time of a Ryanair flight from Austria to the United Kingdom was postponed until the following day.
The company then guaranteed that they would reimburse passengers' hotel and transfer costs and, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, an information leaflet was distributed, pointing out passengers' rights in the event of a flight being delayed or cancelled.
When one passenger applied to Ryanair to refund the additional costs, the airline refused to pay, without giving any precise reasons for its decision.
Ryanair's refusal to pay is a clear contravention of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 which specifies the assistance to be provided for air passengers throughout the EU.
In the event of a delay, or more particularly the postponement of a flight until the following day, passengers have a right to compensation which is regulated by law.
Low-cost airlines such as Ryanair must also comply with the law and adhere to the Regulation.
This type of thing is happening more and more frequently, at European air passengers' expense, and it really is time that the European Commission took some action.
