Mr President, I also believe that we have an excellent result from our rapporteur which takes account of security on the one hand and practicability on the other.
However, we have also heard that, if we look to the future, one of the key concerns is the issue of overstayers, in other words people who enter the EU legally but fail to leave our territory and vanish from view on expiry of their visas.
I should just like to add this to the debate: over the long term, if the entry and exit system is to work, we will need to have systematic checks.
We will not be able to avoid these, and we need to be looking at this issue at Europe's external borders.
