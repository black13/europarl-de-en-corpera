The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Georgia.
I should like to welcome the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, President-in-Office of the Council and a former Member of this European Parliament, Mr Kouchner.
I also welcome the Secretary of State for European Affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet.
In particular I welcome the responsible Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
I also welcome Jacques Barrot who unfortunately is leaving us.
The European Council has just ended, but Minister Bernard Kouchner will undoubtedly tell us all about it himself.
