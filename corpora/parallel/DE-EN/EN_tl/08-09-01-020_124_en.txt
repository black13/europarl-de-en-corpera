Could I say to the next speaker that, at the next Conference of Presidents, we will be looking at the order of the political groups as one objection has already been raised.
For today, I will call Mr Szyma≈Ñski next, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
We will be looking at this matter on Thursday, as no one can explain to me why the order is as it is.
It is an issue that needs to be clarified systematically.
