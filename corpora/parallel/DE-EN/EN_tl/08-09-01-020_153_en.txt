Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution is the most positive achievement since the ceasefire agreement and contains most of the demands made by Elmar Brok and myself, on behalf of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, after our visit to Georgia.
However, this is not enough.
The European Union still has a role to play and our credibility is at stake.
The resolution must be followed by resolute joint action, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has made clear with her encouraging statement today.
We must implement this resolution down to the last dot and comma, just as we are demanding Russia's full compliance, down to the last dot and comma, with the six-point plan.
What is more, over recent weeks, we have seen how important the European Union is and can be, but we have also seen where our weaknesses lie and where we have to take action - including preventive action - to remedy them.
Yes, we can be mediators, but if that is what we want, we must have a common European foreign policy, a pro-active foreign, security and defence policy.
We have also felt acutely, over recent weeks, the lack of a common position - indeed, the lack of political will to achieve a common position - and, even now, the lack of a shared resolve.
The absence of the Lisbon Treaty is weakening us.
Reconstruction is not enough.
We must invest in these countries' independence and cut the ground away from nationalism.
Engagement by the EU is more important than the prospect of NATO membership.
Commissioner, you have said, very eloquently, that there can be no more 'business as usual' towards Russia, and that our policy needs to be reappraised.
We must invest in economic, democratic, social and educational stability.
It is not just about money.
We must also expand our Neighbourhood Policy and put forward practical projects such as those you have announced today.
We look forward to that.
