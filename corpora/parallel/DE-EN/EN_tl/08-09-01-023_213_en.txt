representing the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report and the good cooperation.
There are three points in particular which I should like to mention: firstly, consumers' interests; secondly, the principle of subsidiarity, and thirdly, relevance.
We believe it is far more in line with consumers' interests not to convert voluntary legal expenses schemes for motor insurance in Europe into a compulsory scheme.
We do not need mandatory product bundling or product integration which would simply push up the price of insurance and restrict consumer choice.
On the issue of subsidiarity, I welcome the fact that the rapporteur is not attempting to drive forward harmonisation at all costs.
The countries in which some legal costs are already covered by motor insurance can continue with this type of scheme without other countries being forced to follow suit.
As to the issue of relevance, I would remind the House that we are dealing with an issue which, in numerical terms, is of only very limited relevance.
Cross-border accidents account for only around 1% of road traffic accidents in Europe, and almost all of them are settled out of court.
I congratulate the rapporteur on the report.
