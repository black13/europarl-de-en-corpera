on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking my colleague Nickolay Mladenov for his truly excellent work on this very difficult issue.
His own-initiative report covers all the key problems and does so quite outstandingly.
Nonetheless, I would point out that this report is just one little piece of the puzzle in people's everyday dealings with the EU.
Mr Karas has rightly pointed out that cross-border accidents account for a very small percentage of road traffic accidents and that most of them are settled out of court.
However, a major German weekly newspaper published an article last week which described how an ordinary citizen wished to re-register a German car in Italy, only to fail eight months later, having realised that it is simply not possible.
Citizens dealing with this type of problem on an individual basis feel extremely unhappy about it.
That is why the report, with its incentive for voluntary schemes, is the right approach.
However, the Member States have a role to play in determining whether harmonisation of compensation law in the European Union might not, in the long term, be a far better solution which is more in line with citizens' interests.
Here in Parliament and especially in the Committee on Legal Affairs, we have dealt with the issue of non-contractual damages - in the case of Rome II, for example - on various occasions and it is now up to the Member States to look at which alternative solutions they can identify, if harmonisation of compensation law and the adoption of legal costs as damages is not possible for this House due to the issue of competence.
This is an issue which we will need to resolve in future.
That being the case, Mr Mladenov's proposal is outstanding and deserves our support.
