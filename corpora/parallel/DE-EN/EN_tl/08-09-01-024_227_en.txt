draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, thank you for the good cooperation and your report.
I have four points to make.
Firstly, we believe that we need to stress that fiscal fraud is not something that can be combated in isolation and that a coordinated approach is essential, both among the individual Member States and with third countries.
Secondly, the planned pilot projects to fight carousel fraud are a good idea and we take note of these, but we would make the point that this must not lead to any deterioration in framework conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Thirdly, we expressly support the Commission's proposals for amendment of the VAT Directive and the Council Regulation on administrative cooperation in this area.
Fourthly, I am pleased that the discussion on a general lifting of banking secrecy is something which did not command a majority in any committee and has now been resoundingly rejected by a large majority.
