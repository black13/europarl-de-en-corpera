Mr President, I rise for two reasons: firstly, because this is an issue - as Mr Langen has said - that has been on our agenda for many years and we really should be asking why no progress is being made, especially when it comes to VAT evasion.
Secondly, it is unacceptable to the vast majority of Europeans that here we are discussing tax evasion and fraud - taxpayers' money - so hypocritically without addressing the problems here in our midst.
The European Parliament, as represented by many MEPs, is a hotbed of fraud.
We can read about it in the Galvin report and elsewhere, but attempts are being made to sweep this under the carpet.
I need only mention Chichester, Purvis or certain Liberal MEPs.
It is scandalous.
Unless we address the cases of fraud in our own ranks, we lack any credibility and have no right to criticise others.
I urge OLAF, but particularly the parliamentary administration and parliamentary groups, to establish clarity here.
It is outrageous that attempts are being made to hush things up, here of all places.
