Mr President, in my view, a European response to constant waves of price rises and increasing poverty is long overdue, and indeed it is gratifying that the new draft EU-wide social package makes a start in the right direction.
The intention to facilitate access to health care in other European countries, for example, is to be welcomed.
In practice, holidaymakers, for instance, are all too often shamelessly exploited today, being presented with doctors' bills for which they are only partly reimbursed, if at all, when they go back home.
Conversely, individual Member States owe each other millions of euros - mere declarations of intent are not enough in such cases.
Nor is it sufficient to beat the drum for causes such as a better balance between family and working life.
So that more people can afford to have children, it is essential to act against wage dumping and social dumping - a task which, sad to say, is being largely neglected.
It is a travesty that the EU decrees, on the one hand, that public contracts must be put out to public tender and that the clause requiring successful tenderers to pay at least the statutory minimum wage is then revoked by the European Court of Justice on the grounds of incompatibility with the directives on services in the internal market and on the posting of workers.
In this the EU has shown its true colours as a purely economic community that fobs off the socially underprivileged with peanuts and empty words.
Empty catchphrases can no longer pacify the citizens of the EU, nor can they cushion the impact of a falling birth rate and increasing poverty.
Maybe you can say what you like on paper, but people are undoubtedly tired of empty promises.
