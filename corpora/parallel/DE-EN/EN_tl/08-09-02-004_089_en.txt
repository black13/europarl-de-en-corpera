Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot conceal my disappointment at the statements from the Council and the Commission.
Many words were spoken about the European social model, and some of the Commission's proposals overshoot the mark, in my opinion - my fellow group members have made several points about the anti-discrimination directive.
When it comes to the nuts and bolts of legislation designed to protect workers, however, the Council and the Commission bottle out.
The President-in-Office did, however, refer to the compromise adopted in June on agency and other temporary work, but somehow or other - I believe it was out of shame - the Council and the Commission managed to adopt the Working Time Directive.
What the Council adopted in June, I have to say, is by no means a glorious chapter in the history of Europe's social model.
Before I entered Parliament, I was a doctor on the staff of a hospital, and I know that many salaried doctors and many other employees were initially pleased when the European Court of Justice ruled that time spent on call constituted working time.
I also know, however, that there are difficulties in implementing this ruling and that time spent on call may have to be weighted on the basis of costs and frequency of call-outs.
What the Council has done, however, in virtually reversing the ruling of the Court of Justice and even ignoring the improvements that the Commission's proposal had made to some aspects of the previous legal position is unacceptable.
We need a compromise, and this Parliament pointed the way at first reading with proposals such as the use of a quotient.
But if a doctor is on call in a hospital, for instance, and a patient with a life-threatening condition could arrive at any moment, that cannot be regarded as a rest period, which would be possible under the Council's compromise.
This is another area where further improvement is needed, otherwise the whole debate on the European social model will serve no purpose.
