Mr President, I merely have a list of questions to ask.
Why so little so late?
Why did we declare last September that 2008 was to be the year of Social Europe but not regard social welfare as one of the priorities of the Council Presidency?
Why did the Right wage such a lengthy struggle against social rights in the Services Directive if they are portraying themselves today as true advocates of social justice?
Why did my committee vote in July against the Hamon report and in favour of the Handzlik report, the exact opposite of what has been stated here today?
Why have these things happened?
Please be honest and say what you are really doing instead of giving the public the opposite message.
I simply must ask you to do that; it is really vital.
But why do you pursue such policies?
Purely and simply because you on the Right have espoused the wrong philosophy.
You assume that people are there to serve the economy.
We Socialists take the opposite view, namely that the economy is there to serve the people, and we must fashion our policies accordingly.
