Mr President, I feel compelled to say that this social agenda leaves me stone-cold.
Not a single nettle has been firmly grasped.
This surely cannot be a serious attempt to reform European works councils, since it makes no provision for more meetings or for sanction mechanisms in the event of infringements.
The absence of any willingness to reform the Posting of Workers Directive is equally unacceptable.
Commissioner, the lack of a clear position on working hours in a social agenda is further evidence that this Commission does not baulk at the idea of 65-hour working weeks either.
This no longer bears any relation to the European social model to which my group aspires and which we Socialists are seeking to establish.
May I also say to the Council that it is intolerable how you are putting management and labour organisations under pressure - to put it politely - over the European works councils.
My group will not have any part in this charade.
If Europe's labour force is not to turn its back completely on the European Union, we must afford it better protection from the effects of globalisation and waste no time in paving the way for cross-border collective wage agreements.
