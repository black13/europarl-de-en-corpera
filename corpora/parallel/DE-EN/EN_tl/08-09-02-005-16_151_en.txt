Mr President, as I indicated before the vote, there is an oral compromise amendment that I discussed with Mrs Weber and Mr Demetriou - a compromise between amendments 37 and 39.
The compromise amendment would read as follows:
'Other forms of offences where there are factual indications that a criminal organisation or serious crimes are involved.'
That is how the compromise would be worded, and both amendments 37 and 19 would then be covered.
(The oral amendment was accepted.)
