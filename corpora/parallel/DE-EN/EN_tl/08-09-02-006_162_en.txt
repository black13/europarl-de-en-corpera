Mr President, I was unable to give my explanation because of the noise level, and I would like to do that now.
I voted for the Kaufmann report because of the need to make it clear that the European Judicial Network is a necessity, since it has functioned effectively over the last ten years in conjunction with the system of judicial assistance.
It is now a matter of making a clear distinction between the Network and Eurojust.
Both institutions have their justification.
The aim is that Eurojust and the European Judicial Network should complement each other or cooperate, as appropriate, and thus guarantee security for the Member States.
