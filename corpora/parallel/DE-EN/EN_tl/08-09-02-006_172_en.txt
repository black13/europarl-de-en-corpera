Mr President, this report is about strengthening Eurojust.
This is another set of instruments whose ultimate purpose is to intensify police cooperation and make it effective.
It has become apparent that very many institutions are involved in judicial cooperation within a given country.
Our proposal for the establishment of a coordination system within and between Member States therefore makes very good sense, simply because it guarantees efficient cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and other forms of organised crime.
One particularly heartening measure I wish to highlight is that liaison magistrates are to be established in non-EU countries, similar to what we already have in the police framework, so that cooperation with those countries can then be improved accordingly.
In short, this system will enable us to build another cordon sanitaire to protect the European Union.
