Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Bowles report includes an examination of the problem of VAT fraud - and rightly so, for it runs to EUR 20 billion a year.
I support the proposals on this matter.
It is important to point out, however, that we need a change of system - structural reform - in this area.
What we have been hearing from the Commission in this context has never been more than a statement of intent to step up intergovernmental cooperation in this matter and to engage in evaluation, research and so on.
Given the volume of fraud that is taking place, it is high time the Commission abandoned its passive stance and supported the reformist Member States that actually intend to introduce this reverse-charge procedure.
This is also a call to Mr Kov√°cs to have an overdue rethink on this issue.
I hope that we shall receive an appropriate proposal before this parliamentary term is over and that the proposals from the Austrian and German Governments will be endorsed.
