in writing. - After ten years of beating about the bush, we still cannot agree on effective methods with which we can put a stop to VAT fraud - which, after all, involves the evasion of taxes equivalent to between 2 and 2.5% of Europe's economic output.
The reverse-charge system looks quite nice on paper but still seems too embryonic, which is why most of the calls we have been hearing are still for better cooperation between Member States.
Particularly in the area of fraud, we have some Member States with a conspicuously high degree of susceptibility to fraud and with lax controls, compounded by the prevalence of an unacceptable laissez-faire attitude to recovery.
It strikes me that the parliamentary report does not deliver an emphatic message or offer any new solutions, which is why I have abstained.
