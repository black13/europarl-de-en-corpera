in writing. - Strengthening the Visa Information System (VIS) is undoubtedly a good way to make combating fraud easier in future and - provided that data protection is ensured - is therefore to be welcomed.
Nonetheless, if the collection of fingerprints and face scans is necessary for the granting of Schengen visas in future, this will lead to quite considerable upheavals in the embassies concerned.
In the debate in Germany, it has been suggested that some embassies have neither the personnel nor the facilities to cope with this change.
The possible outsourcing of data storage to external companies, which is also under discussion, gives grave cause for concern, however, and could potentially open the way for future visa scandals.
The VIS has positive aspects, but overall, it has not been properly thought through, which is why I was unable to vote in favour of the report.
