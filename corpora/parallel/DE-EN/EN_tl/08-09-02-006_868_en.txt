in writing. - I voted for Mihael Brejc's report on the use of the Visa Information System under the Schengen Borders Code.
The common rules for the external borders of the Schengen area must be amended, and the use of the Visa Information System must be made more efficient and uniform.
These things must be done very judiciously and carefully, since data privacy and human rights are always paramount and must be respected.
Blanket checking of fingerprints at the borders with the aid of the Visa Information System will lead to unnecessarily long queues and to lengthy delays at border crossing points, even for people who do not require visas.
The report now proposes only random searches of the information system.
Officers on duty at the border will continue to check whether incoming travellers meet all the requirements for entry to the EU, but they can also decide themselves whether to do a VIS search as well.
This approach will still guarantee a very high level of security but will ensure that people are not kept waiting at border crossings any longer than is strictly necessary.
