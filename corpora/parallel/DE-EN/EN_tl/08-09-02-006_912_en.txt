in writing. - It is counterproductive to encourage our own people to learn on the one hand but come up with 'blue card' plans on the other, as the increase in atypical employment and fiercer competitive pressure have already ensured that good basic and further training is no longer a defence against unemployment.
There are enough well-qualified people who are rejected by companies simply because they are out to employ the cheapest possible holders of PhD or Masters' degrees in McJobs or no longer wish to offer anything other than atypical employment contracts.
There is a fundamental need to launch training offensives in order to eliminate the shortage of skilled labour which is used to justify the present state of affairs.
If that proves impossible, preference should be given to a seasonal-migrant model.
This will prevent the recurrence of waves of mass immigration.
