That was an important interim debate on the budget.
You were all very quick to refer to the crisis and the war in Georgia.
As you know, I made a statement to the European Council on that issue yesterday, and I sense that the opinion I expressed yesterday is shared by all sides in the European institutions.
Thank you.
