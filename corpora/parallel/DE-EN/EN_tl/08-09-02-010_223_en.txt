draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Madam President, the interest of the Committee on Budgets in the legislation on electronic communication, the so-called telecom package, is naturally focused on the part involving expenditure from the European budget.
In other words, we are interested in the agency - the European Electronic Communications Market Authority proposed by the Commission and renamed the Body of European Regulators in Telecommunications (BERT) by our colleagues in the specialised committee.
To put it plainly, as things stand, we do not have enough money under subheading 1a for this agency in either form.
For this reason, we very much welcome the fact that the lead committee has taken our amendments on board in its report and is proposing a structure that puts less strain on our budget.
We must all work together, however, to ensure that we make BERT a European body and that we in the European Parliament retain control of it.
I must also remind the House that, under Article 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, Parliament and the Council must reach agreement on the funding of BERT.
