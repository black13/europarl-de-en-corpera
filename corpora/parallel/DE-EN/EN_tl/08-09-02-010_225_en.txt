draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion on the first part - better lawmaking - in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I refer the House to my written opinion, but there are three points to which I attach particular importance.
The first is the promotion and development of fibre-optic networks, known as next-generation networks.
In order to promote these networks, consideration must be given to risk-sharing for the funding of new facilities and to sharing of ducts.
Besides the telecommunications companies, other public enterprises must also be involved in duct-sharing.
My second point - and this has already been touched upon - is that the Commission's centralisation drive, pursued by means of the authority, the right of veto and comitology procedure, must be firmly resisted.
Thirdly, the precise distribution of frequencies should not be laid down until numerous preliminary questions have been answered.
Does responsibility lie with the EU?
For which aspects is it competent?
What is the real extent of the digital dividend?
And what is the impact of specific distribution models?
Secondary services such as wireless microphone systems must not be endangered, for such systems are responsible for major transmissions of events such as the Olympic Games.
For that reason the results of the current studies by specialised bodies must be taken into account in the political decision-making process on the distribution of the frequency spectrum.
I hope that we shall then jointly achieve European added value for all stakeholders.
