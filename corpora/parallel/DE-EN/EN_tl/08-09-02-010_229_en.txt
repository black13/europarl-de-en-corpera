draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, allow me, in the space of sixty seconds, to make a few brief remarks on behalf of my honourable colleague Bernard Rapkay.
Particularly for us Socialists, the creation of a smooth-functioning internal market in telecommunication services is a very high priority.
We welcome the active role of the Commission in this domain.
In particular, consumers must be protected against the obvious abuses of power on the part of the large operators.
There is clearly still plenty of room for fee reductions.
The Commission's initiatives on roaming show that interventions in price-setting are necessary in a market economy too.
We prefer to see the visible hand of the Commission than feel the invisible hand of the market, which is often the hand of a pickpocket in consumers' purses and wallets.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - I shall conclude, Madam President, by thanking all the rapporteurs and especially Catherine Trautmann, who has done a tremendous job, as a result of which we can expect a very large majority tomorrow.
