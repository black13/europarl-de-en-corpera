draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Madam President, if you granted me the same speaking time as the three previous speakers, that would suit me fine.
I should observe in passing, however, that I was under the impression that I would have two and a half minutes.
So as not to waste any of that time, let me thank Malcolm Harbour, Catherine Trautmann and Pilar del Castillo Vera for our truly outstanding cooperation, to which Malcolm has already referred.
We tackled this issue without friction in a spirit of mutual trust and in particularly close cooperation.
It is, unfortunately, too late now to correct the structural defect of having the two directives lumped together.
Nevertheless, let me say in the brief time at my disposal that I am very pleased that the Commission addressed the general issue of data privacy, albeit rather superficially.
The fact is, Commissioner, that you would probably not give me your credit-card details, your telephone number and your address, even if I asked nicely.
The problem, when you are on the Net, is that much of this information may well be there already, in places you cannot imagine and where you would not like it to be.
To that extent I am pleased that I was able, in cooperation with other groups and Members, to help ensure that the right of consumers to have their personal details treated confidentially and their personal systems protected will be incorporated into this package.
I see that time is running out, but I do hope we shall have more opportunities to discuss this or that issue more thoroughly.
May I therefore say thank you again for our constructive cooperation, and perhaps we shall manage to advance the development of data privacy in Europe for the benefit of consumers.
