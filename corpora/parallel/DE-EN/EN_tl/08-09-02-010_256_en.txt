on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I only wish to deal with two points.
I should like to begin with an area in which we still have one or two matters to clear up with Pilar del Castillo Vera.
I refer to the question of how the independence and autonomy of the future small agency can be guaranteed and which is the most appropriate way to fund it.
There are highly diverse views on this point.
I would very much like to learn from the Council how its debates on this subject are shaping up, and how the Council would like to see the creation of the secretariat or BERT - or whatever name is adopted - being guaranteed and how it envisages the funding method.
In this respect, I believe the Commissioner was perfectly correct in stating that we want a European structure and have no wish to create structures that do not dovetail with the European legal system.
There are, as you know, two funding methods under discussion.
The first is the mixed financing suggested by the rapporteur and the second is the proposal I made, which my group supports, that we take the funding from the Community budget.
Be that as it may, it would be interesting to hear how the Council - which has, of course, had heated discussions on this point - and indeed the national regulators now stand on the funding issue.
My second question, which is also addressed to the Council, concerns the funding of the new networks.
Here too, we have adopted various amendments, including one I tabled in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which went into a little more detail on the possible form of a risk-sharing system if companies make the requisite investments and competitors are to have access to the networks right from the start.
As far as I have heard, the Council thinks differently and does not wish to go into such detail or give companies a guarantee that any kind of risk-sharing can take place.
I should be grateful for your comments on these points.
