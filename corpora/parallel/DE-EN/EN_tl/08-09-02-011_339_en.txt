Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, we have here a paradigm shift from overproduction in Europe to fear for the security of our food supplies.
Do you believe that the WTO negotiations that are now being conducted under French chairmanship have any chance of reaching a satisfactory conclusion by December?
Do you believe that the world market could be a golden opportunity for our agricultural sector?
We have seen, of course, that prices have risen very sharply and that these prices naturally offer entirely new income opportunities for our own farmers in countries like France, Britain and, above all, the new Member States, and they would also create great income prospects elsewhere, especially in the LDCs, the poorest of the poor countries.
