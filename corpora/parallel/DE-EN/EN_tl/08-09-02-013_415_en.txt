on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by addressing the Commissioner.
This morning, Commissioner, you tried to tell us what a fine programme the Commission had in store for the people of Europe, one that would provide them with good jobs and show the social face of the EU.
But when it comes to taking concrete action, the Commission cops out.
The present case concerns a complaint made by a German doctor and the action taken in response to it.
It was quite simply about at least reviewing compliance with the existing minimum standards governing working hours in the European Union.
The Commission could not even manage that.
Your reaction has been far removed from what one would expect of a guardian of the Treaties.
You say nothing for years, and then you even relax the standards.
That is what the public perceive as a betrayal of their rights.
With this silence and the amendments to the Working Time Directive you have inflicted massive damage on the project of European union.
That has to be made clear.
