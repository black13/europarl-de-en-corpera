Mr President, I support the view that parents and legal guardians bear great responsibility in the way they deal with children.
Today, the business world sees and treats children as important consumers.
This is why it is necessary to make them aware from a very young age of the power of advertising and its potential adverse effects.
I do not believe, however, in the idea that we should regulate it uniformly throughout Europe.
As the Commissioner also said, in the education system we must try to show children a path from a very young age, making them aware of both the opportunities and risks that are inherent in advertising.
