Madam President, we all know that chemicals are produced and traded throughout the world, and the dangers and risks are global too.
Therefore, we need guidelines in the form of clear classifications and labels, which apply globally.
I would have liked the European Union to be the engine driving very clear labelling and strong consumer protection, but I have heard many speakers here that say that, rather than being the engine, the EU should be sitting in the brake van.
I can live with this political agreement, but I am not very happy with it.
Yes, we managed an important step towards greater safety for people and the environment.
I am also pleased that, despite the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in connection with threshold values for labelling, which was all too industry-friendly - the volumes of data used for the classification should have been included on the label - we managed to limit the damage in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission.
I am glad that there are no longer any tonnage-based threshold values for the requirement to label and also no more accepted loopholes for industry, and that the proposed classification system redirects the focus towards alternatives to experiments on animals.
However, I would have liked to see the labelling of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances improved, and a new 'acute toxicity' category created, because that is extremely topical and a matter on which we ought to have shown willingness to take action.
I believe that we have sent out an important signal for greater safety for people and the environment today, but we cannot rest on our laurels.
Obviously this topic is going to keep us busy in the future, as there is plenty of room for improvement.
