on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an EU-wide, unified permit procedure for hydrogen powered vehicles would overcome at least one of the barriers to the development of environmentally friendly forms of mobility.
There are already several promising projects in the area of local public transport, which mean that series production of hydrogen powered passenger cars is not far away at all.
However, we have to ask how the hydrogen will be obtained.
Whether the final result, in terms of CO2, is favourable depends very much on how hydrogen will be produced in the future.
It is no use if manufacturing it produces more CO2 than is saved by hydrogen power.
At the same time, however, we must ensure that the appropriate filling station infrastructure is created and built, because even hydrogen powered cars have to be filled up.
This is a challenge for the Member States, particularly.
The clear guidelines in this report create a legal framework that facilitates the further development of this promising technology and many other innovations.
The president of this Chamber, Mr PÃ¶ttering, has reported on hydrogen powered vehicles from his own experience.
It would be worth considering using his experience to adapt Parliament's fleet accordingly - at least it is a suggestion worthy of consideration.
Finally, I would like to thank Mrs Weisgerber most sincerely for her warm cooperation in the assembly and production of this report.
