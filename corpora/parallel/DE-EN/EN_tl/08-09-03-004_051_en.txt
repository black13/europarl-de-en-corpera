Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is a good example of how politics is able to take action, because type-approval permits for hydrogen powered vehicles will be available in the future, even though the technology itself is not yet available.
We talk a lot about reducing CO2 produced by vehicles, particularly trucks.
This could be one way of reducing CO2 emissions, but it is important - and I am speaking as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for which I was the shadow rapporteur - that we generate the hydrogen from renewable energies.
This also offers the possibility of storing energy from renewable sources, which we could then use for vehicles, and that would be a good direction to take.
We should continue to concentrate on this in future.
However, it is also important to create a filling station infrastructure.
We see, for example, that the infrastructure for CNG vehicles is still very patchy.
The vehicles are available but the customers, the drivers, are still holding back from purchasing them because availability of the fuel is not guaranteed.
We need to keep the focus on that in future discussions.
