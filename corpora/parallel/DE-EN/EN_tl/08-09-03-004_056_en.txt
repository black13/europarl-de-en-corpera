rapporteur. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the very interesting speeches.
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission, the representatives of the Council and the staff for their fantastic cooperation, which was the key to achieving this political unity at first reading.
As we have seen, hydrogen is a technology of the future.
Hydrogen can be part of the answer to the challenges posed by climate change and the need to reduce emissions.
It is a clean alternative to fossil fuels and the use of hydrogen as an energy vector - as has been stated, it is indeed an energy vector - is totally sustainable if it is produced from renewable energies or nuclear energy.
This is the direction we have to take in the coming years.
I am fascinated by the idea of having a totally hazard-free hydrogen cycle in which hydrogen is ultimately produced from renewable energies and then vaporised.
It is truly fascinating.
I supported this technology long before I came to the European Parliament, and have also worked voluntarily on it for a long time.
Today we have set things going in the right direction.
We have created the necessary preconditions so that we can eventually have unified type-approval regulations.
We have also shown the way to an international type-approval regulation and set the future direction for research and development.
The technology is already here, as Commissioner Verheugen has rightly said.
Now we must deal with the other questions relating to infrastructure.
The question of filling station infrastructure will be handled by a public-private partnership.
Perhaps then we will find that it will not be long before hydrogen powered vehicles are on our streets, and not just as prototypes.
Thank you once again for the good cooperation.
