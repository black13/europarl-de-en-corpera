President Arias, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you most sincerely for this brilliant, distinguished speech.
Your words expressed that you and your country represent democracy and freedom; you work against violence, against terror, against dictatorship.
When you say that Costa Rica is a small country, then I would like to point out that the population of a country or its geographical area are not the most important things.
What is important is the spirit of a country and its president.
Anyone who has heard your speech knows that President Arias and Costa Rica stand for freedom and democracy.
That makes Costa Rica a big country in the world.
(Applause)
You are a man of peace; that is why you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987.
However, you did not retire after that; 21 years have passed, and now you are advocating peace between people and peace with nature.
The European Parliament stands alongside you in upholding these principles.
I would also like to give a warm welcome to the ministers of your government who are accompanying you - the Minister of Foreign Relations, Stagno Ugarte, and the Minister of Foreign Trade, Ruiz Guti√©rrez, who are also here in the Chamber, together with many citizens of Costa Rica, who live here in Brussels and in Belgium.
Be proud of your country!
Not in a nationalistic sense, because then countries that have dictatorships and are ruled by violence could also be proud of themselves, but be proud of your country, of Costa Rica, because you champion the right values: democracy, freedom and peace.
Thank you very much once again.
Muchas gracias, President Arias!
(Applause)
