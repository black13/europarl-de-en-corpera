Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution, but with some heartache.
The war between Russia and Georgia has highlighted differences in dealing with crises.
Georgia has various unsolved problems, but Russia is behaving in the long-established tradition of semi-Asiatic dictators, with skulduggery, provocation and warlike brutality.
This is a danger not only for Ukraine, but also for us.
Our strengths are human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the freedom we have all fought hard together to achieve - freedom from dependency and bondage.
These values urgently require that we defend them through a common foreign and security policy.
