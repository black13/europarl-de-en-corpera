in writing. - I am voting in favour of Mrs Weisgerber's report on type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles.
Fostering environmentally friendly alternative fuels in the EU is an important step that absolutely must be supported in these times.
Hydrogen powered vehicles lend themselves to this purpose but they must guarantee a high level of safety and environmental protection.
To ensure that this is so, unified conditions for type-approval in the European Union are urgently needed.
Without EU-wide regulations on the classification of hydrogen powered vehicles there is a risk that the one-off permits issued by the Member States will distort competition and that enterprises will find that investing in hydrogen vehicles no longer pays off.
A unified type-approval system offers citizens the protection of an EU-wide directive and promotes an increase in the number of environmentally safe vehicles, which is very important.
