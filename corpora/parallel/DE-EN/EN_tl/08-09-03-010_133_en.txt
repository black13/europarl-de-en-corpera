in writing. - There is no doubt that hydrogen power is a technology with future potential, but it has by no means reached maturity.
Not only are acquisition costs still too high to be financed, but the manufacture and storage of hydrogen is expensive.
Furthermore, even if the cars themselves do not produce any harmful emissions, it is still not clear how the hydrogen is to be produced in a way that uses as little energy as possible and does not generate CO2.
In conclusion, we also do not yet know whether battery- or fuel-cell-powered vehicles will become the norm, but it is important in any case that we support alternative technologies in order to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Accordingly, I voted in favour of the Weisgerber report.
