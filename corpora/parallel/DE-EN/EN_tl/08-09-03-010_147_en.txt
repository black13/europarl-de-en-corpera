in writing. - Russia is important to the EU not only as a supplier of energy but also as a counterbalance to America's drive for world domination.
For these reasons, but also to avoid jeopardising its credibility, it is important for the EU to play a neutral role as a mediator between Georgia and Russia.
There are very large Russian populations in many states of the former Soviet Union, such as Ukraine.
That makes it easy to understand why the Kremlin feels it has a particular responsibility to these Russian people groups.
The EU could help to negotiate a solution that would be acceptable to all parties and, for example, speak up for generous ethnic minority rights for Russians in the post-Soviet era, which would fit in with the European Union's oft-quoted human rights goals.
With this in mind, then, I favour the position worked out at the special summit and am against the 'vassals' attitude towards the United States in this report, which is why I voted against it.
