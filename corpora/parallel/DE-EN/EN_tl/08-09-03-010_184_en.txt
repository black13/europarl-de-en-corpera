in writing. - I am voting in favour of Mrs Svensson's report on advertising, which continues to be discriminatory.
Despite the measures that have been taken against it, gender stereotyping remains a major issue in society.
Advertisements, in particular, tend to perpetuate tired old stereotypes of men and women.
Children and young people, especially, identify with characters in advertisements and absorb the clich√©s they present.
This should be prevented, so that the younger generation can deal more practically with the issue of gender equality.
In my opinion, specific training programmes on gender equality would be a good place to start and, above all, something must be done about the ubiquitous stereotyping in textbooks.
In summary, it can be said that advertising confronts all citizens in their daily life and it must therefore present good role models.
The report paves the way towards achieving the goal that has been set.
