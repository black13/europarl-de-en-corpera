in writing. - I am voting against this own-initiative report, because it interferes too much with freedom of opinion and smacks of imperious censorship.
All matters of legitimacy and ethics in relation to advertising are already regulated at national level.
The EU has no place trying to control the diversity of freedom of opinion and freedom in advertising.
Fortunately, this is only an own-initiative report.
