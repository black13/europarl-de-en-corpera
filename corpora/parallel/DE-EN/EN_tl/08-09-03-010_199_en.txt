in writing. - Only 12 years ago, a new technology, which is apparently associated with high death rates and considerable suffering, stunned the world with the cloning of Dolly the sheep.
The commercial sector is already rubbing its hands, dreaming of 'healthy' cloned pork enriched with Omega 3 fatty acids.
They claim that this cruelty to animals also benefits the pigs, which are supposedly healthier thanks to cloning.
Of course, the breeders benefit too, because their financial losses are reduced.
The whole thing is disturbingly like the many and varied temptations to genetic technology, by which multitudes of farmers have been brought to ruin, because the seed was not re-useable and they could not afford any more.
It is also reminiscent of the sudden, unnatural death of entire herds after the animals had eaten genetically modified feedstuffs.
The long-term consequences of radioactive radiation and genetic technology have not yet been ascertained in sufficient detail, and it is impossible to estimate the effects of cloning, let alone cross-breeds.
What would happen if a cloned animal is fed genetic feedstuff?
What effects would that have on humans?
Frankenstein is lurking at the door!
That is why I am voting 'no' this time.
