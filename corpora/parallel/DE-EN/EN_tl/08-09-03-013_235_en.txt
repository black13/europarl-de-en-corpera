Mr President, the current debate on possible sanctions against Russia in reaction to the conflict in the Caucasus once again shows how irresponsibly sanctions are sometimes handled.
It is questionable whether they are legitimate as an all-purpose, non-differentiating instrument and unclear when and how their effectiveness is in fact guaranteed.
It is particularly important to evaluate the effectiveness of EU sanctions correctly.
They should not be deceptive; on the contrary, they must be tailored.
Repressive regimes are often responsible.
What evaluation criteria are applied remains a central question, despite all efforts.
When do sanctions actually lead to a change in behaviour?
Instead of ad hoc sanctions being imposed, I would like an EU strategy resulting in a coherent and sustainable sanctions policy.
There would have to be a consensus here on their optimum conditions of use, however.
An effective sanctions strategy is still lacking up to now.
This report, however, is a step in the right direction.
The European Parliament is currently the most important agent for promoting human rights.
EU sanctions ought not to be an aggressive political instrument, but should be there in the people's interest.
Sanctions that punish the civil population are counterproductive and miss the actual point.
