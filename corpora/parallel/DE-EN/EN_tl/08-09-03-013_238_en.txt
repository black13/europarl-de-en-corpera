Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to pick up on a subject that several Members have addressed.
Sanctions should not be wrongly targeted.
In particular they should not harm the poorest of the poor.
Here we have something that has been developing for quite some time, but we have to continue along this path.
In the past we have seen again and again that corrupt regimes contemptuous of human rights very often have the attendant symptoms of very large amounts of public money being converted as a rule into private capital and then put on hold somewhere in fabulous accounts until the respective member of the regime is able to retrieve and enjoy this money.
This involves us similarly seeking and finding worldwide cooperation, such as in the approach we have created at the International Criminal Court.
The European Union can play an important role here in ensuring that the fruits of this policy do not arrive where we do not want them to arrive.
