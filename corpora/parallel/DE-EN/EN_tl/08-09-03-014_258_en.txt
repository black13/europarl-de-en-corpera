Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, the current statistics show that, overall, MDG 5 is way off track and maternal mortality is even on the increase in Africa and South Asia.
Every year 536 000 women die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth.
Of those deaths 99% occur in developing countries.
In Africa one in 16 women dies during pregnancy or childbirth.
In industrialised countries there is considerably less likelihood of this happening.
The most frequent causes of death are haemorrhaging, infections and illegal abortions.
Approximately 68 000 women die every year as a result of unsafe abortions and millions of women incur life-long injuries or other damage to their health.
In fact, 97% of all unsafe abortions are carried out in developing countries.
Every minute a woman dies somewhere in the world as a result of pregnancy or childbirth.
We have a moral obligation and an opportunity to prevent this.
In developing countries, particularly in rural areas, women urgently need universal access to general health care, medical assistance and advice on pregnancy and childbirth.
I am also calling for family planning, including access to effective contraceptives and safe abortions.
The improvement in reproductive health and the abolition of any kind of discrimination against women are key and extremely important preconditions for achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.
