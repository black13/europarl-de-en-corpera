Time and again we have the problem where very many people in Europe are asking the question: where is European value added?
Now, the European Union is admittedly not responsible for educational issues, but we are responsible for quality assurance and consumer protection issues.
On this we are also agreed.
Would it not be possible for schools and perhaps even the low levels of education to be very consciously addressed here as recipients in the context of the Commission's general information activity?
With projects and competitions we can show how Europe provides European value added here.
We could perhaps - and in connection with the previous question - thus bring this subject to the attention of the very young.
