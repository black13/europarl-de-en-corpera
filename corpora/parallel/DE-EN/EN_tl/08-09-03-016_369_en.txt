Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe small and medium-sized enterprises are very specifically in demand even in the area of financial services.
We have 25 million enterprises in Europe.
I believe many of them would definitely be able to achieve equivalent success on the international market.
Finally, one of the fundamental issues even in the least developed countries is also how income can be generated.
Commissioner Mandelson therefore thinks it is particularly important not to back down in the WTO negotiations, but to create fresh impetus here.
We need trade facilitation, we need the corresponding commitment and I hope we shall achieve this soon.
