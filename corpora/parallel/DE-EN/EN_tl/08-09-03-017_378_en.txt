Mr President, European consumers are groaning under the weight of high food prices and I think one of the causes of the exorbitant price increases is the concentration in the retail market on a few big players.
I have grounds for concern that a similar development could also occur in future in the case of travel agencies.
The liberalisation of the Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems proposed by this report should ensure greater competition on the market.
I fear, however, that only the large tour operators will be able to survive in future, by concluding several CRS provider contracts.
This will be necessary, however, to offer customers a comprehensive choice.
The small operators unable to afford several contracts with CRS providers will fall by the wayside.
Whenever the United States is called upon as an example of consumer-friendly competition in this context, I have to remember that there are no airlines in the Member States that still participate in a computerised reservation system.
I would therefore advocate a rigid definition of the term 'parent carrier'.
