Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we had had to cope with the correspondence that this report has generated over recent weeks using a horseback messenger, we would have exhausted a few horses - without a doubt.
Modern communication has allowed us to stay in constant touch and to keep up to date at all times.
The greatest credit for this, however, is due to Mr Kirkhope, who in a truly exemplary manner has kept Members informed, has always corresponded with the shadow rapporteurs and has actually done everything he can to convey the Committee's requests to the Council.
The Council, however, has not made his work easy.
Quite the opposite.
Wording was proposed - we were able to follow proceedings well - which actually would have done nothing other than cover up distortionary competitive practices more effectively - and I object to this!
I must honestly say that even the home countries of the distortionary competitive airlines would do well here to take consumer protection more seriously by providing fair information as well as following our suggestions to ensure this happens.
The Code of Conduct is not the strongest instrument we have at our disposal.
We must be clear about this.
Even more important is clear wording, which assures us that another back door will not be opened.
Together with my colleague Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, I should also like to guarantee this clarity by referring it back to committee.
I consider this to be a major issue.
We have to stand by the fact that we are protecting consumers and also have to accept the obvious consequences of this.
I thank my fellow Members, however, particularly the rapporteur, that the concerns regarding environmental protection have found echoes in this report, as far as was possible in this sector.
My sincere thanks once again to my fellow Members and the rapporteur.
