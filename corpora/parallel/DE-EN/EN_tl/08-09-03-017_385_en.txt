Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the controversial problem of the definition of parent companies.
The purpose of the definition is indeed to prevent airlines with shares in a CRS abusing their position.
At present this palpably concerns Air France, Iberia and Lufthansa, which have a minority holding in Amadeus.
The current practice of the Commission examining this on a case-by-case basis when abuse is suspected has been proven.
Cases of the abuse of influence have been resolved and prosecuted.
To date this has occurred on two occasions.
There are no reasonable grounds for changing anything in this essentially proven practice.
The definition found of a parent enterprise based on the expression, with regard to competition law, of the determining influence complies with this proven practice.
The term has been proving itself for 40 years now.
Some Members, however, want every airline with a capital share to be automatically defined as a parent company.
For the air transport market this means massive and unnecessary interference in the current competitive situation.
Nor would consumers obtain any advantage from this.
The four winners would be, for example, British Airways, American Airlines and others that would benefit from such a shift in the competitive situation.
In addition, the only European computerised reservation system would have to accept a competitive disadvantage with regard to US competitors on the hotly contested European market.
This I consider politically unreasonable, even negligent, and I therefore recommend that the compromise found be accepted.
