Madam President, Commissioner, we also have to think of our own failings, of course.
We cannot always be talking about sustainable transport on Sundays and doing the opposite from Monday to Friday.
It does seem to be the case that in the Commission 60% of the money flowing into transport flows into roads as co-financing and only 20% of it into environmentally friendly railways.
It can be said that transport in Europe is too cheap and environmentally friendly transport too expensive.
This is also to do with the framework conditions.
We do, for example, have a compulsory rail toll system for each Member State.
This applies to every engine, every kilometre of track, whereas the toll in environmentally damaging road transport is voluntary, its amount is limited and it applies only to motorways, and usually only to lorries of 12 tonnes or more.
You need to change these unfair framework conditions, otherwise you will resolve neither problems to do with climate policy nor transport problems.
The forecast is that traffic is on the increase.
But why is it on the increase?
Because it does not cost anything.
There are several examples that could be mentioned.
I should like to mention one example from your home country.
The United Kingdom exports 1.5 million tonnes of pork every year.
If you look at the balance of imports, this shows that the United Kingdom also imports a further 1.5 million tonnes of pork.
We could eliminate this.
We could eliminate this transportation and use the capacity, which we definitely need, to do so.
In Europe we therefore have to eliminate a lot of the nonsense over transport capacity and then we have to shift transport over to environmentally friendly modes and design it to be efficient so that we can guarantee mobility, while providing people with the goods, but also protecting the environment, because this is the order of the day.
Without a healthy environment, neither we nor our children and children's children have the future we all want.
