Madam President, just very briefly: some of our colleagues may not be aware of this yet, but it was mentioned to me that yesterday, it was decided that the next part-session will be held in Brussels.
I have heard that there are tremendous problems getting beds here in Brussels as the hotel rooms are booked out due to a trade fair.
This part-session should simply have been postponed or transformed into a mini-part-session.
That would have been the best solution.
With a measure of good will, that could have been done.
The second point which I would briefly like to make is directly related to this: has the safety situation actually been checked here in this building?
I hear that there are major structural defects here.
Has this building been checked using the same criteria as have now been applied in the Strasbourg building?
