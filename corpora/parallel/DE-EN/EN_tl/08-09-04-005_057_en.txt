Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, soil protection is an extremely important task for ensuring a healthy farming environment for future generations.
I would underscore everything that has been said in that connection so far.
However, none of these arguments means that soil protection should be a European task.
Not every problem in Europe is necessarily a problem for Europe.
Soil is a local, a localised medium.
As a rule, soil contamination has no cross-border impacts, so there is no reason for soil protection to be a task for the European Union; nor, indeed, does it have any European added value.
Many of the European countries already have soil protection regulations which work very well, and there is not the slightest reason to impose a European regulation on those that do not.
Or do you believe, Commissioner - quite seriously - that wherever Member States are not taking action within their own sphere of competence, the Commission should fill the gap?
That would be absurd.
For reasons of subsidiarity, soil protection is a task for the Member States, and they are quite capable of dealing with it.
That being the case, the Council - including your own country, Madam Secretary of State - provisionally halted this initiative.
I very much hope that the French Republic will stick to this position.
I have no doubt that it could be useful to draft a European soil protection strategy, and I would also have no problem with Europe making a financial contribution wherever optimum soil protection has not yet been achieved.
However, I am firmly opposed to having harmonised soil protection legislation imposed upon all of us, funded by the Community, simply because there is no soil protection legislation in some countries.
That is not what Europe is supposed to be about.
It would be a piece of completely superfluous bureaucracy of the type which sends citizens running for cover, before expressing their opinions in elections and referenda.
It has to be stopped.
