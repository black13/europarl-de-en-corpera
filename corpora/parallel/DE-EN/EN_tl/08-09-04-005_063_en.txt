Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union should act within the scope of its competences in those areas where it can genuinely create European added value with its own rules.
In this particular case, I do not see any added value being created.
What I do see are certain countries which are not taking their responsibilities in the domestic arena seriously, or at least have not done so to date, or simply believe that they can access European money in this way.
I cannot identify any added value at all; what I do see, however, are additional costs and more red tape, especially for those countries which have fulfilled their commitments at home and have taken reasonable soil protection measures.
