Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lengthy vote ahead of us today.
Since Mr Schulz is affected by what Mr Zaleski said, he will be given the floor, but after that, we want to move on to the vote.
We held the debate about Georgia yesterday and we have drawn up a resolution, so we do not need to reiterate everything today.
We want to get on with the vote, but as Mr Schulz was the subject of the remark, he has the floor.
