Mr President, perhaps Mr Zaleski did not listen properly to what I said yesterday.
I did not accuse any nation.
It is not my intention to lay the blame on any particular nation.
As to the crimes against humanity committed by Germans in the Second World War, I have on more than one occasion voiced my shame about my nation in whose name these crimes were committed.
I would like to reiterate that here and now.
I am one of those Germans who want to ensure that it never happens again.
Nonetheless, one thing is true: every responsible politician, every man or woman who is leading a government and wants to solve problems on his or her own country's territory through force of arms places themselves outside international law, and that applies to Mr Saakashvili.
(Applause)
