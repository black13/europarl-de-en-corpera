I was going to make a statement about that at the end of the sitting, because I would like to avoid having a debate about it now.
(Applause)
Can we agree that I will make a statement at the end on what has been decided, so that we really can get on with the vote just now?
There is also a communication about this matter which you will be receiving.
I would ask you to check your emails.
However, I will be making a statement at the end, when you will all still be here.
