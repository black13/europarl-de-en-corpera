Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Simpson has just said is really quite abstruse; indeed, he turns the whole matter on its head.
There are certain industries which attempt to block legislation in the interests of their companies.
May I say this: with this code of conduct, our intention is to improve consumers' rights.
We need to strengthen consumer rights so that we get fair offers from the computerised systems.
We vigorously reject these delaying tactics on the part of the Socialists, who are attempting to wreck the compromise with the French Government and bring about its collapse during this legislative term.
I would urge you to reject the referral back to committee.
