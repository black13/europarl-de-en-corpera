in writing. - I am voting in favour of Timothy Kirkhope's report on the code of conduct for computerised reservation systems.
The new code of conduct will stimulate competition between the computer reservation systems, thereby benefiting the price and quality of services.
The current arrangements are out of date, as almost 40% of bookings are now carried out via alternative websites, dispensing with booking fees altogether.
The new code will benefit consumers by increasing competition and cutting charges, with low-cost airlines now being included in the reservation system as well.
In order to offer customers the best possible information and protection from anti-competitive practices, the provision of services must be expanded, and regulated and controlled on an EU-wide basis.
It is important, therefore, that the flight prices given in main advertisements set out the full flight price including all taxes and charges, so that the customer is not duped by special offers which are not in fact available.
The same applies to the listing of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption: both must be clear to the consumer.
An alternative rail offer for flights of less than 90 minutes gives the customer another option and enables him or her to make an informed choice.
