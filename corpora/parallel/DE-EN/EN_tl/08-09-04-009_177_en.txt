in writing. - I am voting in favour of Michael Cramer's report for a sustainable and efficient logistics and freight transport system in Europe.
This system plays a vital role in strengthening and expanding Europe's position as an internationally competitive economy, but without this occurring at the expense of the environment and citizens.
'Green corridors' are a fundamental concept for optimising Europe's transport and do so as sustainably as possible.
Reducing all types of pollution while increasing the use of renewable energy sources is the right approach to take.
In this context, investment in new technologies such as computerised 'stop-go' in freight transport and support for modes of transport other than road transport play an important role and point the way ahead.
Harmonisation of management and administrative procedures on an EU-wide basis will also make the European transport system better and more efficient.
Europe needs a competitive and innovative economy in order to be successful.
The present report makes an important contribution to achieving that goal.
