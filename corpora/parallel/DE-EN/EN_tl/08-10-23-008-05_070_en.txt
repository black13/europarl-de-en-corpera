on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I would like to introduce a motion.
In Parliament, we quite clearly agree on two points.
On the one hand, we want to be involved in the procedure for these new technical variants and this cannot be decided without Parliament.
I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani, who has ensured that this is the case.
Secondly, it is clear to all of us that this new technical measure must be considered with a great deal of sensitivity.
We have a number of concerns about it.
The criteria for the possible application must be carefully controlled and everyone in the House agrees on this.
I would like to move on behalf of the PPE-DE Group that we give ourselves an extra four weeks and postpone the vote until November, because Commissioner Tajani has stated that there will be a major hearing on the subject in November.
The PPE-DE Group is of the opinion that we should hear all the facts before we come to a decision.
I hope that we will have a majority in favour of this.
This is why we are moving that the vote be adjourned until November.
