on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to oppose this motion for the following reason.
It is true that Mr Tajani's hearing will give us the opportunity to acquire additional information and to define our position.
However, what we are doing with this decision is to tell the Council, which has already reached a resolution during the last Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, that in our view, and this applies at least to my group, security and security measures are absolutely essential.
However, the use of scanners or display devices which show people completely naked is totally unacceptable.
This is a violation of human dignity and it is not accompanied by any increase in security.
(Applause from the left and from the centre)
This is the perfect example of the mania for security which is going on here.
With our decision we want to send a clear signal that we are opposed to measures of this kind, which are also extremely controversial on medical grounds.
We therefore ask you to reject Mr Weber's motion.
(Applause)
