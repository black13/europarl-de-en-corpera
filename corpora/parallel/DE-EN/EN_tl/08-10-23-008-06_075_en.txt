draftsman. - Mr President, I have an oral amendment to paragraph 22, which I have agreed with other fellow Members.

I will read the change out in English now:
- 'urges the corresponding urgencies at the entity level to support the work of the state-level bodies by forwarding to them all the relevant information they gather;'.
