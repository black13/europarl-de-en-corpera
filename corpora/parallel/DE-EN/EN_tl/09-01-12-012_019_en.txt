Mr President, we have, of course, given this matter a great deal of thought.
Perhaps Mr Cohn-Bendit overestimates the significance of a resolution, but with the Security Council's resolution we have a basis which we should support and, as the President of Parliament has already said, we should require both sides to seek peace, to lay down their arms and to comply with the Security Council's resolution.
I would, however, just like to add that this must be the gist of our resolution.
If this is so, we can support it.
In this context we would cooperate and in this context we would support Mr Cohn-Bendit's motion.
