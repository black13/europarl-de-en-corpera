Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation of the Conference of Presidents is based on great wisdom.
We have, today, heard a statement by the President of Parliament who, if I am correct, was supported by all sides of the House.
This is an important basic principle and an important statement by Parliament.
We will receive a great deal of information over the next few days: through sittings held by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and by delegations and through communications received from the Presidency of the Council and from the Commission.
Therefore, we are not in a position to effect a resolution today, which will actually correspond in detail to how things stood on Thursday.
I spent two days last week on the Gaza Strip border and observed a great deal of the suffering of the people on both sides.
I believe that a ceasefire alone will not be enough.
The ceasefire must be linked to a cessation of weapons smuggling into Gaza in the future.
The details of the negotiations taking place in Egypt today, in particular, are of crucial importance.
We should not destroy this by a resolution perhaps shaped by emotions.
Therefore, I am in favour of the retention of the resolution from the Conference of Presidents.
