Mr President, the background to my speech is the illegal transportation of puppies discovered in Austria at the beginning of October 2008.
Since the beginning of October 2008 I have been trying to get speaking time in the one-minute contributions and I am pleased that I have finally succeeded.
It is interesting that Mr Rogalski has been allowed to speak three times in the meantime.
However, now to the matter in hand.
The Austrian police stopped a truck containing137 puppies.
The vehicle manifested serious defects and the animals' passports were forgeries, as the dogs had not reached the legally required age for transport.
The journey started in Slovakia and was due to end in Spain.
This case is not unique and it brings to our notice once more that profit-orientated organisations are constantly evading current animal protection provisions in Europe in a criminal fashion.
In Europe we really need comprehensive inspections of animal transportation and corresponding threats of fines in the event of non-compliance.
The EU must jointly adopt European minimum standards in animal protection, which must be implemented and monitored by all governments.
This would also compel those countries, which have been completely inactive in the field of animal protection to date, to introduce specific standards.
