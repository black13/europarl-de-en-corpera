Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will vote on new regulations on the subject of plant protection, a subject that arouses a great deal of emotion in the populace.
This was also reflected in the deliberations in Parliament.
We would all like fresh, healthy, local food at affordable prices without hazardous residues from plant protection products.
The result achieved in the trialogue will create the preconditions for this.
The new Plant Protection Regulation is a great step towards more consumer and health protection.
Priority was given once more to scientific criteria rather than political dogmas when establishing the exemption criteria.
The result of the trialogue is a giant step forward compared to the result of our Parliament at the first reading.
Almost 80% of all active substances will no longer be affected but only those that constitute a risk to human health or the environment, and this is on a scientific basis.
There will also be sufficient plant protection products available for sustainable management in the future.
However, substances that are really hazardous will also be banned.
In future, there will no longer be 27 national licensing authorities but only 3 licensing zones for licensing plant protection products.
The Member States within these zones must then mutually acknowledge their licences in principle.
The new Plant Protection Product Regulation will provide the harmonisation required for a long time with justification in the plant protection product sector.
We will then have a uniformly high level of protection without jeopardising sustainable agricultural production within Europe.
We will now achieve a real internal market, uniform competitive conditions and a great deal of progress towards health protection.
This is wonderful success for consumers and farmers.
Thank you very much.
