Madam President, I would like to address a subject which has not yet been discussed today in this connection.
At the end of the day, we have again reached what it is to be hoped is a reasonable compromise in Europe.
But what have we done along the way?
Let us remember the discussions over many months with some extreme accusations by one side against the other and vice versa.
All this has been devoured by the media with great enthusiasm.
All that in the media has led to consumers being undermined and everyone agreeing again that 'Europe is doing everything wrong' and 'Europe is against rather than for the citizens'.
Now, at the end of the day, we have reached a halfway reasonable solution, a compromise solution, but still one on which there will be a great deal of agreement.
What will be left then, on average?
Little to nothing!
