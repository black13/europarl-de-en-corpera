rapporteur. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now possible to identify a sugar cube in Lake Constance using state-of-the-art analysis.
However, we must also ask ourselves how we deal with these new discoveries, what we do with them.
We now need objective risk assessments to find a balance between the justified health and environmental requirements and the justified concerns of business and food safety, including within a worldwide comparison.
The questions, which colleagues have asked, have not been adequately answered by the Commission, in my opinion.
It is not enough to say that four substances no longer apply or two substances no longer apply and there are only 25 substances in total.
No, we wish to have an accurate economic assessment, an assessment that not only fulfils economic criteria but also health criteria.
We still need an evaluation.
The Commission must now thoroughly analyse the effects of this new legislation so that we know what effect it will have at the end of the day.
We must continue to monitor this, as scientific discoveries will always continue.
The compromise which has been reached brings a new direction in European plant protection policy.
It brings more common action Europe-wide and it requires targeted measures from Member States, which guarantee the sustainable use of plant protection products.
As rapporteur, I thank you for your support.
We have managed to find a good compromise from different starting positions.
I would like more positive thinking for the New Year.
One thing that can be said is that I did not have enough positive thinking: plant protection products will ensure healthy and sufficient food and a healthy cultural landscape for us in Europe!
