on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, with all due respect to the Commission and to you as a person, you have not really answered Committee Chairman Costa's question.
You had already given us a good intimation when you indicated - and this is something that was already evident in the Green Paper on Mobility in the City - that we need common European solutions to a problem that almost all European cities have in one form or another, some quite different and some quite similar.
We welcomed that at the time, a few months ago, and we have looked forward eagerly to the proposals from the Commission that we were promised.
They have not materialised, And if there was an intimation in your statement, then I have noted it now as follows: there will be no comprehensive action plan.
Why not?
If we believe what we hear - and we hear a great deal in this House and in the institutions of this European Union - it means that there is one Member State or perhaps a few Member States who have caused anxiety, and unfortunately, also caused anxiety to this Commission, with the pretext that subsidiarity could be infringed.
The European Parliament has stated expressly in its proposals that it does not wish to interfere with subsidiarity.
You have emphasised once more that you do not wish to present a uniform plan to suit everyone, but presenting no plan at all is not a solution.
Let us take this step, keep this promise!
The re-election of the Commission will not be guaranteed by doing nothing and by one or more Member States not being insulted, but re-election will be guaranteed if something positive is submitted and presented.
