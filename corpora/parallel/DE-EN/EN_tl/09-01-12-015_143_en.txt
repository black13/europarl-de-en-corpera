Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the constant delay and your answer, Commissioner, are not acceptable.
Time is running out.
Urban traffic plays a key role in the context of climate change.
It is responsible for about 70% of all greenhouse gases in cities.
The EU will only succeed in achieving its own climate protection goals if it changes its transport policy.
The greatest potential lies in the cities because 90% of car journeys made in cities are less than six kilometres long - distances which could easily be covered by taking the train or bus or by cycling or walking.
I hope that the Commission has used the delay to consider how the EU can effectively help governments and cities.
There is actually no European added value when the report is as vague and non-binding as the Green Paper and the Rack Report.
We Greens request that EU Cofinancing be redesigned to be environmentally friendly.
To date, 60% of EU money has been used for road-building projects, while only 20% goes into public transport and rail.
We want at least 40% for rail as decided by Parliament in my report on the first rail package.
Secondly, we only want to grant EU money if cities can present a sustainable mobility plan.
Thirdly, we want to increase road safety with a general speed limit of 30 km/h with the possibility for cities to set higher speeds for specific roads independently.
That is not only good for the climate, it will also reduce accidents because 40 000 people die on Europe's roads every year.
