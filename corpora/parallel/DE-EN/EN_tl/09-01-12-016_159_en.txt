on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Barroso Commission had announced the abolition of European over-regulation as one of its major political goals.
We get the impression with the proposals you are making now that you are actually encouraging over-regulation.
The hearing held by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats last week made it clear that there are grave doubts regarding how much you are now interfering in the competences of the Member States.
What is now on the table has the stink of over-regulation, and that is not something that we can approve of.
It is correct that we must find a balance between the possibilities for developing public and private broadcasting services.
But this also means - particularly in the digital age - that public broadcasting, which stands for quality, cultural diversity, cultural and social cohesion, must have opportunities for development in the digital age.
We require this as part of the Lisbon Strategy.
If public broadcasting is denied this opportunity, it will be turned into a dinosaur.
Then it will not be able to develop well.
When we think of our economic and financial crisis, we have all come to the conclusion that markets must be regulated.
Social and ecological regulation is not a position against markets but in favour of fair markets - and that means regulated markets.
The same applies to the relationship within which the private and public sectors are able to develop in future if we want to be successful in the digital world.
