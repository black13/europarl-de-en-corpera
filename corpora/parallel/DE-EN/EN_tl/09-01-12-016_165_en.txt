Mr President, public broadcasting is more than an economic factor.
I was at the hearing held by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats last week in Brussels.
The importance of information and of the diversity of European culture and education was noted.
If 22 Member States are against revision or intensification because we have different framework conditions and different markets, then it is quite wrong to want an extensive administration, a time-consuming test procedure such as this obligatory ex-ante test, or European interference with an unwieldy bureaucratic concept.
There are already controlling bodies for public broadcasting: the broadcasting councils.
We monitor the adaptation to technological change.
We monitor the measures in order to ensure fair competition.
I am a member of such a body, as the representative of the Union of European Federalists at Hessian Broadcasting [Hessischer Rundfunk].
Our independence is guaranteed by law.
We are in turn completely and rightly controlled by the public.
This is how an effective media policy works.
