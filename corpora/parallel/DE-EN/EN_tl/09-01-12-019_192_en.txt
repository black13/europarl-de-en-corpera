in writing. - This report sends a clear signal for bringing the EU closer to its citizens and proposes tangible steps towards making this goal a reality.
We call upon all EU institutions to make dialogue with civil society an important across-the-board task in their political work.
People only support the EU if they are informed about political projects and activities and are able to participate in decision-making, for example through consultations.
With the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland we have seen what negative consequences deliberately disseminated misinformation can have for European integration.
This must be prevented in future by a pro-active information and dialogue policy.
This also applies particularly to the Council and to the governments of the Member States, which should make a more active effort to provide better information about the EU.
Access to documents from all the EU institutions must be made easier and improved so that every citizen can obtain an impression of their work.
Our aim is to build a strong European civil society as the basic prerequisite for the development of a European public area.
Therefore, we demand the creation finally of the necessary framework conditions, which means, primarily, a charter for European associations, as well as the necessary basic infrastructure for active citizens at European level.
