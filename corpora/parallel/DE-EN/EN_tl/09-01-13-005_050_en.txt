Since the euro was launched on 1 January 1999, the single currency has, in many respects, proven to be an important factor in the stability of the EU economy.
The single currency is, first of all, a driving force for European exchanges: the disappearance of exchange rates in the euro countries is an important and visible benefit for citizens, and promotes mobility within the EU.
In addition to the obvious benefits, the euro has also emerged as an anchor in the financial crisis.
Only a major currency used by many Member States and national economies is able to cushion the dramatic effects of economic collapse.
Monetary union means that macroeconomic levers can be applied at international level and active responses can be made to the financial crisis.
Finally, though, the euro is also a symbol of European integration and the long road that the European people have already travelled together.
Monetary union is the next logical step after economic union, and should also pave the way for deeper European integration.
