Madam President, I have the following request.
When we have formal sittings here, there is always a camera in the middle of the seating area.
It is not always exactly easy for the camera operators to work there; it is also, however, a problem for Members if there is a camera where we want to work.
Could we not amend the allocation of seats if we want to have the cameras here?
If not, someone really needs to come up with a better technical solution.
