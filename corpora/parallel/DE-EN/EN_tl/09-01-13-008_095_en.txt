Mr President, may I thank you on behalf of the European Parliament for your address, for your European courageousness and for your European determination.
We were of course glad to hear that you value the European Parliament, and rightly so.
I still remember very clearly that, during accession negotiations in the second half of the 1990s, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia were initially excluded.
It was the European Parliament that called on the governments to include Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia in the negotiations.
As a result, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia were able to become members of the European Union on 1 May 2004.
You addressed the energy question and I shall reply to you very briefly.
We have a very responsible Commissioner, a compatriot of yours, Andris Piebalgs, who acquitted himself admirably last week and during the gas dispute with Russia and Ukraine, but especially with Russia.
I should like to thank Andris Piebalgs for his work in the presence of his President.
(Applause)
Mr President, my closing remark is this: you spoke about how you are learning and Latvia is learning.
That is certainly true.
Yet even those who belonged to the European Community, to the European Union, from the beginning are learning from you and your historical experiences.
If we are prepared to listen to each other and to learn from each other, then we shall all be the better for it.
On the basis of our common values, we are strong, democratic and free.
Thank you, President Zatlers, it was a joy to welcome you here today.
Thank you.
(Applause)
