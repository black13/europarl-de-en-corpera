The consolidation of economic relations with the Western Balkans is of immense importance both to the EU and to the Western Balkans.
I therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament is working intensively on this issue and that we adopted the Belder report today.
In light of the fact that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans lies with the EU, their economic and political rapprochement to the EU is very important.
In order to tie these countries to the EU in the long term, the development of their market economies and regional cooperation must be fostered.
That is why constructive and positive signals from the European Parliament are also important.
It is in the interests of the EU to champion the creation of political stability, legal security and hence good framework conditions in these countries for foreign investment.
The Belder report underlines the fact that the level of economic relations depends on progress in each individual country.
Moreover, it should be the EU's objective to diversify the national economies of the countries of the Western Balkans.
All these important aspects are reflected in the report.
I am convinced that a positive development in economic relations between the EU and the Western Balkans will be of benefit to all countries on the continent of Europe and I await the implementation of our proposals with anticipation.
