We adopted an EU directive protecting consumers from unfair commercial practices and misleading advertising back in 2005.
However, we still refuse to protect citizens from Internet callers, unwanted advertising calls and Scammer & Co.
Rip-off companies hide behind post office boxes, front men and name-changing.
If you manage to catch any of these companies, they are sentenced to ridiculously small fines, which have no deterrent effect whatsoever.
Fines here need to be drastically increased, especially for repeat offences.
It is important for customers who have been ripped off to be able to file a compensation claim, otherwise we are just hanging them out to dry.
The planned changes will improve the situation for consumers, which is why I voted in favour.
