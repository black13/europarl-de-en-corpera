I voted in favour of both the compromises reached in the difficult trialogue negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Pesticides are unavoidable in modern farming.
They guarantee optimal use of farmland in Europe, thereby ensuring a high standard of food production.
I am, of course, satisfied that account has been taken of my resolution adopted in November, so that particular care must be taken when licensing pesticides which are toxic for bees to ensure that pesticides which are proven to harm bees are not licensed.
The objective is efficiency, which means as much as necessary and as little as possible.
A linear reduction in the number of products would be insane.
Farmers need sufficient different products, if only to prevent resistance from building up.
I still of course have concerns about the actual effects of the regulation on agriculture, viniculture and horticulture in terms of their supply with pesticides and the prices of them and we are still in the dark as to the effects on the industrial sectors affected.
A follow-up assessment here is indispensable.
I am delighted that Luxembourg now lies in the same zone as Belgium and Germany, with farmers and vine-growers able to use the same products on either side of the border.
The problem with France must be solved with understanding.
