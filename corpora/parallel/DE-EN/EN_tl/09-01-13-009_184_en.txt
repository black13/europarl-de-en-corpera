In recent years the Union has constantly increased the limit values and a reduction was therefore long overdue.
That pesticides which are hugely harmful to health can finally be banned is progress, although there is still far too little research here.
The cumulative use of pesticides, which can be used to circumvent the limit values specified, still gives cause for concern.
We still know far too little about the possible interactions and legal specifications here are overdue.
The extent to which documentation and traceability are really effective is open to doubt.
The meat scandals in recent years show quite clearly how easy label fraud is.
Last but not least there is still the problem that, although we may impose pesticide specifications on our producers and farmers, we then import products from countries with laxer requirements.
The Chinese toy episode should be a lesson to us.
The planned regulations are a step in the right direction, which is why I voted for them, but far more is needed.
