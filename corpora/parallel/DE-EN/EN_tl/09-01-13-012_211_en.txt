Mr President, I am not in favour of taking fingerprints from small children or even tiny babies.
Children must be exempted from the requirements to provide biometric fingerprints for passports.
It is therefore right to create an exemption here for children.
There is still no secure knowledge about the use of biometric fingerprints from children under the age of 12.
The main ambiguity is how long fingerprints from growing children are in fact reliable.
If we were simply to use these data, we might achieve the opposite of what we are trying to do, namely less instead of more security.
It is therefore disproportionate to collect and use data whose reliability cannot be guaranteed beyond all doubt.
The compromise which has now been found with the Council reflects these concerns and, thanks to Parliament's insistence and thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur, it is based on an age limit of 12 for a transitional period of four years, during which time a broad study will be carried out in order to investigate the reliability of children's biometric data.
Unfortunately, the compromise also provides for exemptions for those Member States which already have laws allowing fingerprints to be taken from children under the age of 12.
It is therefore even more important that we expressly establish during the course of the compromise reached that the European legal act on security features and biometric data in passports and travel documents cannot under any circumstances be used as grounds for appeal in order to set up databases containing these data at national level.
