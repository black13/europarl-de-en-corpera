Mr President, my thanks go to Carlos Coelho, together with my congratulations on his report.
We would have all been disappointed if his report had been below par, because we are already used to this standard of report from him.
I particularly liked the fact that Carlos Coelho clearly pointed out from the beginning that his report was about the security of children.
We can achieve this by issuing secure passports and by taking fingerprints to ensure that it is possible to check if the person crossing the border is actually the person shown in the passport.
This is therefore an objective which can be used to achieve security for children.
That we are now discussing whether fingerprints should be taken at six years old or at twelve years old is a technical question, not a question of perspective.
I would have no problem with taking fingerprints from the age of six, because this is all about children and their security.
For me it goes without saying that data protection laws must be respected.
We should not even be discussing that.
It is the duty of a constitutional state to control that.
If we achieve a situation in which we have secure passports and data protection laws are respected, then the European Union will have made a decisive step forwards in the interests of children and against child trafficking and child smuggling.
