Mr President, my experience is presumably very similar to that of millions of Europeans.
Commissioner, I entered this Parliament in 1999 with a great deal of enthusiasm that was not inferior to the enthusiasm that you continue to display.
Then I did what so many citizens do.
I wanted to know something, and that was: how are decisions made?
Where does the money go?
Who receives it?
More and more voters have come to me and said: we do not know where we are with this EU.
This was also my experience.
Unfortunately, one then realises that behind many measures there is a deliberate intention to conceal the irresponsibility that we still have in our institutions, including unclearly assigned legislature.
I can only encourage you to keep to your convictions to go further than the Cappato report currently does and make this basic information available.
That would be an achievement, and I say this after 10 years.
