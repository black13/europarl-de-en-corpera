Mr President, this directive is part of the defence package, the context of which is, and I quote, 'the strategy for a stronger and more competitive European defence industry'.
The principal guideline, as with so many things, is the free market for defence-related products too, in other words weapons, and weapons are for killing and waging war.
The aim of the directive is to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the arms industry in the EU.
Mr Swoboda spoke plainly in the previous debate.
He said that we need better initial conditions for the European arms industry in view of the competition, in particular from the United States.
In 2005, the EU Member States jointly became for the first time the top arms exporter in the world.
Of these exports, 70% come from the four large nations of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy.
The main importer states are those of the Middle East.
Our concern should not be for a more efficient arms industry, but rather for disarmament, and unlike the efficiency of the arms industry, for this there is no directive.
It is very clear what this is really all about.
