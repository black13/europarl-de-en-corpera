Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out once again that we are talking about a package: the resolution in December and this debate today.
Only when we view both together - the regulation on transfers of defence-related products within the Community and now the procurement directive - do they make sense.
I have prepared the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
We had a core political objective, namely that with the harmonisation of the European arms industry and the liberalisation within the EU, tougher means of control with regard to the issue of exports outside the EU should at the same time be implemented.
If we are going to mention the negative headlines, we should mention the good ones as well.
At its last meeting at the end of last year, the Council, under the French Presidency, adopted the Code of Conduct as a legally binding instrument.
That is a good thing and it is what this Parliament has always called for.
I would therefore like to point out once again that this harmonisation that we consider to be right - and not only the harmonisation, but also the development of a sanction mechanism that is to be used if this directive is contravened - is now also under the control of the nation states and the Members.
We will follow this process, and not only the harmonisation, with great interest.
