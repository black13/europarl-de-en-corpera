Madam President, I would urge my fellow Member Mr van Orden to consider the fact that the only person here who supports him is the German far-left extremist.
To Mr Pfl√ºger from the left, I would say that a glance at the law will facilitate its understanding.
It is not about exports at all, it is about the European internal market.
Otherwise, what Mrs Weiler said is correct.
She said that these products are expensive through lack of competition.
Yes, when there is no competition, they are expensive.
We will hopefully introduce more competition into the European internal market.
This will certainly not make these products cheap, but perhaps more reasonably priced at least.
This is a big opportunity, an opportunity for the industry to open up new markets and an opportunity for medium-sized companies to penetrate these markets, too.
However - and this is quite important - it is also an opportunity for transparency and thus for civil society, which will be able to keep a better eye on the way this market is structured and on what is happening, and for many non-governmental organisations.
I would like to expressly thank Mr Mladenov and Mr Toubon for their reference to the unusual work involved in this project.
In essence, it is a project under the second pillar, that is the strengthening of the European security and defence policy, using an instrument of the first pillar, namely an internal market directive.
Without the splendid work of the French Presidency mediating between the Member States - an extremely difficult task - it would never have succeeded.
We must expand these opportunities.
It will be an opportunity for the political Europe.
It will be an opportunity for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and an opportunity for the Europe of values and of peace.
This is an opportunity that we must take advantage of.
