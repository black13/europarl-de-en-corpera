Madam President, I would like to make a request under Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure.
If you are addressed in person, you have the opportunity to respond briefly.
It will become clear relatively quickly who the extremists are here, if you take a look at what all this is about.
It is about market extremism, which is evident in this area.
I said that a more efficient defence industry within the European Union would naturally have an impact on arms exports.
No one can deny that this is the case.
To suggest anything else would indicate a total fixation on the European Union.
