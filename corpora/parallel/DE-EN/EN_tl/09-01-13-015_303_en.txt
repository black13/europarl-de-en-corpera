Commissioner, I am interested in the following point.
Over the last 10 years the Eurogroup has been a huge success and, particularly during the most recent crisis, other countries have expressed an interest in joining the group.
Is the Commission already planning which countries could possibly become members in future?
Are there other countries interested in joining the euro area because being a member has proved to be so worthwhile?
