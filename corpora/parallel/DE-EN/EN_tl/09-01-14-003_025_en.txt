Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union has had six months of drama, dynamism and declarations under President Sarkozy, and now you have taken over, Mr President, with a sense of humour that may take some getting used to.
I hope that yours will be a constructive, productive Council Presidency, as the EU faces immense challenges.
You yourself mentioned the war between Israel and Hamas and the economic crisis, and of course there are also internal issues such as the Treaty of Lisbon.
Allow me to take up one aspect of your speech: energy security.
You stressed its fundamental importance, and I agree with you that energy is the basic raw material of modern society.
Our lifestyle, our economy, our further development - all of this depends upon it.
We cannot be dependent on energy supplies.
Independence requires that we have a good mix of various energy sources.
Therefore, I hope that with your open, direct manner, you will be able to persuade your European partners to engage in a new discussion on nuclear power and, in particular, to encourage the German Government to end its anti-nuclear policy.
This is a requirement of security for our continent.
There is a great deal to be done, and this is your opportunity to take Europe forward.
I should like to express my thanks and my confidence in successful cooperation to come.
