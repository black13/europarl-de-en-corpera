Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Topolanek, I welcome the Czech presidency!
As a Prague citizen elected to the European Parliament as a German member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I am particularly pleased that the Czech Republic is to hold the Council Presidency for the next six months.
More than 40 years ago, following the occupation of Czechoslovakia, I went into political exile in Germany, and I still marvel that we are now free to drive forward the development of democracy and the respect for human rights in the Czech Republic and Central Europe.
The current political, economic and environmental developments would represent a great challenge for any Council Presidency - but this one, I believe, will overcome it.
I should like to wish us all, not just the Czech Republic, all the best for this Presidency.
(Applause)
