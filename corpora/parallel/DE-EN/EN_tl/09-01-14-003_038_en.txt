Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it could be that you were not expecting such a friendly, benevolent reception in the European Parliament, Mr Topol√°nek - but the Czech Council Presidency is an event tinged with history.
I have seen two landmark events in my political career, the first being German reunification and the second Europe's reunification following two bloody European civil wars in the last century.
The fact that the Czech Republic is representing the Presidency in the European Parliament today is a reflection of the incredible historic changes to which we have been witness and for which we can be grateful.
I assure you of the support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, without reservation and without scepticism.
You rightly set the ball rolling with Charles IV, who was not only one of the first architects of a trans-European transport network but also the founder of one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Europe, and thus an exponent of a European universality that has possibly left at least as great a mark on us Europeans as the treaties we have concluded.
The occasional Eurosceptic remark aside - which we are familiar with from your own country - you meet with our support.
We in the PPE-DE Group are very staunch Europeans - there is no doubt about that - but precisely because of this we are able to recognise wrong turns taken by Europe and to help put them right.
The Treaty of Lisbon is an excellent instrument for correcting any wrong turns taken by Europe.
For this reason, I wish to express here the expectation that you, as President of the Council, will contribute to the entry into force of this Treaty and that your country will ratify the Treaty as soon as possible.
