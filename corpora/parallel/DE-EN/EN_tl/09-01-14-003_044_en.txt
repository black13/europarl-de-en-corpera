Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, 'Europe without Barriers' is a good motto, as it goes to the heart of the European idea - bringing people together.
I also hope, however, that it proves possible to break down the barriers in the minds of some people, who still have political, if not ideological reservations about the European Union, and therefore close their minds to its further development as envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon.
There is a good deal more work to do on this in your country, too.
The Reform Treaty is essential.
How are you going to make energy policy without the basis laid down for this in the Treaty of Lisbon?
It cannot be done.
Many other policy areas can be looked at in the same way.
It is completely unacceptable to link ratification to other domestic problems, as this is a common Treaty and has nothing to do with domestic political disputes - the opposition against the government or vice versa.
Europe is a community of values.
Human rights and the rule of law - where your country also shows deficits - take centre stage.
I should like to take this opportunity to mention the case of Dr Yekta Uzunoglu, who has spent 14 years fighting for justice and compensation.
I appeal to you to ensure that this unfortunate case, for which VÃ¡clav Havel has already gone on hunger strike, is resolved under your Presidency.
At the end of the French Council Presidency, President Sarkozy said that the previous six months had changed him.
I hope that this experience will also change you and several others in the Czech Republic.
