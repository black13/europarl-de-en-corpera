Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the Czech Council Presidency on its assumption of office.
This is the first Council Presidency from a former Warsaw Pact country and therefore of symbolic importance, as Mr Nassauer rightly said.
The matters of the gas negotiations and the activities of President-in-Office Schwarzenberg in the Middle East and many other examples show that the Czech Council Presidency is well prepared for the work that awaits it.
Therefore, I attach particular importance to the fact that great store has been set by what has been called a strategic energy security concept.
This example, in particular, makes it clear that there are many areas in which nation-states alone are no longer able to look after the interests of their citizens, and only a common European approach will do.
However, President-in-Office, only the Treaty of Lisbon confers on us this competence in matters of energy and energy security.
Our current activities are as coordinators and are non-binding.
In the case of many of the challenges we need to take up, we shall not be able to do so without the scope for action offered by the Treaty of Lisbon - the scope for greater democratisation, namely the reinforcement of the rights of the European Parliament and those of the national parliaments.
I am assuming, therefore, that there was a mistake in the German interpretation when it interpreted you as saying that the Treaty of Nice may be better than the Treaty of Lisbon.
You should still be able to correct the German version.
For this reason, we should seek an opportunity to make clear that we can improve the way we overcome our shared challenges in all the major areas only with the help of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Thank you very much.
