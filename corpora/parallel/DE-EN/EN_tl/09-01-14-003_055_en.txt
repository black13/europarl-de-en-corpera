Madam President.
President-in-Office, you have a particular responsibility.
The Czech Council Presidency has got off to a bumpy start - its art installation has been provocative and given rise to indignation - but its serious efforts to find its feet and assume responsibility for the whole Union have been perceptible even before today.
It seems to be well prepared.
Its programme contains the right priorities.
It will subsequently be judged, however, on the determination, personal commitment and European-mindedness with which these are implemented, and on the success rate.
Commission President Barroso said that the EU is being put to the test in these six months.
The Czech Council Presidency and the Czech Government are being put to the European-policy test.
These tests can be passed only if we all give of our best.
For that reason, I would ask you to stop playing domestic policy off against European policy and burdening your Council Presidency with domestic issues.
You should make clear to citizens that you already feel that, in the matters of the gas dispute, Gaza, Slovakia's actions with regard to Bohunice and the financial crisis, the Treaty of Lisbon would strengthen your role and enable you to carry it out in better harmony with the other European institutions.
The European Union is a community of values and a common system of law.
Yes, we do have rules, and anyone breaking them, anyone not keeping to their promises, shows a lack of solidarity.
We are united despite all our differences by our community of values, our common system of law, our political objectives.
Therefore, I would make the following appeal: do not hide behind Ireland, take a step forward, ratify the Treaty of Lisbon before Europe Day 2009, before the end of your Council Presidency.
We shall judge you by your deeds and not by the comments by your President in the Czech Republic.
