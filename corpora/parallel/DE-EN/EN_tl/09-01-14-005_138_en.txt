Mr President, the Catania report is a real sham.
It contains no review whatsoever of the extent to which fundamental rights were respected in the European Union in the period from 2004 to 2008; it is merely a list of demands by the left wing in this House.
Its demands include the recognition of same-sex marriage in all Member States and the legalisation of drugs, euthanasia and illegal immigrants.
The Austrian People's Party (Ã–VP) delegation and myself reject out of hand the above demands, which were adopted by a majority, and therefore we - myself included - voted against this report.
