in writing. - I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho on security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents.
It does not make sense, however, to accept a flawed regulation unquestioningly if there are some ways in which it could be improved.
For example, it is unacceptable for different Member States to apply different rules on the age for fingerprinting children, and therefore it is important to introduce measures, particularly with regard to child trafficking, that, if not always taken jointly, are at least more comprehensive.
Ultimately, it is important to me to emphasise that biometric data may under no circumstances be used for dishonest purposes.
A strict, recurrent review of data security is therefore indispensable.
