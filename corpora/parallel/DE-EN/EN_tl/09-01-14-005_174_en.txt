in writing. - I abstained from voting on the 'Report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States'.
This report envisages a limitation on the biometric monitoring of citizens of EU Member States in that children under the age of 12 years are excepted from the requirement to provide biometric data.
Such an exception is to be warmly welcomed.
Nevertheless, I reject biometric authentication systems out of hand.
They lead to increased police-state monitoring of citizens.
This is not the way to improve security.
As the report broadly accepts this monitoring, I could not vote in favour; whereas rejecting it would have meant rejecting the improvement I mentioned.
That is why I abstained.
