in writing. - I voted against the Catania report.
I am astounded that the House's services even declared this report admissible in its present form.
It persistently infringes the principle of subsidiarity.
In terms of its content, virtually everything is worthy of criticism.
The nation-states must not let themselves be incapacitated or disempowered when it comes to fundamental rights.
This represents an attempt to push through, to the detriment of the majority, minority rights that cannot be implemented at national level.
A positive attitude to abortion is inconceivable to me.
The actual subject, human rights and their implementation over the last four years, is not mentioned.
