in writing. - I rejected this report.
The demands it makes go way beyond what I understand by transparency.
I consider even the publication of MEPs' attendance registers and voting lists dangerous without extensive additional channels of explanation.
I have a high attendance record and am therefore above suspicion.
It is important to preserve legal protection of personality for MEPs, too.
Europe could increase transparency by publishing public meetings of the Council and the Commission to begin with, before forcing MEPs to lay themselves bare.
In addition, there must be confidentiality among the institutions during difficult negotiation phases.
