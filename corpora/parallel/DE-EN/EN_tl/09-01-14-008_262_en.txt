The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East/Gaza Strip.
It is a particular pleasure to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Karel Schwarzenberg, who has to travel on to South Africa today.
Previous Presidencies have arranged for a representative to take the place of their Minister for Foreign Affairs, and so we particularly appreciate your presence here today, Mr Schwarzenberg.
I wish you a very warm welcome!
We are of course also pleased that the competent Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, is present - as she almost always is.
As you know, the Commissioner is also very knowledgeable about the problems of the Middle East conflict and, like Mr Schwarzenberg, she has travelled to the region.
I wish you a very warm welcome too, Commissioner.
