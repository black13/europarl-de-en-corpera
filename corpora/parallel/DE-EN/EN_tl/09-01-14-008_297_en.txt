Ladies and gentlemen, I really must insist now that you keep to your speaking time.
I have never interrupted speakers, even when their speaking time had elapsed, but Mr Schwarzenberg is already giving us more of his time than we were expecting.
He has until 5.20 p.m. at the latest, I have been told.
I would entreat you to bear in mind the time for which you applied.
Being a general, Mr Morillon will set a good example.
