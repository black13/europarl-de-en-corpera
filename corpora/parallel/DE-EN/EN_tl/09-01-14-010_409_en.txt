Mr Vondra, I hold you in high regard as an experienced human rights activist, and I also regard Czech creativity very highly, hence my questions.
Can you help us find new ways to bring the issue of the Yukos prisoners closer to a solution after years of talking, in other words to develop a degree of actionism?
Also, how can we bring the human rights issue into somewhat sharper focus in practical terms in the negotiations with Russia?
