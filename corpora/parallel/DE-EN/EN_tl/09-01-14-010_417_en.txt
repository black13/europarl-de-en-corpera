Mr Vondra, it is always being said that agricultural policy is there for only the 3% who farm, but there are 100% of us who eat.
I, for one, eat heartily, and I should like to state very clearly my belief that food security is existential.
We are currently seeing the problems of energy dependence.
I am in favour of free world trade, but we must be able to feed ourselves from our own soil, and so we need to preserve our farming structures: this cannot be left solely in the hands of the market.
