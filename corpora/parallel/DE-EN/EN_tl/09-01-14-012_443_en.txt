on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, the Horn of Africa has recently moved back into focus in the EU.
After all, the EU's combat mission Atalanta has been stationed there since Christmas.
In sending this mission, the EU has made the mistake of NATO, the United States, Russia and others there of superficially combating problems by military means, by means of warships.
Indeed, Mr Kouchner actually welcomed the opportunity for action, 10 years after Saint-Malo, with a maritime combat operation off Somalia.
The real causes of the problem are the unfair distribution of resources, for example owing to exploitation of fish stocks, including by fishing trawlers from the European Union.
Somalia is one of the countries whose virtually non-existent government the West is supporting by all means possible.
The Ethiopian occupying forces have now left Somalia, but more than 16 000 people have lost their lives since the invasion of these forces.
Dealings with the countries of the Horn of Africa are illustrated by the example of Djibouti, which has an authoritarian regime, yet all manner of Western countries have military bases there.
Assistance must be provided to the people of the region - not by means of warships, which serve only to protect Western trading routes, but in the form of humanitarian aid, for example.
