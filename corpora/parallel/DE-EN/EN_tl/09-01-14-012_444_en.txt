Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Somalia is a failed State, with all the dreadful things this entails.
You have set out most excellently what needs to be done here, and my friend Mrs Gomes has also stated this very clearly.
Piracy is just one part - albeit an important one - of this problem, as piracy is very firmly established in the region.
A second aspect is the protection of EU maritime routes, which is in the European Union's own interests and those of its citizens.
That is why we have the ESDP operation Atalanta, which is the first maritime operation under the ESDP.
The operation's headquarters are in the United Kingdom, which is also new, and it is being led by a British naval officer, Rear Admiral Jones.
Its first task is to protect food aid and to make sure that this aid can actually reach Somalia, and its second is to combat piracy and take the appropriate action.
We had a conversation with the operation headquarters in Northwood, which made clear that they are missing several things, such as tankers and reconnaissance aircraft - manned and unmanned - and helicopters, as the surveillance needs to be carried out over a very large area.
We must all have a common interest in a successful Operation Atalanta.
This is necessary both to protect our maritime routes and to make a contribution - albeit possibly just a small one - to solving the problem of the failed State of Somalia.
