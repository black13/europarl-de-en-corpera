on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - I welcome the Czech presidency headed by vice-premier Alexander Vondra.
By registering the democratic opposition Movement for Freedom, led by Alexander Milinkevich, and releasing political prisoners, the Belarusian Government has sent out signals that it is becoming more open.
Now comes the test of whether a genuine will to change and to resume relations with the EU lies behind the readiness to engage in dialogue.
We want to see Belarus find its place in Europe; we have been waiting a long time for this and are prepared to resume relations, but only on clear conditions, chief among which is respect for human rights.
This goes not only for freedom of the press and of expression, but also for the entire political, social and private life of every individual.
The electoral fraud and the attacks on the opposition have not been forgotten, and we are following developments very closely.
In October, we decided to suspend the entry ban for President Lukashenko.
For its part, Belarus needs to permit entry to European delegations, too, to enable debates with opposition members.
Experience has taught us that all dictatorships come to an end!
