on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner.
War, concentration camps, genocide - never again!
After the horrors of the Second World War, no one in Europe could imagine that this could ever happen again.
Yet it could: in the mid-1990s, six years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, whilst Western and Central Europe were growing together in peace, it happened again in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The mistakes of the international community - many years of looking the other way, of almost carefree dealings with the thugs there, of friendly handshakes with criminals such as Ratko Mladić - have strengthened acceptance of him and his accomplices: they got off scot-free when they followed the years of ethnic expulsions, of ethnic cleansing, with a massacre.
To this day, Ratko Mladić has not had to answer to the courts.
Who is hiding him?
Who is helping him and thus placing themselves and him under an even greater burden of guilt?
Many of the other perpetrators are also still at large, and some are even still living in Bosnia-Herzegovina among the bereaved families of the victims.
Therefore, we must insist that not only the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, but also the local war-crimes tribunals in Bosnia-Herzegovina, be able to do their jobs properly.
The commemorative day we have proclaimed is intended as a shake-up, as a signal not to forget, and as a demonstration to the bereaved families that we mourn with them.
Indeed, perhaps this day can serve to arouse awareness of these terrible crimes even in those who still do not believe that it happened, as even video recordings prove, and then the foundations for the necessary reconciliation can be laid.
Without recognition of the direct and indirect responsibility for this massacre, there can be no peace.
We owe this at least, and the conviction of the perpetrators, to the victims and their families.
