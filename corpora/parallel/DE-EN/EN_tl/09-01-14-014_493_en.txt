on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, the resolution speaks of the UN, and also of the European institutions, in very clear, critical terms.
The shortcomings in the decision-making mechanisms in the field of foreign and security policy were not conducive to preventing the terrible crimes in Srebrenica.
The lack of a single voice remains a shortcoming in the European Neighbourhood Policy to this day, as today's discussion on the Gaza conflict has shown once more.
The massacre in Srebrenica must never be forgotten, which is why we welcome and support the initiative to proclaim 11 July the commemorative day for the victims of this genocide.
At the same time, however, there must be reconciliation on both sides, which can be done only by consistently reappraising the events.
It is totally unacceptable, therefore, that the guilty parties and those accused of this crime are still at large.
I believe that not only MladiÄ‡ but also the other guilty parties must stand trial.
