Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a community can work together constructively only if everyone abides by the laws and rules.
Farmers, in particular, attach the highest priority to ensuring that animals are transported in such a way that, after slaughter, the meat that reaches consumers is of the best quality and affected as little as possible by stress.
Black sheep must be named and shamed, as these violations are unacceptable and bring the whole industry into disrepute.
We have to successfully reduce the transport of live animals for slaughter.
I hope that we can arrive at a comprehensible state of affairs in this regard at long last, and also that there is a scientific basis.
Commissioner, I wish to reiterate my call for third-country imports failing to comply with the rules to be treated and punished in exactly the same way as animal shipments within the EU.
