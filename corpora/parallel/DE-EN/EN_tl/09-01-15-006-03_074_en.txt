Many thanks, Mr Schulz.
Since I was unable to take part in yesterday's reception owing to the visit by the President of the Council, Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek, I wish to say the following to Mr Rocard.
Mr Rocard, I should like to express my friendship and my deep respect for you, and to wish you happiness and success in all your future plans.
I hope that we shall continue to see each other frequently, and I wish to thank you for the great contribution you have made to European integration.
You have my sincere thanks, Mr Rocard!
