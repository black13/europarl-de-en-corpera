Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in Office of the Council, Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg, and the External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, for participating in our debate yesterday, and also my fellow Members for today's vote, which was almost unanimous.
The EU is indeed much more united than people say.
If we remain so, we can achieve something in the Middle East, and so we must continue in this direction.
The components are clear: 'yes' to the right of Israel to exist, 'no' to war and bloodshed, 'no' to Hamas' rocket fire, 'no' to Hamas' terrorism and, crucially, 'yes' to negotiations on the bones of contention, including the problem of the settlers, as this, alongside the unacceptable terrorism on the part of Hamas, is at the heart of the matter.
The fundamental components are on the table, therefore, and so the task of the EU is to drive things forward with energy and determination instead of degenerating into a disunited talking shop, which - unfortunately - we have been in recent years in the matter of Middle East policy.
