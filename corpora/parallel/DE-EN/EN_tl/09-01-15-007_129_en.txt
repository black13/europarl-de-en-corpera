in writing. - I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Riera Madurell on the transposition of the Directive on equal treatment.
In my opinion, it is high time that women were treated as equal to men in all, not just some, respects.
It cannot be said - not by a long chalk - that equal opportunities exist in access to careers or day-to-day working life.
As regards the income gap between the sexes, in some Member States, this is closing extremely hesitantly, whereas in others it is even widening again.
The implementation of this directive is particularly important to me because of these obvious injustices and particularly because, as a family person, I value and respect women greatly.
