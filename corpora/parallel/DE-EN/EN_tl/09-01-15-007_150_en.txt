I welcome the adoption of the resolution on the situation in the Gaza Strip.
It is imperative that the European Parliament express its views on the crisis.
It is the duty of Parliament to condemn this humanitarian disaster, laying claim as it does to moral leadership on respect for human rights.
It is precisely because of this that Parliament can no longer remain silent.
That is why I voted in favour of this resolution.
Nevertheless, Parliament could have sent out a stronger signal; the resolution remains too weak on some points.
It is important that we call for a lasting cease-fire and condemn the suffering of the civilian population.
It is also our duty to suggest practical solutions for ending the war and to call on the EU to commit itself to these in its role within the Quartet.
As the United States is currently in a state of paralysis on account of its change of president, the EU must further increase its sense of duty.
A pause in the negotiations on enhancing relations with Israel is called for in view of such excessive military action.
Unfortunately, there is no mention of this in the resolution.
If Israel does not want to negotiate directly with Hamas, it is up to the EU to work to ensure that others talk to Hamas.
The continuation of the military offensive is costing too many lives.
Lip service is insufficient in the face of such a severe humanitarian crisis.
