on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, my office in Munich is situated on a street that is home to many Christian Armenians from Iran.
They are members of one of the most ancient Christian communities in the world and are, at the same time, patriotic Persians.
This shows that Iran/Persia has an ancient tradition of tolerance, not only towards different religions but also towards the many peoples comprising its large empire.
It runs entirely counter to the Iranian/Persian spirit to rule as intolerantly as this mullah regime is doing.
It runs counter to the best, most noble traditions of one of the most ancient countries on earth.
Therefore, it is in the interests of the Iranian people and its future that we be clearer in our denunciation of these abuses.
Ms Shirin Ebadi, who has denounced these abuses at great personal risk, and who won the Nobel Peace Prize as a result, continues to do so on behalf of all ethnic groups and all religious communities.
We cannot tolerate such dreadful, abominable persecution of Ms Ebadi.
She needs our solidarity.
Therefore, I appeal to the Czech Council Presidency to apply its sound human rights policy in this matter, too.
