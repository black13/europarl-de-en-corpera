The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 29 January 2009, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Monday: Mrs Roure has withdrawn her request for a brief presentation of her report on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and refugees in the Member States.
The report will therefore be put to the vote on Thursday.
Thursday: The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has requested that the item on the situation in the Philippines be replaced with an item entitled 'Refusal of the extradition from Brazil of Cesare Battisti'.
