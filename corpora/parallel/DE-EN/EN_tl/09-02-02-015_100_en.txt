Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what would you do, Commissioner, to speed up the opening of the Chinese and Indian markets?
The main thing, of course, is that we should be able to export our products to those countries.
Very many European companies have invested in China, building or acquiring factories there.
That is why a more open market is really the top priority.
What scope is there for you - in cooperation with Commissioner Kov√°cs, where appropriate - to provide the textile industry with tax incentives, such as shorter depreciation periods, with a view to enhancing companies' creditworthiness?
That would naturally help to safeguard jobs as well.
When the Basel II Accord is implemented in the future, there will therefore be a need to have structures in place that serve to make firms more creditworthy.
