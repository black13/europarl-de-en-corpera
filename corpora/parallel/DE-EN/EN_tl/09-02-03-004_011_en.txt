draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new proposal submitted by the Commission is urgently needed.
The members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality have specific questions and suggestions relating to the proposal.
It is essential that we go beyond the confines of the Daphne Programme and introduce legislative initiatives in the area of child pornography.
Of course, this is also the responsibility of the users, but the states must take action.
For example, I believe that Europol is an important tool which, combined with an effective network of experts and a special unit whose members have had training on very specific issues, can be used to combat child pornography and prostitution.
We must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality by taking a joint European approach.
We need more background information in the form of concrete studies on the social situation of the victims, because family members themselves are often responsible for abusing children and putting them on the net.
It is important for us to make definite progress in this area.
I hope that the Commission is prepared to work closely with the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality so that we can resolve these questions together.
