Madam President, throughout the world the hope of obtaining a well-paid job has a very strong appeal.
In particular, in difficult economic times, the black economy starts to grow which, of course, results in many people risking their lives in the search for the land of plenty.
It is important for us to make it clear that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated.
However, the recent report on fundamental human rights presents a few problems in this respect.
The report indicates that breaches of EU entry requirements will be rewarded, as immigrants will be given greater protection than the people of Europe, whose identity and social harmony are under threat from mass immigration.
Illegal immigration will be trivialised if, in future, every illegal immigrant is seen simply as a person without a valid work permit.
However, we must not forget that migrants without residence permits will ultimately have to be deported.
It is important for us to do away with incentives, such as mass legalisation and the prospect of employment.
In addition, we must negotiate effective agreements on deportation with the countries of origin.
Also, the FRONTEX border security organisation must finally be expanded so that it can be deployed efficiently.
