Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I believe that what Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler has said is right.
I would like to thank Mr Fava for his report and for the excellent work that he has done.
The report makes it clear that both parties involved in illegal employment must be held equally liable, which will create a legal balance.
Illegal employment must be penalised and prohibited in all Member States.
Employers must be made responsible for upholding this ban, but it is also the job of the relevant authorities to monitor the observance of the ban and to impose penalties.
The most important issue is to protect the people in these employment relationships from exploitation.
Establishing legal penalties certainly represents a step forward.
However, the authorities must put in place more controls and prosecute those suspected of committing offences.
The report is a compromise between the Council and the European Parliament and specifies minimum standards.
Nevertheless, the prospect of Member States strengthening or weakening the requirements is not inspiring.
We have taken the first step forward.
Now we should go the rest of the way together.
I think I can say, at least for myself and on behalf of parts of my group, if not for the majority, that we can support this report in good conscience.
