Madam President, the most important result of this report is that not only illegally employed third-country nationals, but also their employers, will be penalised.
We must be aware - and this really is a crime - that these people are being exploited even in a progressive confederation of states such as Europe.
Someone is making a good profit out of them.
They have no right to healthcare or pensions and they live in constant fear of being caught and sent back to their home country.
For this reason, I believe that another very important point is the opportunity in future of imposing penalties on employers who exploit illegal immigrants.
Measures such as fines, responsibility for the cost of deportation, withdrawal of public funding or support or even temporary or permanent closure of the business are, in my opinion, urgently needed to bring about a change in the situation.
Regular and effective inspections by the individual Member States are also, of course, essential in this respect, along with the possibility of requiring tax and social security contributions to be paid retrospectively.
A Europe in which some people are exploited by others is not a truly social Europe.
It is my belief that this directive represents a step in the right direction.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work.
However, this must not, under any circumstances, be the last step that we take.
