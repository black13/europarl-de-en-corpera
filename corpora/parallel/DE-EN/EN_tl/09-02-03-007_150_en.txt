Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Záborská report, which the Greens were opposed to and introduced an alternative discussion about.
I am of the opinion that we in Europe must ensure, on the basis of our community of shared values, that women in particular who are starting a family have the right to choose whether to stop work completely or only to work part-time after the birth, in order to care for their child.
I was very fortunate that my mother was able to do this and I must say that I have benefited from it.
If my mother had been unlucky enough to be divorced after twenty years of marriage, she would have been in a difficult situation, because she would not have received any social security support, particularly in old age.
I have been fighting for forty years to ensure that women who choose to devote themselves to their family and their children are not discriminated against and do not put themselves in the wrong by making this choice.
I cannot vote in favour of an ideology which wants to entrust children and adults to the state from the cradle to the grave.
I regret the fact that the report from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality was rejected.
The majority of members who voted against it did a disservice to women, to the family and to society.
