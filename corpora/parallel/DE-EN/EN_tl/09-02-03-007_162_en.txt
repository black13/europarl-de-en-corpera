I voted against Angelika Niebler's report on the extension of the agreement for scientific and technical cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America.
The content of the extended agreement differs from the previous agreement in that sections on space research and security research have been added.
As both the USA and the EU are explicitly planning to use space for military ends and as they define security primarily in military terms, it is reasonable to assume that the cooperation agreement will also serve military purposes.
Cooperation in the fields of science and research is extremely important.
However, it must be used for civilian purposes.
I am opposed to any military use.
