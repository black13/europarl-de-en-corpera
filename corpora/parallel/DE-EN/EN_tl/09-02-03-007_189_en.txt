I have voted against the report by Luís Queiró on the future of general and business aviation.
It is undoubtedly true that the number of general and business aircraft movements has increased significantly and therefore that the environmental impact has also grown.
However, in my opinion, investing in the expansion of airports is the wrong approach, because this will only lead to more demand for travel and an increase in air traffic.
We need to find alternatives so that the level of air traffic does not escalate and pollution remains within reasonable limits.
