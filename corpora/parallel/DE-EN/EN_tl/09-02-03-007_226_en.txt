I have voted in favour of the Záborská report on bringing an end to discrimination.
We must do everything that we possibly can to achieve gender equality.
On the one hand, men must become more involved in housework and childcare and, on the other, it must be possible for women to follow a completely independent career.
However, it is important that we never lose sight of the welfare of children and make appropriate, affordable childcare facilities available.
