I am voting in favour of the Angelilli report on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
Nowadays, it is more important than ever for children's development and integrity to be protected in every possible way.
Since, in most families, both parents work, the grandparents are not available to look after the children and the Internet is often the only form of entertainment, the extent of the risk is undeniable.
