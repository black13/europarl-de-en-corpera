While the European Parliament is discussing how children can be better protected, the Islamic world is moving in the opposite direction.
The most senior Islamic cleric in Saudi Arabia has described girls aged 10 or 12 as 'marriageable' and has demanded the right for child marriages to take place.
As a result of Islamic immigrants, this will also have an impact on Europe and we must prepare ourselves for this eventuality.
Our children must be given the best possible protection.
As sex offenders who target children have a high reoffending rate, we must establish an EU-wide register of the names of potential sex offenders, paedophiles and people with relevant behavioural problems.
We must combat violence against children and child abuse in all its forms more effectively and increase the penalties for sexual contact with children and the possession of child pornography.
I have voted in favour of the Angelilli report because it will improve the protection for our children.
