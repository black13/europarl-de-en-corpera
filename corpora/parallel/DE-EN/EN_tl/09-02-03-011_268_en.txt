Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, should prisoners from Guantánamo be accepted in the European Union?
This is the question which we must ask ourselves today.
The answer will depend on the considerations which we choose to be guided by.
Some people allege that the prisoners have been tortured.
This is a reason for accepting them, under the dictates of humanity.
It is without doubt true that torture is the most inhumane and degrading practice.
If these people have been tortured, then they have a right to our sympathy, regardless of the individual accusations made against them.
However, is that the only aspect which we have to consider?
For example, many of the people who are or were imprisoned in Guantánamo went to training camps for terrorists in Afghanistan after 11 September.
They were not tourists who wanted to experience the beauty of the country, but potential terrorists.
We have a duty to protect European citizens against potential terrorists.
Unfortunately, torture takes place all over the world and we constantly condemn it.
We have not yet gone as far as saying that anyone who has been tortured has a right to be accepted in Europe.
We have not yet done this, for good reason.
Instead we have weighed this consideration against the need for security in the European Union.
We must also do that in this case.
We must ensure that potential terrorists do not descend on Europe and, therefore, in evaluating this problem, I would like to see the need for security being given the highest priority above all other considerations.
