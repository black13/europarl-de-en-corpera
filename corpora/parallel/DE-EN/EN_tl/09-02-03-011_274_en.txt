Mr President, my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, has demanded the closure of the US prison camp in Guant치namo right from the start.
Contrary to all the relevant fundamental legal principles and international agreements, people have been held captive and tortured over a period of years and denied a fair trial.
Their fundamental human rights have been disregarded.
The very power which tries to uphold human rights, democracy and freedom throughout the world has violated fundamental rights in this case and created its own unlegislated area for its war on terror.
This is unacceptable!
It was important that the European Parliament constantly repeated its call for the closure of Guant치namo over a long period.
However, now that a new government has said that it is changing its policy, we Europeans are now starting to cast doubt on what we ourselves have been calling for.
We are hesitating and starting a shameful period of horse-trading.
I regard this as a cynical approach.
What has happened to our call for the universality and indivisibility of human rights?
We cannot really be saying that we want to preach one thing and do another.
It cannot be true that, in some way, we want to justify and accept this shameful camp.
We cannot only regard upholding human rights as an important principle when we demand it of others and do not do anything to promote it ourselves.
I call on the Member States to state their position clearly, but I also say on behalf of my group that the closure of the prison camp at Guant치namo only represents the first step.
The US military base at Guant치namo must also be removed.
