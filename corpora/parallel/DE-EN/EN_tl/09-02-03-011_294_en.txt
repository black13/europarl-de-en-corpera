Mr President, there is no question that the responsibility for Guantánamo lies with the USA.
However, it is an act of solidarity to help and support Barack Obama to return to the rule of international law when he asks us to do so.
I am thinking, for example, about the Uighurs who cannot return to China.
However, we also need to consider the people who have spent five or seven years in Guantánamo.
We cannot decide whether or not they want to live in the USA.
That is their choice.
For example, the city of Munich and the Uighurs who live there would be ready to accept these Uighur people and to support and care for them so that they can come to terms with their traumatic experiences.
However, one thing must be made clear.
It is not acceptable for the Bavarian Interior Minister, Joachim Hermann, to say: 'Everyone who is held in Guantánamo must have committed a crime'.
The right to the presumption of innocence must apply in this case.
As the head of a police authority, this minister should pack his bags and go.
We are training the police in other countries to introduce precisely this right to the presumption of innocence into their work and not to give premature orders to shoot.
We should think carefully about that.
