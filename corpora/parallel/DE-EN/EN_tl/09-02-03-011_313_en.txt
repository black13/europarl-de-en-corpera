Mr President, I would like to agree with all those speakers who want to ensure that Europe does its humanitarian duty by supporting, in particular, those people who have been denounced, despite the fact that no evidence has been found against them.
These are classic asylum cases.
However, I would like to ask the Member States not to attempt to go it alone and I would like to put particular emphasis on this.
Europe must learn to speak with one voice and to take united action.
This would allow us to meet the concerns of the new US administration and to live up to our own self-image as a European Union with joint values which oblige us to take joint action.
