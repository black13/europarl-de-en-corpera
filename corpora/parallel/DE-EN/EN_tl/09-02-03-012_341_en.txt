Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must give priority to the careful treatment of refugees.
In Europe, we are all familiar with the concept of compulsory school attendance.
We should start by allowing the people who are stranded here to have a proper education.
Language teaching and vocational training are both urgently needed, together with the opportunity to learn about European culture so that the time spent in these detention camps is not wasted, but instead we help people to help themselves.
This should be our main objective.
Perhaps we can include a preparatory measure in the budget to allow us to offer these people educational opportunities.
They have come to Europe in desperation and we should be able to give them a basic framework to enable them to be successful in their home countries and to play an active role in promoting democracy and freedom.
