Mr President, I have listened very carefully to this debate and have remained here from beginning to end, unlike many group spokesmen.
I have noticed one thing and that is that more than half of the debate was devoted to internal Italian politics.
This is a legitimate concern, but I suggest that the debate should primarily take place in Rome and not here in the European Parliament.
We are discussing a European issue here and we should include one additional point in the discussion.
Hardly any of the speeches have referred to the fact that this issue concerns not only refugees, asylum seekers and economic immigrants to Europe, but it is also, to a large degree, about finally putting an end to organised crime.
None of the people who come to Lampedusa or Malta have organised a boat for themselves.
They come because they have been enticed by organised crime organisations and have paid a great deal of money.
