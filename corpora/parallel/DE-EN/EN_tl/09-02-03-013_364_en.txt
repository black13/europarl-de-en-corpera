I welcome the fact that the European Union is making a humanitarian commitment to help those who are suffering in the Gaza Strip.
I also welcome the fact that we have condemned what is probably a disproportionate reaction on the part of Israel and have rightly indicated that this is not the way to secure peace because, on the contrary, it puts peace at risk.
However, we should also take the time to explain on behalf of the European Union that people within the Gaza Strip have committed illegal violent acts which have a direct and fatal impact on the residents of Israel.
I would be pleased if the European Union could provide a balanced response in this respect.
