Commissioner, it is always a great pleasure to listen to what you have to say and to discuss issues with you.
I have produced a diagram which shows the career of your special advisor.
I would like to ask you how you ensure that no conflicts of interest come about.
One of the people who plays a role in your new offers appears on this diagram.
This is someone who has had a business relationship with your special advisor for a long time.
So how do you ensure that no conflicts of interest occur?
