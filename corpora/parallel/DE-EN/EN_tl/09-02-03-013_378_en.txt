I would like to query something again.
We understand that a search is going on for property outside the European area.
However, I think that European tax money is being used and that the European Parliament should be involved in a transparent process.
My question is as follows.
As you yourself have said, Commissioner, nine parties have already shown interest in this call for information and are currently being evaluated.
However, specific changes of use have been introduced at one site, the Heysel site.
How does the information which you have just given us fit together with what is obviously already in preparation on this site?
We would like some more specific information, in particular, about when we will be informed about the overall status and about the procedure.
