The European Parliament has moved its relationship with Latin America onto a new level, because we now have mutual relationships between the European Parliament and almost all the Latin American parliaments, including the Andean Parliament, via EuroLat.
Is this enforced, pragmatic return to bilateralism really the right approach or should we attempt to have an intensive dialogue with Latin America as a whole and only take specific requirements into consideration in the context of special arrangements?
