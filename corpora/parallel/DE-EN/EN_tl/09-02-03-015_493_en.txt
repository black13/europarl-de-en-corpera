Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is normal for people in Europe to undergo compulsory schooling.
This involves becoming familiar with the customs and the culture of the country in which you live, so that you are able to live there.
Compulsory schooling involves learning the language of the country and possibly other languages.
It also forms the basis for vocational training and shows how the culture of the country has developed and where it is heading.
In addition, students learn about history.
Compulsory schooling, as we understand it, helps people to live together in harmony.
If you live in a country, it is clear that you must also be able to understand the language of the country.
This is the purpose served by a good compulsory schooling system.
Against this background, I would like to say that many of the problems in Europe could be solved by the efficient provision of compulsory schooling for all the residents of a country.
