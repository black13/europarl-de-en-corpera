Madam President, the Florenz report actually contains a lot of good suggestions.
One good thing about the climate debate is that it will act as a catalyst for the transition into the age of renewable energies.
This is shown very clearly in the report along with many opportunities for new technologies and economic development.
However, I think it is a shame that we have excluded large areas of science.
Studies and scientists that approach the subject of climate change with less gloomy scenarios or perhaps even positively, have simply been ignored.
Corresponding applications were rejected by the majority, and that was that.
Science is only what fits into the political concept.
This will not work, because science does not allow itself to be manipulated.
Thus, the report will, unfortunately, hit rocky ground in the end.
Anyone who, on this basis, demands a reduction in CO2 of 80% or more is jeopardising the economy and social achievement.
Anyone who, at the same time, demands the abandonment of nuclear power is consciously closing his eyes to reality.
Anyone who demands accounting standards for all areas of human life is at odds with the fundamental idea of freedom.
Anyone who demands new laws for soil and agriculture is abusing the climate debate for the purposes of implementing sanctions that he or she wanted to implement anyway but which have nothing to do with climate change.
And anyone who demands protective clothing against the effects of the climate is deliberately stirring up anxiety.
I hope that these radical and misplaced ideologies will not be included in the report.
I will then be able to support the report, as protection of the environment is very important to me, particularly when it can be combined with social achievement and economic competitiveness.
