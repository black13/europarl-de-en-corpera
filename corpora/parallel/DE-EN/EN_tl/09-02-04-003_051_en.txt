- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Temporary Committee on Climate Change has done a very good job.
Today we have in front of us the final report to be put to the vote.
It indicates how we, as the European Parliament, envisage future climate policy and what measures need to be taken as regards adaptation to climate change.
I hope that, when the next legislative process is due, we in Parliament also reach such a high level of agreement so that what we have documented in this report will be put into practice.
Through the committee's method of working, this report has also succeeded in achieving a horizontal viewpoint.
I have to say that we ought to maintain this committee's method of working in the next parliamentary term, too, as Mr Sacconi has just suggested.
The fight against climate change cannot be waged by Europe alone.
We must also get other continents and countries on board.
The committee has also done a good job in this regard, because we, as Parliament, have for the first time become visible in matters of climate diplomacy and I would like to emphasise this once again in this House.
When we talk about adaptation measures then we are also talking about funding.
In this regard, I would like, once again, to call on the other two institutions, the Commission and the Council, to give this matter top priority in the next Financial Perspective.
We can adopt the most wonderful reports here, but if there is no money available for the measures then the report will come to nothing.
We should also look once more at the extent to which the financial measures that we are already taking are having an effect, and let us please have this summarised in an audit.
