Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, who has indeed tried to achieve as much as possible for all of us.
Agriculture is particularly affected by climate change, as its products are produced in the open air.
We think of droughts and desertification, as we are seeing in southern Italy, for example, or of other extreme weather phenomena, such as unexpected rain and hail showers or floods, which often affect the livelihoods of our farmers.
Agriculture is often depicted as the big cause of climate change.
Around 10% of global greenhouse gases are produced in agriculture, most of which, however, are gases of natural origin, such as methane.
In my opinion, agriculture is, on the contrary, leading the way in the fight against climate change.
I would like to document the following with a study from Austria from 2008: through plants such as grass, maize and cereals and the soil, agriculture and forestry consume and bind considerably more greenhouse gases than they generate.
According to the study from 2008, the emissions from agriculture and forestry of approximately 8 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year compare in total with a binding effect of 58 million tonnes CO2 or CO2 equivalents.
This shows that agriculture should not be depicted as an environmental villain.
Quite the opposite.
Here are some more figures: since 1990, agriculture in Austria has reduced its CO2 emissions by 1.3 million tonnes.
Energy is another important area in which agriculture contributes to the fight against climate change.
For example, agriculture in Austria consumes approximately 2.2% of the energy generated.
The proportion of renewable energy is 23%, a large share of which again belongs to agriculture.
Finally, I would like to say the following.
Great importance must...
