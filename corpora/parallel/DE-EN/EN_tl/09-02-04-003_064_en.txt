Madam President, taking the consequences of climate change seriously means listening to all of the various sides of the debate, including that of science.
We had a lot of experts in the committee, that is true.
Unfortunately, however, they represented only one view.
We did not get the chance to hear all sides of the debate.
I think this was a mistake.
We had an initial draft of Mr Florenz's report, which was considerably better than the one we have before us today on which we are to base our decision.
Many of the suggestions that are currently included are fine, but, in my opinion, a lot of them are wrong.
It makes no sense constantly to resort to new regulations and new measures.
The only solution can be to say 'yes' to innovation and 'yes' to research.
The solution lies in assuming individual responsibility and not in ever increasing state regulations.
There are numerous nonsensical regulations, such as the accounting obligation, prevention of and sanctions on the consumption of meat, calumnies on agriculture and many others.
In my opinion, this is the wrong way to go and I therefore find this report problematic as it currently stands.
