rapporteur. - Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, I am very pleased that, in the closing stages of this Temporary Committee, this issue has been met with such strong interest, and for that I am most warmly appreciative.
I would also like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate and all those who have worked with us.
We have produced a roadmap to take us to Copenhagen, which naturally contains signposts as well as stop signs and unrestricted travel signs, but also signs that indicate that there are difficult roads ahead.
We have discussed this here today.
I am pleased that there have been critical comments, some of which we can take on board.
The suggestion from Mr Holm for the citizens of Europe to stop eating meat is, I am sorry to say, quite ludicrous, but we all have our own opinions.
There will be a successful outcome in the end and everyone will have contributed to this.
Once again, you have my sincere thanks.
