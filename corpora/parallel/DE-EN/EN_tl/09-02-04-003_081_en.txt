in writing. - Europe and the world are currently facing considerable challenges.
The capital market crisis is not the only pressing problem.
We must also initiate a sustainable programme to combat climate change as quickly as possible.
As large an economic and political association as the European Union is able to establish itself as the leading partner in the fight against climate change.
The first step has already been taken in this regard - the Union has agreed binding climate targets and, with the adoption of the climate change package in December 2008, it has got many appropriate measures for protecting the climate underway.
The top priority must now be the conclusion of the international agreement in Copenhagen, whilst avoiding de-industrialisation and unnecessary burdens on the European economy.
We should instead increase our investment in, and research into, green technology.
In this way, Europe can move forward, not only in the area of the environment, but also in the area of the economy.
