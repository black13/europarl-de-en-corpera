President Abbas, I would like to thank you very much on behalf of the European Parliament for coming here to Strasbourg and speaking to us.
We now have the joint task of working for peace.
We in the European Union and the European Parliament want to be honest brokers of peace.
We want the people of Israel to live within secure borders and we want the people of Palestine to live within secure borders.
Our starting point is human dignity.
Palestinian girls work just as hard in school as Israeli girls.
Israeli boys love playing football just as much as Palestinian boys.
The time must come for peaceful co-existence of the kind which we have in Europe.
That is our wish for the Middle East.
We wish you, President Abbas, every success in all your efforts to bring about peace.
A secure Palestinian state and also a secure Israeli state, and this comment is addressed to Israel, must not remain a future vision.
This must become reality and it must happen within our lifetime.
If we really want this to come about, then we will be able to achieve it.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like to thank you.
If circumstances permit, we will meet again on 23 and 24 February.
The Bureau of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has asked me to visit Palestine and Israel.
I will head a delegation which will travel to Gaza and we will also visit areas of southern Israel.
If your diary allows, and I hope that this will be possible, we will meet in Ramallah.
I will, of course, also be visiting Jerusalem.
We want to help - and this comes both from our head and from our heart - to make peace possible between Israel and Palestine, between Palestine and Israel in the Middle East.
President Abbas, we would like to thank you for your hard work and to encourage you to continue on the road of reconciliation, compromise and peace.
We would like to thank you for your visit to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
