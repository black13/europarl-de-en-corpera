Madam President, during the last formal sitting, I asked if the use of the camera could not be made easier by leaving one seat empty.
Today that was once again not the case.
The camera was not on me, but on General Morillon and then on Mr Grosch.
Perhaps it would be possible to ensure that both the cameraman's job and our job are made easier.
