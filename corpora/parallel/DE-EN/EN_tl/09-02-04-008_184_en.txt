in writing. - I am voting in favour of Claudio Fava's report on sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-party nationals.
We must put a stop to the employment of illegal immigrants, both in order to protect them from exploitation and to prevent the economy of the country in question from being damaged.
The most important issue is not to punish the illegal workers from third-party states, but to penalise the employers, who are in a much stronger position.
