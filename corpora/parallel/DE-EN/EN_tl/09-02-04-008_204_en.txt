in writing. - I have voted in favour of the European Parliament's joint motion for a resolution on the return and resettlement of the Guantánamo detention facility inmates, because I welcome the acceptance of Guantánamo prisoners by the countries of the EU.
Many EU Member States are jointly culpable when it comes to Guantánamo because, for example, they granted overflying rights for the illegal transport of prisoners.
However, the report contains a few points which make it difficult to vote in its favour.
The torture practices in Guantánamo and, in particular, waterboarding are not explicitly referred to as torture, but instead as 'harsh interrogation techniques which amount to torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment'.
In addition, the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asking for all secret prison camps to be closed, the right of compensation for the victims and an investigation of violations of human rights in relation to Guantánamo were all rejected.
