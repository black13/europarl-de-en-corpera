in writing. - I have abstained from voting on the climate change report.
This does not mean that I believe the entire report to be bad.
However, it did combine correct scientific data and false polemics.
All the work done by the committee was one-sided and the wide range of scientific opinion was not reflected.
It is not possible to produce a balanced report on this basis.
Unfortunately this type of approach has become more common in the run-up to the European elections.
