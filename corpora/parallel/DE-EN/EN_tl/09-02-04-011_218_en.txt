Madam President, we are discussing Kosovo today against the background of a very detailed report by Mr Lagendijk, the rapporteur, which is, of course, linked to statements from the Commission and the Council.
In this case the rapporteur has no official speaking time, which I believe is an appalling situation.
If the rapporteur were only to present the initiative report on Monday evening, he would have four minutes.
I think that this is unfair.
I would therefore ask the Bureau to consider whether someone who has worked for months as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs should not also be given official speaking time.
Now Mrs Kallenbach has given him her minute of time out of a sense of solidarity with a colleague from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Perhaps it would be possible, Madam President, if this is within your power, to give Mrs Kallenbach one minute under the 'catch-the-eye''procedure.
However, I would like to ask you to think about this carefully.
We need to find a different arrangement in this type of case.
