on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, rejects the resolution that has been tabled on Kosovo.
The majority of the Member States, but not all, have recognised Kosovo in contravention of international law.
My group insists that all the regulations concerning Kosovo must be in line with international law and must be agreed with all the parties involved, including Serbia.
The recognition of Kosovo has created a disastrous precedent, which is now being followed by other regions, such as South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The EU has launched the EULEX mission in Kosovo.
The GUE/NGL Group rejects this mission as it is based on the recognition of Kosovo in contravention of international law and therefore creates something similar to an EU protectorate.
EULEX has, and I quote, 'certain executive responsibilities'.
This means that EULEX officials can annul simple resolutions made by the Kosovan authorities.
The EULEX mission also includes 500 policemen to combat insurrection.
On 26 January EULEX and KFOR held a joint exercise on combating insurrection.
This unfortunately indicates the close cooperation that exists between the EU and NATO in Kosovo.
At the same time, the EU and other organisations are promoting neo-liberal economic reconstruction in Kosovo, but this is not what the local people want.
For this reason, we are calling for solutions which are in line with international law and a clear vote against the EU EULEX mission.
If we really want to support the local people, the EULEX mission will not allow us to do so.
