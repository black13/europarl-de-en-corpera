Madam President, my fellow member Joost Lagendijk is in the same situation as Kosovo.
He exists, but he is not recognised by everyone as a rapporteur, although, in fact, he is one.
In this context I would like to thank him very much, together with Mr Tabajdi, for his report.
Of course, we have not made as much progress with the recognition of Kosovo as many people, including those in Kosovo, would have liked.
We must acknowledge that this has been a painful situation for Serbia.
We should not add fuel to the fire.
Instead we should make every effort to ensure that the process is a peaceful one.
I am very pleased that the leaders of Serbia, despite their many harsh words at the beginning, have attempted to legalise and neutralise the situation in order to give the EULEX mission a chance.
I would ask everyone who is opposed to the EULEX mission what situation the Serbian and other minorities in the country would be in if the EULEX mission did not exist?
It is nonsensical from the standpoint of the Serbian minority or of Serbia to condemn the EULEX mission.
I believe that the fact that someone here in Parliament who supports Serbia has condemned the EULEX mission is simply grotesque.
However, it is true that there are some questions which remain unanswered.
The political leaders in Kosovo must make an effort to get things done.
One of our main tasks and demands is to implement all the aspects of the Ahtisaari plan, which we will vote on tomorrow as part of this resolution.
Finally, we should promote the integration of the entire region.
Of course, all the countries will have to do their homework.
However, the more progress which Serbia and Macedonia make in the integration process, the sooner we will be able to resolve the Kosovo question and the other related open questions.
Only the integration of all the countries in the region will create the conditions needed by Kosovo for peaceful development.
