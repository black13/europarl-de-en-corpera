- Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk, as well as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for having ensured, through this resolution and this debate, that the subject of Kosovo remains on our agenda.
It is my opinion that the people of Kosovo have certainly earned this, after the European Union's failure there in the 1990s.
We have a debt to pay there, namely that we owe it to the people of Kosovo and of the entire region to provide them with quite intensive help them along their route into the EU.
In this respect, the absolute number one priority is the preconditions for improved economic development, as without these, social unrest cannot be ruled out.
I would like to ask the Commission to bring its influence to bear to ensure that the CEFTA agreement is actually implemented by all the signatory States.
I would also ask the Council to please ensure that the Member States handle the matter of the forced repatriation of asylum seekers in a sensitive manner.
