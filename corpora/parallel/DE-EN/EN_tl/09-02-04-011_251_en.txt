Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgetary Control is allowing itself to say a few words on high-level foreign policy.
We have established that in Kosovo - the third state that receives the most aid from the European Union - there are extremely worrying cases of corruption with grave consequences for the certainty of our budget and the financial interests of the Community.
There is a final report from a United Nations task force, the Commission's anti-fraud office and the Guarda di Finanza.
This final report has not yet been implemented.
It dates from the end of June 2008 and exposes serious cases of corruption involving EU funds.
We await an explanation.
This final report really is a final report.
There is no follow-up organisation.
There is currently no one representing our interests on this matter.
In this respect, too, I would call on the Commission to finally appoint someone.
EULEX itself cannot do this job.
I am also opposed to us continuing to make excuses for the uncertain status of this State.
