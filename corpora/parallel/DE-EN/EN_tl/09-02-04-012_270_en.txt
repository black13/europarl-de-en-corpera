Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will only succeed in fighting climate change and restructuring the world economy if we tackle the two together.
What we need is a green New Deal.
The crisis in the car industry is not a purely economic crisis.
The carmakers' slump is also the result of their bigger-faster-heavier philosophy over recent years.
Until just a few months ago, General Motors, Daimler and co were focussing on gas-guzzlers, whilst their marketing made out that SUVs were the new city cars.
They were quite simply ignoring climate change.
That is coming back to haunt them now.
If we are now to make billions of taxpayers' money available, the terms must be clear.
The car companies must use the money to switch to a smaller, more efficient range of products, to alternative propulsion systems - not only for the environment, nor merely for the climate, but also for the long-term security of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
I will give you an example from Germany, my home country, of how not to do it.
In Germany, if the CEO of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, decides to scrap his nine year-old third, fourth or fifth car and buy a new Porsche Cayenne, he will receive EUR 4 000.
This is neither socially nor environmentally-minded.
In fact it is simply crazy.
We must not go along with this.
