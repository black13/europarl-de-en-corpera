Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen has just set out for us how dramatic the figures are and what the current situation is in the automotive market.
Dramatic events, then, require harmonised action.
In 2006, we, in the European Parliament, launched an own-initiative report on the harmonisation of vehicle tax, which we hoped would be based on CO2 and consumption.
I believe that this would represent an economic programme through which the Council could show, as one - as this would have to be decided unanimously - how consumption-based vehicle taxes could be brought on-line.
With regard to what my colleague, Mrs De Vits, was talking about, which is to say General Motors, I would like to ask the Commission whether it is taking precautions for the eventuality of the collapse of the parent company.
In such an event, would the Commission act harmoniously to find a European solution for General Motors' subsidiaries?
