Mr President, you have just made a statement about the Bureau's decision, explaining why the 'catch-the-eye' debate system has been changed.
In this regard, I would like to make a formal protest against this change.
This procedure was introduced in order to invigorate our debates, to generate dialogue with the Commission and to strengthen the debating culture.
What the Bureau has now decided is completely counter-productive and I would like to ask you, please, to bring this matter up at the Conference of Presidents and to answer this protest.
