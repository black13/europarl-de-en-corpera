on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, at least this was discovered, in the Irish case, by means of inspections.
Ten years ago in Belgium, the cases came thick and fast.
In both cases, we hear talk of accidents that took place, but these accidents have never been proven.
After 10 years, the case is now closed in Belgium.
One person got a suspended sentence of one and a half years.
However, how the substance got into the products is not clear.
We must therefore continue to assume that toxic substances were deliberately mixed in, that feedstuffs were used to save on disposal costs.
Thus, the oil is diluted and added to the feedstuffs.
In both cases, the oil in question is transformer oil.
As long as these accidents have not been reconstructed and it remains unproven that it really was the result of burning, it must be assumed, in Ireland, too, that a criminal act took place whereby these toxic substances, this PCB, were admixed.
This means that we must increase the frequency of inspections so that criminal efforts are not focused on such feedstuffs with the impression that this is an easy way to cut costs.
For that reason, the open declaration that we will be adopting here tomorrow represents a further opportunity not to increase the focus against criminal efforts but to increase the frequency of inspections.
Risks, furthermore, must not be determined merely in terms of which plants are involved but also in relation to who on earth is running these plants and from what murky sources this oil is obtained.
We do know the sort of people we are dealing with here and the institutions thus need to be aware, in relation to inspections, that they represent a higher risk and must therefore be subject to stricter inspections.
