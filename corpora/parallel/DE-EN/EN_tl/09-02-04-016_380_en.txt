Madam President, Commissioner, we are, tonight, discussing the use of PCB waste oils in an Irish food recycling plant.
Tomorrow, we will be debating the placing on the market and use of feed for animals.
Tomorrow, we will observe that we have, together, already achieved a series of important and expedient measures in this sector.
Yet there are still problems in this area.
That is why the five questions posed by Mrs McGuinness in her oral question must be taken seriously and must be given a serious answer.
Commissioner, you, yourself, talked of gaps that are still to be closed in the implementation of our legislation in a number of Member States.
It is true that the feed sector overall has thoroughly proven its reliability in recent years, but certain businesses are either unaware of the risks or do not wish to see them.
It would seem, furthermore, that there is still much room for improvement in many Member States in terms of inspection on the appropriate risk basis.
All of us - Parliament, the decreasing number of farmers and also consumers - expect the proper application of EU legislation with inspections to that effect.
For that reason, I believe that general food law, food and feed hygiene and the licensing conditions for food recycling plants needs to be looked into.
Yes, we do want to make use of surplus foodstuffs.
I, personally, at least, would like this to happen and for the surplus foodstuffs in question not to be destroyed.
Traceability, however, must be ensured.
Unwanted substances and products must be excluded in a secure and controlled manner.
When feed companies are licensed, the professional competence of their staff in the area of food and feed safety must be ensured.
Feedingstuffs are the basis of food safety and there must be certainty on the part of farmers so that consumers can be ensured of safe and sound food.
