Madam President, Commissioner, has the Commission investigated or reconstructed the course of events leading to the accident?
I find the idea that the burning of waste oil and the smoke that then seeps through a few breadcrumbs could cause dioxin contamination on this scale, where a 200-fold increase in dioxin levels occurred in the pigmeat - not in the feed, but in the pigmeat itself - quite laughable.
I shall continue to assume, until or unless it is proved to the contrary, that this was a case of a deliberate admixing.
Every road accident is reconstructed and it is investigated how such an accident could have occurred.
This accident - if that is what it was - too, must be reconstructed and it must be investigated whether this type of combustion and the smoke which it passes through the meat really can cause so much dioxin to end up in the meat.
As a practician, I would say that everything that is being said in this regard is nonsense.
What we are talking about here was a deliberate admixing and we are being made into repositories for this poison, one which does not break down by itself and which therefore continues through generations of people.
