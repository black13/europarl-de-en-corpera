on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and myself, I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
I believe that the approach taken to this report is a model for the parliamentary work in this House.
Today's vote does not involve any amendments, as the work on this was technically very sound and encompassed the entire political spectrum.
I believe that this result is one to be proud of.
It is a balanced result that safeguards the interests of farmers as users of feed, feed manufacturers, and all other links in the food chain.
It improves transparency, and my group, in particular, sets great store by the setting up of a register in which the raw materials mixed into feed must be entered.
Food scandals occur time and again and not even the new legislation will prevent this, as no European rules are designed to prevent criminal activity; but these rules will help ensure that, when these scandals do occur, it will be easier to detect what substances have been mixed in.
I also think it a good thing that manufacturers of feed may provide further information on a voluntary basis, and I consider it an excellent proposal that, if they provide such information, this must be scientifically proven.
I am of the opinion that this new feed law significantly improves protection and that the decreasing order enables farmers to see the proportions of each feed component and what is the best feed for their animals, and to choose accordingly.
I reiterate my thanks to all those who contributed to making this such a good report.
