Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as he has succeeded in producing a genuinely workable compromise at first reading.
It has also proved possible to reconcile consumer protection and food safety with the necessary protection of intellectual property.
Farmers must be able to trust that the feed they are using contains what is stated on the label.
Black sheep in the feed industry have caused great economic losses in agriculture and far beyond.
Thank you once again, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
