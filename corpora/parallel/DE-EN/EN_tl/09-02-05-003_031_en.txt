Mr President, Commissioners, I do not have anything to add about the content, as enough has been said in this regard.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, who showed good staying power in the trialogue.
This report has been a long haul.
As we know, the European Court of Justice issued a judgment, which was followed by clean, fair discussion.
We had opportunity to discuss this at length and, as rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has shown that a satisfactory solution can be achieved in a short space of time even as part of a first reading agreement.
I have crossed swords with him a fair few times since 1994, but our teamwork has always been fair, and I should like to thank him once again for his work.
