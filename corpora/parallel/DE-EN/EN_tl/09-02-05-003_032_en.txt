Mr President, I had run out of speaking time, so I do have some new things to say.
If we now adopt new European feed legislation here in Parliament, by what will probably be a large majority, and the Council accepts this legislation, we shall have achieved a new, high quality standard in Europe.
I should like to ask the two Commissioners present to insist on these European standards in the case of imports of feed and food as well in future.
Europe can face up to global competition only if the same standards are applied to imports.
Therefore, the Commission must also press for our European standards to form part of the WTO negotiations and to become a global standard - then we need not fear this global competition.
