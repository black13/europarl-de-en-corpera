Many thanks, Mrs Roure.
I can see that even the top jurists here in plenary, or those who see themselves as such, are unaware that the rapporteur is entitled to make a two-minute statement when a report has not been discussed in plenary.
Therefore, Mrs Roure has this right, which she has exercised, and everyone should accept this as it is laid down in our Rules of Procedure.
(Applause)
