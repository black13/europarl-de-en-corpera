Madam President, a humanitarian disaster is currently taking place in the north of Sri Lanka that is receiving relatively little attention.
The Sri Lankan army is carrying out attacks on the civilian population that could even be described as massacres.
A hospital has even come under fire and, according to humanitarian organisations, the overall situation is disastrous.
The Red Cross has raised the alarm.
The situation in Sri Lanka has escalated, and the European Union is not blameless in this, having torpedoed the negotiations that were held under the leadership of Norway by placing the LTTE on the EU list of terrorist organisations.
This meant that negotiations within the European Union were no longer possible.
In Sri Lanka itself, freedom of the press no longer exists.
Recently, a journalist was killed.
The German ambassador, who spoke at his funeral, was described by the President as someone who should leave the country.
All he had done was to describe the situation accurately.
There is talk of thousands of refugees in the north, and I must make it quite clear that the whole situation there is one on which we should be focusing much more attention.
The European Union should be coming out very much more clearly against what the Sri Lankan Government is currently doing.
The attacks by both the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE are wrong; it is clear that it is mainly civilians who are being hit.
We need to help the people trapped in the north and to achieve an immediate cease-fire, as it is quite clear that very large numbers of civilians are being killed there.
This is unacceptable, and the European Union shares the blame for this if it fails to state much more clearly that the support for the Sri Lankan Government must end.
