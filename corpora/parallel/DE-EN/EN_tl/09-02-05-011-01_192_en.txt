Madam President, the dramatic images from Sri Lanka reveal that a brutal civil war that has spanned decades is coming to a head.
As we all know, whilst it may be possible to end a war by means of weapons, it is not possible to establish lasting peace this way.
In addition, there can be no effective, lasting fight against terrorism, in particular, by means of weapons, as terrorism always finds a way.
Therefore, it is important to get to grips with the causes.
The next step must be to reach a peace settlement based on the following fundamental elements.
Firstly, a clear monopoly of power on the part of the unitary State.
No State can allow ethnic groups or sections of the population to arm and engage in armed conflict.
This requires, however, that this State comply with democratic rules and the rule of law and actively seek a political solution along the lines of autonomy, one that finally resolves Sri Lanka's nationality problems, which are an old historical legacy and also a legacy of colonial times, and which need to be tackled urgently.
Therefore, I wish to appeal quite clearly to the European Union and all the countries of this earth to help with the development of democracy and the rule of law, with the strengthening of autonomy and of minority rights, and of course also with the economic development of a country that has been bled dry so appallingly by the terror of this civil war.
Therefore, if the guns were to fall silent at long last - unfortunately we are not at that stage yet - this would not mean the end of developments, but only the beginning of movement towards a peace based on the rule of law, freedom, human rights, minority rights and national autonomy.
