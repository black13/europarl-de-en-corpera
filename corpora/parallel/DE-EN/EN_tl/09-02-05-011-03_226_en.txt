Madam President, I asked to speak because I was Chairman of the German-Brazilian Parliamentarian Group in the lower house of the German Parliament for 10 years and I know Brazil very well.
I am indeed surprised at the refusal of the Lula administration to extradite this convicted murderer to a European Member State.
I hope that the proceedings in Brazil will be concluded very quickly.
The Lula administration has made a particular commitment to human rights.
One aspect of human rights is that convicted murderers be brought to justice, and so I hope that this motion for a resolution receives strong support.
I personally shall make use of my contacts with Brazilian parliamentarians to see to it that pressure is put on the government at domestic level, too, to grant this extradition request.
