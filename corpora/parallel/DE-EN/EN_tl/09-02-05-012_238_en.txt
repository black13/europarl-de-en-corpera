Madam President, I just want to say that it is on Thursday afternoons that the most important issues are discussed and that, therefore, on account of their urgency, these important issues must indeed be dealt with on Thursday afternoons.
The only ones to blame are those who are absent on Thursdays.
They are shirkers, and should give some thought to whether they wish to run for the European Parliament once again.
