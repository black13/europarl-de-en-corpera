Mr President, we have tabled two motions, neither of which, most probably, will achieve a broad majority in this House.
I therefore wish to endorse this motion.
Mr President, with your permission, we will also move to defer Mr Berman's report.
If this motion is not accepted due to the lateness of its timing, I would like to say, now, that we will move tomorrow to postpone the vote on the report.
Thank you.
