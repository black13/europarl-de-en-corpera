Mr President, my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has tabled a resolution which has the support of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and large parts of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
I therefore think that Mr Reul is calling for a deferral out of fear that his position is a minority one.
I find it a little strange that we should have such a long and hard debate and then hear calls for another delay.
We are thus against deferral.
