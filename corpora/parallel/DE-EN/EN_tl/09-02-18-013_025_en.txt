Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the political contexts.
You have also heard what Mr Swoboda had to say.
The decision will be taken tomorrow.
(Parliament adopts the motion from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats).
We will vote on Mr Swoboda's motion tomorrow.
I would ask you all to remember that in today's vote.
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
