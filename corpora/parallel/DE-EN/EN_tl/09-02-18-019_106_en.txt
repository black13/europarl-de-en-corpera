Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, as we all know, risk scenarios are constantly changing.
The Treaty is also changing, and with it the opportunities for the European Security and Defence Policy.
What will always be the same, however, is people's desire for security and stability, for a strong Union and for disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament.
With the three reports under discussion today, the European Parliament is giving a very strong indication of how it means to achieve these objectives and guarantee security.
Firstly, there is the report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which focuses on security in the Balkans, stability in Africa and peace in the Palestinian territories.
Secondly, there is the report on cooperation with NATO, with its clear emphasis on closer cooperation between the EU and NATO and on better coordination.
At the heart of the third report is the further development of the European Security and Defence Policy, with the aim of achieving greater efficiency and better coordination in connection with defence expenditure, and of achieving strategic autonomy for the whole Union and thus, also easing the burden on our Member States.
If we have all these objectives in mind, we must support the calls of these reports: for shared research and development, for the development of common standards and for common procurement systems, for example - all with the objective of interoperability.
This will also mean optimum cooperation between the military in the Member States, cooperation between the police and the military, and also the creation of permanent military structures and the establishment of an Operational Headquarters and/or a Council of Ministers for Defence.
I am convinced that this gives us a crucial opportunity to make our Union into a political union and to develop a security union that gives the public what it expects of the Union: lasting security, stability and peace.
