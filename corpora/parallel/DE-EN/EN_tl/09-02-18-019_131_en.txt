Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment on a few points.
Firstly, I wish to explain why I did not include the principles of 'human security' and 'responsibility to protect' in my report.
This has been very controversial.
In my personal opinion, these concepts that we have developed, whilst very important, are not suitable for a security policy, as they can be misused to justify military intervention all around the world.
This is a very real risk I can envisage.
Therefore, I do support these two concepts, but not for the security policy.
It has also been said that I am in the process of creating a European army and am calling for this in my report.
I would ask you to read the whole report through once again - you will most certainly not find the words 'European army' in it.
What the report says is that taxpayers' money should be spent better in this field than has been the case up to now.
Then there is the European Security Strategy, which now has everyone's support.
The work that needed to be done on this took several years and was very successful.
In my opinion, the next step must be to produce a work on the implementation of the security policy, a white paper on the security policy.
This is a job for the next parliamentary term.
Last but not least, I believe that the next talks we hold on this subject must deal with the issue of EUBAM Rafah: how to revive this mission and how it can possibly be extended.
