Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to discuss not the legal basis but the basis for survival.
Small and medium-sized enterprises have a very special role to play in this.
Creditworthiness is particularly important during financial crises, so that these enterprises can still obtain microcredit.
I wish to point out in particular that the instrument of microcredit has actually very much proved its worth worldwide and that, particularly within the framework of the WTO round, which is hopefully approaching the final stages, we should consider how to bring about the relevant trade facilitation for the affected families in these areas.
After all, prosperity is created where something is produced, where people can live off the proceeds themselves and feed their families.
If, in addition, they manage to sell something, prosperity is assured.
It is with this in mind that I hope development policy takes the right course.
