The review of the new foreign policy financing instruments has revealed defects in cooperation with third countries, and so we propose reforming the industrial instrument.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs does not consider it desirable to limit the new legal basis for the instrument to a few areas of cooperation.
In addition, the policy fields currently envisaged (culture, youth, research) are borrowed from European domestic policy and have not, up to now, been intended to define cooperation with third countries.
This is just one of the uncertainties that worries the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
What happens, for example, if, in the near future, it becomes desirable to cooperate with other countries in matters of climate policy?
Do we have to create a new legal basis for the instrument each time?
Do we mean to do that every time there is a change in the area of cooperation?
The reform of the foreign policy instruments is very important to us all, and so it should be made clear that we are not fighting against one another.
This is the only reason why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, together with the second rapporteur from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, withdrew the amendment on Monday.
In terms of content, we believe our proposal is more far-sighted and that it is the one that enables a coherent foreign policy.
However, this report is just a recommendation to the Commission.
We shall see what it does with it.
