When we talk about health, we are usually referring to physical wellbeing.
Yet mental illness can be as much of a handicap to the daily lives of sufferers, and has extensive adverse social effects.
Parliament's initiative to improve information on mental health is a very positive step, therefore.
There should be more public discussion of approaches to mental disorders and, in addition, methods for preventing mental illness should be made accessible to the general public.
The workplace setting should be particularly emphasised in this connection.
Since working people spend a very great deal of time at their workplace and are exposed to stress in connection with their work, it is necessary to promote mental health in that particular setting.
Only motivated, balanced workers are in a position to meet the demands made of them.
Awareness of this issue should therefore be raised among businesses and public bodies.
On the whole, by recognising mental disorders, Parliament is indicating a modern understanding of health and offering many sufferers a positive perspective in the long term.
