Madam President, there are indeed differences of interpretation.
The legal interpretation by the Committee on Development is opposed to the interpretation by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and it is opposed to the legal interpretation by the legal services of our Parliament, to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to the view of the Council and the Commission, and therefore we, in the majority, insist on using the legal base as set out in this amendment.
I ask therefore for the application for referral back to committee to be withdrawn.
As regards the substance of the report there are no differences of opinion.
We agree on the substance, it is only with regard to the legal interpretation that there are differences and a referral back to committee will not change those differences.
