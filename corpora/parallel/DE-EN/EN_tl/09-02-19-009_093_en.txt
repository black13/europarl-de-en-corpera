Madam President, thank you very much.
I suggest that you all listen to what I have to say before you start your shouting.
A fellow Member, who often recalls things differently, has just spoken.
I would like to remind you of the following: when Prime Minister SÃ³crates wanted to speak here in connection with the signing of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, he was unable to do so by virtue of being shouted down.
President Klaus was able to speak here unhindered.
That is the difference between us and them.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
