in writing. - The prospect of finding work in Europe is attractive for third-country nationals for very understandable reasons.
In times of crisis, however, we need to pay particular attention to who gets the ever scarcer jobs in order to prevent social discrepancies from arising as well.
In my opinion, therefore, it is important to impose sanctions on employers who do not follow the rules.
In these unsettled times, illegal labour cannot be tolerated, and we must start with those that are within reach locally and where sanctions will also have an effect.
This report is thus an attempt to tackle this problem more forcefully, because the in-flow of migrant workers is not going to decrease, particularly during the crisis.
