in writing. - The projects proposed by the newly-formed Union for the Mediterranean all sound well and good: the Solar Plan, collaboration in civil protection, joint initiatives for the depollution of the Mediterranean and new port and motorway projects.
However, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper.
Whether anything will actually be done is doubtful.
After all, the organisation's predecessor, Euromed, did not actually achieve anything.
Moreover, as long as the participating states do not see any actual possibility of these projects coming to fruition, they will surely not sacrifice existing good bilateral relations for the sake of a vague project.
As I do not believe that the new Union for the Mediterranean will be any more successful than its predecessor organisation, I have voted against this report.
