in writing. - Even after all the years since its formation, the EU is still not actually close to its citizens.
It simply assumes that all citizens use the Internet and can find their way around the EU website without difficulty.
However, this is not the case, as the web pages are often only understandable to insiders and are also not always intelligible in all languages.
Many states also have a strong tradition of printed media, which are an important means of providing non-partisan information to citizens.
The EU is always emphasising the importance of information policy, but in this regard is allowing an information gap to develop.
Firstly, the broadsheets will suffer huge losses if the Official Journal entries that are required to be published are dropped and, secondly, all those who are not familiar with modern technology will be at a disadvantage.
For this reason, I have voted against the Dahl report.
