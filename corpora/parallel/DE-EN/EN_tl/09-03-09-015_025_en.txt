The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 5 February pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
Monday:
Firstly, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the vote on the report by Mrs Kósáné Kovács on the social situation of the Roma be held tomorrow instead of on Thursday as scheduled.
Secondly, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has also requested that the vote on Mr Reul's report on possible solutions to the challenges in relation to oil supply be held tomorrow.
In both cases, the deadline for alternative joint motions for resolutions is this evening, which means that it is technically impossible to vote on these texts tomorrow.
However, the votes could be held on Wednesday instead of tomorrow.
Are there any objections to this?
