This political will has been noted.
I have been told that, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, it is only possible to vote on Wednesday.
However, we can let the representatives of the Roma know that this is the case, so as to express our political will.
Then we would be able to vote on both requests on Wednesday.
(Parliament approved the request)
Tuesday:
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that a Commission statement on MON810 genetically modified maize be included on the agenda and that the debate be wound up with the tabling of a motion for a resolution.
Who wishes to justify this request?
Mr Cohn-Bendit?
