on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, there was a clear qualified majority against the Commission's request at the last Environment Council meeting.
The Commission made such requests back in 2006 and 2007, and each time the Council opposed them.
Now, this request will probably be repeated at the next Environment Council meeting, this time directed against France and Greece.
Parliament should simply take a clear position, to put an end to this debate once and for all.
It is not the Commission's job to constantly attempt to buy countries because of an initiative that has been rejected by various political camps.
That is why we want to see, at long last, a debate with the Council and Commission and a motion for a resolution, so as to put an end to the matter once and for all - and this before the elections so that voters know who stands for what.
Is that not right, Mr Ferber?
