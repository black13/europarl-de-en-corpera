on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, as Mr Swoboda has just pointed out, I support one part of Mr Cohn-Bendit's request and oppose the other.
I think he is right; the Commission's behaviour is certainly remarkable, to put it politely.
Secondly, it is true that the situation in the Council is confusing: some Member States share the Commission's opinion and others do not.
We have a similar situation in this House.
It is true that we need a discussion with the Commission - even though it has already pressed ahead with this many times before against the recommendations of Parliament and even of some members of the Council - and we support the call for a Commission statement to this end.
The second part is the resolution.
I have read the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance very carefully, and Mr Cohn-Bendit's justification related more to the election campaign than to GM maize, which was very interesting.
The Verts/ALE Group also requests a procedure to vote out the Commission - a vote of no confidence in the Commission.
Yet so far-reaching is this step that we believe the matter must first be carefully examined, which is why we support the debate - indeed!
In addition, there is a specialist committee that should be dealing with the resolution; it should present us with a motion for a resolution at one of the coming plenary sittings that is properly prepared rather than cobbled together quickly this week.
