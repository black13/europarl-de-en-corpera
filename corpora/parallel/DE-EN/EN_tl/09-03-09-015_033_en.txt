On the one hand, a request has been made to place the topic of a resolution on the agenda; on the other, Mr Fjellner says that neither a statement nor a resolution should be placed on the agenda.
I would suggest first voting on the procedure, and then we can discuss whether we have just the statement.
In addition, I have received a request for a roll call vote.
This roll call vote is to determine who supports the request by Mr Cohn-Bendit and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
The vote is opened.
