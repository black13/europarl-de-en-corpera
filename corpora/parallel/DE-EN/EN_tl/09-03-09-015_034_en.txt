Mr President, this should not be made any more complicated.
I am sure you are right on a formal level; you are a president with such a firm grasp of things that I do not doubt it.
Yet I got the impression that Mrs Frassoni agrees with our proposal.
We are holding a discussion with the Commission this week, and I would also request that this be placed on the agenda.
At the same time, I request that we ask the specialist committee responsible to prepare a resolution.
I believe that would be a further-reaching request on which you could hold an initial vote.
