We could spend another half hour discussing this.
The correct procedure is that we vote on whether or not to meet the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
I have tried to help out with my proposal that we hold another discussion afterwards as to whether we want a Commission statement, but things cannot be done in any other order.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Wednesday:
I wish to inform you that 113 amendments have been tabled to the report by Mrs Elisa Ferreira on a European Economic Recovery Plan.
This exceeds the threshold of 50 amendments laid down in Rule 156, and so I have referred these texts for consideration by the committee responsible.
The committee meets this evening, and the debate on the report remains on the agenda for Wednesday.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that the oral questions to the Council and the Commission on SIS II be dealt with at 3 p.m., as the first item of the afternoon sitting.
Since all the political groups have given their agreement, the agenda will be amended accordingly.
I have just been informed that I have overlooked something relating to Tuesday: the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the afternoon debates be extended by half an hour and consequently Question Time with the Commission be held from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Is that all right?
(Parliament approved the request)
Thursday:
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have requested that the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising be wound up with the tabling of a motion for a resolution.
