Mr President, I wish to draw attention to something that particularly besmirches this House: the pension fund.
According to recent reports in the magazine Stern, at least 76 German MEPs were members of this fund.
This relates only to the association's list, however, not to the fund.
I hereby call on you, Mr PÃ¶ttering, as President of Parliament, to send the complete list of fund members to the administration of the lower house of the German Parliament as, under the relevant regulations in your home country, the suspicion of serious fraud would automatically arise if it were to turn out that duplicate payments had been made.
This must then be followed by the relevant investigations, and the German authorities have a right to learn of this from you.
In the same way, we all have a right to know this fund's deficit.
Something is being kept quiet here, and there is the risk of speculators being bailed out once again to the tune of many millions at taxpayers' expense at the end of the parliamentary term.
That cannot be allowed to happen!
