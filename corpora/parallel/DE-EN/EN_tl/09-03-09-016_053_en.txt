Madam President, we are going to be dealing with - though unfortunately not debating - the report by Mrs Kósáné Kovács concerning the Roma issue.
I should like to take this opportunity to highlight the issue given the very difficult situation at present.
There have been a number of incidents in Hungary, but the problem is not limited to that country, where the economic crisis and the social problems perhaps explain the renewed increase in attacks on Roma.
This is something that is particularly reprehensible.
Several Roma - including Austrian Roma - have approached me and asked me to bring this up, as fear has gripped the Roma community in Europe once again.
I should like to urge the Commission, too, to monitor the situation very closely and to do all it can to ensure that the Roma - and other minorities too, but here we are particularly talking about the Roma - do not need to live in fear again in Europe: they should not have to do so in this day and age.
