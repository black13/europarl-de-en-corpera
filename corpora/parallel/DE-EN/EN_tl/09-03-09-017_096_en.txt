Madam President, we are right to talk about the financial crisis, but we are not right to say that the European Union does not have any money in its budget to fund the relevant measures to combat it.
We have EUR 144 billion in our annual budget, from which EUR 5 billion has somehow been extracted.
My specific proposal is as follows: let us turn this EUR 5 billion into EUR 50 billion without increasing the budget.
How is that possible?
Taking the administrative part, if we include all the EU administrative expenditure hidden in the operational programmes, that gives us EUR 15 billion.
I say we could manage on EUR 5 billion, which leaves EUR 10 billion for combating the financial crisis.
Then we do what we are always demanding of everyone else, namely submit our programmes and activities to independent examination.
I am convinced that, if the specific policies of the European Union of today were to be examined at long last, we could easily achieve a further EUR 30 billion in potential savings per year, without losing sight of our objectives.
There are also some small matters in this House.
We have a budget of EUR 1.5 billion.
Starting sittings on time would introduce efficiency into our work - which would be worth EUR 700 million - and the remaining 300 could be obtained from the Council, which works at least as wastefully as this Parliament.
