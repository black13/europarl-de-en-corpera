draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Many thanks, Mr President.
Currently, the transfer of a company's seat involves administrative obstacles, costs and social consequences and fails to offer the necessary legal certainty to shareholders, creditors or workers.
A public consultation back in 2004 made it clear how important it was to adopt a 14th Directive.
For this reason, I would call on the Commission to present a legislative proposal on this - as soon as possible - with the dual purpose of simplifying the mobility of companies and ensuring that the matter of participation in relation to the transfer of a company's seat is not left up to the European Court of Justice.
A future 14th Directive must not provide an escape route from strong participation systems.
On no account must existing rights be curtailed.
In order to guarantee the coherence and substantive nature of employee participation procedures, reference should be made to the European Directive on works councils, the 10th Directive and the Directive on worker consultation and information.
It is absolutely vital that information be provided in good time and that a transfer plan be issued prior to any transfer of a company's seat.
