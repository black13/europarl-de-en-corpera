draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, the proposal presented by the Commission for the European private company within the framework of the Small Business Act had serious weaknesses.
It paid scant regard to the interests of creditors, employees, consumers and small suppliers.
To mention a few of its provisions, it envisaged minimum capital of EUR 1 and, in addition, inadequate registration procedures, no requirement for cross-border activity, and the separation of the articles of association, the seat and the actual place of business.
The latter would have led to the circumvention of employee participation.
Every new European company law directive should help achieve the aim of harmonising employees' rights and the idea of the European standard of participation, based on the new EU Reform Treaty, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Employees' rights are core rights for a social Europe.
