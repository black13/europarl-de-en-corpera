draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, we all know that our capacity to build on the growth and innovation potential of small and medium-sized enterprises is decisive for the prosperity of the European Union.
SMEs also play a crucial role in overcoming the crisis.
We must therefore relieve the burden on them and support them, based on the idea that fewer rules have the potential to mean much more to SMEs.
As Chairman of the SME intergroup I would make it quite clear, however, that the Small Business Act is just a declaration of intent by the Heads of State or Government.
Declarations of intent alone are of no use to SMEs, and that is why we make a crystal clear call for national and European legislation to be led by the 'Think Small First' principle, and we have made four demands.
The first is that Member States must announce how and in what timeframe they will incorporate the core elements of the 'Think Small First' principle into national legislation.
Secondly, Member States should, on a compulsory basis, present the progress made on the implementation of the 'Think Small First' principle in the annual reports on the Lisbon process national reform programmes.
Thirdly, we need standard criteria for the measurement of progress in the implementation of the 'Think Small First' principle.
Then, fourthly, we must establish the 'Think Small First' principle as an obligatory component of future legislation at European level, too.
In addition, in response to current events, I would say that all existing regulations should be examined in terms of their pro-cyclical impact on SMEs.
We need to act quickly on this.
