Madam President, Commissioner, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Schwab on the compromise that he has produced in collaboration with the Council.
Not every issue was covered, but that is the way with compromises.
The introduction of mandatory safety systems for vehicles is something I particularly welcome.
The mandatory introduction of new safety technology such as ESP will mean that, in future, it will not only be those who buy premium cars who will benefit from a higher standard of safety on the road, but also the drivers of goods vehicles.
In doing this, we are making a crucial contribution to the safety of Europe.
This must also unconditionally apply to tyre safety.
It is right to clearly class the wet grip, and thus the safety, of tyres as more important than rolling resistance, which helps reduce CO2 emissions.
Tyres' rolling resistance, depending on the driving conditions and speed, accounts for 20 to 30% of fuel consumption.
It is therefore clear that, given the current environmental debate and in order to reduce petrol costs, a reduction must be achieved.
However, it is necessary to realise that, without rolling resistance, which occurs through the deformation of tyres and their elastic properties, safe and comfortable driving would be impossible.
We therefore have to see safety in another light here, too.
The new developments by the tyre manufacturers show that it is possible to have both safety and lower rolling resistance.
In this way, we will also enable the European motor industry to take, and retain, a world lead.
The compromise motions that we will be voting on tomorrow send a clear signal away from the CO2 hysteria and towards greater road safety.
