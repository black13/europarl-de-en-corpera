Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, and in particular Mr Titley and the Commission, for this sound proposal.
My thanks to the Czech Presidency, on the other hand, are somewhat more ambivalent.
I have to say that we were put under heavy pressure by the Council in this trialogue and that the Council showed little ambition.
Quite the opposite, in fact, in that the Council warned us in advance against setting our demands too high so as not to jeopardise the manufacturers in these times of economic crisis.
I see this completely differently, and I think that the majority in this Chamber does too - particularly in times of economic crisis, what we need is clear standards and for the European industry to be motivated and given incentives to set its standards high and develop models for the future, and not for the current situation.
Energy efficiency and CO2 emissions clearly play a very important role in this.
The issue of safety is clearly also important, while the issue of minimising noise, which was given short shrift in this debate, must also not be overlooked, as more and more people are falling ill as a result of noise, with the attendant high costs for society.
For that reason, it is also important that this regulation should be in line with relevant standards.
Overall, we have achieved a good compromise.
We did not sign the first reading agreement as we were critical of the procedure and also of the pressure from the Czech Presidency, but we can live with this compromise, and we, as a group, will be voting for it.
