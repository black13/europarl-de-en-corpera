Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point, I can but offer my sincere thanks for the broad support for this proposal from all sides of the House.
What we have, of course, is a compromise, and there is always scope to want a little bit more in such cases.
I can also say that I, personally, and the Commission would have been prepared to go a step further.
What we have now is what we were able to achieve, however, and it represents a major step forward.
In particular, I would like to emphasise once again what Mrs RÃ¼hle said.
Politically speaking, the crucial thing, especially in this situation, is to improve European vehicles in areas that will be crucial in future.
One thing is quite clear, and that is that the crisis in demand is not just the result of the general economic conditions and the economic uncertainty but also has something to do with the fact that the vehicles that European manufacturers are offering have perhaps failed to meet the requirements of the European market in recent years where fuel consumption, environmental friendliness and safety are concerned.
That is why it is so important that this is now quickly rectified.
Please allow me to say something about the issue that Mrs Doyle mentioned.
I am aware that there is an erroneous interpretation of the requirements pertaining to type-approval in a number of Member States - as you have just quite correctly pointed out - but it is an erroneous interpretation, one which is not in line with the legal framework that is in place.
The Commission will ensure that the necessary clarifications are issued and that the negative consequences that you have highlighted, Mrs Doyle, will not occur.
