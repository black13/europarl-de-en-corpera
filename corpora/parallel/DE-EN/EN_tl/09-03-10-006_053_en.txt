Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the directive on industrial emissions is long overdue.
A piece of legislation in which all the significant measures to reduce pollution depend on the best available technique should be adjusted at least every five years, rather than after 13.
After such a period, the techniques have moved on far ahead of us.
At the same time, we must note that, despite the march of technology, the targets associated with our directive from back in the day have by no means been met.
That is why I have such a high opinion of the compromise achieved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Its implementation will get us where we need to go.
I find the hysteria when we deal with soil protection or the wishes of the farmers' unions incomprehensible.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to achieve environmental targets without impeding economic activities.
Doing so is very much looking to the future and not looking backwards, as the proposals from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats do.
