Mr President, one reason why we fell into the trap of globalisation is specifically that we failed to avoid the Europe trap.
The Europe trap essentially lies in our failure, then as now, to act according to the tried and tested principles of transparency of the Scandinavian and other states.
I have now been a Member of this Chamber for 10 years and it was not by chance that, when I arrived here - not with this intention, but it came to me very quickly - I found myself saying, 'oh my word, transparency is the crucial issue', and for that reason, I set up the European Transparency Initiative back in 2000.
The initiative was adopted by the Commission word for word, it is just that there is still little by way of substance.
Commissioner, you can read up on what I said to your fellow Swede Anna Lindh - in a long speech at the Nice Summit - in this area.
You, as a Swede, understand what this is about.
You do know what should really be done.
In the European Union, however, the reality when it comes to transparency issues is that the task we face is like trying to clear an avalanche with a shovel.
We are not getting through, and new snow keeps on coming.
There is only one way to rescue this European Union, and that is to have real transparency on the Swedish model plus that of the US Freedom of Information Act right now, immediately.
Without it, you will experience yet more avalanches, and this time they will hit populated areas.
