Mr President, the problem of the estrangement of the public from politics in the EU is something that is well known, which is why we attempt to demonstrate our citizen-friendliness over and over again.
This includes regularly recurring initiatives to simplify access to the documents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Internet is, of course, a cheap and simple tool to achieve this.
The EU's homepage has been revised and has, at least, been made more logical and easier to navigate around than it was in the past.
In its Internet presence, the EU also highlights the importance of multilingualism as a significant factor in achieving greater transparency, legitimacy and efficiency within the Union.
Yet it does not, in reality, live up to what it asks of itself.
In practice, the consistent use of the three working languages German, English and French would, in fact, make it possible to reach the majority of the population.
Even the Internet presence of the current Presidency, which is in English, French and Czech, takes no account of the fact that German, with an 18% share of mother-tongue speakers in the EU, is the language with the most native speakers in the Union, while a further 14% of EU citizens speak it as a foreign language.
I believe it is time that more attention was finally paid to this state of affairs.
