Mr President, I am very pleased that the President has finally given the floor to the rapporteur.
I am also quite surprised!
At this time, we are still getting used to the recast rules.
I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that the application of these rules is no surprise, even just before a vote.
We have already applied these rules consistently in committee and it is only logical for them to be applied consistently in plenary.
If we were to vote now, there would not be a single amendment and not a single compromise up for voting that have not been discussed.
Everything is itemised on the voting list.
For the same reason as Mr Sacconi, but with a different conclusion, I see absolutely no reason to postpone.
We can vote now!
(Applause)
