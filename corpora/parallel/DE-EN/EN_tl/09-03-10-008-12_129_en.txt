Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can help you out here and even point out to the President what he himself decided.
We now have Amendments 106, 139, 88 and 89.
The President has ruled Amendment 88 admissible.
You all have a note to that effect in the voting list.
If not, you will have to speak to those responsible within your group.
I am sorry for that.
