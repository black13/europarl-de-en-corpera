Mr President, I congratulate the House on this new information system.
It would seem, though, that a couple of bits of information in the everyday routine do not work.
I am very pleased, meanwhile, that, on the 50th anniversary of China's occupation of Tibet, many of us have managed to display Tibetan flags.
It has come to my attention, however, that the Bureau had said in advance that certain flags may not be put up, meaning that MEPs are unable to display them on this important day.
Is there any up-to-date information on this issue?
