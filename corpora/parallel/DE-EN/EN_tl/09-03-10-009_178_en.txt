Mr President, I very much welcome the central element of the Krahmer report, the European safety network.
Maximum emissions limits are being laid down which the Member States must adhere to as an absolute top limit when granting permits to large industrial plants.
There is, then, a rough framework, so that everything moves flexibly and so that there is a level playing field.
This will put a stop to the inflationary use of derogations that has thus far taken place in certain Member States.
This means competition on an equal footing throughout Europe.
In that way, we can together establish a high standard at the European level.
I must make it clear, though, that I vehemently reject the regulations on soil protection.
I am of the opinion that more account should be taken of the subsidiarity principle.
Regulations on soil protection have no cross-border effect.
Soil protection is not a cross-border issue.
I therefore continue to believe that the Member States can regulate soil protection themselves.
There is an attempt here, however, to use the IPPC Directive as a back door through which to bring in parts of the soil protection directive, which we successfully fought off in the past.
I very much regret that my motions to delete the relevant parts were rejected by a very narrow majority, in one case by only six votes.
I have therefore decided to vote against this report as a whole, despite the fact that I very much welcome the European safety network.
