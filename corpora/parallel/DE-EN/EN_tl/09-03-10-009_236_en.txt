I welcome the fact that the Commission has proposed a regulation updating EU asylum law since, given current circumstances, this is urgently needed.
The number of refugees is constantly rising, and the current regulations and directives governing asylum are no longer coping with the situation.
I therefore believe it to be essential that the Commission's reforms are implemented as soon as possible, and I would categorise the following points in those reforms to be of particular importance.
There must be a common asylum system, and one that leads to 'uniform and reasonable time limits'.
The rights of refugees must be bolstered - because of their status as particularly 'in need of protection', refugees cannot, as a matter of principle, be taken into custody.
There must be uniform border controls so that people who have a right to international protection can get access more easily.
The Dublin system currently in force, under which the wishes of asylum seekers, for example, their choice of a European country, cannot be taken into consideration, must be revised to the effect that people who are recognised as being in special need of protection are also able to live in another EU country.
The individual Member States must always retain the ability to decide independently who and how many people they accept, and why they do so.
I support the Commission's proposal and the own-initiative report, but I would point out, once again, that, on this issue, rapid and uniform implementation is crucial.
