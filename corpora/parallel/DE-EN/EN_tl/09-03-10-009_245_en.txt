Courts are dealing with international and cross-border evidence law on an increasingly frequent basis.
Such cases may relate to Austrians who have accidents in Germany, defective goods or services procured from another Member State, witnesses who live at the other end of the EU or defendants who move abroad.
The right to legal redress absolutely must not cease because evidence is located outside the Member State in which the court in question is located.
Those on the ground tell us that, just as in the past, there are unsolved questions in connection with the cross-border taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters.
Since these matters do still require solving, I have voted in favour of this report.
