I have voted in favour of this report, as consumers need and want safer and more environmentally-friendly vehicles.
As for car safety, I particularly welcome the mandatory fitting of ESP (electronic stability systems) in passenger cars from as early as those built in 2011.
As far as tyres are concerned, I believe the efforts to reduce CO2 emissions through the use of better tyres with less rolling resistance, as well as the introduction of electronic tyre pressure monitoring systems, to be worthwhile.
The reduction of CO2 emissions must not, however, be at the expense of the safety of the tyres, which is to say, their wet grip.
I am also pleased that existing stocks will not - as originally planned - have to be taken off the market within 12 months, but instead only 30 months after the introduction of a new standard.
This avoids the need for tyre stocks to be destroyed, which would cause additional damage to the environment.
Furthermore, we are allowing our supply businesses, hard hit, as they have been, by the economic crisis, a sufficient transitional period to get to grips with the high level of requirements made of them.
