The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation has voted in favour of the option of establishing a European private company.
We would like to issue the following explanation, however.
Worker participation is a cornerstone of a democratic and social Europe.
For that reason, the right to information, consultation and worker participation, without restrictions, must take the same form as in the existing rules on the European company (Societas Europae - SE) and the European cooperative society (Societas Cooperativa Europaea - SCE).
The version of a European private company now agreed represents an improvement on the Commission's proposal in this regard - which is the reason we have voted in favour - but fails the objective of adapting to the existing rules.
The risk of circumventing workers' rights to participation has not been completely averted.
The process is not yet over.
We call upon the Council of Ministers to improve the proposal in the following ways:
the addition of clear references to the Directive on a European company (SE), in particular, to its standard rules in respect of the election of members to the administrative or supervisory board,
the simplification of the impracticable provision of Article 34; the significant lowering of the thresholds,
the stipulation that a European private company really is active across borders.
We call on the Commission to finally get the 14th Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of a limited company moving, as the rights of worker participation in the cross-border transfer of registered offices can only sensibly be ensured by a Europe-wide directive on worker participation.
