The global financial and food crisis means that people are saving on consumption, and that means a rise in market share for discounters.
In addition, we are laying down restrictive production regulations for our domestic food producers and promoting quality seals and similar schemes.
At the same time, we are importing products that do not meet domestic quality standards and for which compliance with such standards cannot be checked.
This means that domestic farmers find themselves severely squeezed and we must ensure that, especially in this difficult situation, the rate of farms going under does not escalate and that we do not lose our capability, across the EU, of self-sufficiency in food production.
People who are prepared to pay for the quality of their food can all too easily lose their ability to keep on top of what is what amongst the jumble of quality seals and symbols - not everything that is labelled as 'organic' is produced in the domestic market and not everywhere where a particular country is given as the country of origin do all the ingredients actually come from that country.
There is some playing fast and loose here, and food scandals and labelling scams are repeatedly being uncovered.
Ultimately, consumers have to be able to rely on labelling.
This initiative appears to be taking us in that direction, and that is why I have voted for it.
