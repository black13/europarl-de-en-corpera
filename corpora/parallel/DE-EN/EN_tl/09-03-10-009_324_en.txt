If small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are, for the first time, to be put at the heart of European legislation, it is no cause for celebration.

2009 will, no doubt, be a year of destiny in which the survival or otherwise of thousands of SMEs will be decided.

The much talked-about credit crunch looms large, in any case, in the contraction of the volume of credit.
What is needed here is to ensure that Basel II does not lead to the money flow to SMEs drying up definitively.
If we do want to cut red tape, the gain from simplifying a procedure - insofar as this would have any noticeable impact on a business - must not be lost again through new obstacles elsewhere.
If nothing else, tendering and public procurement must also be made more SME-friendly in order to give these companies a chance.
