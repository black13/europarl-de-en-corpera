Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, support this final compromise.
We are pleased that Parliament has prevailed, with the result that all eight legislative proposals form a single package to be voted on together.
I would like to thank all the rapporteurs from the bottom of my heart for their collaboration.
Marine safety urgently needs stricter European legislation in order to save lives and prevent environmental disasters by preventing accidents.
There must be no repeats of the shipping accidents involving the Erika and the Prestige.
Port State control means that ships that call at EU ports can be better monitored and - this is something we think is important - these ships can face sanctions where they fail to satisfy the safety provisions.
The monitoring of ships in territorial waters is extremely important, especially in environmentally sensitive areas, as pollution of the seas and the oceans recognises no boundaries.
That is why cross-border action is urgently required.
In the liability regulation in favour of passengers on passenger ships there is, unfortunately, only a regulation for the maritime area.
We Greens would have liked to have seen it apply to inland waterways too.
Finally, we are pleased that, after a long delay, the Council has also decided on the obligations of the port States and the insurance and liability of shipowners.
With this port package, we have taken a mighty step forwards, knowing that these rules can and must be improved still further in future.
