Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow's decision on external costs in the road haulage sector is a decision about whether haulage, ultimately, is sustainable; whether, in future, there is to be fair competition between road and rail; and whether the polluter pays principle is finally to be made to apply to road traffic - at least to some extent.
The costs are not new - they have been around for some time.
It is just that, at present, they are paid for from national budgets.
We surely must put the environment and the health of those living close to transport links above having uncongested roads.
The burdens are well enough known to all of us.
Health impacts along transit routes have been documented and that is our call to action.
The stricter exhaust emission standards for goods vehicles, for which we had had such high hopes, were inadequate.
Any improvement in each individual goods vehicle meant nothing, as simultaneous growth cancelled everything out.
That means that we need new, targeted measures in order to provide a better framework for a market that has come off the rails.
It also means, however, that the likes of relief for heavy road-users, which are still in existence, need to be abolished, as what this does is give extra reward to polluters for polluting.
We demand the most comprehensive possible inclusion of all the external costs that arise that currently have to be borne by the budgets, and I will finish with my old ceterum censeo: the sensitive area of the Alps needs special protection.
