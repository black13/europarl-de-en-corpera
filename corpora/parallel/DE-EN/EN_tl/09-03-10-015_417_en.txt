Thank you, Mr President, I very much welcome this proposal.
We are on the right road here, in particular, when it comes to incorporating the costs of congestion into overall road costs.
We need to achieve cost reality here to really bring about a situation where market economic instruments regulate traffic.
Otherwise, we will always have imbalances in this regard.
This debate has also shown up the tensions between the peripheral regions and those areas in the centre of our continent.
Quite simply, it must also be the case that when people from the peripheral regions drive though our central areas, they must take account of the concerns of the population.
That is very important and I do ask for understanding on this point, because on this issue some of the population has found itself pushed to the limit.
The subsidiarity principle, as expressed in the proposal, allows the Member States to decide for themselves whether they want to internalise these external costs.
For the central areas - and for the Alpine regions in particular - it is clear that they will choose to do so.
If peripheral regions decide not to take that route, that is something I can understand.
Overall, however, we must strive to make the individual sectors in the transport industry bear the costs that they actually give rise to.
That is the only way in which, in the long term, we can create a system that is truly sustainable and that satisfies the concerns of the population.
Thank you.
