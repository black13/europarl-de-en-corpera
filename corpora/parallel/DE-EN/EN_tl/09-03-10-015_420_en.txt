Mr President, I wanted to speak again because a number of my fellow Members have spoken about the jobs issue in perhaps somewhat sanctimonious terms.
I think we would all agree that it is incredibly important, especially in times like these, to safeguard jobs.
The freight transport industry is, of course, suffering in this situation, but it is not only the hauliers that are suffering - the railways, inland waterways and maritime transport are suffering just as much.
All this directive does is to reduce the unfair advantage that road haulage currently enjoys over other forms of transport.
The question of jobs is a completely different issue.
In that regard, we need to implement a prudent economic and reconstruction policy, and we must consistently push on with what we have decided in this House.
This directive, however, has absolutely nothing to do with that.
