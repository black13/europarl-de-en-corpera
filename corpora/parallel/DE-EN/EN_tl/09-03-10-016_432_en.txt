Mr President, I would like to put on record my thanks to the Commissioner and the Commission for ensuring, in particular, that the subject of the thermal insulation of buildings was discussed here.
It is one of the most efficient ways of saving energy and, from that point of view, it seems to me to be an important and a correct route to go down.
In this context, my question is this: does the Commission see an opportunity here to make the corresponding VAT cuts available for low-energy houses and energy-neutral houses in the prefabricated construction sector?
Is this something that can be considered, and where are we heading?
