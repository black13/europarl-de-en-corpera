Mr President, Commissioner, I have two brief questions.
My first question is this: what happens in respect of those Member States that have really provocatively low business tax rates or indeed none at all?
Is it fair for the relaxation of the Pact by these countries to be overlooked when they get into difficulties due to the low tax takes resulting from their policies?
My second question is as follows.
Should this question not be linked to a certain level of success?
In other words, where a Member State suffers a greater deficit in order to combat unemployment and unemployment then falls dramatically, would it not make sense to promote such an approach?
