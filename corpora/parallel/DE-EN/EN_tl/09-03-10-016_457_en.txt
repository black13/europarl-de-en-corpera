Mr President, Commissioner, industry does actually produce equipment that is very suitable for the varied purposes of the information society for elderly and disabled users, too.
That said, nearly all the mobile phones, emergency call buttons and similar gadgets are offered at fundamentally very expensive prices.
Is the Commission able to do anything about this?
You see, selling particularly simple technology at especially expensive prices is not very user-friendly.
