Mr President, Commissioner, I have a high personal regard for you, and that is why I regret the fact that Commissioner Rehn is not here, as I am far from satisfied with that answer.
I could have printed that off from the Internet myself.
I will state very plainly what I was getting at with my question.
Negotiations are taking place with Serbia about a stabilisation agreement currently being drawn up.
I want to draw the Commission's attention to the danger that Serbia could block Kosovo here, as in the UN and the Council of Europe.
My question was, what do we do to prevent the occurrence of something like the current block on Croatia by Slovenia.
