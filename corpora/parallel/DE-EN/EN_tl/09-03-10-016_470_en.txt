Mr President, I would like to support Mrs Ludford's question.
The Commissioner has rightly said that this is a criterion for Serbia.
What he has not said, is whether or not Serbia fulfils this criterion.
I would be interested to hear the answer.
Does Serbia fulfil the criterion of full cooperation?
We know that that is the case for Croatia.
