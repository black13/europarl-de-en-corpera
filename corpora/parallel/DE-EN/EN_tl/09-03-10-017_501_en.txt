Madam President, we find the Czech Presidency's attempts to water down the EU's childcare objectives to be truly shameful and we naturally, therefore, roundly reject them.
It is also a great success that the Union's Ministers for the Family, as a result of the pressure that has been exerted by this House, did not endorse this watering down of the childcare objectives.
I also find it very regrettable that the Czech Presidency is conspicuous by its absence today and is unable to discuss its attempt to water down the Barcelona objectives with us here in Parliament, as this Czech move is a very clear roll-back in EU equality policy and we very clearly reject the antiquated picture of women and the family expressed by the Czech Presidency's proposal.
Yet, Commissioner Å pidla, you have said that there are funding opportunities.
You have observed that most Member States of the EU do not meet the objectives, particularly when it comes to childcare for the under-threes.
What initiative will the Commission take in order to make the Member States more active, however?
I have, I am afraid to say, heard no answer from you today on that question.
What else will the Commission do to encourage the Member States?
You have also hinted that there are possibilities of co-financing.
Are these possibilities being used by the Member States?
I would ask that you answer this question.
If not, why are they not used and will the Commission also increase the funding for the expansion of childcare?
