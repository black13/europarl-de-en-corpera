Mr President, Commissioner, you will surely not be surprised to hear that I am not happy with the answer you have given us, especially as we made great efforts several weeks ago to make contact with a very wide range of representatives of the Commission, in particular, Commissioner Verheugen, and demanded clear answers.
There was very much an opportunity today to provide a much more precise answer and to say how the Commission itself intends to assume its responsibility.
For me, there are two aspects that I would like to introduce to this debate.
First of all, Qimonda is capable of ensuring a crucial technological advance for the European Union in terms of semiconductor technology and nanotechnology.
Secondly, Qimonda has no competitors in Europe but does have some in Asia, where they are assisted by 70% subsidies - that makes the crucial difference.
Thirdly, the closing down of production at Qimonda will mean the loss of the cooperative core of a network of around 40 000 jobs in a region like Saxony alone.
What do workers, their families and the people of the affected regions expect from the Union?
First and foremost, they expect a clear and immediate undertaking that the Commission wants to retain the current sites of the European semiconductor technology and nanotechnology industry, that this head start for the future is not to be allowed to be thrown away and that the statements made about future research spending, in particular, in relation to the Eighth Research Framework Programme, are true.
We also expect that the Commission, the Federal German Government and the Regional Government of Saxony will support the necessary solution to prevent the closing down of production.
There is not much time left, just a few days.
Top management figures are already drifting away.
The alternatives to a solution would be that highly advanced research technology moves to Asia or is sold for peanuts.
That cannot, I would contend, be in the interests of the European Union.
