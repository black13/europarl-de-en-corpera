Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, thank you.
We must take the opportunity offered by the financial crisis to undertake radical greening of the European economy and to put a stop to climate change.
However, the Commission is not making use of this opportunity and is relying on a rescue package involving outdated concepts such as road building and the car industry.
Even investment in ailing economic structures seems to be a possibility.
This is not a forward-looking concept which would stop people from worrying about the loss of their livelihoods.
The relaxation in the rules for the use of the Structural Funds must be aimed solely at sustainable, environmentally-friendly investment.
Without a climate check of this kind, the co-financing must not be increased.
Commissioners, I believe that your approach of using the financial crisis to erode the rights of workers is also a cynical one.
The posting directive should reinforce workers' rights and not help to weaken them.
Reform of this kind is long overdue.
What you are offering in the new document is unacceptable.
