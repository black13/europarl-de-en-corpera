Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kirilov's report primarily concerns changes to the three Structural Funds Regulations 2007-2013 with the aim of improving cash flow and liquidity in the Member States.
This is one measure for combating the economic crisis which we can support unconditionally.
Member States are now required to make full use, for example, of the opportunities for supporting investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy in housing and the new investment opportunities in housing in general.
These planned measures will contribute to accelerating, simplifying and increasing the flexibility of the use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds.
I must emphasise that these measures do not conflict with free competition, social standards and the implementation of environmental and climate protection regulations within the Community.
It is now the responsibility of the Member States to guarantee the co-financing of the money provided by the European Structural Funds in order to be able to make full use of it.
The demand in the report for increased simplicity in the administration and implementation of the funds is to be welcomed and supported.
Commissioners, we are looking forward to further proposals on this subject from the Commission in 2009.
It is important to emphasise the significance for a successful economic recovery of measures to support employment and business.
However, Member States should be urged to make extensive use of the Structural Funds for promoting or creating jobs in small and medium-sized businesses.
The committee has taken full account of our amendments.
We must support this report unreservedly.
Congratulations, Mr Kirilov.
