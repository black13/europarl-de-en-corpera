Madam President, thank you for allowing me to make a personal observation at the end of this debate.
I would like to respond to the comments made by Mr Lehne.
I understood from what you said, Mr Lehne, that the crisis was caused by the socialists in Europe.
Of course, we already knew that.
It is a well-known principle in Germany that when the sun shines in the morning, the Christian democrats are responsible, but if there is ice and snow, that is the fault of the social democrats.
We are all aware of this.
However, you, the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, could now demonstrate whether you will put into practice what you, Mr Lehne, have said when you attacked me for saying something wrong - I may have been mistaken.
Therefore, I would ask you now to tell us about the Ferreira report, Amendment 113, which concerns solidarity between the Member States and the closure of tax havens.
This is about our decision to ensure that the EU urges the G20 summit to close tax havens.
Will you vote for or against the Ferreira report?
Community solidarity between the eurozone and the states outside it and solidarity within the eurozone.
Will you vote in favour?
And finally the fiscal stimulus of 1% or 1.5% of GDP as the Community's attempt to bring the crisis to an end.
Will you vote in favour?
These are Amendments 92, 102 and 113 from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
If you vote in favour, then you will receive an apology from me, Mr Lehne.
If you do not vote in favour, then I would have to say that you are a person who makes big speeches and then does not vote accordingly.
