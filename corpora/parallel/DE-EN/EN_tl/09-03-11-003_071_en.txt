Madam President, thank you very much.
I will be really brief.
Firstly, of course, the socialists are not responsible for the crisis.
No one in the Chamber has said that.
We all know whose fault it is and this has been investigated in great detail.
However, I have rightly pointed out that over many years, the socialists have been responsible for blocking the implementation of clear transparency rules relating to hedge funds and private equity and I have given examples of this.
This is quite simply a fact.
As far as the amendments which have been referred to are concerned, I would like to mention just one point, the subject of tax havens.
We are in complete agreement on this.
The question is simply at which point we vote in favour of it.
Today we will be debating Amendment 25 on the resolution concerning the Lisbon Strategy, which covers precisely this subject.
The group will vote in favour of this.
Therefore, I have no problems with the questions that have been mentioned.
