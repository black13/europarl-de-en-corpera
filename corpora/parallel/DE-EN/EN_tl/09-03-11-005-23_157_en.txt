Madam President, you can tell by the enthusiastic response from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to my intervention how well things went during our vote.
I would like to thank my colleague Mrs Ferreira who has done a huge amount of work in order to bring about this result.
I would also like to thank specifically Mr HÃ¶kmark, Mrs Herczog, Mr Bullmann and Mr Lehne, who have, in my opinion, worked very hard on the similar Lisbon resolution.
However, you can see from the reaction of the PPE-DE group that there was a mood of excitement.
We would like to thank you for voting with us on the closure of tax havens and on solidarity with the Member States.
Until a few minutes ago, things looked quite different.
It is to your credit that you have encouraged the spread of social democracy.
This is good for the European Parliament, which has moved to the left.
(Applause from the left and protests from the right)
