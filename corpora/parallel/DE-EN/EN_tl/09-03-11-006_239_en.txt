I am voting in favour of the reasonable compromise on the new Eurovignette.
Together with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I have been fighting for years - in the face of huge opposition from parts of the conservative Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - to have the external costs (noise, congestion, pollution) included in the calculation of tolls, in order to transfer the financial burden from the taxpayer to the polluter, in other words, the heavy goods traffic.
I am opposed to the probable result of the compromise on the congestion costs because, as a result of the majority situation, it was only possible to ensure that they were recognised as external costs on condition that this applied not only to heavy goods traffic but to all causes of congestion, including cars.
It is likely that CO2 will also not be included in the calculation because of the incomprehensible opposition of the PPE-DE.
The amendment which I submitted to the committee, in which I asked for minimum tolls on all parts of the Trans-European Transport Network, did not receive a majority of the votes.
I will introduce this proposal again during further discussions on this subject.
One particularly positive feature for Austria is the fact that the external costs and the so-called Alpine surcharge (a higher toll in Alpine regions) will probably not be offset.
This means that Austria can charge a higher toll in sensitive Alpine regions and can still charge for the external costs as well.
As a result, a higher Brenner toll will be possible.
