in writing. - Heavy goods traffic in Europe has increased since the EU expansion to the East and this is particularly noticeable in many Member States, including Austria.
Now we have the problem that some factors cause high external costs which the public has to pay.
Heavy goods transport throughout Europe is one of these factors and another is nuclear power stations.
If a toll is imposed on heavy goods vehicles without, at the same time, developing the railways and removing cross-border obstacles to rail transport, then we will have simply voted for more expensive goods and there will be no improvement in people's health and no reduction in pollution.
I believe it is counterproductive to penalise someone who is stuck in congestion.
This will probably result in traffic moving back to the small villages and towns, which is something that we do not want.
In the long term, the only option is to develop the infrastructure and this means that we need to make local public transport more attractive.
The Eurovignette under consideration today seems to represent a reasonable compromise which is why I have voted in favour of it.
