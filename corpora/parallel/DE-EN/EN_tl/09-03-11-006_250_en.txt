The full impact of the financial crisis which started in the US is now being felt in the real economy.
The experts do not agree on the best response to this crisis and the best way of stimulating the economy in order to keep the unemployment figures in check.
However, even before the financial crisis, the situation on the labour market did not look at all bright.
More and more people were being forced into part-time and short-time work and state-supported jobs were being constantly cut back.
For some time, increasing numbers of people have been living below the poverty line, despite being in work.
In light of the gloomy forecasts about the economy, it is likely that the number of people in full-time employment will continue to fall and, at some point, that part-time workers will also lose their jobs.
We must do everything we can to avoid mass unemployment.
It is by no means certain that the measures presented in this report are suitable or satisfactory in this respect.
For this reason, I have voted against the report.
