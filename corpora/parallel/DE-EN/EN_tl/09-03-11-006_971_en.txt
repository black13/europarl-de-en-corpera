in writing. - I support this report which should encourage the shift of freight from the road onto rail.
The report is part of a package of initiatives aimed at making transport more sustainable, and ensuring that users will only have to pay the transport costs directly related to their use of that particular mode of transport.
Tolls will be charged for local noise pollution, local air pollution as well as infrastructure damage/costs.
This will create a fairer system of the 'polluter pays' principle, with safeguards built in to ensure market transparency and avoid discrimination.
