Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Schengen is, and always has been, synonymous with the link between security on the one hand and freedom and liberality on the other.
For the citizens of Europe and for all of us, this has been part of the added value offered by the European Union.
It has always worked very well and has been applied effectively in the interim on a 'one for all' basis.
What is happening now is annoying.
However, it is also annoying that Parliament, which has always been very cooperative, has not been given the necessary information.
We have always kept the citizens of Europe informed.
The Schengen Information System II will be functioning perfectly and on schedule and now we find out that problems have arisen and that there does not seem to be an end in sight to the dilemma.
I would be interested to know whether the figures circulating in the media, which indicate that around EUR 100 million has so far been spent on developing the Schengen Information System II, are correct.
Will the company suffer the consequences?
Why has the Commission, the Council or another body not introduced a system of checks in good time?
