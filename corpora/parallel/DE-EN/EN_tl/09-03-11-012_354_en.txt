Thank you, Madam President.
In this very comprehensive debate here today, I just want to highlight one problem and that is the issue of multilingualism in Macedonia.
Conflict broke out recently in schools in Struga between Albanian- and Macedonian-speaking parents.
Under pressure from these nationalistic-minded parents, those in charge reacted by separating teaching by ethnic groups, which is a step in the wrong direction.
The learning of languages is not fostered by keeping linguistic groups apart; it is fostered by informally bringing people who speak different languages together at school, at work and at play.
The teaching of English, which is now already compulsory across the board from year one, is of course to be welcomed, but it should not be used as an excuse by Macedonians not to learn Albanian or for Albanians not to learn Macedonian.
Schools in multilingual regions have a very particular task: they must teach the children their mother tongue and the language of their neighbours.
United in diversity is the motto of the EU and should also apply to Macedonians.
