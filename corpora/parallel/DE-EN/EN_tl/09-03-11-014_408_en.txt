Madam President, I think it is a very good thing that efforts are being made to support relatives so that they can take over long-term care.
Unfortunately, in reality, there are not enough relatives to do so.
On the contrary, we need an increasing number of highly trained staff.
Hence my question: what initiatives will the President-in-Office of the Council take to ensure that sufficient professionally trained carers are available?
Has any thought been given to a form of harmonised training, as these are new initiatives?
