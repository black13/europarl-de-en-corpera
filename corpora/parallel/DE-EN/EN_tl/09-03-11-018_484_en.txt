Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that the Single Euro Payments Area represents a genuine challenge to small and medium-sized enterprises.
They have recently been working very intensively with the credit card system and the prices and costs which result from these systems differ greatly.
I believe that the required degree of transparency is not present here.
It is precisely during a crisis that we need commensurate support for business.
It must be possible to improve the creditworthiness of companies by reducing costs, because then, of course, they can get access to credit again.
I think that the SEPA would be a good instrument here.
It should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to achieve a situation where not only can small and medium-sized enterprises work cheaply and efficiently, but where this also applies to transactions between small and large businesses.
