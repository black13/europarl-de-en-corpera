Mr President, Commissioner, I totally agree with you that we need a political solution, not a military solution in Sri Lanka.
I have visited this country many times as a member of the South Asia delegation.
I know how the people long for peace after 25 years of violence.
However, I must say that, in this sort of war, the LTTE should make a move and unfortunately, is not doing so.
You too mentioned that and the Foreign Ministers again urgently called on 23 February for this organisation to lay down its arms and end the terror.
Just imagine a Member State of the EU in which terror has reigned for 25 years.
That there is a great deal of chaos and disorder there is easy to imagine.
I support the Tamils' cause, but I reject the LTTE's methods equally decisively.
For weeks, we have heard that in this small district, more than 100 000 people have simply been seized.
Reuters reported just yesterday that, according to eye witness reports, people are being shot when they try to leave this zone.
So we need to call on the LTTE and the forces behind the LTTE to end these practices.
The game is up; they cannot carry on like this.
Obviously civilians in this war zone are exposed to barrage fire from both sides.
We must also call on the government to respect international law and permit humanitarian actions.
It is the fundamentalism on both sides that is demanding so many victims.
I think we should prepare for post-war order.
As you said, the 13th amendment in the Sri Lankan constitution must be implemented, which provides for decentralisation in the sense of regional administration by the people who live there and the EU can provide valuable help here.
I am sure that you in the Commission and we in the EU are prepared to do so.
