Mr President, thank you Commissioner for speaking so plainly.
I think that our main focus now must be directed towards the fate of the civilian population and the only thing that can, in fact, apply here is what was said in the Council of Ministers on 23 February, namely that the EU calls for an immediate ceasefire.
I am against adding the word 'temporary', otherwise the humanitarian disaster which you referred to will continue.
I also think that, in this situation, where the people are trapped in this zone, we must oppose all acts of violence that prevent people from leaving the combat zone.
In this situation, it does not matter to me if the violence is being perpetrated by the LTTE or by government troops.
Our focus must be on the people themselves.
Perhaps I might make a comment to my honourable friends from the former colonial power who are preparing to leave our group.
I hope that the impression which has imposed itself upon me, that there is also a certain domestic incentive to lash out so unilaterally at the LTTE alone, is false.
I also hope that they do not have a specific segment of the electorate in mind.
