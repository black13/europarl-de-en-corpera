Madam President, 50 years ago, the Chinese army delivered the final blow to Tibetan resistance.
Since then, Tibetans have fled, with an inordinate amount of effort, over the Himalayas and across the borders into other states.
Up to now, several thousand people a year - all of whom are refugees - have made this supreme effort to cross 5000 m high passes.
If, as China has always claimed, the situation of the Tibetans is so wonderful, there would be neither grounds for flight nor justification for the fact that journalists, people from the West and observers have been prevented for months from visiting this country at all or only under close escort.
Female journalists are even followed to the toilet by female intelligence service observers to ensure that nothing forbidden can be done.
I therefore ask myself: what is our task as the European Union?
We need somehow to bring about the resumption of the Sino-Tibetan dialogue.
However, it must take place on a different basis.
Up to now all that has happened is that China has repeated the same accusations and demands, without trying in the slightest to understand the Tibetan representatives' explanation that it is not a matter of leaving China and becoming an independent state; it is about achieving autonomy.
Commissioner, how do we deal with the fact that the monitoring of the Internet in Tibet is stricter than anywhere else in China and that it was European companies that supplied the tools to make this monitoring so efficient?
We need to act.
We are being called on at home to enter into dialogue.
