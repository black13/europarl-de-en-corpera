Madam President, on 10 March 1959, the Tibetan people were subjected to unspeakable suffering at the hands of the Chinese.
Sixty thousand people lost their lives and hundreds of thousands were arrested, taken away and tortured in the months that followed.
A year ago, the violence escalated once again.
More than 200 Tibetans died, some as a result of deliberate fatal shots, and now - shortly after the 50th anniversary - monasteries are closed to the outside world, access roads are controlled and soldiers and security men stand in readiness to nip demonstrations in the bud.
We still have no news of possible rioting.
What is the response to this show of power?
Silence in the media.
The Dalai Lama has urged his people to maintain the path of non-violence.
His call for dialogue has had no positive response in Beijing.
When an envoy of the Dalai Lama presented specific steps for autonomy in a memorandum, they were rejected by President Hu Jintao.
He said, 'we must build a Great Wall against separatism'.
This idea, which is pure provocation, was topped by the planned forced introduction of a holiday for Tibetans: 28 March is to be Serfs' Emancipation Day.
This is the bitter reality.
Two days ago, the European Parliament displayed flags.
In plenary, an impressive number of us placed the Tibetan flag on our tables and showed our solidarity with the suffering Tibetans.
There were peaceful protests in all parts of the EU.
Our fellow Members - Mr Cappato, Mrs Lichtenberger, Mr Tannock and Mr Romeva i Rueda - are absolutely right: today's resolution speaks loud and clear.
The memorandum must form the basis for further negotiations.
It is a document for true autonomy within the framework of the Chinese constitution.
The isolation of Tibet must stop - for the inhabitants, for tourists, for journalists.
We must have an answer to 600 imprisoned Tibetans.
