on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to say first of all that I do not think it is fair that, when I withdrew my amendment, you rejected part of my original text.
That is not a fair procedure.
However, with regard to what Mrs Ibrisagic has just said, I would like to say that we are able to accept this wording.
I would then also withdraw my Amendment 3 and I hope for fair treatment from the other side.
