Mr President, I am very pleased with this and would also like to thank Mr Swoboda very much because this important report has been adopted with a very large consensus.
I would like to take the opportunity to urge our Slovene Members, for whom and for whose country I have the greatest sympathy, to find a way once again of continuing Slovenia's great achievements towards European integration.
This country was the first new Member State to introduce the euro and was the first to implement Schengen.
Slovenia is a pioneer of European unification.
I would like to see Slovenia, in its national interest, also act as a pioneer in connection with the accession of Croatia to the EU.
