Mr President, in the crucial areas - human rights, the rights of minorities, religious freedom, freedom of expression - Turkey has made next to no progress, and in the last few days has even taken steps backwards.
However, irrespective of this, the Commission claims that we are nevertheless obliged to take a positive position, as this is an important strategic partner.
That is true, but that is a foreign policy matter.
The fact that we need strategic partnerships is not a criterion for accession.
However, I have nevertheless quite clearly voted in favour of the report, because the Socialist call to focus the report on accession was rejected.
This report is a great success and a breakthrough for us, because it expressly avoids setting accession as a goal and because it talks about a long-lasting, open-ended process, the outcome of which is still unclear.
We would have preferred a 'no' to full membership, but this wording nevertheless comes close to that and is therefore a great success for those of us who are happy to say 'yes' to partnership with Turkey as part of our foreign policy, but say 'no' to accession.
