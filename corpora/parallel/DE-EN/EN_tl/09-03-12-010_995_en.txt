I welcome the clear majority in favour of the resolution on Turkey.
We need to make it clear to the Turkish Government that the standstill in the reform process that has lasted for years has consequences.
Freedom of expression and freedom of the press, in particular, have suffered severe setbacks.
This is especially evident in the current behaviour of the Turkish Government towards the DoÄŸan Media Group.
The ruinous fines being demanded on account of alleged tax evasion are disproportionate and are tantamount to censorship of the media.
No progress has been made with regard to religious freedom, despite the new Law on Foundations.
Religious minorities continue to be discriminated against and harassed.
I am pleased that my proposal to call on Turkey to retract its plans for the expropriation of the Monastery of St. Gabriel in Tur Abdin has been included in the motion for a resolution.
We are also demanding that Turkey complies with the EU's ecological and environmental standards and respects the rights of the people affected in connection with the dams in the South-East Anatolia Project.
Rather than being on its way to meeting the Copenhagen criteria, Turkey is moving ever further away from our fundamental values.
Does the Turkish Government really want to set the Republic on a new democratic foundation?
The court procedure against the AK Party and the mysterious Ergenekon proceedings present a picture of a deeply divided society that is neither willing nor able to meet the challenges presented by the European Union.
It is therefore time we finally started talking specifically about a privileged partnership between the EU and Turkey.
