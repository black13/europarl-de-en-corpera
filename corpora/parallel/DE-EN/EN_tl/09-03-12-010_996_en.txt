in writing. - The Sri Lankan army is acting with the most brutal severity in its war against the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Ealam (LTTE) with absolutely no regard for civilians.
Civilians are constantly being killed or wounded in attacks by this army.
Hundreds of thousands are confined and many have no access to humanitarian aid.
The International Committee of the Red Cross has described it as one of the most catastrophic situations they have ever experienced.
An immediate cessation of all fighting on both sides, that of the Sri Lankan army and that of the LTTE, is needed.
All international organisations and governments should demand this.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the British Conservative Mr Tannock, representing the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, gained acceptance for his demand for a 'temporary ceasefire'.
This would have supported the brutal war policy of the Sri Lankan government and given clearance for attacks on civilians.
I voted in favour of the resolution, because, thankfully, the majority of the European Parliament, including the PPE-DE Group, did not ultimately follow the inhumane policy of Mr Tannock and the British Conservatives and voted in favour of the demand for an immediate ceasefire.
By placing the LTTE on the EU list of terrorist organisations, the EU positioned itself on one side and gave the LTTE de facto clearance for carrying on the shootings.
As a result, the negotiations under way at the time under Norwegian mediation were blown out of the water and could only be continued with great difficulty outside the EU.
