Madam President, Commissioner, I have followed the situation in the Philippines ever since the unfortunate Marcos couple ruled that country.
Since then, this great island republic has experienced a lot of ups and downs, the ups and downs of a dictatorship and of attempts to move towards freedom, of economic crises and of developments towards a market economy, which were then continually stifled in a quagmire of corruption, mismanagement and, unfortunately, constant authoritarian incursions.
If we look at the map we see that this island republic is of supreme strategic importance.
Like Indonesia, it controls certain maritime routes that are central and vital to our economy, but also to that of Asia.
Therefore, stability in the region matters a great deal, and that is why we need to make it clear to those in power that it is only through dialogue, only through the rule of law, only by strengthening democracy, infrastructure and small and medium-sized enterprises that this country will finally find long-term stability.
Otherwise, it will continually be under the threat of collapse, and separatist movements, movements in individual island groups, religious and cultural movements that oppose each other will threaten the unity of the country.
This is therefore an issue that is of central importance for the European Union.
