Madam President, Commissioner, we find ourselves in a very complicated situation.
What is going on in Sudan is neither so incomprehensible nor so surprising that we need to wait to see what happens.
A war against the people of southern Sudan has been going on there for decades.
This is a humanitarian disaster brought about by the genocidal policy of Mr al-Bashir.
Millions of people have been displaced and are struggling to survive and they have been in this situation for months or years rather than for weeks.
That is one side of the coin.
On the other side, it is true that we are involved in a situation in which we must not jeopardise the work of the humanitarian organisations.
We must take their concerns and needs seriously.
Which way should we go, then?
We must be guided by the facts.
The facts are that Mr al-Bashir is quite deliberately exerting this pressure on the humanitarian organisations.
Anyone who has seen his demonstrative performance, his mocking dance in this action against the humanitarian organisations and in his demonstrations knows that he is quite intentionally being provocative.
We must not allow ourselves to be provoked.
However, neither must we simply shut up, as many fellow Members would like.
That would not impress the dictator either.
I therefore suggest that we remove the three paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 from the resolution and adopt the remainder as proposed.
