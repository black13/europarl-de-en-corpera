Mrs Frassoni, as you yourself were present, I am sure you will recall that we discussed this matter at the Conference of Presidents.
There was only one objection with respect to 15 July, which came from you.
All the other group chairmen shared the view expressed in my statement before the Council.
In any case, you may read the exact wording I used in my speech.
The speech is available to all MEPs and to the public.
