Mr President, I would like to address a critical remark to the Commission with regard to the decision to ban the classic light bulb, which was submitted in writing last week.
I fully support the energy efficiency requirements and the climate objectives, which we have established, together with the Council and the Commission.
It was only the approach that was wrong in this case.
It is clear that citizens do not feel included, when decisions are taken behind closed doors, using comitology procedures.
Thus, the Commission definitely deserves criticism for failing to involve the European Parliament in the decision-making process and for not following the normal procedure.
Secondly, there was a clear lack of communication.
The people are very concerned, as no comprehensive impact assessment was carried out in relation to these measures, especially as we know that these bulbs contain mercury and therefore pose a threat to human health, especially for children.
Thirdly, it would also have been wise to think about the future and promoting new technologies.
Therefore, I would ask the Commission to submit a new proposal.
