draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, for your words, which we certainly should remember for a long time.
A few weeks ago, I attended the most recent regional ACP summit in Guyana.
The predominant opinion amongst my colleagues from the Caribbean States was that the time has come to look to the future, to stop crying over spilt milk and to single-mindedly implement the Economic Partnership Agreements.
In order to ensure successful implementation of these agreements, it is vital for the parliaments to control the process by means of their parliamentary scrutiny.
It is only if the parliaments are able to verify whether the new system of regulations can achieve what it was designed to do, that the Economic Partnership Agreements can operate as a driving force for development.
It is only when the parliaments take on this supervisory function that we can ensure that financial aid reaches the areas where it is needed.
This applies to the national parliaments of the Caribbean as much as it does to the European Parliament.
In all of the resolutions before us concerning the Economic Partnership Agreements, there are paragraphs which address the issue of parliamentary control.
However, these references are not consistent.
The text contained in the SADC-EPA Resolution presents a good compromise.
It ensures that the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Development, as well as the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee are involved in the process.
As I view this compromise as a success, I have, together with my colleague Mr Sturdy, tabled a number of amendments, which aim to standardise these paragraphs in all of the EPA Resolutions.
I would very much like your support for this initiative.
