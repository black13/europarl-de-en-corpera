Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I was going to briefly comment on your last remark, but I have decided not to.
Men are also interested in cosmetics - more and more so, in fact.
In any case, they are interested in ensuring that our cosmetic products are safe.
There is only one thing left for me to do at this point.
I would like to sincerely thank you for your agreement and support.
As Mr Davies said, we have really provided a good example of what European legislation can achieve.
If I may personally give you a piece of advice, Mr Davies, it is the following.
In your homeland it is perhaps also worth noting that we in Europe have regulations on cosmetics which do not exist elsewhere, namely the prohibition of the testing of cosmetics on animals.
That is not permitted in Europe.
Moreover, a few days ago, a regulation came into force which stipulates that products that are tested on animals cannot be placed on the European market.
Given that the British are well known for being a nation of animal lovers, this is an argument that you, too, may be able to use.
