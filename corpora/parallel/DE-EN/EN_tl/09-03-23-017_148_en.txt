Mr President, as chairman of the Ad-hoc Delegation for Relations with the Pan-African Parliament, I would like to take the opportunity today to thank the many people involved.
First of all, I would like to thank Maria Martens, who has prepared an excellent report on progress made regarding the agreed EU-Africa Strategy.
Secondly, I would like to thank the institutions involved.
We have managed, within the framework of a hexalogue - that is, involving six interlocutors - to reach an understanding between the two Parliaments.
Both Commissions have agreed, as have the two Parliaments as well as the two Councils.
As far as the Council is concerned, I would specifically like to single out the legal service, which is always particularly important when it comes to such matters, as common positions sometimes fail here.
However, following the first meeting in Adis Ababa, we have managed, in our second meeting today, to implement and finally agree on what we had agreed concerning the involvement of the two Parliaments.
I would like to comment on what Mr Hutchinson said.
What is really happening?
Yes, many bad things are happening in Africa.
However, my impression - and perhaps this is coincidental - is that, since the agreement of this common strategy, Africa has reacted differently to coups.
In Mauretania, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Madagascar, Africa has reacted by suspending the membership of these countries.
That did not happen in the past.
Back then, it would have been business as usual.
In this regard, I would also like to state that we, as European governments, should also take these facts into account.
If this partnership is based on common values, then the Europeans also have to react when Africans react when something goes wrong in Africa.
That is why I am confident that if we, as Parliaments, are more involved in the implementation of this strategy in the future, we will be able to deliver added value to this partnership.
