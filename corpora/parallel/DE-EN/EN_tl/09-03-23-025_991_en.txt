in writing. - Linguistic diversity is important.
It is part of the day-to-day reality in the European Union and is gaining increasing significance in the relationships between the Member States, in the way in which our multicultural societies live together and in the common policy measures taken by the European Union.
However, the decision-making power on matters of language policy lies primarily with the Member States.
It is not the responsibility of the European Parliament to lay down requirements and recommendations for language policy.
The fact that the EU has a Commissioner for Multilingualism makes it clear that reform of the Commission is urgently needed and that there must be fewer Commissioners than there are Member States.
