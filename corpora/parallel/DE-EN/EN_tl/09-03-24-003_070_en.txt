Mr President, as we are speaking about EU cohesion policy and regional development, perhaps we should take a look at the EU accession candidate countries.
Last weekend I was in Turkey, more specifically in eastern Anatolia, and I saw the problems in Diyarbakir in the Kurdish area.
I realised that there was a need to advise the accession candidates about the benefits and the necessity of regional development.
The problem in the Kurdish area is not only an ethnic problem and not only a question of the right of self-determination and similar issues.
It is also not a problem of terrorism, but has much more to do with regional development and with balancing regional development across the towns and the countryside.
I believe that we should explain to Turkey that it should apply European cohesion policy in this case, otherwise it will not be ready for accession to the European Union in this respect either.
