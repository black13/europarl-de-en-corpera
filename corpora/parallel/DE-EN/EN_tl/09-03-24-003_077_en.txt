rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to make two comments as this debate comes to a close.
The public has a very ambivalent view of European structural policy.
Some people take it for granted that they will receive support, but simply find that the bureaucratic obstacles are too great.
For other people, including some in this House, it seems merely to be a gateway to fraud.
Neither of these views is correct.
Solidarity is genuinely important for my group, but it must be well-founded and it must not be a one-way street.
On the other hand, it is not the case that project promoters, communities and associations which apply for projects want to defraud the European Union.
Complex processes often result in errors being made, but they do not give rise to fraud.
This is why we must change how things are done.
The second point which I would like to consider is that cohesion policy is indisputably an important part of European policy.
Faced with challenges such as climate change, the economic crisis and globalisation, together with demographic changes and developments on the labour market, we need this policy urgently.
The European Parliament must redefine the cohesion policy for the future to meet the needs of the European regions.
The reports which we have just discussed form a good foundation for this process.
This will allow European added value to be created for the European Union.
However, when we redesign the structural policy, we must not behave as if it could solve all the problems of the European Union.
We really must concentrate on the tasks in hand.
Thank you.
