in writing. - In line with the European Union's motto of 'united in diversity', we must do more to make our continent a 'Europe of the regions'.
Territorial cohesion plays an important role in this respect.
For this reason, we should put the emphasis on making it into a separate objective, alongside economic and social cohesion.
During the process of strengthening the regions, we must pay particular attention to sensitive areas, as has been mentioned in the current cohesion debate.
The increased costs must be taken into account, in particular in mountain regions, which are very time-consuming and costly to manage.
Providing compensation for these difficult conditions represents an important step towards creating a Europe where all areas are worth living in.
In this context, we should highlight the agricultural industry.
Milk production in the mountains makes an important contribution to the preservation of rural areas and should therefore be given sufficient support.
Small and medium-sized enterprises which create jobs outside the major European commercial centres should also be helped.
Overall the current debate on cohesion is setting the direction for modern regional policy and will take the traditional structure of Europe into the future.
