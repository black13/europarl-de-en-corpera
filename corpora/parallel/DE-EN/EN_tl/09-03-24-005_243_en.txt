in writing. - The recent campaign to make energy-saving bulbs mandatory, which the manufacturers in particular will profit from, highlights the gap between the European Union and its citizens.
How can the people of Europe feel any affinity with a European Union which repeats referendums, if they are held at all, until the right result is achieved?
How can Austrian citizens, for example, identify with an EU which has resulted in them being overcome by an avalanche of transit traffic, punished them with sanctions for holding democratic elections and forced them to give up their neutrality and banking secrecy?
The EU was created for economic reasons and that remains obvious.
It is not the creation of the citizens; it is the creation of an EU establishment which is divorced from reality and which adheres to the mantra of liberalisation and free movement of capital.
If we do not revise our way of thinking and if the lack of transparency and democracy continues, we can adopt one declaration of intent after another, but the citizens will remain alienated from the EU and their frustration with it will continue to increase.
For this reason I have abstained from voting on this report.
