in writing. - I am voting in favour of Mr Becsey's report which recommends higher rates of excise duty on tobacco products.
I very much welcome the gradual increase in the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products from 2014 onwards.
I also believe that updating the definitions of some kinds of tobacco products is essential in order to guarantee an increased level of health protection.
I have been a strong supporter of protection for non-smokers for many years and I think that this report is another step in the right direction.
This is underlined by the Commission's expectation that tobacco consumption will fall by 10% over the next five years.
