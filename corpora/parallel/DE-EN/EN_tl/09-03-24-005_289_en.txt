in writing. - I am voting in favour of Mrs Muscardini's report concerning a clampdown on female genital mutilation.
More than half a million women are currently affected by this hideous ritual which must be banned once and for all and the perpetrators prosecuted.
The measures and decisions taken in the past must be combined and extended.
We need comprehensive strategies and action plans to allow us to protect women from the archaic tradition of circumcision.
During negotiations with third countries, the Commission must continue to attempt to introduce the abolition of female genital mutilation as a clause and it must be possible for anyone who commits the offence of female circumcision in any EU Member State to be prosecuted.
