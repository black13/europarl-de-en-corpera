in writing. - On the one hand, the multi-million euro EU language teaching and exchange programmes are promoting multilingualism and highlighting on their website the importance of multilingualism as an essential factor in increasing the transparency, legitimacy and efficiency of the EU; on the other hand, the EU does not follow these principles itself.
Even the website of the current Presidency takes no account of the fact that German, with an 18% share, is the language with the most native speakers in the EU, while a further 14% of EU citizens speak it as a foreign language.
This is a missed opportunity for the EU to come closer to its citizens.
In practice, the consistent use of the three working languages: German, English and French, would make it possible to reach a majority of the population.
As the rapporteur has apparently reached a similar conclusion, I have voted in favour of the report.
