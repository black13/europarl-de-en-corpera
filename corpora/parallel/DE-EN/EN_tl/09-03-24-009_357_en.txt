draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to summarise the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the annual report of the European Investment Bank.
The Committee on Budgetary Control calls on the EIB to play a more active role and to introduce a more active policy to combat fraud, involving zero tolerance for fraud, corruption, money laundering and terrorism financing.
Independently of any efforts that the EIB has made in the past, which deserve our recognition, it must now pursue a policy which is not only recorded on paper, but also involves concrete measures and transparency criteria for the purposes of traceability.
Therefore, companies which have been shown to be corrupt should not be allowed to take out loans and informers should receive effective protection.
The investigative and preventative function of the EIB must play a more prominent role than it has done in the past.
In particular, in consideration of the current financial and economic crisis, we want the same supervisory regulations to apply to the EIB as to all other commercial banks, because without real supervisory control, the EIB cannot be a credible player on the credit market.
We also need independent monitoring structures which will ensure the quality of the EIB's results and its adherence to the code of conduct.
Our main concern is that Parliament should in future produce a separate report on the work of the EIB.
In our opinion a report of this kind would be both possible and appropriate, because the Member States are the only shareholders of the EIB, which means that it has a direct link with, and therefore a direct budgetary responsibility to, Parliament.
Thank you very much.
