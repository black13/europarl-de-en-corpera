Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the current economic crisis in terms of a problem of imbalance, with a deregulated market on the one hand and a lack of public interest on the other hand.
We have not always succeeded in arousing public interest in the financial markets and in the real economic processes.
This is why it is so important today that we are discussing the public investment banks, which are at exactly this interface, which allow the market to function and which have a public mandate to represent our future interests.
Therefore, my prediction for the presidents of these banks who are here with us today is that we will need them even more in the future than we do at the moment and have done in the past.
Mr Mitchell's report has two areas of emphasis.
He urges us to find a good division of labour, an optimum position for focusing on strengths.
He also proposes that we allow the two banks to concentrate on the tasks which face us in future.
These are climate change, the concern that we will be threatened with mass unemployment and recession, unless we take countermeasures, and the call, in particular from small and medium-sized enterprises, for public infrastructure, so that we can make progress, create some breathing space and give ourselves a perspective on the situation.
Therefore, I would like to thank Mr Mitchell for his good work.
He has produced a positive report.
The European Parliament has fought to retain its role and will perform its role more forcefully in future.
That is the message from my group.
One more comment to Mrs Stauner who has just referred to the supervisory regulations.
Of course, public banks must be subject to supervisory regulations and to proper controls.
However, the same supervisory regulations cannot be applied to them as to normal banks, otherwise they would not be in a position to take on the risks which we often want them to accept.
For this reason, I am in favour of controls, but of a different kind.
