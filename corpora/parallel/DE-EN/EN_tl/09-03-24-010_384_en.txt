draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on this communication, which it has presented openly in just the way we had imagined in the past.
Congratulations!
The 300 or more contributions are worth following up.
They are committed proposals which will help us to move forward.
I am very grateful that the subjects of accountability, transparency and the visibility of policies have been covered in the communication.
This will be a decisive influence.
My applause for the previous speaker was, of course, as a result of the impression created by the question as to what extent the Council can withdraw the European Union from the control of the European Parliament.
With regard to Lisbon this means that if they really acquire more rights, there will be no parliamentary and public control over the eight billion.
To make it entirely clear, I come from a neutral country.
I should be able to tell the people who elected me what is happening with the money.
I cannot do this, even though I am chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Therefore these considerations must be taken into account in future.
I am very grateful for your suggestions.
I am sorry that this debate is falling into political limbo, as we are already saying goodbye to one another and wishing each other luck.
I would like to do the same.
You have done a good job as Commissioner.
Congratulations!
