draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has managed to create a so-called zero budget.
We are the only political level which has a zero budget.
We have 0.89% of gross national income available to us and we are a good example of how carefully European taxpayers' money can be used.
In addition, we have shown over a number of years that our revenue exceeds our spending.
We have a little left over every year and we should at last get around to using the money which remains for creating European added value in future.
Parliament and the Council should agree on how this money can contribute to European added value.
It is very important that we put these foundations in place.
Furthermore, we have just had a debate on the European Investment Bank.
I believe that, in particular in times of crisis, funds should be made available as quickly as possible.
We need an immediate allocation of funds, especially in the area of research, which offers future opportunities for new services and new products.
Simplifying the administration and reducing the amount of bureaucracy are important requirements, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, because they want to do business on world markets and to do this they need our support.
A strong focus on developing the infrastructures between the Member States, which the Economic Recovery Plan begins to address - to give one example, Nabucco and other energy pipelines - is crucial in this respect, because rapid investment is possible in this area.
If you think about how much steel is needed for these pipelines, it will become clear that our steel industry could, at least in the short term, achieve peak sales and job security.
We should work to achieve this.
