Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reform of EU finances is long overdue and I am grateful to Mr BÃ¶ge, the rapporteur, for establishing this.
We need a fair, simple, transparent, reliable and sustainable revenue and spending system for the EU.
The finance for the EU budget should come only from two sources, in other words the traditional own resources and the payments based on the economic power of the Member States, that is, a proportion of gross national income.
In this case, the Member States should contribute a maximum of 1% of their GNI.
Instead of making more money available for the EU, the funds should be redeployed to areas where genuine added value can be obtained on a European level, for example common foreign policy, trans-European networks, management of external borders and research.
On the other hand, there should be no more long-term subsidies.
This also means that the VAT-based own resources should be abolished and, most importantly, that there must be no EU tax, regardless of its form, while the EU is not a truly representative democracy.
It is right for there to be a ban on EU public indebtedness.
This is an excellent policy and must be retained.
In addition, all the EU finance ministers must at last make a national statement of assurance.
Thank you very much and I wish you every success in your new role.
