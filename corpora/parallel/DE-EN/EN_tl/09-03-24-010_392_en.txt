on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of the vote on the current Financial Perspective all three European institutions - the Council, Parliament and the Commission - understood that we need reform if we want to bring ourselves up-to-date.
Now the Member States are shying away from this, which is the wrong approach.
In contrast, it is right that we need a balance between continuity and predictability on the one hand and the ability to adapt rapidly to new challenges on the other hand.
We need to change the rigid structure.
For this reason, the European budget - the medium-term financial plan - must cover five years and therefore be linked in political terms to the responsibility of an elected Commission and an elected Parliament.
This will contribute to transparency and to political clarity and the readiness to make decisions.
Today we have heard what Mr Brown is proposing and what should be on the agenda.
President Obama has also announced today his intention to invest 129 billion in renewable energy.
I would like to say that we should also make it clear to the citizens of Europe that we must modify the European budget.
We must link agricultural policy, for example, to environmental energy production and no longer make direct payments dependent on the size of the farms in hectares.
We must create more links with rural development which will really benefit the people who live in rural areas.
We must adjust all our economic policies and growth policies to the paradigm of climate change and sustainability, if we really take the debates that we have here and the Lisbon Strategy seriously, and we must adapt to the new challenges that face us.
This also means that we must invest more in education, research and development at European level.
All three institutions must find the political courage to do this together.
