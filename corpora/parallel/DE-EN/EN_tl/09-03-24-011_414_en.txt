on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, what concerns us most in this debate are the workers in the car industry.
The figures are so huge that it is hard to imagine the scale of the problem.
In your speech, Commissioner, you made one of the alarming issues very clear, which is that in contrast to this there are also the figures relating to the appalling levels of overproduction and the striking failure to innovate in the areas of efficiency and climate protection.
If we are now prepared to give the car industry state aid, this must be dependent on the funding being used to secure jobs and to create sustainable employment.
In addition, it must be conditional on these companies genuinely focusing on innovation.
Something which makes me a little suspicious, Commissioner, is the considerable influence of the CARS 21 group and the influence of the industry in the process which is being kick-started here.
I am familiar with some German car companies and I am aware that they have been putting the brakes on when it comes to climate protection and efficiency.
I have also noticed with great interest that a new exemption was requested two weeks ago to suspend environmental requirements.
This must not happen.
The aid must be dependent on conditions such as the provision of jobs, genuine innovation, training and skills development for employees and this applies to suppliers, in other words, the many SMEs which depend on the large organisations, and to the workers in the car industry.
My group would be happy with that.
However, without these strict conditions, we will not be contributing to the creation of sustainable jobs.
