Mr President, I would like to state very clearly that I fully support everything that the Commissioner has said.
In my country, Austria, many thousands of workers are directly or indirectly affected by the crisis.
This also applies to our neighbour, Slovakia, and many other countries.
I am particularly concerned because, of course, it is clear that the car industry is a key industry.
It should not be seen as an outdated industry, because a great deal of research and development is linked to the existence of the car industry in Europe.
In addition, a large number of small and medium-sized supply companies are dependent on the car industry.
We always visualise the very large companies and have little sympathy for them.
However, when I look at all the suppliers, the small and medium-sized enterprises, the situation seems quite different.
In particular, I would like to reinforce what you have said, Commissioner, about General Motors.
We have a large General Motors manufacturing site in Vienna.
We are familiar with the fears of the people who are waiting to find out about the decision to be made in America.
I hope that this will be a positive example of transatlantic cooperation in which America - because it is not the American Government, but America as a whole - which is always demanding that Europe does more to combat the crisis, sets a positive example, so that Europe has the opportunity to succeed with its own companies.
Finally, a word about protectionist measures.
Only a common European solution will be acceptable.
That must be our goal.
