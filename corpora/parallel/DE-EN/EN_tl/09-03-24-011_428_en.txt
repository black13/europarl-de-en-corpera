Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the Commissioner for his speech, but also for his bold actions over the last few weeks and months concerning the car industry and his clear statement that a solution must be found for General Motors, because the company is needed, in particular in relation to the strategy on new drive systems.
I would like to thank him very sincerely.
I would also like to pick up on what Mr Langen said about the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supporting our group's amendment, because I believe this to be important and also the right thing to do.
I am grateful that we as a Parliament are making a statement on General Motors.
For a long time it looked as if this would not happen, but better late than never.
Thank you very much.
In our resolution we have discussed short-term measures.
However, we should also speak about medium-term measures, as the CARS 21 group of experts has done, and about harmonising car tax rates.
I know that this is a difficult task, but it would represent a European economic recovery plan for the car industry.
We are in a time of crisis and we should start these measures now.
The 27 finance ministers should make a joint effort.
