on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, I know of a song which contains the line 'There must be unlimited freedom in the sky'.
This is simply not true.
The European sky consists of a patchwork of 60 national control centres.
This is twice as many as in the USA, but with half the amount of air traffic.
In addition, military no-fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another.
This is not sustainable, particularly in the light of the fact that the volume of air traffic doubles every 10 to 15 years.
When the amount of traffic doubles, the safety risk increases fourfold.
This led us in 2004 to initiate the single European sky concept.
Unfortunately the Council of Ministers insisted at the time that Member States should agree among themselves which airspace blocks should be created.
This was a mistake, because the Member States have now wasted a great deal of time and become bogged down in issues of national competence.
Now the Parliament and a good rapporteur have put in place a regulation with clear objectives and ground rules for the introduction of these airspace blocks by 2012.
This makes a contribution to safety, to climate protection and to reducing the costs of air traffic.
Flights which are 50 kilometres shorter, a 12% cut in CO2 emissions, savings of EUR 3 billion for the airlines and fewer delays for passengers.
In brief, I hope that this sectoral reform in the sky will finally be successful and will take us a step further.
