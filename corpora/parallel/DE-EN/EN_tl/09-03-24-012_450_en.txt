on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur who has entered into these negotiations with a great deal of commitment and expert knowledge.
These negotiations were necessary, as although the boundaries in the sky are not visible, they are clearly present.
They were primarily national boundaries, which, it must be said, were based on national egoism and which have helped to prevent the unification of the European airspace.
In light of the speed of travel, the safety requirements and the huge growth in air traffic, it should have been possible to introduce these improvements much earlier, especially as the concept of airspace blocks has been under discussion and negotiation since 2004.
I believe that we can now make significant progress in this area.
It is not only a question of improving the flight paths, increasing passengers' comfort and improving calculability; it will also, if it is implemented effectively, result in a reduction in emissions.
We urgently need this reduction in air traffic emissions, because the volume of air traffic is growing so much and because our air traffic emissions trading system has not been very effective.
The Council has opposed this right until the end.
Its opposition was not as successful as it had hoped and therefore even I can vote in favour of this report.
