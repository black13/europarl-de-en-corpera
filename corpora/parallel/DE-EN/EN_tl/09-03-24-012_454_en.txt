Madam President, it is not simply the case nowadays that aircraft fly across national borders.
Although the people up on the right, who may not exactly be saying ridiculous things, but are hiding behind their beautiful flags, do not seem to have understood, it is the case that the European airspace is fully deregulated and in this situation it is essential that this deregulated airspace should be centrally managed, centrally monitored and centrally implemented.
These two reports represent the right way of achieving this.
It is essential that flights in Europe should be better coordinated.
It is also essential that the same high safety standards apply everywhere and I am convinced that the path that we are taking here is the right one.
As a result of our current airspace blocks, there are too many flights, which are too long and have very circuitous routes.
In addition, CO2 emissions are much too high and the airlines are subject to enormous costs.
All this will be changed and improved by the regulation which we will adopt tomorrow.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Marinescu, for all his excellent work.
I think we have worked together to achieve something very positive for the people of Europe.
That is what we are here for.
