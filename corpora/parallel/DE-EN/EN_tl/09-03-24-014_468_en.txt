Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we can celebrate the European day of the mobile phone, because together with the Commission and the Council we have today adopted the 'Roaming Regulation II'.
We have come to a good conclusion which will result in a reduction in the costs of using mobile phones.
This is a good thing in an economic crisis.
We are also planning a cost reduction programme for the chargers, which is very important for the citizens of Europe.
Chargers should have a label showing their efficiency class, in a similar way to fridges, so that you can see how much electricity they use.
It is also important for us to introduce a legal requirement for an automatic cut-off, so that the charger automatically switches off when the device is charged.
In addition, we should ask the standards institutes to produce proposals which will make this possible.
I believe that the schedule presented here by the Commission is a good one, as it requires the industry to come to a voluntary agreement by April or be subject to technical legislation.
Of course, this is not as easy as it seems.
On the one hand, we have the connection between the charger and the mobile phone.
It will be straightforward to establish a technical standard for this.
However, on the other hand the wall socket presents a problem that we are familiar with from European standards.
In this case we should also develop proposals to find a solution to this problem, which concerns not only Europe but also the rest of the world.
Perhaps we could involve the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) in order to find a worldwide solution.
