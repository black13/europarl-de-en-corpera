Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I had already noted that, Mr Rübig.
I wanted to say to you that that is why I am so relaxed about this issue, because I do not believe that we are making life unnecessarily difficult for the industry, as the USB standard is already in place.
All my experts tell me that the existing standard can be used for all hand-held devices.
You cannot use it at the same time for desktop PCs and mobile phones, but it is possible for all hand-held devices.
This is also my answer to Mrs Ţicău.
The standard you are asking about is in fact already in existence.
In addition, I should tell you, Mrs Ţicău, that intensive work is already underway into the issue of energy consumption and the effect of chargers of this kind on the environment.
We will look into this question at the latest when we start work on implementing the directive concerning products that use energy, for which we have presented you with a new proposal.
My final remark is directed once again at Mr Rübig.
I think the idea of an automatic cut-off is a very good one and it applies not only to chargers.
I think this is a subject which could be taken much further.
The Commission is already working on it and will report back to you on the results.
