on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order to fulfil the European Union's claim to be an area of freedom, security and justice, our task is to control the allocation of entry visas for people travelling to the EU from outside Europe.
The newly created rules require EU embassies and representations to take fingerprints and photos of applicants in future.
This meets four objectives.
Firstly, it will simplify the process of combating fraud and abuse, as biometric identifiers make forging visas more difficult.
Secondly, it will prevent so-called visa shopping.
Thirdly, the process of applying for a visa will be speeded up.
Fourthly, at the same time border controls will be made easier, because biometric identifiers will allow border staff to determine quickly whether the person in front of them is the person for whom the visa was issued.
We would have been happy to support the Commission proposal to take the fingerprints of children from the age of six years upwards, in order to prevent the risk of people trafficking.
Unfortunately there was not a majority in favour of this in the House.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports with a broad majority the compromise that a Member State which is responsible for accepting and processing applications must also be able as a last resort to work with external service providers.
A decisive factor in our agreement to cooperation of this kind is that the Member States remain responsible for data protection and data security in these cases.
This means that the electronic data sent by the external service providers to the authorities of the relevant Member State must always be fully encrypted.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members from the other groups, who have worked as shadow rapporteurs on this project for three years.
