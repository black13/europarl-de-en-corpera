Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that the regulation will allow us to achieve two main objectives: security on the one hand and a more citizen-friendly approach on the other.
The introduction of fingerprints and photographs will ensure that the new visas cannot be forged or misused.
In my opinion, the new visas are more citizen-friendly because the proposal will introduce a one-stop process in which all the necessary data is recorded at once.
In addition, applicants do not need to visit the visa office every time as the data can be stored for up to five years.
I believe it is also more citizen-friendly if the process can be made shorter by calling for the cooperation of the Member States or bringing in external service providers, if the data protection regulations are followed.
We will guarantee that they will be followed, because the necessary precautions have been taken.
I would like to reassure everyone who is concerned that there will be abuse of the system or the regulations will not be adhered to as a result of using external service providers.
In my country we have had very positive experiences in this respect.
For this reason, I am supporting this more citizen-friendly approach.
Up to this point I also support the rapporteur and I would like to congratulate her.
In the course of our work together, this has not always been the case, Baroness Ludford.
However, I am not as pleased about the fact that we cannot take fingerprints from children from the age of six upwards.
I object simply because this would result in a safer situation for children, because their identity could be determined without doubt and because we could prevent child trafficking and other criminal activities.
I regret this.
However, I hope that after a study has been completed and after three years at the latest everyone will be sensible enough to decide that it is possible to take fingerprints from the age of six in order to provide better protection for children.
