on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Mrs Liotard, ladies and gentlemen, we need new regulations for novel foods.
In particular in the case of nanotechnologies, our requirements for foodstuffs should not be less strict than those for cosmetics.
We need a definition of nanomaterials and clear labelling.
However, nanofoods must not be approved until specific risk analysis methods have been put in place, otherwise we will be turning consumers into guinea pigs, which I hope no one wants to do.
In the case of gene technology, we must close the labelling loophole as quickly as possible.
Foods which come from animals that have been fed GMO feedstuffs must be labelled.
We have traceability on paper, so it will be possible.
We will see tomorrow how the Members from Germany have voted, because there is a labelling loophole here.
We do not want to take away the consumers' right to choose for themselves.
They should have freedom of choice and the opportunity to make their own decisions.
We must be quite clear about the fact that we do not want cloned meat to be approved in Europe, for both animal welfare and ethical reasons.
We should make this very clear in this regulation.
My final point is that animals should not be subjected to unnecessary suffering.
For this reason, we are calling for a ban on duplicating animal testing.
Thank you.
