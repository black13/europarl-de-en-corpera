- Ladies and gentlemen, we have noted the internal political situation in the Czech Republic.
I should like on behalf of all of you to state that this should not affect the work of the Czech Presidency and that we must have the will to ensure that work continues.
We support the Czech Prime Minister, the President of the European Council, in his work to make a success of the Czech Presidency.
I should like - and I trust that I can say this on behalf of all of you - to encourage the President of the European Council to pursue the ratification process for the Treaty of Lisbon in his country and in other countries where things still need to be done.
We have been working on this treaty for the reform of the European Union for 10 years since the decisions were taken in Nice and we want to be able to take the final difficult steps so that this Treaty can hopefully enter into force in early 2010.
We need the Treaty of Lisbon for greater democracy, so that the European Union has more freedom of action and for greater transparency.
(Applause)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the European Council on 19-20 March 2009.
