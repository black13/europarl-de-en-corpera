- Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the Czech Presidency.
Despite considerable domestic problems, it has managed to advance the European agenda during the worst economic and financial crisis for decades.
These congratulations come with a request that the Czech Presidency complete its mandate in as good and targeted a manner as before.
When I listen to the Chairman of the Socialist Group, I think I am on another planet.
He praises Mr Brown, who, before becoming prime minister, was Chancellor of the Exchequer and hence responsible for the financial policy and framework conditions of the European Union and the United Kingdom.
It has been said here on numerous occasions that only a change in attitude on the part of the United Kingdom will allow us to introduce the necessary regulatory measures.
How can someone who has obstructed that for a decade today be declared our saviour?
I do not understand that.
The Czech Prime Minister's criticism of the US policy of increasing the money supply is justified from every point of view.
You cannot resolve the problems with the very means that caused the crisis, namely an excessive increase in the money supply and too much living on credit.
Living on credit is the problem.
The first priority, therefore, is to bring the crisis on the financial market under control, change the global imbalances, jointly address the tasks before us in terms of climate protection and the fight against poverty and implement a new morality in the world based on a social market economy.
If we manage to do this in this crisis, then the Czech Presidency will have met all our expectations in full, regardless of what happens with the Treaty of Lisbon and the internal situation in the Czech Republic.
