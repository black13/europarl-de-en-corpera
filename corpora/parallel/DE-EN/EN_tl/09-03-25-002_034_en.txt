- Mr President, I was delighted to see Mr Vondra here in plenary this morning and I am delighted about the signal from the Presidency that it will continue working.
In my opinion, we shall be doing Europe a disservice, precisely in these times of crisis, if we do not all pull together and help the Czech Presidency to function.
From what I have heard from the Czech Republic, the government will remain in office and at the helm, because the majority which teamed up together yesterday does not suffice to support a new government.
I believe that, in the crisis, this type of stability, by which I mean solidarity with the Czech Presidency, is indispensable.
I also call on many western Europeans, such as the French, to rein in their malice towards the east, as it was with the referendum in France that the European crisis ultimately started.
I would like to see more courageous leadership as far as the question of climate is concerned and inclusion in what is needed now.
We need to dare to try something new if we are to make headway in this crisis.
My honourable friend was right; we are living on credit.
However, we are also living on credit as far as the environment and climate are concerned.
We have endlessly squandered resources.
We are not managing the economy in a sustainable manner.
The UN, Ban Ki-moon, the World Bank, everyone is telling us that what is happening now in China, what is happening in South Korea, with more than half the national short-term economic programme being dedicated to climate protection and sustainable development, is the right thing and that this is where the future lies.
Unfortunately, the European Council is not currently mustering up that much courage.
Unfortunately, I do not believe that the Czech Republic alone is to blame.
