- Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, you will see that it was better that I sat over here.
Firstly, unlike Mr Schulz, I should like to say that the Czech Presidency under Prime Minister Topolánek has so far been an excellent Presidency.
(Applause)
I am proud that this was and is the first Presidency from a former Warsaw Pact country and it deserves all possible support in that it symbolises the unity of Europe.
The second point I should like to address is that we are now in a difficult situation in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon.
I should like to endorse the request that Prime Minister Topolánek and the opposition leader Mr Paroubek sit down together and negotiate responsibly, because domestic policy problems cannot influence the fate of the whole of Europe.
My final comment is to Mr Schulz: My final comment is to Mr Schulz: Gordon Brown obstructed regulation of the financial markets and Gordon Brown and German Minister of Employment Scholz from the SPD are obstructing a compromise in the Working Times Directive in keeping with the resolution by the European Parliament.
Mr Schulz should not try and tell us that he alone advocates social Europe.
Precisely the opposite is true.
