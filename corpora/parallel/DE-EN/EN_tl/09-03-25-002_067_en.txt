- Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the Czech Presidency.
Yesterday's deal on roaming was sensational and the citizens of Europe stand to gain from it.
The energy and gas package has been sorted out and numerous other points have been negotiated exceptionally well by the Czech Presidency in our opinion.
The same applies to the motivation of the European people, especially in times of crisis, to praise those who make a superhuman effort.
That is why we should also support Commissioner Kov√°cs in tabling more proposals for progressive depreciation.
If we assume that more than a thousand billion euros are to be invested up to 2030 in order to build new power stations, then we need to make a start today.
That would trigger jobs and growth.
