- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a point of order.
I should like to quote from the letter which President PÃ¶ttering sent to me as chairman of the Committee on International Trade.
Have no fear, I shall not read the entire letter.
'The interpretation of Rule 47 by AFCO to which you refer was announced at Parliament's sitting of 18 February 2009, and, in the absence of objections, was deemed adopted. [...]
The proposals concerning the two EPAs [i.e. the reports by David Martin and Erika Mann] were formally announced and referred to your committee [i.e. the Committee on International Trade] only at the sitting of 19 February 2009.
In the light of the above interpretation, it will no longer be possible to apply Rule 47 in relation to those two procedures, nor to any further procedures.'
Therefore, all references in official documents to Rule 47 have to be deleted.
This relates both to the cover sheet of the document and to the table of contents, to the opinion page and to the procedure page, the last page of the Committee on International Trade.
I should like this to be recorded in the minutes.
