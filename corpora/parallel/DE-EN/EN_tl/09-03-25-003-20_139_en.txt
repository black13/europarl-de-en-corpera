- Madam President, I refer to Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure and thank you for having given me the floor.
I ask my fellow Members from the Federal Republic of Germany in particular for their indulgence of my having asked to speak now.
At the beginning of this vote, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen took the floor.
Mr Le Pen repeated in his leave to speak that the existence of the gas chambers in Auschwitz was a detail of world history.
With reference to Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure, which describes how members of this House must behave here, I ask Parliament's Bureau to check if such a statement is permissible in a chamber of deputies, which is bound by a spirit of reconciliation and understanding and respect for the victims, especially of Hitler's Fascism.
I would be grateful if Parliament's Bureau could advise on the necessary measures.
(Applause)
