- Madam President, I should like to say to Mr Hannan that the European Central Bank is also a good thing because we had no currency depreciation such as that regrettably experienced by the British pound over recent months.
That is perhaps a sign that he should reconsider his position.
On the Marinescu report, I deliberately voted for the Marinescu report.
I believe that functional airspace blocks are the right response to today's challenges.
They are late coming, but at least they are coming.
They offer an important advantage in reducing holding stacks and congested corridors, and they will benefit the environment and keep the cost of air travel down.
For that reason, I think that the air navigation services will do a good job here.
