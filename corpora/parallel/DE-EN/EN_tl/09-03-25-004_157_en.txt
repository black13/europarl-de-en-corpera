- Madam President, the regulation on novel foods brings harmonisation of the approval and use of these novel foods and ingredients to the European Union.
That is an important step for a comprehensive guarantee of food safety.
Without this regulation, we would have had no control over and no restrictions on approvals.
We have ensured in this regulation that there are strict criteria which serve consumer protection.
In granting approvals, the European Food Safety Authority will ultimately decide on the safety of novel foods, thereby giving us harmonisation throughout Europe.
In addition to safety concerns, ethical questions in relation to novel foods are also very important.
This includes the question of avoiding animal testing or preventing the use of cloned foods.
I therefore welcome the fact that these ethical aspects are taken into account during approval.
We wanted an opinion by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies to be taken into account where there are ethical reservations.
I am grateful that this was included and I was therefore able to vote in favour of the report as a whole.
