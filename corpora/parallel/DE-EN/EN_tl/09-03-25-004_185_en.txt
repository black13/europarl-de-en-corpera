in writing. - Biometric data can make passports and travel documents more difficult to forge and thereby help to combat organised crime and illegal immigration.
However, this is only possible if the biometric data are recorded correctly.
There still appear to be problems here.
With hackers currently boasting on the Internet about how easily fingerprints can be forged on German registration forms and pointing out that, if identity cards are reduced to credit card format, the photos can be digitally mastered, making biometric readability difficult, doubts about this technology could easily arise.
In all events, data protection for normal citizens must be guaranteed during the use of biometric data.
In this sense, I agree with this report.
