in writing. - I am voting in favour of the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system.
Air traffic management has been included in the common transport policy since 2004 on the basis of the Single European Sky Regulation.
Following enlargement, the European aviation market has grown to 37 countries and has made the EU a global player.
An update to reflect this was therefore urgently needed.
One core element of the Single European Sky is the creation of functional airspace blocks (FAB) based on traffic flows rather than national borders.
It should be possible to reduce the current 60 blocks and control centres to between 15 and 20.
This not only corresponds to the concept of a common Europe, it also saves time, money and fuel.
In the past, each flight has been an average of 49 km longer than necessary due to the fragmentation of airspace.
The Commission expects savings of between 7 and 12% of CO2 emissions.
Functional airspace blocks are essential because they allow the air traffic control systems of several Member States to be integrated into one European transport system.
An FAB coordinator should also be introduced along the lines of the TEN coordinators.
