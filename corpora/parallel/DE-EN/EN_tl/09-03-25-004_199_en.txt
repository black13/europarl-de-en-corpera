in writing. - I am voting in favour of the report on aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services.
Air traffic management has been included in the common transport policy since 2004 on the basis of the Single European Sky Regulation.
Following enlargement, the European aviation market has grown to 37 countries and has made the EU a global player.
An update to reflect this was therefore urgently needed.
The second report in the package extends the scope by harmonising controls of aerodromes and their operators.
Austrian aerodromes also come under this new rule.
What is positive, precisely in times of economic crisis, is that a series of proposed amendments in Parliament allows advance payments for infrastructure investments where other sources of investment are available in addition to user fees and under strict conditions.
This will help significantly in seeing us through this economic crisis.
