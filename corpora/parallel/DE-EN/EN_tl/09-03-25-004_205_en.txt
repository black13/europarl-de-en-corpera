in writing. - I am voting in favour of the report by Kartika Tamara Liotard on greater safety for novel foods.
We need stricter requirements for approving novel foods, such as products from cloned meat and the use of nanotechnologies.
The term 'novel foods' now includes numerous foods manufactured using novel methods which are currently only marginally represented on the European market, if at all, as well as foods simply unknown to European consumers.
However, they also include products from cloned animals, the long-term consequences of which have barely been researched at present.
Over 100 applications for approvals of novel foods have been made since 1997 and over 20 have been approved.
I am in favour of a separate regulation for products made from cloned meat and for new approvals to be suspended until such time as it enters into force.
Foods containing nanomaterials should be banned until such time as an animal-friendly and safe method of evaluation is found.
If such products are placed on the market, they must be labelled so that all information on their origin is directly brought to the consumer's attention.
