in writing. - It should now be clear to everyone that the documents submitted in approval procedures are often embellished and that there are no long-term findings.
At the very latest when we hear how rigorously and scrupulously attempts are apparently being made to build up a gene monopoly for genetically modified seed, the alarm bells should ring when there is talk of cloned meat.
In any event, the consequences of cloned meat, including interactions with genetically modified fodder or pesticides and atomic radiation, cannot be predicted.
Apart from that, clones would appear to be incompatible with EU animal welfare legislation.
Overall, the cloning of animals for food production should be rejected, but if it is used, then there must be appropriate labelling, so that citizens are free to decide.
For these reasons I voted in favour of the Liotard report.
