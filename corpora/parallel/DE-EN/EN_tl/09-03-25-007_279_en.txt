draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mill√°n Mon, for tabling this excellent report, in which all points needed for fair transatlantic relations have been addressed.
This draft resolution on the state of transatlantic relations in the aftermath of the US elections indicates how important these relations are.
According to the Commission's figures, nearly 14 million jobs in the European Union and in the US depend on these transatlantic economic and investment relations.
I hope that the new President of the United States, as he said in his pre-election speech in Berlin in July 2008, will set a high value on these relations.
As he said at the time, America has no better partner than Europe.
We note in the motion for a resolution that this partnership is also the most important strategic partnership for Europe also.
This partnership is indeed the precondition, especially in the current global financial and economic crisis, for meeting global challenges.
However, the precondition for a viable transatlantic partnership is that the Americans also acknowledge Europe's justified concerns in transatlantic trade.
We have particularly high standards in the European Union, for example in consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection.
We also want these standards to be met by products supplied by the US to Europe.
I hope that the new president and his new administration will work on introducing these standards in the US.
Then we too shall have no problems.
I am convinced that this motion for a resolution will be adopted tomorrow, because I am of the opinion that it contains everything needed for good relations.
