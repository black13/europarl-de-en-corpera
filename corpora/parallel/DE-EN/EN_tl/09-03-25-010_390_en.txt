- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, nearly 20 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, this is the first debate in this House on an issue which could drive a wedge between people in the East and in the West, even in our European Community.
Why?
The view of a totalitarian regime from the outside is very different from the view from the inside.
The way in which 20th century European history was dealt with and retold differed greatly, especially in the individual Member States.
Moreover, in some Central and Eastern European Member States, people who disregarded human rights or sent people to camps or to their death without following the legal procedure are still in office and held in esteem.
It poisons our common future if we fail to acknowledge this properly.
Europe should therefore not remain inactive.
I welcome the fact that we have now given this issue a European platform.
I trust that it will not stop with today's debate and that we and the Commission shall together begin a process to implement the projects which you mentioned.
I hope that we shall manage through this process to bring perpetrators who are still alive to book and to commemorate the victims, in order to develop greater understanding for each other in the interest of a common future.
