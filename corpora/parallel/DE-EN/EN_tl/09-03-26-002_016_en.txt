Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Siekierski has done a great deal of work to produce this report and for this I would like to offer him my sincere thanks.
I also share his view that a lot of people, particularly now during the economic crisis, are facing the threat of poverty.
It would be an indictment of Europe if people here in Europe had to suffer hunger.
However, I have to disagree with the impression given that food has become more expensive.
That may be true in certain countries, but in Germany it is certainly not the case.
Partly as a result of erroneous decisions at European level, the price of milk and butter, for example, is lower than it has been for a long time and it has reached a level that is threatening the existence of many farms.
I have here some statistics which list the prices of food.
In 1970, an industrial worker had to work for 243 minutes in order to be able to buy a kilogram of pork chops, a kilogram of beef, a kilogram of dark wheat and rye bread, ten eggs, 250 grams of butter, a kilogram of potatoes and a litre of milk; in 2008 he had to work only 82 minutes.
This means he only required a third as much time in order to be able to afford this food.
In the explanatory statement it is stated that in Germany alone 9 million people face the threat of poverty.
A correction is also needed here.
In Germany, every citizen, every person is entitled to minimum benefit from the state and therefore none of these 9 million people need suffer hunger.
It is therefore important for the money that is made available here for food aid to be used in places in Europe where people are really facing the threat of hunger.
It would be a disgrace for Europe if we did not rectify this.
