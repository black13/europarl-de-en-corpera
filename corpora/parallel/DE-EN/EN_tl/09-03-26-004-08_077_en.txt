Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Article 170(4), I request on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the final vote on the resolution and the report be postponed until the next plenary sitting.
It became clear in the debate yesterday that the majority in Parliament would be able to agree to the signing of the interim agreement, even if it pains them to do so.
Many Members are hoping that, after years of deadlock, the agreement will enable a new quality of dialogue between the European Union and Turkmenistan.
However, for the majority of Members it is important that we do not give the Commission and the Council a free ride.
As Parliament, we need guarantees from the Commission and the Council that, if the human rights situation continues to worsen, at the request of Parliament serious consideration will be given to the suspension of the agreement.
Yesterday, the Commission unfortunately only conditionally agreed and the Council did not agree at all to this demand.
I therefore request, on behalf of my Group, that both final votes be postponed until we have the corresponding commitments from the Council and the Commission.
(Applause)
