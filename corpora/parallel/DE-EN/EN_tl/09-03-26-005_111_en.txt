Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the report by Mrs Batzeli.
In my opinion, it calls into question some of the essential cornerstones of our economic system, such as free competition and the basic principles of the social market economy.
It is clear that appropriate measures to stabilise food prices need to be found in order to ensure sustainable agricultural production.
Practices which distort competition must be stopped.
However, an EU-wide database containing reference prices for products and inputs would bring more bureaucracy and reporting obligations, the costs of which would be passed on by the trade to producers or consumers.
The result would be higher end and consumer prices and lower prices for producers.
Complete transparency of all business cost factors such as pay, energy costs, purchase and sale prices and the profit margins would lead to monitoring and dirigisme.
These are not the aims of a social and free Europe.
The position of farmers in the food supply chain can only be strengthened by cooperation and the inclusion of shared responsibility.
