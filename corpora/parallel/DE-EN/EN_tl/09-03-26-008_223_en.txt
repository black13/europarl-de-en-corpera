Madam President, thirty years ago I was here in Strasbourg when the directly elected European Parliament met for the first time.
The Oldest Member was Louise Weiss, after whom this wonderful building, itself a splendid piece of European culture, was named.
Her speech was the intellectual foundation document of the European Parliament.
She talked at that time of the type of Europeans we need, united on the basis of a common European culture.
This European culture is not something new, as many people think, but it is the rediscovery of something that is much older than the nation states, Mr Heaton-Harris.
Borders, at least on the continent, are mostly rather artificial.
Culture is deeply rooted in regions that are often divided by artificial borders, and regional culture is of enormous importance as a link between nations.
One of the greatest cultural figures was the Bohemian Forest poet Adalbert Stifter, who worked in Bavaria, Upper Austria and Bohemia and united Czech and German people.
This tradition must be kept alive - the culture that is destroyed by nationalism and displacement, the culture of minorities, the regional culture, the culture of European regions that span borders and, in particular, the diversity that we will only be able to preserve together.
Franz Josef Strau√ü, the great Bavarian European, once said that we will only be able to remain Bavarians, Basques, Germans or Britons if we become Europeans in time - Europe not being a centralising factor, but a common roof against the rain of globalisation and standardisation.
