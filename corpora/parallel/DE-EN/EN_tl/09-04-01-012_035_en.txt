Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Onyszkiewicz has spoken very lucidly on the importance of human rights in cooperation with Russia, for which I thank him.
I think it is particularly important to make it absolutely clear that Europe does not value economic links, that is to say gas connections, over human rights.
Normal partnerships are based on two reliable parties that trust each other.
Strategic partnerships run the risk of having only limited defensibility and reliability, which is why the EU has to protect itself against unreliability.
As long as Russia continues to abuse human rights so seriously and fails to reach a minimum level of democracy and rule of law, as shown, for example, by the cases of Anna Politkovskaya or Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, we cannot have a good, normal partnership.
