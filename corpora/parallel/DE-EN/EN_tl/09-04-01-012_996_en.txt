in writing. - The comprehensive new partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is, in my view, very welcome.
Russia is the EU's third-largest trading partner, as well as having major strategic importance in terms of Europe's energy supply.
The agreement with the Russian Federation lays the groundwork for improved cooperation between the two parties.
In light of how important the EU and Russia are to each other, this agreement must not, however, remain simply an act of political will; we must also be able to ensure that it is implemented.
Parliament's recommendation to the European Council primarily emphasises the importance of protecting human rights and the freedom of the media in Russia.
As the intention is for us to progressively build on our relationship in economic, security policy and education policy terms, it is extremely important that all our partners respect European values.
It is the only way for the partnership between Russia and the European Union to be developed to the satisfaction of both sides.
