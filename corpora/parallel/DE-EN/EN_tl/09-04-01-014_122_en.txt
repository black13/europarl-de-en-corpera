Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a journalist, I would like to draw attention to a change in this directive that is of great concern to me personally.
Specifically, I find it incomprehensible that, when the directive has not yet been transposed in 10 out of 27 Member States, we are going a step further and trying to stick an additional directive on top of it.
Opinions may be divided on that, which is fine, but what really disturbs me, as a journalist, is the fact that it is damaging the freedom of the press in the Member States.
Let me give you two examples of this.
Mr Weber's proposed amendment, which merits our support, means that it will also be possible to limit the freedom of the press, for example, if a publisher is required to accept an advertisement from neo-Nazis or anti-Semites.
I think that is totally inappropriate and goes completely against the principles we have in the EU, and I object strongly to it.
We cannot allow this to happen.
The same applies, of course, if we have anti-discrimination; then people who we do not want to encourage in the EU, but rather need to take action against, will have even more opportunities, for example in the property market.
In my homeland, we see neo-Nazis trying to buy property almost on a weekly basis.
If property is being rented or sold, we cannot prevent left-wing or right-wing extremists from taking it.
They will make use of this new amendment, and I object strongly to this and will vote against it.
I am therefore in favour of supporting referral back to committee or, if this is impossible, of voting against it.
