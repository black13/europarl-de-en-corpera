Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, since I am the one who has been quoted the most in this debate, I would like the opportunity to respond once again.
I have said that anyone who asks questions is the bad guy in this debate.
All the speakers who have vehemently spoken against discrimination have talked about the principle.
Once again I would appreciate it if we could not dispute the principle and instead work to combat discrimination.
Even when, for example, we discuss environmental issues and we disagree with regard to the prohibition on CO2 emissions, then we disagree on the means to achieve it, but we all agree on the objective.
Why are we not allowed to disagree on the means with regard to discrimination and how we want to combat it?
Moreover, if newspaper publishers sit in our offices and express their concerns, we should be allowed to bring up those concerns here.
Mr Cashman, you are not doing the issue and your concerns any favours if you marginalise anyone who simply asks questions.
That is purely and simply what we are doing here.
