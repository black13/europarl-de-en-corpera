on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing these three reports in the face of the largest and most difficult economic and financial crisis that has so far been experienced in the history of the European Union.
It is, of course, right that cohesion policy has to play a part in assuaging the consequences of this economic crisis.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to stress once again that, although it is correct that the cohesion policy budget is the largest individual budget in the European Union, it is, unfortunately, also correct that the Member States contribute slightly over 1% of their GDP to the European Union's budget.
This means that, even if we spend over EUR 6.25 billion on funding interim payments and advance payments, it is merely a drop in the ocean and it is just not enough.
It will mitigate the consequences, it will enable leverage, but national efforts, too, will continue to be necessary.
Perhaps we should bear that in mind in connection with the next debate on the Financial Perspective.
Our Group has discussed the three reports very intensively and could have brought a number of other good ideas to the debate.
In many instances - as Mrs JÃ¶ns has already said - we were surprised that it has taken an economic crisis to actually make a reduction in bureaucracy possible in the Commission.
We will not table any amendments because we know that rapid action is now needed in the regions and because we also know that we will have to talk about changes to structural policy elsewhere.
We are therefore supporting the entire package proposed by the Commission and we hope that it will reach the regions as quickly as possible and that the money can indeed help to combat the financial crisis.
