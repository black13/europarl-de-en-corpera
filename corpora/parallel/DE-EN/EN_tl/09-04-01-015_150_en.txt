on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, view the financial crisis and the climate crisis in relation to each other, as the adverse effects of climate change on the regions are long-lasting and give rise to enormous costs.
They cause a strain on economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Therefore, we must take action now.
Building insulation and the use of renewable energy in housing under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) are an initial step in this regard.
However, what use is this progress if, at the same time, Member States are permitted to invest ERDF funds in road planning and colossal waste-incineration plants, the use of which aggravates climate change anew and harms the environment?
This is half-hearted and inconsistent.
Nor does your dynamic speech, Commissioner, answer the question as to why the Commission is rejecting our proposal to orient regional policy as a whole more strongly towards environmental and climate protection.
Does the Commission lack the courage to assert against Member States a revision of the ERDF Regulation that is oriented towards climate objectives?
Why is there no Commission action plan on regional policy?
The reservations about climate protection on the part of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy have prevented our amendments receiving majority support in committee.
However, we shall be re-tabling them and requesting a roll-call vote.
Then we shall see whether voters can trust you, too, to support climate protection.
