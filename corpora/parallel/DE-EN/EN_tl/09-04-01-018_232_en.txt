on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Community Code on Visas will mean that, in future, Schengen visas - visas for stays of up to three months - will be issued according to established uniform criteria in the Schengen area.
This step is urgently needed in a European Union with open borders.
At the same time, Member States' responsibility for processing visa applications is clarified.
As a rule, applicants must contact the Member State in which their main destination is located.
My group welcomes the fact that the requirement and the procedure for issuing entry visas will speed up entry for large numbers of people.
This way, business travellers entering the EU will be treated fairly and, moreover, holidaymakers from all round the world - by far the largest group of travellers to the EU - will benefit.
Thus we have not only made it possible to process visa applications quickly but also ensured that security screening prevents abuses.
With its balance between security and facilitating entry, the Visa Information System affords Member States instant, direct access to all the relevant data in connection with the issuing of visas.
Thus the examination of applications is being simplified while, at the same time, the issuing of visas will provide greater security in future thanks to the use of biometric identifiers; that is, photograph and fingerprints.
The compromise struck between rapporteur Mr Lax and the Council takes account of Parliament's original position and also has the support of the broad majority of my group.
I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Lax for his commitment and his excellent cooperation over the last three years on this very complex dossier, which puts European visa policy on a new footing.
