on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, my colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats said that the sector is very concerned that, if someone drives for just one minute too long, he or she may have to pay up weeks later.
Regrettably - from my point of view - I can put her mind at rest.
Firstly, checks in the Member States are very permeable, with most Member States taking lightly or disregarding their monitoring obligation.
Secondly, criminal prosecution in this field is still in its infancy even though the state of affairs is disastrous.
When, for example, a driver who has been working for 38 hours without a break is stopped on the Inntal motorway, no one can tell me he has failed to find a car park; instead, there is often pressure from employers for drivers to keep going until they are ready to drop.
This is dangerous for all the other road users.
I need not go into detail about the gravity of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles.
This is also a concern for local residents, of course, as some of these vehicles may also be carrying dangerous goods, which then cause damage.
Therefore, I think it extremely necessary and important that there be proper monitoring in this area - it is essential!
Secondly, I think that particularly with the introduction of digital tachographs, there is now such a long history of implementation in the Member States that the time is coming, slowly but surely, to enable those wishing to perform monitoring - for the benefit of drivers, local residents, other road users and road safety in general - to do so more effectively at long last.
