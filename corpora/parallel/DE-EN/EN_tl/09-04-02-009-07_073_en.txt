Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment to the effect that, in points 5, 8 and 16, the word 'legal' should be deleted, as it gives the impression that children who are not registered, in other words involved in a current asylum procedure, could be excluded from the education programmes.
We wish to protest against this.
I move that the word 'legal' be deleted since every child has the right to education if he or she is registered in a country.
