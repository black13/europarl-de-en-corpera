Mr President, we, the German conservative group (CDU/CSU), voted against Mrs Buitenweg's report.
We oppose discrimination of all kinds, but we do not believe that a comprehensive framework directive at European level is really the right way to protect those affected.
Ten Member States have still not transposed the existing anti-discrimination directive at all.
Despite that, a simple majority of this House - not a qualified majority - did vote in favour of this extension today.
It would give rise to considerable additional bureaucracy and unnecessary costs - something that the public has little understanding for.
Improvements can be made in relation to insurance and in the structural adaptation measures relating to disabled entrances, and the requirement for a law on class actions could be eliminated, but we foresee serious problems for the Member States if, for example, we were forced to include the concept 'belief' in the prohibited grounds for discrimination.
The consequence of this would be that extremists and sects, such as Scientology, for example, would be able to invoke the protection of the directive.
We are also opposed to granting complete equivalence of status to traditional and same-sex marriages.
In the Commission's view, the transposal of the directive requires that same-sex partners, insofar as they may be legally recognised in a given Member State, should also receive the same rights as married couples.
We are opposed to that idea.
We therefore voted against the report and in favour of referring the proposal back to the Commission.
