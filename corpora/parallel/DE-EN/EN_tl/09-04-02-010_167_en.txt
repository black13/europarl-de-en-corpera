Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while 10 of the 27 Member States are embroiled in an on-going court case due to their failure to transpose the first directive, we have today still seen a simple majority in this House vote to lay a second directive on top of the first.
I, personally - along with the majority of my group - voted 'no'.
Why was that?
I will mention two examples.
From experience in my Franconian home, I know of the efforts of political extremists, neo-Nazis and left-wing radicals attempting to acquire property and thereby generate widespread publicity in their favour.
If this is implemented, the equal treatment directive will mean that owners and our landlords will now, in some cases, have to make deals that they had hitherto been able to refuse.
For that reason I voted against Mrs Buitenweg's report today.
Another reason is that, in the amendment today, we reversed the reversal of the burden of proof and with it a fundamental element of our state under the rule of law.
I regard that as completely illegitimate.
The third point relates to newspapers and publishers, whose freedom to refuse to publish items by extremists would be curtailed by this directive.
That, in my view, is a clear intrusion on the freedom of the press and something that I therefore reject.
