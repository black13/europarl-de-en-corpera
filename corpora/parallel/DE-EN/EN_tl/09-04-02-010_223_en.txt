in writing. - For years now, the nationalistic and patriotic forces in the EU have been warning of the consequences of unchecked mass immigration.
Concentrations of foreigners of 20, 50 or even 90% show that the multicultural vision has failed.
School experiments with classes made up purely of foreigners have proven fruitless and even intensive language courses have their limits if the parents do not support their children.
In Austria, language courses have been offered to parents for years, but here too the level of success leaves a lot to be desired.
The disposition towards education is something that is passed on from one generation to the next, and when parents see education as pointless, then we are coming up against a brick wall, as has been demonstrated in France.
The only solution is zero immigration or negative immigration, bringing an end to family members joining immigrants already in situ, and the willingness to integrate must at long last be something that is demanded.
The EU's proposed solution - getting more teachers from immigrant backgrounds into schools - is divorced from the reality, and it is for this reason that I voted against this report.
