in writing. - It is telling when the object of greater harmonisation of national provisions and procedures relating to visas is illegal immigration.
Past visa scandals, of course, show how relaxed an approach some states take to the issuing of visas.
There has been too little investigation into the cases I refer to, and not enough change has resulted.
The mass legalisations of recent decades also cast doubt on whether it is sensible to proceed with harmonisation.
Unless all Member States are in favour of strict visa provisions and a rigorous immigration policy aimed at zero immigration, the result can only be the lowest common denominator.
In order to prevent the possible opening up of the immigration floodgates via the back door, I voted against Mr Lax's report.
