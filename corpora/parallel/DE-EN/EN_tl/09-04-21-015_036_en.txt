Mr President, I would request that you ask the House whether that should be placed on the agenda.
You cannot simply decide that yourself.
At least ask whether the Members agree with that decision.
You can surely find a couple of minutes to discuss this important topic, which greatly affects many regions in our Union, and to discuss it in good time, as in May it will be too late.
