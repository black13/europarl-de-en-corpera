Mr President, MON 810 was approved in the European Union in 1998.
This approval is not mandatory for Member States and each Member State is free to decide whether to accept this approval, to apply it or to issue a ban on the cultivation of this maize.
I assume that this is the basis for the latest ruling in the Federal Republic of Germany on this issue.
In this regard, may I say that MON 810 was approved in Germany in 2005, then in 2007 sowing of the seeds was stopped and in December 2007 Monsanto submitted a plan for the general monitoring of its cultivation.
It was subsequently approved again in 2008 and then, a few days ago, it was prohibited.
Mrs Frassoni has stated that many Member States have rejected the cultivation of this maize.
There are precisely four States - France, Austria, Hungary and Luxembourg - and now Germany has joined them, so there are five out of the 27 Member States.
This is purely a national decision on the basis of subsidiarity and therefore we should not burden Parliament with it.
