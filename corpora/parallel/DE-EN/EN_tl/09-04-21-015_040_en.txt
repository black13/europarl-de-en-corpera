Thank you Mr President.
We are not in favour of proceeding in the way in which Mrs Frassoni has requested, but for a different reason to that given by Mr Goepel, and therefore I am grateful to you for the opportunity to present it briefly.
We need to have a detailed debate, not only about this point, but also about the issue of how we want to deal with genetically modified food.
However, we cannot manage this in the short time we have until the day after tomorrow.
I therefore believe that we should ask the new Parliament after the elections to conduct a detailed debate on the use of genetically modified food.
Thank you very much.
