Mr President, a few weeks ago, an unholy alliance of pro-European Czech Social Democrats, President Klaus, who opposes the EU, and the Communists brought about the fall of the Topol√°nek government.
Work is now under way to establish the interim government, which is to undertake the governmental work from May until after the new elections in October.
I hope that this new cabinet will lead the Czech Presidency, which has so far performed its role very well, to its conclusion and help to enable the necessary ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Czech Republic.
This would be an important, positive sign for Europe.
