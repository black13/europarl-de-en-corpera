Mr President, yesterday the United Nations' anti-racism conference opened in Geneva.
Twenty-two EU countries are participating and five countries have decided not to participate.
This shows the unity of the European Union in relation to such an important event in a poor light.
However, I now read that a few countries are still considering travelling to Geneva during the course of the week, and therefore I would ask you to bring your influence to bear on the Czech Presidency so that we, as the EU, can take a united stance on this anti-racism conference.
A dreadful speech by the Iranian President must not be allowed to divide the EU and weaken the UN.
That must not be the outcome of this speech, and therefore I believe that we must strive once again - as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has also requested - to ensure that all 27 EU Member States and the EU as a unit actually support the final document arrived at there to help the millions of people in the world who are affected by racism and discrimination.
Thank you very much.
