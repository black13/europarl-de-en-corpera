Madam President, thank you Mr Piebalgs for your focussed speech.
I believe that we can best measure the progress we have made by what we set as the goal at the beginning of the debate.
I remember the situation at the start as being one in which Mrs Kroes presented an analysis showing that, despite several liberalisation packages at European level, the market power is held by fewer and fewer players - large energy companies - in ever more EU Member States, in other words the concentration is increasing in the energy sector in relation to electricity just as it is in relation to gas.
I was therefore pleased at the start of the debate that both the Commission and then later the European Parliament said that the most effective instrument to combat this concentration - particularly in the electricity sector - is the separation of generation and grid.
I would make a bet with you today that without this separation - as you initially advocated - we will not manage to provide any real protection for consumers from arbitrary prices on the energy market.
I am also willing to bet that this Parliament will discuss this instrument again in the foreseeable future, because what we are deciding on now will not be enough to break down this power and the dominant position of some large energy companies.
It will not be enough to prevent electricity and gas prices rising ever higher, despite ever increasing profits in the energy sector.
It will not be enough actually to provide the transparency and consumer protection promised here by many well-meaning Members of this House.
I have to acknowledge that these Members have fought very hard in this respect.
However, I also have to say that it is the large companies and some of the Member States that have succeeded here, and not the far-sighted European politicians.
I hope that you will accept the bet and then in four years' time we will discuss the next liberalisation step and we will actually talk about unbundling.
