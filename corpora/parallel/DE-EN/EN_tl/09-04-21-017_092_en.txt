Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we agreed that we wanted to ensure that citizens got greater security of supply with regard to energy, that they had sufficient energy and that they were able to buy energy at reasonable prices.
We did not agree as to the instruments with which we can best achieve this.
However, today we have a result that we can be proud of and that is constructive and discriminating, because the matter is complicated and there is no simple answer to it.
The solution is that we must ensure that more money is invested in the energy sector, in grids, in interconnectors and in new power stations.
This is a very important consideration and the necessary capital must be made available for it.
On the other hand, we must ensure that those companies providing the energy are monitored and that true competition is created.
I believe that it was the right solution to approve different models for the organisation of the enterprises, while at the same time ensuring that we have effective monitoring, a strong agency and solid cooperation between regulatory authorities and making sure that companies cannot simply do whatever they want to.
The fact that completely different provisions can be made - including tailored to particular national circumstances -is a clever solution.
If used correctly, it may also be a future-proof solution and one that will take us a significant step forward.
Moreover - and this is true - during our process and the discussions we had in the Member States, we could already see changes taking place.
The situation is no longer the same as it was at the start of the survey carried out by the Commission.
The data and facts are now already much more diverse and we have already made significant progress, but what we are about to adopt now will take us another step further.
