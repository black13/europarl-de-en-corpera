Madam President, I believe that in this case - I was shadow rapporteur for my Group for the gas sector - a compromise has been found that we can agree to for the other sectors too, because we did not look to the market in an ideological way, but thought in practical terms.
A common European market means, above all, that we give the national regulators more opportunity, more power, and that we establish common European criteria, so that no one regulator makes completely different decisions to the others and we do not have a situation where one is dependent on the government and the others are not and we have a European agency, which, in cooperation with the Commission, can really work towards forming a European market.
The second very important aspect is the fact that the role of the consumer is strengthened, something that in principle is reflected in several provisions, although I would have liked to have seen it in more.
It is about consumers having opportunities and rights and finding transparency in this important supply sector.
Both of these conditions are met and I am therefore voting in favour of this package.
