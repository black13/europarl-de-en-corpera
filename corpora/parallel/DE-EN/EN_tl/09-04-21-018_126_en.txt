Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs VÄƒlean, in particular, but also Commissioner Reding, who showed great commitment in the negotiations for the Roaming II Regulation.
I believe that these negotiations and, of course, also the objective of bringing the national prices and the prices that we pay in the other European countries onto the same level, are an important step forward.
It is also good that the national regulatory authorities are now also responsible for roaming and will therefore take over the control and monitoring roles, which will quite simply provide us with more transparency.
Transparency is vital to the functioning of a market.
Up to now there has been a lack of transparency in several areas, but there has also been blatant market abuse.
It is not right for up to a thousand times the amount to be demanded for data roaming, as is often the case.
The per second-based billing for inbound calls will in future also bring definite progress and result in cost benefits for European citizens.
