in writing. - Around 80% of EU funds are still being managed and spent by the Member States and there are still open questions and irregularities in connection with the handling of European Union money.
The European Court of Auditors has now failed to confirm the legality and regularity of the EU's financial transactions in its annual audit reports 14 times in succession.
Complete disclosure and inspection of EU expenditure is essential.
It is necessary for the Member States' finance ministers to submit a national statement of assurance for all of the EU funds used.
