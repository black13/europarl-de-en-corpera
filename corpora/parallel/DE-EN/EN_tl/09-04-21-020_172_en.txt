draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament does not really have anything to say on this matter.
It has been consulted and it is being used for the preparation of a directive which will serve to maintain uncertainty rather than help to increase safety in the nuclear sector.
The directive is irrelevant to all existing nuclear power stations in the European Union.
It is also irrelevant to high risk projects, such as those currently planned in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Romania.
It has absolutely nothing to deliver in this regard.
Moreover, if it survives, namely in connection with future planning that has not even begun yet, it will not lay down the current highest available scientific and technological standards, but will recommend compliance with principles.
I ask myself why we as Parliament are allowing ourselves to be used in this way with this token gesture, which will not serve to ensure the safety of citizens.
