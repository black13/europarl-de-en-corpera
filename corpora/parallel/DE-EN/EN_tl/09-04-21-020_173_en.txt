Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the decision we have taken is a smart one and it has been cleverly presented.
It is also a smart decision for Parliament to contribute to harmonisation in Europe and to establishing more security rules.
We have a duty to do that.
Mrs Harms, I think you are quite wrong on the one hand to demand more and more safety in the nuclear sector and to complain that nuclear technologies do not have sufficient guarantees of safety while at the same time using every opportunity to obstruct such decisions here in this House.
You cannot complain about the European Parliament concerning itself with this matter and then be dissatisfied that nuclear technology is not safe enough.
We have fulfilled our duty today.
We are attempting to contribute to providing a minimum level of safety for nuclear technology throughout Europe while, of course, also - as we have jointly established with a large majority in other decisions in this House - stabilising and supporting nuclear technology as one of several options in the energy mix.
In this connection it is also relevant to ask how things stand with regard to safety.
The answer must be given, we cannot simply keep asking for it.
This proposal is on the table today and I hope that it will receive a majority vote tomorrow.
