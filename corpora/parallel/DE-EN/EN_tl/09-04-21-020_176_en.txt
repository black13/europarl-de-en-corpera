Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal currently on the table is to be welcomed.
I would like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs, and your predecessor, Commissioner Palacio, who had already realised that it is important to think about safety.
I also believe that it is important to improve the independence of national regulatory bodies.
If regulatory bodies in all of the other countries were as independent as the regulatory body in France we would already have made a great deal of progress.
It would, of course, be even better if we had an EU-wide regulatory body with the ability to remove dangerous nuclear power stations from the grid in the peer review process.
It is also important to have strict mandatory safety standards and to ensure, through the European regulator, that shutdown is carried out.
Safety and protection are extremely important for public health and receive our full support.
More must be done in relation to this in future.
