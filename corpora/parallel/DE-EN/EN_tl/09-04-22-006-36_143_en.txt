Mr President, I should like to say that, in its debate and its papers, Parliament has called on both the Commission and the Council to state that, if Parliament were to call for this agreement to be suspended or revoked, they would do so.
The statements were very different.
The President-in-Office of the Council expressed no opinion at all as to how the Council would react if Parliament were to call for this.
The Commissioner merely replied that the Commission would give some thought to what it would do if Parliament made this request.
My point is that Parliament's demands have in no way been met by either the Commission or the Council, and therefore I can only recommend that we now withhold our support for this.
(Applause)
