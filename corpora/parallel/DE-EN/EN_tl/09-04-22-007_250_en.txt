Mobile phones are now part of everyday life, and large sections of the population never go anywhere without them.
Whether they are used for business or private purposes is of secondary importance.
At all events, all kinds of communication, be they telephone calls, text or multimedia messages, Internet communication or surfing, incur costs that operators charge to customers.
It is understandable that these costs are higher in a foreign network - not the operator's home network, that is - but, since the advent of international mobile telephony, we have seen excessive abuse of these roaming costs time and again.
In some cases, consumers have had to accept outrageous bills that have not been backed up by any universally applicable calculation.
In the form of this initiative, which not only makes it easier for individual citizens to navigate the tariff jungle but also standardises the costs, the Union is finally doing something for the benefit of the people of Europe for once.
It is for that reason that I have voted in favour of this report.
