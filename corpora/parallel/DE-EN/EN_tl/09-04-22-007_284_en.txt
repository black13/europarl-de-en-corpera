The right of asylum is to become a vehicle for mass immigration on an unprecedented scale.
Europe's doors would be opened wide to the developing world.
If the multicultural visionaries have their way, the concept of the family will be extended to mean that whole tribes can immigrate without any difficulty.

This would put even more pressure on the domestic labour market - particularly during the economic crisis - and taxpayers would be required to dig deep into their pockets.
For these reasons, there is no option but to reject this report.
