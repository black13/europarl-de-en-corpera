Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, our Italian fellow Members have rightly viewed this debate as a very important one for their country and requested the floor, yet it is also a debate for all Europeans.
After all, we are a European community.
We are pleased to have the opportunities presented by the Solidarity Fund, and we should like its use to be as targeted as possible - including by the Italian Government and the regional bodies.
We wish to express once more our condolences to the numerous victims, and we hope that Europe is able to help bring relief as soon as possible.
