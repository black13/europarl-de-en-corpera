Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, I should like to introduce another rather different emphasis into this debate.
Some speeches we have heard could give rise to the impression that there is no parliamentary scrutiny of common foreign and security policy, but this is far from the truth.
Excellent cooperation has evolved between the Council and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, and we are informed of every detail - including the budgetary aspects.
The Committee on Budgetary Control is not involved in this - this is an internal matter for the European Parliament - but the Chairmen of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence are regularly informed of budgetary aspects.
Parliamentary scrutiny is taking place here.
Then there are the confidential aspects, for which there is a special committee, which is also informed at regular intervals of all the details of European security and defence policy by Mr Solana personally.
Things may have gone very unsatisfactorily in this regard from the point of view of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I agree that the Council's absence from this debate is unsatisfactory.
Nevertheless, nonsensical remarks such as those made by Mr Martin give the impression that there is no democratic control of any kind of the important matter of foreign and security policy in the European Union.
There are more important things, for example the issue of the accounts from which Mr Solana's travel is financed.
There is the issue of the operations in Chad, Congo, Georgia and many other countries.
Dialogue and effective democratic control are a reality here.
