Mr President, I should like to pick up briefly on what Mr von Wogau said.
Mr von Wogau, you may have a body that holds very interesting discussions on future projects.
However, discharge is not the responsibility of three Chairmen or a diverse body, but instead of the Committee on Budgetary Control and then of plenary.
If you can tell us what is happening with the Council's off-budget accounts, then please go ahead.
I am convinced that you do not know, and we do not know either.
Yet, by granting discharge, we take full responsibility for what the Council has or has not done.
This is not a kindergarten; if we do not know what they have done, we cannot take responsibility for it, otherwise we make ourselves a laughing stock the world over.
Anyone wishing to do that tomorrow is welcome to, but my recommendation is not to grant discharge and to opt for postponement.
