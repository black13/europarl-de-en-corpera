Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is in our interests to find a solution to this dispute, but this will be possible only if the Council makes a move.
We have complied with procedures, we have sent rapporteurs, and the four coordinators have written letters and asked questions.
No replies were forthcoming, with just a reference made to a gentlemen's agreement - which certainly never applied to discharge, only ever to the budget meeting.
Even then, it applied only to the administrative part.
This gentlemen's agreement has never applied to the operational part; indeed, at the time the agreement was made, there was no operational part.
The Council must offer us a solution to this; it has time to come up with one, and we would urge it to do so.
I am a little ashamed on its behalf on account of the members of the public up there, as this is the negative side, the arrogant side of Europe.
We no longer live in a monarchy, and it is time that, in this regard, the Council joined us on the path of democracy - of greater democracy - which, incidentally, it always helps push through in the Treaties, too.
We would urge the Council to stop making this House a laughing stock, and the Council should also stop making itself a laughing stock.
