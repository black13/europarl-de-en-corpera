Mr President, passenger rights must be put at the heart of transport policy as a whole - particularly here in the European Union.
We have already managed this for rail and air transport, although there is considerable scope for improvement with regard to denied boarding.
As I keep having to say, the problems are far too great.
One group is particularly dependent on clear rules.
In the case of air transport, it has become apparent that the rules are not clear enough.
By now, people with particular needs could write volumes about all the things that have happened to them on journeys.
I myself have received some of their accounts.
It is a disaster.
Therefore, it is not only required by law but also morally imperative for the European Union to put these people on an equal footing.
In the field of bus, coach and maritime transport, for which we are now laying down rules, we may encounter problems assigning responsibilities when it comes to maritime transport and the ports - but this must be given a practice-based solution in future.
My second point is that we should include as much as possible when it comes to bus and coach transport.
If we make too many exceptions, we give operators the opportunity to circumvent the rules.
We cannot continue to put the people who have to contend with particular needs at a disadvantage by allowing these difficulties to continue.
It is our duty to take care of and ultimately also to enforce their right to mobility.
