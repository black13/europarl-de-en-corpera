on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank the rapporteur.
In the context of climate change, urban transport plays a central role, because it is responsible for 70% of all harmful emissions.
Only if we change our transport policy in the EU will we be able to achieve our own climate protection targets.
The greatest potential is in towns, where 90% of all car journeys are less than 6 km long and which therefore offer an ideal opportunity to take a bus or train or go by bicycle or on foot.
We are delighted that the majority is in favour of only giving EU money to towns with over 100 000 inhabitants which can also submit a sustainable mobility plan.
We are sorry that our proposal to introduce a general speed limit of 30 km/h, with the facility for towns to set higher speeds on certain roads in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, did not achieve a majority.
This would not only be good for the climate; it would also reduce the number of road traffic accidents.
Every year 40 000 people die on the roads of Europe; that is 40 000 too many.
