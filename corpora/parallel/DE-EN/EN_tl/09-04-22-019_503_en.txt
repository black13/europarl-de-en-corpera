on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, in principle one must agree with the general objective of the directive.
Better information systems for travellers and road infrastructure operators, for example with a view to reducing road traffic accidents and making transport cheaper and more efficient, is obviously a good idea, as is the facility for collecting environmental data.
However, I have three main concerns.
Firstly, faith in so-called smart technology easily tempts people into handing their responsibility over to machines and instruments.
Secondly, there is an ever-increasing danger of all the data collected being misused.
People's privacy is in ever-increasing danger.
Thirdly, this directive is too car-oriented.
Interoperability with other transport systems, such as public transport, would be much more important than the elaborate game of cat-and-mouse that industry is trying to play with us.
