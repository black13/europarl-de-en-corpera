on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, plenary will vote tomorrow on the Marco Polo II programme to improve the environmental performance of freight transport.
Marco Polo II offers improved planning security, because it is timetabled to run until 31 December 2013.
It has a budget of EUR 450 million.
The eligibility thresholds for the proposed projects are to be lowered in comparison with Marco Polo I and are equal to utilisation by small and medium-sized enterprises.
I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for that.
In light of the current financial situation of many small and medium-sized enterprises, this is a very citizen-friendly policy to which I can give my unconditional support.
The programme is based on displacing traffic and reducing the overload on road transport.
It will also strengthen co-modality and hence contribute towards an efficient and sustainable transport system.
With a positive vote, which I recommend for tomorrow, the legislative procedure will be closed at first reading.
