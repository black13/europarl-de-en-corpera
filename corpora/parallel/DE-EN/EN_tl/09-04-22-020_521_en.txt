rapporteur. - Madam President, Commissioner, I agree with you.
We can send out a positive message tomorrow, namely that we are able to make citizen-friendly and sensible amendments to our legislation when it is necessary to do so.
We should not only send out this message; we should also start up an information campaign in the countries of Europe, so that we can capitalise on the attractiveness of this programme, because we really have made all the necessary adjustments.
Now there are real deals to be had at bargain prices.
If we cannot manage to shift anything now, then we really do need to question the entire programme.
I hope, Mrs Jensen, that we shall not have to put the money into other programmes, because this is an important concern.
We must and will displace traffic wherever possible, but it is difficult.
Mr Blokland, you have already had an answer.
We re-negotiated inland waterway transport and forced an additional compromise on the Council, as it were.
Our concern was to finish at first reading.
That is why we could not take too radical an approach and had to negotiate with one eye on compromise and consensus.
As a result, we achieved a great deal.
I look forward to the fundamental debate which we shall have shortly on the third programme, on the basis of a communication which the Commission has promised, so that we can discuss all the fundamental questions, everything that we have listed in a joint motion for a compromise, such as whether we should split up the programme for individual modes of transport and so on.
Then it will become exciting again.
Now it just has to work, so that it does not grind to a halt and projects already under way possibly fall by the way-side in this crisis.
That really would be a pity, hence this compromise.
My thanks once again to everyone for their input.
