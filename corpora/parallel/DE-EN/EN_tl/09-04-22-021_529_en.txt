Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also want more freight on the railways, but not at the expense of passenger traffic.
Passenger mobility is a public service in Europe.
The Commission is ignoring the realities of Europe's rail networks, in which goods and passengers are carried on the same rails.
There should be no dogmatic priority for either one sort of train or the other.
We Greens want to use the one-stop shops to create a single contact person for everyone who wants to send freight trains across borders in Europe.
In addition, we want more transparency when paths are allocated and during operational disruptions, in order to avoid unfair distortions of competition, among other things.
The Commission and you, as the guardian of the treaties, must eliminate the practice which allows state-owned companies to reserve paths free of charge solely to keep out competitors.
Our motions on noise reduction, especially from freight traffic, were rejected by the major coalition here in the House.
However, we Greens shall continue to lobby for railways to remain environmentally friendly, especially by retrofitting existing freight wagons.
