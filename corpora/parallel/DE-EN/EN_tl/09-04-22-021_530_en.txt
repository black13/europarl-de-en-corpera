Madam President, in competition with road freight traffic, freight traffic on the railways only stands a chance if it really is established throughout Europe, which is why I welcome the introduction of cross-border freight traffic corridors, on which freight traffic will be optimised.
That is what it is about.
With this report, we have defused justified concerns about a reduction in the standard of passenger traffic with fixed priority regulations for freight traffic.
However, we shall have to do more work on the report, because we are process workers and we are only at first reading.
In future we shall have to also take account of how the Member States react.
We need a different basis on which to calculate the number of corridors.
Parliament has proposed one per country.
I think that we in Germany would need a north/south and an east/west corridor.
Secondly, we need to consider if alternate corridors are possible in areas which possibly have less mixed traffic.
Thirdly, it must be clear that the overall capacity of rail transport must not be reduced.
Last but not least, many citizens worry that more freight traffic on the railways will bring more noise with it.
That is why we must start with sensible legislation on noise reduction in freight rail traffic straight away in the next parliamentary term.
I look forward to more work.
We still have things to do.
My thanks to the rapporteur, because this really was a good compromise on a very contentious issue.
