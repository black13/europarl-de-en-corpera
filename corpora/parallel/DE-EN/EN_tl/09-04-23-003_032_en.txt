Mr President, pension claims, unemployment insurance and sickness insurance - nearly 25 years after the advent of the Schengen Agreement, social provision is still limping along behind it.
Holiday visitors are often brazenly exploited and have to pay exorbitant bills locally that are then either only partially reimbursed or not reimbursed at all when they return to their home country within the Union.
The European Health Insurance Card is often not accepted, unfortunately, while the settlement of payments between the Member States does not really work.
Particularly in times of tight budgets, however, the patient must be put more at the centre of healthcare provision.
To that end, patient rights must, of course, be strengthened.
Whether a patient in a medical emergency is able to get prior authorisation for the reimbursement of costs for hospital treatment must be viewed as doubtful.
If we are constantly economising on medical staff due to cost pressures, then I would say our healthcare system is heading in the wrong direction.
Better cooperation makes sense, therefore, but it absolutely must not be allowed to degenerate into a bureaucratic obstacle race.
