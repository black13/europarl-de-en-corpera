Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in ruling that patients have a right to be reimbursed the costs of treatment carried out abroad, the European Court of Justice has given us a clear mission.
In this regard, Commissioner Vassiliou, the Commission proposal is excellent.
It is a proposal worth standing up for.
I regret what has gone on in this House with regard to this directive over the last few weeks.
The spectres of the market have been evoked and absurd connections to the Services Directive have been created.
Some of the amendments - and I say this as someone who grew up in the former German Democratic Republic - make my blood run cold.
One example states that Member States may take appropriate measures to stem patient flows.
What manner of people are these?
It would seem that new Iron Curtains are to be put up.
It is all the more remarkable that such proposals should come from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, of all people.
We are talking about social Europe, something that we talk about a lot these days - Members from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in particular, like to do so.
This lunchtime we have the opportunity to pass this acid test and make it clear whether, for us, this is about patients' rights or whether we prefer the blinkered perspective of the national healthcare bureaucracies.
