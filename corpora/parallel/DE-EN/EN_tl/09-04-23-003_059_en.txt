Mr President, I completely disagree with Mr Matsakis, as the Commission proposal does not, in fact, provide legal certainty for patients who get treatment outside their home countries.
Furthermore, it also fails to clear up the grey areas for social security systems under Regulation (EC) No 883/2004.
Only a clear system of prior authorisation for cases where expensive treatment is involved would guarantee reimbursement for patients.
The directive is also unclear when it comes to its legal basis - as other Members have already made clear - including in relation to the division of competences between the Member States and Europe.
The Member States' healthcare systems are systems of solidarity that guarantee the same access to everyone, irrespective of how deep their pockets are or where they live.
EU legislation must not put these systems of solidarity in jeopardy.
In this regard, too, the Commission proposal is inadequate, and we will therefore need our amendments to be adopted if we are to vote for this proposal.
