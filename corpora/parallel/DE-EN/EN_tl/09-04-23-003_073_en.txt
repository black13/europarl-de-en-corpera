in writing. - The agreement that has been reached to improve patient mobility is a good thing, overall.
Simplification of the cross-border provision of healthcare services represents an important step towards a real free movement of people.
Economically speaking, too, a better use of the capacity of specialist clinics will bring benefits with it.
Putting all these positives to one side, however, we must not overlook the immense challenges that a better linking up of the national systems involves.
First and foremost, there needs to be greater certainty in terms of cost issues.
There must be no disadvantaging of the Member State carrying out the treatment due to a lack of clarity about whether the patient or the sending state is to pick up the tab.
The system of rules for settlement must be laid down precisely and account must be taken of different national circumstances.
Furthermore, domestic provision must be safeguarded and it is not the intention that that domestic provision should have to suffer as a result of greater patient mobility.
I am pleased to see this confirmed in the text.
For the future, the cross-border provision of health care services is a further milestone on the road to European integration.
When it comes to implementation, however, strict attention must be paid to ensuring that better patient mobility does not lead to health tourism.
