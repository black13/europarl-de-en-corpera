Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are aiming to work together to attain the best conditions for the provision of health care in Europe.
Especially in rural areas of the European Union close to national borders - such as my home in the greater cross-border region between Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France - the advancement of patient mobility, which we were just debating, is a particularly important building block for improving the provision of health care and making it more efficient.
In everything we do, however, we must adhere to and retain the ethical standards of the Member States.
This applies to DNA analysis just as it does to artificial insemination, and it also applies to rare diseases, the subject of Mr Trakatellis's report.
Rare diseases need a stronger political framework in order to improve research and treatment, as companies prefer to invest in large markets.
In fighting for people's health we must not seek to eradicate rare diseases by, for example, selecting embryos.
The matter at hand here, after all, is healing people.
This one element represents a complete wrong turn for a report that otherwise takes a sound approach, and it is a turn that is morally perilous.
In Amendment 15, it is not healing that is the focus, but selection.
Who is to decide which life is worth living?
Do we believe that prevention means preventing life?
I do not think so.
In my own country, and many other Member States besides, pre-implantation diagnosis is prohibited, and for good reason.
That official European documents can use terms such as eradication and the selection of healthy embryos unabashedly is something that I find shocking and contrary to our stated goal of the acknowledgement and integration of those with disabilities and diseases into our society.
I ask you all to vote against Amendment 15 as a matter of imperative importance so that what is otherwise such a sound report by Mr Trakatellis will also be able to obtain a good majority.
