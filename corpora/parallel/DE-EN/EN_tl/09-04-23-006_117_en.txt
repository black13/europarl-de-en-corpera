Mr President, of course we can continue the debate.
Mr Cohn-Bendit's motion has been carried, after all, and many comments have been made.
I would ask that we concentrate on what we are due to vote on, which is to say Mr Casaca's report.
Irrespective of whether this is deemed to be a private or a public fund, this report is about a very specific matter, namely Parliament establishing, firstly, that it has no legal claim to have its deficits subsidised and, secondly, that, furthermore, no such subsidising of deficits will take place.
There is no money for the fund.
That is the crucial point, and I would ask that we vote on it.
