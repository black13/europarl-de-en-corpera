Mr President, I voted against Mr Trakatellis's report as a result of the scandalous Amendment 15, which confuses the curing of diseases with the murder of unborn human beings and reeks of eugenics.
We need to be clear on this: human beings have a right to life from the moment the egg and the sperm fuse until their natural death, and this amendment fundamentally brings that right to life into question.
An unborn human being would no longer have a right to life, simply because he or she has a disease.
That is the precise opposite of medicine - it is murder.
For that reason, Mr Trakatellis's report is unacceptable and this amendment is a scandal that discredits this Parliament, which has otherwise time and again served bioethics and the protection of unborn human life well.
