in writing. - The European Parliament voted today on Mr Casaca's report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Parliament for the 2007 budgetary year.
The report also addressed the question of the pension fund of the European Parliament.
The European Parliament pension fund is a voluntary pension fund.
The pension fund has now got into financial difficulties and a deficit has accrued.
The Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is opposed to using tax revenue to clear the deficit.
It is irresponsible to expect European taxpayers to pay for these losses.
Any such plans should be averted.
The Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament voted against discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament's budget.
The possibility of using tax revenue to clear the deficit has not been totally excluded.
