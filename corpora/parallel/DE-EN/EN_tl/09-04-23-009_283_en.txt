in writing. - The report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism does not take sufficient account of the real interest of rail transport as a whole in better use being made of the capacity available.
Infrastructure operators are to be obliged to retain capacity reserves for occasional traffic in their annual network timetable.
This preliminary requirement leaves infrastructure operators no flexibility to take decisions on such measures in real time.
The Commission's original proposal has even been tightened up, as capacity reserves must guarantee adequate quality for international facilitated freight traffic paths.
The extent to which requests for paths by railway companies are actually used cannot be approximately estimated for planning purposes.
These capacities are removed in advance from the timetabling process, with the result that other, later path requests cannot be satisfied.
If the already marginal network capacities are not used by freight companies, they will ultimately be eradicated to the disadvantage of all users.
This regulation would achieve precisely the opposite of the actual objective, which is better use of available capacities.
In order to limit the negative impact on passenger traffic and freight traffic requested in the short term, a regulation is needed which allows the infrastructure operators to decide if such a measure is suitable, taking account of the demands of passenger rail traffic or how better account can be taken of the needs of freight rail traffic.
