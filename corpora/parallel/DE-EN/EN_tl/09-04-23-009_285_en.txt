in writing. - Freight traffic is concentrated mainly on the roads at present and the proportion carried on rail and water or by air is declining.
In times of ever-narrowing margins and extreme competition, overtaking manoeuvres by lorry drivers, coupled with overtired drivers and overloading, are a fatal cocktail of risks.
In addition to the risk of accident, freight traffic, which has a tendency to break down, is untenable from the point of view of congestion, noise and environmental pollution.
It is high time to get freight on to the railways, but for that we shall need better technical solutions and logistics models for coordination and organisational networking.
This report is a step in the right direction, which is why I voted for it.
