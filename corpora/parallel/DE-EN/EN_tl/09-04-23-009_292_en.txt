in writing. - I voted in favour of the directive on patient rights in cross-border healthcare, because it provides patients with greater legal security.
Especially in areas of the European Union close to borders, such as my home town in the large region of Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France, or in rural regions with a shortage of medical services, the promotion of patient mobility is an important component in improving and increasing the efficiency of health services.
The German health services sector will profit from cross-border patient mobility, if patients from other EU Member States make greater use of our high standard of medical services, for example in rehabilitation.
However, the sovereignty of the Member States must be retained.
The Member States themselves are responsible for providing medical care and for organising their health systems.
In keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, the directive should only regulate areas which concern the cross-border mobility of patients.
Our high quality and safety standards in Germany must not be compromised.
Ethical standards, which the Member States comply with for good reason, such as, for example, in artificial insemination, DNA analysis or assisted suicide, must not be called into question.
