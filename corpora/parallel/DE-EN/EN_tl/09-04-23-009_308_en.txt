in writing. - The explicit call in Amendment 15 for rare diseases to be eliminated through genetic counselling of carrier parents and for healthy embryos to be selected through pre-implantation diagnostics (PID) is not merely contrary to current laws in Germany.
In light in particular of German history, it would appear to be unacceptable and intolerable as a matter of principle to demand or recommend the eradication and selection of disabled persons, even if they have not yet been born.
Alarmingly, these proposals and wordings reveal a total lack of respect for the value of every human life, regardless of whether we are talking about sick or healthy people.
The addendum tabled replaces the call for therapeutic treatment of rare diseases with the objective of preventing the birth of sick people.
This is not compatible with the spirit and letter of European and international declarations of human rights.
The actual objective of convincing European policy should be to help people affected or at risk of disease, not their early selection on the basis of quality criteria.
The report and individual amendments, especially Amendment 15, are not in keeping with my Christian values.
That is why I voted against the report.
