Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, G20 is indeed the right way forward; in time G8 will have to be dissolved by G20.
Then we would have one summit less.
Europeans have failed.
The European Union with 27 Member States is indeed the right arena in which to organise a new financial market order.
To date we have had a lot of talk on this but no clear resolutions.
We have heard a great deal about clearing tax havens, control of hedge funds and the end of fraudulent financial market products.
If the Europeans had gone to London with a policy position, who would have actually been able to stand up against them?
I find, as my honourable friend Mrs Lucas said, that it is infuriating that the London summit simply adjourned the climate crisis and the security of energy supply crisis.
That has not only inflicted a great deal of damage on the climate and security of energy supply, but has also gambled away the opportunity for thousands of new jobs.
