Mr President, I can follow on seamlessly here.
It is a tragedy that this continent is unable to reach a majority on what my fellow Member Mrs Lucas referred to.
If it were, we would be in a far better position and could look future generations in the eye.
As things stand, we cannot.
A criticism that I have to make is that much of the debate about the financial disaster and the way in which the emerging or already real climate catastrophe is being pushed aside reminds me of the German Bundestag after the Second World War.
Many members of parliament and many politicians in the Bundestag no longer had any interest in what had happened up to 1945.
They had to be confronted with it slowly.
That is the starting point: unless you conquer the past, examine your own mistakes and look to the future, there is no way forwards.
The EU and, more importantly, the political actors failed dramatically in the financial crisis.
They must draw conclusions from that and first learn what they did wrong.
