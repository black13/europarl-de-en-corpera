Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am most grateful for this debate today, because it shows that a Europe with 27 Member States and 500 million citizens definitely has clout outside the borders of Europe.
Many citizens in Moldova have recognised how important it is to have a division of power, to develop a basic democratic understanding and to fight for it.
It does not happen as a matter of course that people stand up for democracy today and that people can proclaim their convictions in public and are not locked up or subject to repression for doing so.
That is why I believe - and I should like to support the Commissioner fully here - that we in Europe should use everything currently at our disposal in the fight for freedom by individual citizens, for freedom of the press and for a well-established democracy.
