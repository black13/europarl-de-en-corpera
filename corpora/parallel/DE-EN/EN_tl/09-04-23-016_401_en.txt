Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Rehn for giving us an overview of the Western Balkans again today.
I have just returned from Macedonia and Kosovo and should like to address three points.
The first is the disunity of the European Union.
If it persists in the common foreign and security policy, we shall have no stability and no overcoming of ethnic divides in the Balkans.
Secondly, the strategy of the German conservatives in the CDU has dropped on the Balkans like a bomb as it were, because it divests the European perspective of credibility and, if the European election campaign is fought like that, there will again be conflict in the Balkans.
Thirdly, and this is why we should act now, not only to maintain the perspective, but also to make it realisable: Greece must lift the blockade in NATO to Macedonia's membership and we must unite in recognising the independence of Kosovo, otherwise our EULEX mission will suffer.
