on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the programme that allowed Iraq, Iran and North Korea to acquire nuclear technology was called Atoms for Peace.
East and West participated in this programme.
We have seen where it led in Iraq, where a terrible war took place following atomic armament based originally on civilian technology.
Where it will end in Iran, I cannot say today.
Korea has left the non-proliferation community.
In the same week in which North Korea aggressively announced its new plans and finally evicted the IAEA from the country, the IAEA has in turn announced that it would start new negotiations with between 30 and 50 developing countries on civilian armament; it is called equipment, but I call it armament.
This is a deadly cycle.
Unless we stop civilian armament, we shall never get a grip on the proliferation of nuclear technology, including military technology.
