on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to finally put an end to nuclear weapons on this planet and to implement the disarmament obligation in the Non-Proliferation Treaty, especially Article 6.
The new US President, Barack Obama, has stated that he wants nuclear disarmament.
Now the governments of the European Union are being called on to act and engage in specific nuclear disarmament.
What this actually means is disarmament instead of modernisation of British and French atomic weapons.
It also means a stop to Germany's nuclear participation, which means the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Europe, for example from BÃ¼chel in the Rhineland-Palatinate.
The majority in the European Parliament and so far achieved in the Committee on Foreign Affairs should not waste time voting on wishy-washy reports and should retain the specific calls for disarmament originally included in the report.
I get the impression that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is still living in the past.
What we need is stronger disarmament components in the NPT and that is what we should vote for tomorrow.
