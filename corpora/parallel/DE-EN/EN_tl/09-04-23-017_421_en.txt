Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Soviet Union came to an end, many took the view that it would also be the end of the nuclear scare, but what was then a global nuclear scare has re-emerged at regional level; I need only mention Iran, North Korea, India and Pakistan.
Unfortunately, not even the NPT has been able to prevent that.
The real danger is that terrorists or criminals or irresponsible regimes might obtain nuclear weapons.
The initiative by Kissinger and Shultz and Obama's speech in Prague has now brought new momentum to this issue.
That is extremely important.
It is becoming clear here that even the nuclear powers are now prepared to reduce their arsenals, and that is what was new about President Obama's declaration.
It is important now for Europe to speak with one voice, for Europe, its nuclear powers and the others, to speak with one voice.
A first step on this path is the fact that Mr Solana is conducting negotiations with Iran on behalf of all the European countries, as well as of countries beyond Europe.
I believe that we should latch on to that.
We must not expect any quick miracles on this path, as Mrs Beer is doing, but if there is an opportunity today for us to really be able to reduce this threat, step by step, then we should grab it.
