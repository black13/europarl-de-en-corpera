rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not an ideological debate that we are holding here.
After the military inventions led by the Americans against Iraq, Afghanistan and other regions, we found ourselves in an era of ever-increasing crises and the prospect of even talking about nuclear disarmament could barely be dreamed or hoped of.
Now there is a unique opportunity.
I do not know how long this window of opportunity will remain open, but it is our duty to give future generations a peaceful world to live in.
The preconditions to success in the areas which Commissioner Rehn has just referred to include not accepting double standards within the EU.
That means that, as Europeans, we too have a duty to get nuclear disarmament moving again.
May I remind you of our debate in December last year, when Javier Solana was here and we discussed revising the security strategy.
He named as one major danger - and this was shared in this House - the danger of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
That is why I appeal to you once again.
Look again at the three amendments which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have proposed in order to set a disarmament and control process in motion, to make available instruments such as a Nuclear Weapons Convention to supplement the NPT.
Re-consider whether you cannot vote for them, because if the PPE amendment is adopted, it will not be possible for my group to vote for this report.
To close, I should like to thank the international organisations such as Mayors for Peace, the IPPNW and the ICAN.
ICAN was there long before Obama as an international campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons.
