draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, women and girls with disabilities experience multiple discrimination and disability has very clear gender-specific dimensions.
We must make disabled women and girls more visible and, above all, we must ensure that they are given greater consideration at EU level.
The European Parliament made very important points clear to me in the resolution on the situation of women with disabilities adopted in 2007.
The specific situation of women and girls must also be given full consideration when implementing the UN Convention.
Regrettably, so far only 4 EU Member States have ratified the Convention and the Protocol.
We need gender mainstreaming in EU policies on people with disabilities, especially for access to work and integration in the workplace.
Education, anti-discrimination and the right to work must be secured.
The main problem is violence and we must very clearly show it a red card.
Women and girls with disabilities are at very great risk of violence, including sexual violence, both within and outside the home.
Often their right to sexuality and maternity is restricted or there are forced abortions and sterilisations.
The Member States should therefore pass legislation to protect them from violence and give better support to victims.
