on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, with the Convention, the right to protection and recognition of their human dignity and to full participation in society has been secured internationally for disabled persons.
It is now all the more important for the Council to submit the ratification act to the UN no later than this year's International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
At the same time, we call on all the Member States to ratify the Optional Protocol, so that the UN Convention acquires an international complaints committee.
I can only tell you how important this is with reference to my country.
Until now, disabled persons have been refused equal access to education.
Only 15% of disabled children are integrated into the school system.
Claims to access for disabled persons are circumvented in my country with translation tricks.
That is why we must protest against the fact that this sort of thing is still happening and safeguard full social participation for disabled persons in all the EU Member States in future.
