on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I have a few words of warning to say about this compromise, which was achieved very quickly - astonishingly quickly, in fact.
We have leapt forward so quickly that we could have adopted this directive tonight practically without debate.
That must be one of the reasons why so few Members are planning to speak.
I would like to warn that we are extending the scope of this directive at a point in time where we have hardly any experience of how transposal of the current directive has gone.
I would also like to remind everyone that we have debated the scope in Parliament, and this House wanted to extend it to cover all products.
I think that would be the wrong way to go.
It is neither acceptable nor sensible to subject every product produced in the EU to an environmental compliance assessment, and it is regrettable - at least as far as I can see - that this is being included in the text as an option for 2012.
I would like to warn that we need to beware that the European Commission does not become a product planning authority.
Politicians and administrators do not know better, including after the experiences of the financial and economic crisis, how products should be produced and what engineers can perhaps do better.
In closing, I would also like to remind everyone that the growing complexity of this product legislation overwhelms small and medium-sized enterprises.
Many of these requirements can hardly be met by these enterprises as it is, and what we are doing today will saddle them with further burdens, the practical consequences of which I have the feeling we have not sufficiently thought out.
