Madam President, with regard to the planning of the sitting, I would like to mention that we had a very long voting session yesterday and that led to a lot of problems with subsequent appointments.
We will be adjourning very shortly today and we will not start the voting until 12 noon.
Perhaps it would be possible to plan the sitting so as to divide the time up more efficiently.
That would help the Members and, in particular, the visitors, who yesterday had to wait for us for a considerable length of time.
These are, of course, citizens, who also have a right to talk to their Members, and in this regard I would be very pleased if, in future, in the planning of the sitting we could schedule such procedures to everyone's satisfaction.
