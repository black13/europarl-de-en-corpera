Madam President, I wanted to speak because these cross border payments are very advantageous and indicate that, through a positive solution and the elimination of further barriers, the European Union is consciously relating to citizens and is establishing regulations that will make things easier for them in their day to day lives.
I am firmly convinced about this report and am therefore positive that we have taken a significant step forwards here in facilitating activities within the European Union.
I hope that this will set a precedent for other areas.
