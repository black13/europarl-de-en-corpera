in writing. - The Regulation concerning statistics on plant protection products is part of the review of European plant protection products policy, of which the Approval Regulation and the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, which were successfully adopted at the beginning of the year, also form part.
The objective is to reduce the negative effects of plant protection products as much as possible by reducing the risks.
In order to measure this we need indicators and in order to develop these indicators we need reliable data, determined by statistics, which ensure comparability between Member States.
That is why I voted in favour of the report.
However, we must not forget that only those who market the products in accordance with the regulations will provide data.
Up-to-date reports on the Europe-wide illegal trade in pesticides indicate that this needs to be brought more firmly into our sights.
The same applies to the importing of products from third countries.
We need to step up our controls in this regard.
Our stringent European approval procedure guarantees the comprehensive protection of people and the environment.
Anyone who sells or uses plant protection products without approval and anyone who does not adequately check residue limits not only creates avoidable risks, but also brings the manufacturer of the product and the agricultural industry into disrepute.
Existing law provides a sufficient level of protection in this regard.
However, it must be complied with and monitored.
