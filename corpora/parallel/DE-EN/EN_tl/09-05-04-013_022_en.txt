on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I find this line of argument beyond belief.
It is not a question of ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon here today.
We only want to be prepared for when it is ratified.
If it is not, then everything we have decided will be wasted.
However, if it is ratified - and this would then take place in October - this Parliament will have to work differently from November onwards.
It would be really irresponsible of us not to be prepared.
That is why this debate is necessary and why a decision must be taken.
Furthermore, Mrs McDonald, I find it especially unfair to your colleague Mrs Kaufmann, who is unfortunately leaving this Parliament, that you have not even given her the chance, at the end of her time here, to see such an important report adopted in the European Parliament.
On behalf of your colleague Mrs Kaufmann, I must disagree with you.
(Applause)
