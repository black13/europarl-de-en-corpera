Mr President, last week, Slovenia stepped up its opposition to Croatia's accession.
I would like to describe this conflict in clear terms, as this behaviour seems to me to be inappropriate and unworthy of a Member State of the European Union.
Croatia is a candidate country, waiting to join the European Union, and has shown a strong willingness to implement reforms.
Although not all of the criteria have been met, the direction being taken is clear.
Slovenia must stop behaving in a petty manner, so that a solution may quickly be found.
The Treaty of Lisbon and the enlargement process will allow the European Union to develop further, and Croatia will become a Member State!
