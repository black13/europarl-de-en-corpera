Thank you very much, Mr Pannella.
Your words do not contradict what I said.
I am satisfied that between 1996 and 1999 you were absent from the European Parliament.
You were elected, as you stated, and that does not contradict what I said.
I would like to explicitly assure you of my respect for your activities and your work in the European Parliament.
