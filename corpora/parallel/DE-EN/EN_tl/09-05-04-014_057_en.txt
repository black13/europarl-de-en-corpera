Thank you, Mrs Gill.
This is also the last time that I will preside over the one-minute speeches.
I have always tried to allow as many people to speak as possible.
We have often been able to get through the entire list - as we were indeed able to do this evening - for it is one of the privileges of the MEPs to be able to speak, and Monday evenings always provide an opportunity to do so.
Therefore, I would also like to thank you sincerely for what you have told us.
That concludes this item.
