Mr President, Commissioner, I would be interested to know whether there are any statistics available on face masks.
How many masks are available in Europe, and what quantities could be produced in the event of an outbreak of this kind of disease?
The same goes for the medication available, of course.
Is there an overview of how much medication is currently stored in Europe and how much could be produced in the event of an outbreak?
Do you think that it would be possible to also provide information for doctors in the 23 languages of the European Union, so that information could be provided rapidly and efficiently?
