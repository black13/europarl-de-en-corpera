Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being here and for getting here so quickly.
If we compare this situation with the case of avian influenza, then - even as an impatient MEP - I am very satisfied with the way in which the European Union, the WHO, and also the Member States themselves, have responded.
Certain Members have said that there is insufficient information.
In Germany, I feel that I have been provided with sufficient information on how I should behave.
I also do not wish to always make Europe responsible for everything.
It is the Member States that are responsible for providing this information.
We should also take this opportunity to remind them that they need to fulfil their duty to provide information.
I have also heard, on a number of occasions, that there are still certain shortcomings, particularly relating to the stockpiling of vaccines.
I would be interested to know whether this is really the case, whether the Member States really do not want to share vaccines and whether they are only storing them for use on their territory, or whether they have agreed to share the vaccines.
Then we would be at the same stage as the Commission is now.
I would like to express my thanks for this rapid and excellent work.
Congratulations!
