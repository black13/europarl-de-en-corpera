Mr President, the Member States are clearly responsible for legislation in the field of healthcare.
Europe has laid down minimum standards for maternity leave.
We have varied legislation in the Member States, which cannot be compared.
In certain countries, maternity leave is paid out of tax revenue.
In others, as is the case in Germany, it is paid through health insurance companies, and enterprises bear the main share of the costs.
Both the length of, and the financial support for, maternity leave vary.
In all cases, however, the mother is assured protection in case of illness, even after the maternity leave has ended.
You are confusing two issues here: maternity leave and parental leave are two different things - as you pointed out, Commissioner Å pidla.
What I would like to know is whether, in Germany, for example, the combined total of maternity leave and parental leave would meet the requirements of the new directive?
The extension of maternity leave, which focuses on the health of the mother, is not always an advantage for women.
Companies will employ fewer women, as men do not take maternity leave.
Moreover, stricter legal protection against dismissal does not help in the search for a new job.
We also have to ensure that women are able to find employment and work on equal terms.
In this respect, companies are called on to help to ensure a family-friendly working environment.
