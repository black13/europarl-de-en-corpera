Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to state on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that it is not in the interests of European workers that the conciliation procedure on new working time legislation has failed and that the old working time legislation continues to apply.
I would also like to say that it is a myth that this is purely the fault of the Council, while the majority of those in Parliament, like knights in shining armour, have sacrificed themselves in the interests of the workers.
The reality is that both parties are at fault.
In is true that the Council did not move an inch on the question of the opt-out, but the majority in Parliament was equally inflexible in insisting that a solution was only possible if the opt-out was abolished.
As a result, both parties passed like ships in the night and the result was easy to predict.
This is a lost opportunity.
For example, it would have been possible to put in place a European on-call time regulation which specified for the whole of Europe that 'on-call time is working time', as the Court of Justice of the European Communities has laid down.
In order to achieve this it would have been necessary for the majority in Parliament to have moved a very small distance on the question of the opt-out, for example when it was a case of determining the conditions under which an opt-out is possible, which should be as strict as possible, and who takes the decision about the opt-out.
The two sides of industry should have been involved.
However, none of this happened.
The insistence on the removal of the opt-out at all costs became a sacred cow.
This was the other side of the irreconcilable behaviour which resulted in the failure of the new solution.
This is a very regrettable situation.
As I have said, it is not in the interests of the workers.
