on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Å pidla, at election time we would have liked to have been able to present the citizens of Europe with a Working Time Directive which offered minimum health and safety standards.
This would have been our contribution to the concept of improving the quality of work.
Our resolution would have set minimum standards and, at the same time, would have offered a degree of flexibility which would have represented a solution for hospitals.
However, the Council has blocked this over a number of weeks and it has finally failed.
Unfortunately, the Commission is also partly responsible in this case, because it has not contributed to the process of finding a solution.
The Commission proposals have ridden roughshod over labour law and called into question something which would generally have been regarded as a legal minimum standard.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, together with a large majority of the Conciliation Committee, were not prepared to vote in favour of legalised exploitation.
It is well-known that the German Labour Minister and social democrat, Olaf Scholz, was one of the hard core of objectors in the Council.
In all seriousness, he wanted to introduce exceptions to a long-term solution which would allow people to work up to 78 hours per week.
In Germany he claims to be the representative of the workers, while in Brussels he acts as the spokesperson for those members of the Council who are opposed to the interests of European workers.
He has stabbed the Social Democrats in the back.
