Madam President, I have asked to make few more brief remarks because I believe that it is necessary.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Sedláček, has told us that the Council accepted the proposal at the beginning of last week.
I must state quite clearly that the information which we were given in the trialogue was quite different.
We received the information that the Commission proposal would not be accepted, that there would be no possibility of an opt-out during the trial period and that the period of six months would not be accepted.
It was also made clear that on-call time would not be regarded as a necessary continuation of working time.
We were also told exactly what has been said here, that there was a willingness to toe the line.
This was not the position of Parliament.
I would like to make it clear that we did receive this information.
The problem may be that you came later, not until after midnight, but we did receive this information.
Secondly, Mr Bushill-Matthews gave the impression that the negotiations were biased and one-sided.
I would like to explain one thing.
The negotiating delegation consisted of the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, the chairman of the Committee, the shadow rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda, from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and myself.
We were in agreement on every single case.
The guidelines in this House ensure that my group does not have the majority in the delegation to the Conciliation Committee.
The results were quite clear: 15 votes in favour, none against and five abstentions.
The debate today has quite clearly demonstrated that a broad majority of Parliament supports this position.
I would not like anyone to go away with this impression of bias.
