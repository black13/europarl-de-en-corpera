on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, the concern throughout the world and all the measures currently being taken to combat swine flu, like those taken a few years ago against bird flu and BSE, are completely out of proportion to the lack of consideration given to the much higher number of deaths on the roads.
Forty thousand people die every year on the roads of the European Union.
Large numbers of people are injured or permanently disabled.
All of this is simply accepted, as if it were an act of God.
Everyone knows that a disproportionate number of lorries is involved in serious road accidents.
The main causes are speed, overtiredness and alcohol.
This directive is a move towards ensuring that drivers do not become overtired.
Not only driving times, which are monitored using the tachograph, but also loading and unloading times should now be considered as working time for everyone.
This is the right solution.
If a driver has been working for several hours before he climbs behind the steering wheel of a 40-tonne truck, he is already tired and will find it difficult to concentrate.
For me it is completely incomprehensible that this regulation should only apply to drivers who are employed by others and are not self-employed.
The only excuse is that it is more difficult to monitor the working time of self-employed people.
This may be true, but does a self-employed driver present a smaller risk behind the steering wheel when he is overtired?
