Madam President, I also welcome the agreement on behalf of our group and we will vote in favour of it tomorrow.
We are meeting the wishes of the many citizens who have asked us in countless letters and e-mails to take action in this area.
We are, of course, also following Parliament's written statement which clearly demanded the ban.
I am rather surprised by the previous speaker from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I would be interested to know whether she really was speaking on behalf of the committee or only on her own behalf.
In any case, I would like to state quite clearly that there definitely is a legal basis for this.
For example, there is a ban on the trade in dog and cat skins, which came into force at the beginning of this year.
This makes it very clear that there is a legal foundation for what we are doing.
In addition, we already have a distinct distortion of the internal market, because at least five Member States have already implemented a ban and others are planning to do so.
This is why the European Union must act in order to follow up on this distortion of the internal market.
There are foundations for our actions.
There are legal foundations for our actions and internal market foundations for our actions.
Once again I would like to emphasise this very clearly.
As far as the exceptions are concerned, I would also like to say clearly that the markets for the Inuits collapsed some years ago.
The Inuits explained this during the consultation.
We invited them to speak before the committee and they explicitly said that the markets had already collapsed before we took action.
If the Inuits want to continue selling these products, then they can only do this if it is quite clear that the products have nothing to do with the usual method of hunting seals.
Only if a clear distinction is made will the Inuits have the opportunity to sell anything.
