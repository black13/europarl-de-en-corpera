Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only recommend that my fellow Member does not stand for this Parliament again; then he will have done his job well.
I would like to offer Commissioner Reding and also the Czech Presidency my sincere thanks, because together with our rapporteurs they have once again taken a great step for the citizens of Europe.
The concept of the internal market offers citizens great progress in the area of telecommunications in particular, as well as in all areas where we were previously confronted with monopolies.
In addition, we have already seen with the roaming regulation that there can be great savings here for households, and citizens are protected.
In particular, market access for small and medium-sized enterprises is quite an important prerequisite for ensuring that a good service is being offered, that network neutrality is implemented and that we of course authorise the independent regulatory authorities in the Member States to represent their industry and their enterprises, but also their consumers in other European countries.
The enforcement of the rights of citizens of one nation in another Member State is of particular significance to small and medium-sized enterprises, and we should ensure that in future broadband continues to be used for the benefit of the population and prices drop, because with the very dynamic development of broadband services and the Internet that is currently taking place, especially in the area of telephony, we have completely new possibilities for the use of broadband.
For that reason I am also grateful that the GSM 900 frequency band is also at the disposal of UMTS and that, for the first time, some thought has been given to the fourth generation network, which will hopefully receive the continued support of the Commission, so that we have comprehensive support for the provision of broadband, especially in rural areas.
Consumer protection is also regulated quite excellently in this legislation: the fact that the courts are working to ensure that the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights is applied accordingly, is great progress, so that we have a great chance in this area, with the allocation of frequency bands, to also take advantage of unrestricted and unimpeded use of the Internet, while at the same time we have the assurance that courts will decide if there are to be restrictions.
