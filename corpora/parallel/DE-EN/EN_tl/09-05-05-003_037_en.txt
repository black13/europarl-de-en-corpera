Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would of course firstly like to offer all the participants my sincere thanks for the significant work they have done.
I know that the committee and in particular Mrs Trautmann have shown much commitment, to achieve two goals: on the one hand to create a basis for modernisation, for the continued technical revolution in Europe in terms of the creation of new jobs, and also in terms of the competitiveness of our continent - thus also making an important contribution to Lisbon - and on the other hand, to protect consumer rights, which have already been mentioned here several times.
I think that both goals have been successfully achieved.
The release in the future of certain frequency bands, when we migrate to the digital system, will create more possibilities and more innovation.
This will also make an important contribution to an innovative society, and we are grateful for that.
Of course, there are also a few delicate matters.
As one who frequently uses the Internet, writes blogs and is active on Facebook and Twitter, I know that there are quite a few problems here.
Nevertheless, I am utterly convinced that we should not intervene without a judicial decision.
It would not only be wrong in principal, it would also give out the wrong signal, especially to our young people, who are constantly surfing the web and use these modern means of communication very heavily.
I am therefore very pleased that, among other things, it has also been indicated clearly in the recitals that, on the one hand, we are of course not prepared to accept criminal activity, but on the other hand we are also not prepared to allow intervention without the verdict of a judge, without a legal basis.
In my view, this is an essential principle which must be observed.
I am very grateful to my colleague Mrs Trautmann and all the others for persevering in this matter and ensuring a clear line.
