Madam President, I would like to say that today's debate has been dominated by the following question: how can we strike a balance between freedom on the internet, free access, copyright protection and observance of fundamental rights?
This is indeed the magic formula for finding the right balance here.
I would like to stress that this is not about the arbitrary blocking of the Internet.
We cannot have YouTube being shut down, as it was in Turkey, because there had apparently been insults to Atat√ºrk.
We do not want the sort of situation there is in China.
Of course, websites cannot be closed at random for political reasons.
However, I would like to say clearly that citizens cannot have an unlimited right to unrestricted illegal downloading!
This is not a point that can be negotiated here.
However, we must ensure - and this is the balance we are looking for and have yet to find - that producers of creative content, whose works appear on the Internet, can be fairly compensated.
We need a new model for this.
It is not the French model.
We want a judicial reservation, a judicial decision on fundamental rights.
However, we have still to find this new social contract in the knowledge society between copyright and the protection of fundamental rights.
