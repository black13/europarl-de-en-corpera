Madam President.
I think you feel uneasy here today, Commissioner, and I think I know why.
The reason is the Commission is taking a position which is more an industry lobby position than one which simplifies consumer protection and environmental protection in Europe.
I have followed labelling legislation for the last 15 years.
What is in the labelling directive from the beginning of the 1990s?
It states that A to G should be regularly updated in line with the state of the art, so that only the best are in the A category.
What has industry done?
It obstructed the updating at the end of the 1990s.
Consequently, at the beginning of 2000 more than 50% of all appliances were in category A. Then they came up with the gimmick of A+ and A++.
Now they have come up with the gimmick of A-20, A-40 and A-60.
Mr Reul is always on the side of the industry lobby.
I am therefore hardly surprised that he is defending this.
Come on Commissioner, please!
A to G is easy to understand.
Fifteen years of shameless lobbying by various industry circles to undermine the European labelling system, that is what is going on here.
Tomorrow, we, Parliament, must put an end to this terrible episode.
