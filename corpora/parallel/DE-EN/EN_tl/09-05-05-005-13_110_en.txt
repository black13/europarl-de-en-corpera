What I was about to say was that this is the last vote with me in the chair.
I would like to say a special word of thanks to Paul Dunstan to my left, who has done his job so splendidly over the years.
(Loud applause)
Paul, I would like to tell you, together we have made few mistakes - sometimes I have made them, sometimes you.
However, we were an unbeatable team.
I give you my sincere thanks.
