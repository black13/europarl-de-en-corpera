During the debate in the Committee on Transport I introduced two amendments, which affect all transport employees.
In my view it is an advantage for a harmonised social and employment policy in Europe that working conditions affect all employees equally.
The idea of including self-employed people in the working time directive is unrealistic.
It is simply impossible to control the working hours of self-employed people.
As far as safety is concerned, all drivers, including those who are self-employed, are subject to the rules on driving time and rest periods in buses and lorries over 3.5 tonnes.
Broadening the driving and rest period rules to include drivers in lorries under 3.5 tonnes would do more for safety.
The Commission should review this, but has yet to introduce a proposal.
I hope that the new Parliament will take up these proposals.
