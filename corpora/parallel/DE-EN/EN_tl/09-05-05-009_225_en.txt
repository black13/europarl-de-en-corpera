Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, the June summit will have to deal with the Treaty of Lisbon again - hopefully for the last time before it enters into force.
Mr Vondra, I wish you all the best tomorrow in the Czech Senate, I hope it goes well and then we will only have the referendum in Ireland to come.
Then you would have to negotiate the package of guarantees with Ireland.
Of course, we then have to fulfil the expectations of the Irish population and the Irish Government.
However, we must be careful not to create new hurdles for all the other Member States, for example, if one of these guarantees were then to have to be ratified once more in all states.
Perhaps you can add something about how this package is being prepared for June.
Secondly, President of the Commission, we are of course interested in the election of the new President of the Commission.
We, the European Parliament, would like an agreement with the Council on the procedure for June/July.
We would like consultation, as established for the future in the Treaty of Lisbon.
President-in-Office of the Council, could you also say something about this?
