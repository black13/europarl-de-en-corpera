Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have touched a raw nerve with their reports and have made it clear how essential joint action by the Member States and the European Union is to ensure that the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis are not borne by those who are worst affected by it, namely, those on the bottom rungs of society's ladder.
I am therefore also extremely disappointed that the socalled Employment Summit on 7 May is actually nothing more than a farce and it should be extremely embarrassing to all of us who bear responsibility in the European Union that this summit is going under such a name.
In my opinion it shows clearly that current policies still do not reflect the fact that we can only fight the economic and financial crisis if at the same time we also fight poverty, social exclusion, job losses and the ubiquitous fall in labour standards.
The Commission recently presented dramatic figures for employment development and the employment situation both in the European Union and the euro zone.
It is time for consistent action here!
It must be about finally putting a stop to the privatisation of public services - security systems like old-age provisions.
I still do not understand why, at the March Summit, the Commission and the Council were still urging Member States to further privatise pension systems and create pension funds.
This is completely counterproductive - more and more people sink into poverty as a result and it exacerbates the problem of old-age poverty.
We need anti-poverty social security systems, we need a social pact for Europe, as European trade unions have demanded.
The fight against poverty could be a truly humanitarian way to start fighting the economic and financial crisis globally and the European Union is duty bound to do this.
