Madam President, the European social models face great challenges.
In particular against the backdrop of the current financial crisis, measures at European level must be coordinated.
I would therefore also like to thank the rapporteurs very much for their excellent work.
Not only must we take immediate measures to regulate the financial market, we must also coordinate sociopolitical measures and create a social framework.
Here we should also bear in mind the competences of the Member States.
I am in favour of giving priority to creating and boosting employment at this time of crisis and also of pressing ahead with the realisation of the flexicurity principle.
However, I refuse to accept the demand for the introduction of minimum wages in all Member States, as called for in paragraph 14 of the report by Mr Silva Peneda, whom I would otherwise like to thank for his work.
This demand, which relates to a decision that should be left to the sole discretion of Member States, infringes the principle of subsidiarity.
Labour market regulations and systems vary greatly from one Member State to another.
In my opinion, every person must be guaranteed sufficient income to be able to lead a decent life.
This can be achieved through a minimum income with the help of additional state social benefits.
What level would the minimum wage be pegged at?
At the Romanian level perhaps?
There it is around EUR 72 a month.
I particularly support the idea that we must secure a basic income for everyone, but I refer back to Member States' competences for establishing appropriate limits.
I declare myself in favour of a social Europe.
Europe must create a social framework, but at the same time consider the powers of the Member States.
