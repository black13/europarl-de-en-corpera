Madam President, Commissioner, in principle I am against the introduction of new taxes.
They affect, above all, the middle class.
They affect wealth creation and do not stimulate investment.
However, we must consider taxes in conjunction with short-term stock profits.
Do you envisage that taxes on short-term stock profits gained from naked short selling will be earmarked for the creation of new jobs?
