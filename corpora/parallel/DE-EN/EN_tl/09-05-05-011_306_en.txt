Madam President, Commissioner, connected to the fault line through the Apennines, there is another fault line which crosses Slovenia.
As you perhaps know, the Krško nuclear power plant is situated on this fault line.
On our initiative several warning devices have been installed there.
What measures do you plan to take, following this devastating earthquake in Italy, to guarantee the security of the Krško nuclear power plant, which stands on a fault line connected to this.
Do you think that you might take precautionary measures, which might go so far as closing Krško?
