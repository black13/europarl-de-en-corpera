Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your very good and detailed answer and also for your excellent work on these two important projects which cross in Munich.
I have just two brief supplementary questions:
Firstly, there is a rumour regarding the Brenner Base Tunnel, that it might be reduced to passenger transport.
Can you rule this out?
Secondly, in Austria and in Stuttgart a great deal is being done for the main route from Strasbourg to Vienna and Budapest.
However, we have the problem of the Munich bypass, the Munich airport link and the stretch from Munich to Mühldorf, Freilassing and Salzburg, so the Chemical Triangle and the stretch via Mühldorf.
I would like to draw your attention to this in particular, as progress here is still very slow.
