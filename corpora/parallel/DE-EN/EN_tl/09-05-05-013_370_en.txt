Madam President, Commissioner, I am delighted to see you here again today.
In all my years of political activity - both in Austria and in almost 15 years in the European Parliament - debates on wine have always been very emotional ones.
We can see that again here today.
In my opinion, wine is one of the most elegant products that agriculture can produce.
It is in the interests of quality production by European - and especially Austrian - wine-growers, that priority be given to the quality and the distinctiveness of wine from different regions.
We believe that mixing wines is not an oenological procedure.
Rosé wine is produced through a special, very traditional oenological procedure.
Therefore, Commissioner, I support all my fellow Members who, like I, reject this mixing or blending of white with red wine.
It is time there was a clear definition for the production of traditional rosé wines.
Commissioner, it must also be possible, as you have mentioned, for Member States to gain knowledge, so that they then see some decisions differently or amend them.
I urge you to do this for the sake of the quality of European wine production.
