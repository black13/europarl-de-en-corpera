Madam President, Commissioner, in recent years you have seen how sensitive a product wine is.
Here today we are mainly putting the case for the liberalisation of the wine market regulations.
You talk about opening up to the world market.
I sometimes wonder, who is guiding whom here?
Traditionally our wine-making has evolved in Europe.
Our traditions and our regional identity are what characterises our wine, and that should also guide us in the deliberations we are now having on the wine market regulations.
I was struck by the fact that here things have been incorporated into the wine market regulations through Committee, things which we have not debated at all in Parliament!
The question, Commissioner, is what national and regional regulation options still exist?
What restrictions or bans can Member States impose for their regions involved in making the lowest grade of wine?
That is what this is about, we are not talking about wines of origin and home wines, but about the lowest grade of wines.
For example, would the ban on blending red and white wine be a regional or national ban?
Would that be possible in future for these low-grade wines?
Or a ban on the indication of grape variety and vintage: this also causes us problems, as we want to be able to differentiate our wines, the lower wines from those described as home wines or wines of origin.
So French Ros√© or German Riesling, those are names which need a clear, unambiguous regulation.
They are linked to our traditional producers and we set great store by this for the future.
Therefore, we ask for your support.
