Mr President, I would like to respond to what Mr Lagendijk has said.
We too of course see the positive diplomatic role Turkey can play in relation to Armenia and in relation to the Middle East.
However, diplomacy and democracy are two different things.
We are particularly concerned by Prime Minister Erdoğan's action against Ahmed Doğan's publishing group.
Even Der Spiegel, which has nothing to do with either Doğan or Springer, writes of Erdoğan's private vendetta against Doğan.
I have already mentioned the Commission's progress report.
Once again I would like to ask the Commission a specific question.
Is the Commission more or less concerned about freedom of opinion and of the press in Turkey than it was at the time the progress report was published?
If no, why is it no longer concerned?
If yes, what specific measures does the Commission intend to take?
How important is the subject of freedom of the press and of opinion in relation to the ongoing accession negotiations?
As I said, this is after all about the first Copenhagen criterion, the political criterion.
