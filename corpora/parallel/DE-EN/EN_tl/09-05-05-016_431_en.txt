Mr President, to reform the European Union is difficult, but to reform the European Parliament is even more difficult, as we have seen in the debate on the revision of the Rules of Procedure and the work of our fellow Member Richard Corbett.
I would like to thank Mr Corbett for the truly enormous commitment he has shown, to bring the many different interests under one umbrella and to carry this revision of our Rules of Procedure through to the plenum.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will support this report.
We are waiting for the Treaty of Lisbon; then Parliament will have more legislative powers and we must get ready to place legislating at the heart of our work.
Initiative reports will have to take second place; legislation needs to come first.
We must also be more robust in our work around the world.
Journeys by parliamentary delegations to different countries, to different parts of the world must be linked to Parliament's technical committees.
If a delegation is dealing with a subject like climate change or social protection, experts from the relevant technical committee should be on board as well.
I welcome the fact that we are making our debates more attractive: in future it is not the red card, but the blue card that will bring more dynamism.
This is excellent.
Cooperation between committees, these joint committees, that is a test run, because the previous practice was unsatisfactory.
Let us be honest, the advising committee had almost no chance.
In this respect, the trial with joint sittings by two committees is a new attempt to devise something better.
This reform is essential.
It is also good that we are doing it before the elections and not postponing it until the next legislative period.
I would once more like to thank Mr Corbett and all those who participated.
