Mr President, Mr Onesta said that his report is not revolutionary, but it is however an important reform, which strengthens the rights of citizens as well as the Committee on Petitions.
The right to petition is a right accorded to citizens and a few improvements will be made, which will also encourage citizens to address questions to Parliament.
I also think it is right that when it comes to the admissibility of a petition, it is not the chairman of the committee who should decide.
Although I myself am chairman of a committee, I agree that if a quarter of the members think a subject should be discussed, then it must be discussed.
I would like to correct something Mr Onesta said: the European citizens' initiative is not a petition - that is an aliud.
It is actually a European popular petition, a different sort of right.
It is not addressed to Parliament but to the Commission and we should not confuse them.
The representatives of civil society have set great store by this.
This will probably be the last report that Mr Onesta will make here in Parliament.
I would like to thank him most sincerely for his work, which in many respects has been excellent, both as Vice-President and as a member of our committee.
I should also mention Agora, Parliament's forum with civil society, which is making history and is a really important instrument.
We therefore support the Onesta report and would like to thank you once more for your constructive cooperation.
(Applause)
