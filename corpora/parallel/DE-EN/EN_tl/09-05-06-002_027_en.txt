Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Mrs Stavreva for her excellent report.
It is absolutely crucial that this economic programme, which we have adopted in its entirety today, is also available in rural areas.
Broadband is an indispensable means of communication for rural areas, especially in Austria, for new and modern jobs and for rapid information delivery.
It should not be overlooked that more than 50% of the population of the European Union lives in rural areas.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am coming to the end of my political career.
I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to all my colleagues, the Commission and all the institutions of the European Union, especially officials and staff, for their help and support.
It has been a pleasure to work with you all.
Finally I would like to thank the interpreters who had to interpret my Austrian German.
I am convinced that it must continue to be absolutely clear that the common agricultural policy, with its two pillars, is essential for the society of the European Union.
Farmers are naturally aware of their responsibility towards society.
But I also expect the society of the European Union to be aware of its responsibility towards all those who safeguard its resources.
With this in mind, I wish the European Union all the best for the future.
(Applause)
