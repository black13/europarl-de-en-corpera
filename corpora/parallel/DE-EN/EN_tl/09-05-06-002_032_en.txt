Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true to say that the European Union is trying to make its own contribution in this major financial and economic crisis.
It is also true to say that, with regard to promoting broadband in rural areas, it should be entitled to make a real contribution to ensuring that the digital segregation of society is overcome and that more people have the opportunity to take part in it and to strengthen internal cohesion in the European Union.
However, as a budgetary politician, I would like to point out that, although the announcement of such a programme will have public impact, it is not clear where the money will actually come from.
It is, to some extent, dubious.
I cannot endorse it, and if the Council takes such decisions, and if the Commission, through Mr Barroso, comes up with something like that, one must seriously ensure that it is clear where the money is coming from.
That is the only really convincing form of politics that we can present to our citizens.
At the moment the money is unfortunately not there.
Member States must once again take a stand so that we can really make it clear that this is a contribution to a better structural policy and to more solidarity in Europe.
Then we must make a joint contribution so that it can actually become a reality.
