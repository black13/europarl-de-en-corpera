Madam President, although the European Union has introduced subsidies for rural development, at the same time the rural depopulation caused by the conditions imposed by Maastricht has encouraged unbridled enthusiasm for liberalisation and the accompanying dismantling of rural infrastructures.
Following the demise of Chrysler and the closing of police stations and schools, thanks to deregulation decreed by the EU the post offices will also soon be closing.
The Commission is quite clearly planning to administer further euthanasia.
Should the eligibility criteria of below average economic power and rural depopulation cease to apply from 2014 this could be the kiss of death for many disadvantaged areas.
This, in my opinion, is an assault on all rural areas, which we should not let pass.
We need equivalent living conditions in towns and cities and in the country.
Otherwise not only individual areas but also entire valleys in Europe will soon be deserted.
Cutting subsidies is certainly the wrong approach if we wish to safeguard vital rural areas and lower middleclass structures.
However, rural areas cannot be kept alive through agricultural subsidies alone.
The demise of farming in recent years shows this more clearly than ever.
Subsidies for disadvantaged areas must not be cut but increased.
Small, medium-sized and organic farms must survive and food sovereignty should be maintained.
If the EU cannot soon be dissuaded from promoting primarily intensive stock-rearing and large landowners - like the British Queen for example - then it is high time that agriculture was renationalised or, at the very least, party renationalised.
