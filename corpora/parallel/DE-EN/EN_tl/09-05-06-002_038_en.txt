Madam President, Commissioners, this Economic Recovery Plan is no masterpiece.
Above all, there is not much left over for rural areas.
It also entails a transfer of funds from the agricultural budget to rural development.
Commissioner, it does not lead to independent rural development for rural areas but once again follows a balancing logic.
Above all, it is left to the discretion of the Member States to create compensation programmes.
In Germany, this affects the milk fund.
A loss of 15 cents per kilo of milk means a shortfall of EUR 4.2 billion for German milk farmers alone.
Now, a compensation is to be created with EUR 100 million.
Commissioner, let me be clear about this.
This is just peanuts, not an economic recovery plan!
