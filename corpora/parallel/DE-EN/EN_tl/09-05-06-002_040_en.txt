Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are less than two hours away from the final decision on the European Economic Recovery Plan.
It has taken us five months - needless to say because of sophistry in the Council - five months to come to a decision on the package now before us.
Had we taken the title of this package at all seriously, we would have had to be much quicker.
The package in itself is fine; there is no question about that.
However, I very much doubt whether it can really bring about Europe's economic recovery in the current crisis.
Can the designated money flow into the designated projects within the designated time?
It is a good thing that the Members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy also had their doubts and negotiated a declaration from the Commission not to put leftovers into energy efficiency.
There is a chance therefore that the EUR 2.6 billion to be decided on will be used reasonably.
But will we also manage to agree on the EUR 2.4 billion deficit in the EUR 5 billion Recovery Plan with the Council in the autumn?
EUR 5 billion over two years are an expression of European solidarity.
That is all well and good.
However, more effective help for the entire European economy comes from a common regional and structural political framework: EUR 38 billion - this year alone!
These resources are the driving force behind the European economy.
