- Madam President, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the 'peanuts' have meant that, in my small village of 450 inhabitants, it has been full steam ahead with work on bridging the broadband gap.
I believe that, in three to four months' time at the latest, we will have it.
Mrs Stavreva, thank you very much for your report.
It is very good.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have been able to work in this lofty Chamber on the development of agriculture for 15 years, helping to shape it, irrespective of farm size and legal form.
The time has now come for me to do something else.
I would like to thank all my fellow Members, officials, Mr Piebalgs and, in particular, you, Mrs Fischer Boel.
