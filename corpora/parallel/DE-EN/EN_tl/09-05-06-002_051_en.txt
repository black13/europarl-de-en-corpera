- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Commissioner Fischer Boel and Commissioner Piebalgs.
This is a good sign: agriculture and energy side by side, working together.
The same is true of Mr Schierhuber and Mr Karas, Members of Parliament, who are putting themselves on the line, so to speak, for small and medium-sized farms.
This is a good sign.
This debate about the EUR 5 billion shows that we have the right agenda and that we have to strengthen purchasing power in rural areas.
In a time of economic and financial crisis in particular, our challenge is, as a matter of priority, not to send the money we need for energy to the Russia oligarchies and oil magnates, but to keep it in Europe and strengthen rural areas here.
I should like to express my congratulations on this initiative and am particularly pleased that we can adopt it today.
