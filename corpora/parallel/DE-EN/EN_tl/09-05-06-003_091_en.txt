rapporteur. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you for your support and for the signal we are sending to savers, businesses, banks and the world of finance.
The debate was very open.
It also highlighted the weaknesses and the need for further development.
I can tell you that all your wishes, as well as your criticisms and reservations, played a role in the negotiations, that we tried to incorporate them in recitals and in the request for reviews.
There is nothing that was said here today that did not also play a role in the agreement presented - in some cases not a very strong role - but everything played a role.
It is therefore absolutely clear that this is an important step forward, but it is not the final step, because we are announcing, giving notice of and promoting further steps in this agreement and specifying the direction for this debate.
In other words, the debate will continue, it has to continue.
But I believe that it is important that we send a clear signal now, in this legislative period, that we are competent, that we wish to create trust, security and stability, that we can react quickly and that we know what still needs to be done in the future.
I therefore call on you to take this step together and with a big majority.
Thank you very much for the debate.
