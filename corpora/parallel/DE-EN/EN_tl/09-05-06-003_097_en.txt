Madam President, I refer to Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure.
In the sitting of 24 April, in my absence during the vote HansPeter Martin claimed that a vote was illegally cast with a voting card from my seat by an unauthorised person.
The Presidency was able to reject this immediately as incorrect.
I understand that, at present, in the election campaign, many of my fellow Members are becoming nervous.
However, this is tantamount to an accusation of deception, fraud, and unjust enrichment on my part.
It is an accusation of a serious criminal offence.
Mr Martin defames, denounces and maligns Parliament, its Members, even the officials and, especially, his Austrian colleagues time and again in public with distortions, half-truths and untruths, and the extent of what I can tolerate has been exceeded.
I demand the retraction of this accusation, an apology and a condemnation by the Presidency.
(Applause)
