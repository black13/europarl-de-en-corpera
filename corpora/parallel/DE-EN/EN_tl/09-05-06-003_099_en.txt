Madam President, could you please call for silence in the Chamber?
(Laughter)
Or will I be punished through the withdrawal of my daily subsistence allowance if I dare to call out 'referendum'?
I have the right to make a personal comment under Rule 149.
I absolutely reject what my fellow Member has just uttered.
I recall what I actually said in plenary in the absence of many of the right wing extremists and the mob behind me.
I stand by it.
And if I am being accused....
(Protests)
You can hear many other protests here that are so terrible that I do not wish to repeat them in public.
But that is what the right wing extremists are like.
We know that from history and that is the huge danger that lies ahead of us.
As regards the accusation of the unlawfulness of my action, I would just point out that there may have been various attempts to criminalise me, but never any criminal investigations, not because the Austrian judges or public prosecutors were prejudiced but because they saw how unfounded those allegations were.
If the right wing extremists now go on the offensive with such arguments, it is up to the electorate to judge.
(The President cut off the speaker)
