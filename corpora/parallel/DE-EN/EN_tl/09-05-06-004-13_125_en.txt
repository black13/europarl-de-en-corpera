Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - Madam President, the reform of the European Union is difficult enough but the reform of the European Parliament appears to be even more difficult.
However, I must say to Mrs Frassoni that this reform process has now lasted two and a half years.
We had a reform group that Mrs Frassoni herself belonged to.
Our Committee complied with the conclusions of the reform group point by point.
In other words, today we are presenting in plenary something that took two and a half years to discuss, debate and decide.
There is therefore no reason why this point should be referred back to committee.
Today, we should complete this final act and prepare for the new legislative period with many improvements to our work.
I am therefore voting against the motion tabled by Mrs Frassoni.
