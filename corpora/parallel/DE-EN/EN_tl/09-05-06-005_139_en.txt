Thank you, Mr Wurtz.
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of you all I should like to thank Mr Wurtz, who has been a Member since 1979 and will now leave Parliament.
Our thanks also go to three other fellow Members, who have been here since 1979 and will now leave: Klaus HÃ¤nsch, a former President, Ingo Friedrich, former Vice-President and Quaestor, and Karl von Wogau, former Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and currently Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence.
I should like to extend my sincere thanks on behalf of you all to these four and to all other departing fellow Members for their huge commitment.
Thank you very much.
(Loud applause)
