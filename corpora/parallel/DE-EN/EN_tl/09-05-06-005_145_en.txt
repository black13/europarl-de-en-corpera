Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, under your presidency relations between the European Parliament and the Commission have developed very well, not to say smoothly.
It is to your credit that, even during election campaigns when, as is generally known, the potential for conflict is at its greatest, at no time did the normal political debates turn into a crisis among the institutions.
If I may be permitted to make a personal comment, I should like to thank you warmly for your, at all times, friendly and courteous approach to your work.
You not only acted politely but also took corrective action when necessary.
And you were always gentlemanlike.
I should also like to emphasise how important it was for this Parliament and for the entire European Union that you had the courage and the willingness to defend the democratic principles and privileges of this Parliament, even against Heads of State where necessary.
(Applause)
I should also like to congratulate you on 30 years as an elected Member of the European Parliament.
Your personality has very much left its mark on these decades and you have made a significant contribution to shaping the development of Parliament.
President Barroso would very much have liked to come himself but, as you know, he is attending the EU-Canada Summit in Prague.
On behalf of the President of the Commission and the entire Commission I should like to thank you warmly for your successful presidency.
Thank you.
(Applause)
