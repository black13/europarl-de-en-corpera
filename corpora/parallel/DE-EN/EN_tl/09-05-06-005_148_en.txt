Madam President, I have a question on order in the Chamber.
Shortly before we were able to vote, when the sitting was suspended for just a short time, a Member of our honourable House apparently succeeded in smuggling in a parliamentary candidate, having a few cheeky promotional photographs taken with her and, in my view, abusing our Body.
Is it not necessary to hold these candidates to account?
