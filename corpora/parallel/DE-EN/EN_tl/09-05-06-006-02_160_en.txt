on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, on the basis of Rule 154 and Rule 155(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to endorse the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to change the voting order of the amendments and to put Amendments 1 c, p, 2, 5, 6 and 9 to the vote before Compromise Amendment 10.
This also relates, among other things - perhaps there is something else on your voting lists - to the fact that, following the motion adopted by our Group yesterday, Compromise Amendment 10 will no longer be supported by the ALDE Group.
As regards the voting procedure, Rule 154 explains which amendment is to be dealt with first when there are corresponding or conflicting requests.
It is important to us that a court ruling be issued before any intervention in the behaviour of individuals can take place.
That is why we have withdrawn the amendment.
