on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I am not speaking in my capacity as Committee Chairman but as rapporteur for my Group on the Trautmann report.
I urge the House to reject the procedural motion and to allow the voting to take place in the order proposed by you on the voting lists.
Mrs Harms, no one in this House wishes to curtail the right to free Internet access.
We have incorporated this aspect into the compromise, which we discussed with the Czech President-in-Office of the Council over many months.
All political parties were heavily involved in these discussions.
I request that the proposed order be kept and that the change to the voting order now being proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe be rejected.
