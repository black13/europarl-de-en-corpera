in writing. - The European social models are facing major challenges during the current financial crisis.
The German conservative group (CDU/CSU) is therefore speaking out in favour of a social Europe.
For this reason, we endorse Mr Silva Peneda's report on the Renewed Social Agenda.
We also welcome both the fact that job creation and promotion are being accorded priority in this time of crisis and our willingness to press ahead with measures relating to education and training.
Europe must create a social framework and establish standards at a European level.
We must certainly take into account the competences of Member States in that regard.
For this reason, we oppose the blanket call for the introduction of a minimum wage in all the Member States, as originally expressed in paragraph 14 of the report.
The introduction of a minimum wage is a decision which should be left to the sole discretion of Member States.
We are, therefore, pleased that the oral amendment to this paragraph has been adopted.
Sufficient benefits must be ensured to enable every person to lead a dignified life, but different options are available to Member States in this regard.
We have made it clear in our oral amendment that, in addition to the minimum wage, consideration should also be given to collective agreements and generally binding regulations, or a state-guaranteed minimum income.
In this way, we pay due regard to the principle of subsidiarity.
