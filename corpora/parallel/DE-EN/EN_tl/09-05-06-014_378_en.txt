My question concerns the following: Mrs Trautmann was outvoted today here in Parliament with her compromise amendment on the telecommunications package.
This means, therefore, that she has put President Sarkozy in a good position with his 'three strikes - out' solution.
How does the Czech Presidency assess today's vote in Parliament with regard to the European creative artists who want to protect their rights on the Internet?
