Mr President, I congratulate the Czech Presidency on the decision in the Senate.
Nonetheless, I have to say that we in Europe are naturally dissatisfied with many areas of the interplay between the institutions of the European Union and that is why we have negotiated this reform treaty over the last eight months.
Would it perhaps be possible for a debate to be conducted in the Czech Republic regarding what in fact they find troubling about this treaty and what alternatives President Klaus could offer the people of Europe to quell the current dissatisfaction, to which he indeed vociferously refers, and what solutions he would envision?
At present, all that is known is that he wants to prevent the reform but is putting forward no positive proposals.
