Mr President, with President Klaus having damaged the national renown of his country out of sheer egocentricity I too would like to congratulate the Czech Presidency and say that it was a first-class presidency.
I am happy that it has ended with the ratification of the treaty as far as parliamentary procedure is concerned.
