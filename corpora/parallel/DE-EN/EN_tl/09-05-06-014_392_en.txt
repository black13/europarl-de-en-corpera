Many thanks for that very good and very exhaustive reply.
I have three very short supplementary questions:
First, do you believe it is conceivable that the Czech Presidency will open a new chapter with Croatia?
Second, will you name a date for Macedonia this year?
Third, what is the timeframe for relaxing visa restrictions?
