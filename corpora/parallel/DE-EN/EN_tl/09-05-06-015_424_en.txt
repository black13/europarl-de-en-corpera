draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection we also see the enormous advantages of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we would not want to miss out on, notably in the area of consumer protection.
It is very interesting to note that, in the Treaty of Lisbon, consumer protection has become a cross-sectional task, which naturally gives this area much greater strength.
This area is especially important to the citizens of the European Union, as we can show them on a daily basis what the European Union does for them.
The citizens continually ask what the European Union does for them.
That this is now anchored in Article 12 and not in Article one hundred and something is also important as it means that the value of consumer protection has been enhanced a great deal.
I think it is good that we will have the Treaty of Lisbon.
I am very pleased that the Prague Senate has also ratified the Treaty.
This has sent a clear message that we are for this Europe, a social Europe, a Europe of citizens, which we wish to equip for the future.
Thank you for allowing us to demonstrate this once again today.
A special thanks to you, Mrs Kaufmann, for your very good work in the Convention.
You have achieved something very important there.
