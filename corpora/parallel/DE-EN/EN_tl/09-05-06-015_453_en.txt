rapporteur. - Mr President, thank you for giving my this opportunity to make a few comments rather earlier than anticipated.
This debate has shown a high degree of conviction right across the political and national spectrum.
It has also demonstrated the strength of our commitment to take Europe forward.
When I listen to some very critical speakers from Anglo-Saxon countries, I remember that it was precisely from such countries that, over the last few months, a particularly large number of cries for help came to overcome the financial crisis together.
I am sure that these gentlemen will also realise that they represent positions based on the 60-year legacy of Winston Churchill.
We are now entering a very decisive phase.
Following our decisions, which we reached with such broad consensus in the European Parliament and which we found so convincing in Prague, we should not fall into triumphalism.
It will be an important task for us to give the people of Ireland, in all modesty, an opportunity to take their decision, in sovereignty and freedom - a decision that Ireland has to take in sovereign freedom out of responsibility for the entire continent.
I believe that we should also be instrumental in ensuring that this is possible.
I hope that, at the end of June, the European Council will create the necessary conditions for the completion of this final stage and that the Irish are given the conditions they need to tackle this issue.
