Mr President, the previous speaker has just demonstrated how difficult the advancement of democracy in Europe is when we see that, in Ireland, half the population failed to vote because of the complexity of the issues and the fact that not everyone wants to be a constitutionalist.
Of those who did vote, half voted against the Treaty because they had not read it.
How are we to reform Europe if we cannot manage to persuade those responsible to actually assume their responsibility?
The Commissioner, Mrs Wallstr√∂m, and her team bear a very special responsibility, which is to inform the people of Europe, those who are interested, and to make all information available to them, so that the issues can be discussed competently.
We must seek dialogue with the people of Europe far more intensely, inform them and tell them just how important the reform is for the development of Europe.
With this approach, we will get results.
