rapporteur. - Mr President, Vice-President, I thank Mrs Doyle for her contribution from an Irish perspective, which I fully support.
The people of Ireland must decide independently and without external pressure, most likely in October, whether the guarantees to be negotiated at the June Summit will allay their misgivings, their main concerns associated with the treaty, and whether, under these circumstances, they can follow the remaining 26 countries and take the step towards reforming the European Union together with them.
I hope that the independence of opinion forming in Ireland is also respected by its neighbour, Great Britain.
At the first referendum many 'no' voters from Great Britain travelled around Ireland and, above all, the Europhobic British tabloid press helped to unsettle the people of Ireland.
One thing has to be acknowledged, which is that the independence of the people of Ireland to form an opinion at the second referendum must be respected.
It was a major debate, an important debate.
Today parliaments in 26 countries have said 'yes'.
More than 7 800 representatives of the people have found that the Treaty is good and that it represents progress.
Three hundred and fifty representatives of the people in 26 countries have said 'no'.
They cannot all be fools and scatterbrains.
What I mean is that the treaty cannot be as bad as it is repeatedly portrayed to be.
It is labelled with stereotypes, sometimes also in this House.
Whoever says this will be a military union misunderstands the primary objective of the European Union, which is the service of peace, on the continent and throughout the world.
Moreover, anyone who says that a neo-liberal economic constitution is being established has not read the treaty.
It is the most social European treaty there has ever been.
Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
I hope that the new Parliament will do what is stated in the reports, which is to apply and implement the Treaty.
Thank you very much.
