Mr President, I thank you for the supportive and constructive debate.
I am certain that, with this impetus, the MEDIA Mundus programme, which has rightly been addressed today, will not only enjoy great success but will also be able to mobilise additional support in the coming years.
Anyone who deplores the lack of or insufficient European culture in the world, which they have every reason to do, can only welcome the MEDIA Mundus programme and vote in favour of it enthusiastically.
It is an excellent example of how we can bring our cultural message to the world.
That is why I would earnestly request that you convey this message to our governments with vigour.
Promoting European culture collaboratively does not mean less national identity for all our countries and Member States in the European Union.
Rather, it strengthens their particular national identity and brings our European culture together so that we may be a more effective ambassador in the world.
On that note, I would like to thank you all.
I invite all of you who would like to discuss how we could go about this to the Members' bar.
