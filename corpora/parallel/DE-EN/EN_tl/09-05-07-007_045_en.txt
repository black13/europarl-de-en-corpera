Further reductions in asbestos in Europe must be welcomed unreservedly.
As the carcinogenic effects of asbestos fibres have been known for decades and the EU also introduced a ban on the use of this harmful substance in new products in 2003, the last relics of asbestos use should now slowly disappear from Europe.
Most Member States are already choosing alternative methods.
Especially in the area of electrolysis plants other materials can often be used as an alternative to asbestos.
In the light of the increased awareness of the people of Europe of health issues and the very high standards of environmental and health protection in Europe, it is unacceptable that carcinogenic substances are still in circulation in Europe.
