Mr President, Mr Nassauer, the right to self-determination is a human right and that includes sexual self-determination.
To that extent it was already topical in 2008 and what was said is particularly unfortunate.
I will read Amendment 2 aloud.
On the one hand, it is about a correction of fact and, on the other, a somewhat more balanced formulation:
'Underlines the importance of promoting sexual and reproductive health rights, as a precondition for any successful fight against HIV/AIDS, which causes enormous loss in terms of human lives and economic development, affecting particularly the poorest regions in the world; is concerned about declarations made by Pope Benedict XVI, which create the impression that condom use could even lead to an increased risk of contagion; is of the opinion that those statements will severely hamper the fight against HIV/AIDS;'.
The remainder of the amendment remains unchanged.
(Applause from the left)
