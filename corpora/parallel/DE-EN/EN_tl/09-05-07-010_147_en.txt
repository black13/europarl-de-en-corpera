Mr President, the new role of Parliament after the Treaty of Lisbon will be very important, and I hope that Parliament will seize the opportunities it is given to the best of its ability.
As a member of an ethnic minority traditionally present in the European Union, I am particularly pleased that the rights of ethnic minorities are mentioned as individual rights for the first time in Article 2.
I hope that group rights will follow as quickly as possible.
I am retiring voluntarily, of my own volition, but not without a feeling of nostalgia after five years as a Member of this Parliament and fifteen years as a Member of Parliament in Rome.
As an Italian national, with German as my mother tongue, of Austrian Slovene descent, with a Tyrolean nature - a proper European - I have been particularly pleased that we are all reunited in this Chamber as minorities and that minorities have been given opportunities.
Many have not yet really sensed that they belong to a minority, but I hope they will feel this more and more, including the States.
I am grateful to this House for the understanding for minorities that has been forthcoming.
