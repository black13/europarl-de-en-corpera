- Mr President, I am very grateful to this House for rejecting the scandalous attack on the Pope by the Liberals.
Even in the somewhat more carefully chosen words of Mr Graf Lambsdorff it would have been a scandalous statement.
I have to say quite clearly that attempts are being made in this House to place the highest moral authority of the 21st century, which extends far beyond the billion Catholics and provides support for Europe and the entire world, on an equal footing with torturers, human rights abusers and dictators.
These are unheard of matters in hand and will return to haunt the Liberal Group and also the German FDP Party.
