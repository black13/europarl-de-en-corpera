Madam President, Bavaria and its municipalities have many contacts all over the world, as does the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt.
I should therefore like to welcome a delegation of mayors from this region.
Madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively.
There are many cultural, economic and scientific contacts and a strong and supportive ecclesiastical presence.
That is why it is all the more regrettable that, in this scenically beautiful and culturally rich country, such appalling abuses are being committed.
There is a real danger that Madagascar, in its strategically important location, will become a failed state, like others we know of in Africa, first and foremost of which is Somalia.
It is therefore important that orderly and democratic relations are restored there as quickly as possible.
That is why I am pleased that we met the contact group a few days ago to discuss first concrete steps.
We must create an appropriate structure to prepare for new elections under the leadership of the ousted democratically elected president, whom we continue to recognise as the only legitimate head of state.
A dialogue must be opened, which must include the prime minister, who is currently in prison and who must be released immediately.
Not only humanitarian aid but also vital development aid, especially medical care, must continue to be given to the fullest extent.
For all these reasons, we in the European Union are called upon to be involved in the negotiations there, not only as a humanitarian factor and not only as an economic factor, but especially as a political factor bringing about peace in the region.
To achieve this, we count on the cooperation of the African Union, which once again has the opportunity to establish itself little by little as a factor in democratic stabilisation - stabilisation can in fact also be anti-democratic - which we will intensively support with the means at our disposal.
(Applause)
