Madam President, 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan-European picnic on the Austro-Hungarian border.
I had the honour of being allowed to take part in the relevant preparations and I will never forget, a short time later, the Chancellor of Unity, Helmut Kohl, and Pope John Paul II, two spearheads of this development, striding through the Brandenburg Gates and saying that socialism should not be replaced by predatory capitalism but by freedom and a social market economy.
Today, we are witnessing in Latin America a dangerous regression into socialist dictatorship and oppression.
The germ from which this comes is, I am afraid to say, Venezuela.
President Ch√°vez is attempting to stifle freedom throughout Latin America by means of oil money.
That is why the case of Manuel Rosales is so important.
Mr Rosales is not only an outstanding democrat, whom we must defend; he is also a symbolic figure for democracy in Latin America.
We shall support him and continue to stand up for the freedom of the Latin American people.
