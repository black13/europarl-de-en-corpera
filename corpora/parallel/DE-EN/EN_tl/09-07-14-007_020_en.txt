Mr President, on behalf of our group I would like to congratulate you on your election.
We supported your election and, even though we should be careful not to overuse the term 'historic moment', I believe that your election as President of the European Parliament is indeed an historic moment.
(Applause)
The fact that 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, six years after the accession of your country and many other Central and Eastern European countries to the European Union - which was after all a process that you yourself initiated as Prime Minister of your country, as the accession negotiations took place during your term of office - the fact that 20 years after putting an end to the division of the world into two heavily armed blocs, after overcoming the Stalinist dictatorships of the states which had to suffer 40 years longer under these dictatorships than the western part of Europe did under the fascist dictatorships, the fact that 20 years later it is only natural that Members from Poland, Hungary, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic or Slovakia should be sitting together with Members from France, Portugal, Finland, Germany, Austria or Italy in this Chamber and that we are able to elect as head of this assembly a representative of Solidarność, a democratically elected head of the Polish Government, in a free, secret and fair election - that is in my view an historic moment, which proves that Europe - this great continent in which 27 states have united to become the European Union - actually represents something, and that is that the dream of democracy and freedom can become reality if we do not merely dream, but also actively work to bring it about, as you have done in your life.
I therefore believe that your Presidency is also an appeal to all of us and that the values on which this Union was founded are the values that drove the dictators to the wall and overcame the dictatorships.
It is the wish of our group that your Presidency will be based on these values.
My sincere congratulations, Mr Buzek.
(Applause)
