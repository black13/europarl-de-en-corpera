Mr President, I am pleased that a neighbour from Poland has become President of this House.
I come from eastern Germany and work near Słubice.
Słubice and Frankfurt/Oder are both part of a united Europe.
I would like to thank you for focusing in particular on the continued integration of Eastern and Western Europe.
There is still much to do in this respect, as we are all aware.
However, I would also like to mention the important contribution in terms of Polish culture that you can make to cooperation and cultural diversity in Europe.
I hope that I will soon be able to speak to you in more depth.
I have started to work towards this.
Two of my sons speak Polish.
I once had the honour of presenting the Andrzej Wajda film prize to the director Andreas Dresen and of making a speech to mark the occasion.
Andrzej Wajda and other Polish directors are part of our European culture.
I hope that Western Europe and Eastern Europe will not forget the special achievements of Eastern European culture.
Mr President, you have our respect and our support!
