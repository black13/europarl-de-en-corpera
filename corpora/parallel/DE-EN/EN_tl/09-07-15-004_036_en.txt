Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this debate many people have expressed their gratitude to the Czech Presidency for the fact that it has still managed to complete a few projects, in administrative terms, by the end of its term of office.
I ask myself in all seriousness: have we really become so modest in our expectations?
We are in the business of politics.
What we actually expect, in the greatest economic crisis for decades which is combined with environmental challenges, is a Presidency which shows leadership and vision.
That is what we really expect.
We have seen that the administrative work has been completed for what is still on the table at end of the term of office.
I really would have expected more.
Prime Minister, if you meet with President Klaus this evening, please tell him that had an opportunity during these six months to make the Czech national identity and sovereignty clear to Europe by showing strong leadership.
He did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in Parliament.
Unfortunately, he missed the opportunity.
