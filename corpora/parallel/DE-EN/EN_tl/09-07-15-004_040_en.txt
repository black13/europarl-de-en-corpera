Mr President, I would like to state once again that, under conditions for which neither Prime Minister Topolánek nor Prime Minister Fischer was responsible, the Council Presidency was more successful than it appears to have been, and I would also like to thank Saša Vondra for preparing for this Presidency.
I would like to make one further comment and that is in response to Mr Higgins.
The Treaty of Lisbon contains a horizontal social clause.
It gives us more social rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
If we do not get this Treaty, we will have a Europe with fewer social rights.
I believe that this should be made clear, so that the people of Ireland cannot be told any more lies.
We should tell the truth.
Without the Treaty of Lisbon we are left with the Treaty of Nice and with fewer social rights in Europe.
We should therefore stop this awful campaign and tell the people of Ireland the truth.
(Applause)
