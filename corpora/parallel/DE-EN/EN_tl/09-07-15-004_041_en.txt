Mr President, I would like to point out that the Czech Presidency has not only achieved more than it has been given credit for, but that it was also very varied.
First-rate officials and outstanding ministers, such as Karel Schwarzenberg, Saša Vondra, Ondřej Liška and others, as well as Prime Minister Fischer have done an excellent job.
I would like to thank them for that.
This country has only one problem and that is President Klaus, who has seriously damaged his country by consciously and deliberately undermining this successful Presidency.
I would like to thank Prime Minister Fischer for the masterful way in which he rejected this, went to the Brussels Summit himself and successfully concluded this Council Presidency.
