Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy.
We need bold democrats and in this new period we urgently need an exciting, democratic and genuinely effective Europe.
Creative artists and, in particular, freelance writers, will have a role in identifying the values of this new Europe.
Their uncensored imagination will be able to put the bureaucratic genie which aims to destroy democracy back in its bottle.
After all, it is exciting ideas that lie behind at the birth of social change.
Those who can offer visions of hope which allow them to get inside people's minds - the Swedes have been particularly good at this in the past, and in this respect I have every confidence in my former colleague Cecilia Malmstr√∂m - can also inspire their interest in socio-political matters.
This is how I deliberately worded the final paragraph of my new book at the beginning of this last election campaign, which brought about major changes and which is linked to a great deal of hope that you in particular from Sweden with your great democratic tradition and transparency will now recognise the signs of the times.
We are not only facing the economic crisis - and here the Swedes have shown their cleverness by largely avoiding it - but we also have to deal with a rather ominous swing to the right.
I therefore firmly believe that together we democrats must stand up for genuine transparency and in particular we must stand together in the fight against the extreme right.
