Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to welcome the Swedes and also offer my congratulations that they - as the Prime Minister said - have finally found their way to Europe after a long process.
We are very pleased to find that Swedes today are among the best Europeans.
You have presented your programme and it is very ambitious.
However, I would like to ask you to consider whether Sweden would have the courage to take the step, particularly after the experience of the financial market crisis, of joining the euro - especially as you said that the Stability and Growth Pact must be complied with.
You, of course, have no opt-out clause like the United Kingdom and Denmark, for example, and you meet all of the conditions now.
Will you have the courage during your Presidency to stabilise Europe further and become a member of the euro zone?
Prime Minister, I agree with your prioritising of climate policy and the Baltic Sea Strategy, but with regard to your programme in its written form, I have a request: please pay more attention than proposed to combating the financial market crisis.
None of the other projects will have a chance if the crisis in the financial markets and in the economy is not resolved as quickly as possible.
For this we need clear rules.
It is not enough for the City of London once again to determine the course.
We need clear rules in the social market economy, because a market economy without rules cannot operate and will not receive majority support.
Therefore, you should consider once again - although we fully support your programme - whether you should not give the subject of overcoming the financial market crisis higher priority than you have done so far.
Thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval.
(Applause)
