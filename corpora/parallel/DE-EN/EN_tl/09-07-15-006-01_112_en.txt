Mr President, I think you need to explain something.
We are at present conducting a test.
In this test we can only vote for two people - for example Pavarotti and Montserrat Caball√©.
Later, however, in the vote for the quaestors we will be able to vote for five people.
I just wanted to reiterate this as it has confused many Members.
It is only in this test that we can vote for two people, afterwards in the real vote it will be five.
