on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left is deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in Iran.
We, too, condemn in the strongest possible terms the brutal mistreatment of demonstrators.
We are extremely concerned about the fate of numerous people who were detained and call for their immediate release and we also believe that the European Parliament as a whole should do this.
We are also critical of comments in media and governmental circles in other states which exploit the legitimate protests of the Iranian citizens.
Not even the most recent developments in Iran justify plans for military action against Iranian nuclear installations.
My group rejects such strategies.
We therefore welcome the clear statement by President Obama, who has refused to give Israel the green light for an attack on Iran.
The US President also believes in diplomacy.
Iran is a sovereign state.
Its people alone have the right to decide on changes to its society.
The government of a sovereign state must openly accept the desire for change and drive through a political solution.
