Mr President, I think it is good that we are having this debate in the first week of the new Parliament.
Unfortunately, our group chairmen have rejected a motion for a resolution.
I ask myself who we are actually paying attention to here.
A resolution would have been helpful to the dissidents in Iran if we had confirmed to them in a tangible statement that what was officially described as a presidential election did not in any way meet international standards of democracy because most of the candidates were rejected by the Guardian Council and because even those who were permitted to stand cannot be considered to have been given equal conditions.
From a political perspective we can therefore conclude without reservation that the results of the election as announced did not represent the will of the Iranian people.
Let us, as the EU, actively use our instruments for democracy and human rights, support the living civil society or even lawyers like Shirin Ebadi, for example, who is standing up for the Bahai detainees there.
I believe this is the policy that can be successful at the moment, even in the short term.
(Applause)
