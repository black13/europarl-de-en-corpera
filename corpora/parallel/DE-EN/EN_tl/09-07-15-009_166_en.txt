on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I condemn the violence on both sides, both on the part of the Han Chinese and on the part of the Uighurs, and I mourn for all the innocent victims.
However, this is not a conflict where the two sides are equal.
The Uighurs are a suppressed people numbering only nine million.
I believe that the minorities policy in the People's Republic of China has failed.
The society is also not harmonious as the Communist Party of China claims.
In Xinjiang, the region of the Uighurs, there is just as little cultural autonomy as in Tibet.
There is no real self-government, even if these regions are referred to as being autonomous and above all - and this is crucial for the younger generation in particular - the Uighurs do not have the same social and economic rights as the rest of the population.
However, the Communist Party of China recognises only one charge, only one monotonously repeated charge, and that is of criminal separatism.
Anyone who promotes human rights and democracy in China runs the risk of being declared a criminal and a separatist.
However, the People's Republic of China needs to understand that it is only with the guarantee of minority rights that there will be any real chance of internal peace.
Only by granting equal rights will China have peaceful internal development and acceptance of this country.
I have one last very important comment to make to the Swedish Presidency.
Yes, it is true that we have an interest in a strategic partnership with China on account of climate policy and general foreign policy matters.
However, we cannot sacrifice human rights and our criticism of the situation regarding human rights in China for the sake of a strategic interest.
Our strategic policy with regard to China must instead include a clear statement regarding the minorities policy and the violation of human rights in China.
