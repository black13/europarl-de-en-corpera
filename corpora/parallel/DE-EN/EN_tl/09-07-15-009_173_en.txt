Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing needs to be stated very clearly: there is a unified system in China and we do not want to allow this system to break up.
We respect the Chinese system.
However, that does not mean ...
(Interruption by Mr Posselt)
We respect China's unified system.
However, that does not mean that the diversity of peoples in China must not also be respected.
That is what we Social Democrats are calling for.
We want citizens' rights, human rights and people's freedom to be respected in China.
We want freedom of expression to be respected.
We want journalists to be able to move around freely so that the situation as it really is can indeed be reported.
That is what we want and there is one thing that we would say very clearly to our colleagues in China: what for us is a basic principle we would also expect to be a basic principle for you in China, namely that human rights are universal.
What the politicians always say to us - let us first solve the social problems and then we can talk about human rights - is the wrong way to go about things.
It must be the other way round.
Human rights come first and then social rights, which are quite simply part and parcel of human rights and cannot be separated from them.
I was therefore very disappointed by what you said, Mr Bildt.
You seemed to be saying: let us work together on an economic level, that is our main concern and all of the other things are of no particular interest to us.
That is not the approach that we need.
We need to take the approach presented to us by the European Commission, namely to say that we first want a common basis for our work on which we can then build our cooperation, because we do want cooperation, that much is clear, but not on any basis, only on a correct basis that respects human dignity.
