Mr President, we are having this debate on the basis of the universal nature of human rights, but also on the basis of the need for a global partnership.
A harmonious society has been mentioned.
That is one of the slogans of the Communist Party of China, but it is also something more: it reflects a deep hope of the Chinese people.
A harmonious society is not simply the same as masking authoritarian relations.
I believe it could be our job to support the Chinese people in their realisation of a harmonious society.
A partnership involves speaking out clearly.
When we talk about Xinjiang the word 'Uighurs' should also be mentioned.
However, clear speaking is not the same as being confrontational - we should avoid that.
I would like to say one last thing to Mr Posselt.
He spoke of separatism.
Now, I know Mr Posselt that your Bavarian party knows something about this, but I think that we should instead follow Mr Brok and talk about continuing with the One China policy.
