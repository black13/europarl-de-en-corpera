Mr President, I think that this conflict is very often presented in a very one-sided manner.
I agree with the previous speaker that in the present case it is frequently a matter of attacks on Han Chinese by Uighurs and indeed that some of these attacks are racially motivated.
(Heckling)
I read an interview with a Uighur woman, for example, who said: Would you like to be governed by yellow communists?
The Uighurs enjoy many privileges in their region, for example they are allowed to have more children, they are allowed to practice their religion even during working hours and there are many other examples.
Many of the local Han Chinese are also envious of them.
We ought therefore to be very discriminating in our observation of this situation and investigate the causes and effects.
Sometimes problems do not lie where they seem to at first glance.
We should be careful not to take a one-sided position.
We ought to support the Chinese in solving their problems.
The one-sided view that is so often presented in this House is, in my opinion, dangerous.
The Chinese Government certainly has shortcomings in its policy towards minority groups and it has its failures too.
However, it is also showing the will to improve in many areas.
We should therefore help it in this regard through cooperation - and indeed also critical cooperation - based on trust.
