in writing. - Conflict resolution for millions of Uighurs in China - dialogue not condemnation.
We lament the bloody clashes, the dead and wounded in Xinjiang-Uighur.
The actions of the police and security forces were excessive and harm the Chinese Government's goals of growth and stability.
At the same time it is wrong to accuse China of cultural genocide.
The Government is striving to obtain a balance between the autonomy of minority groups and modernisation in a multi-ethnic state.
It is also up to us as a partner to support China's development in terms of democracy and the rule of law, without neglecting the special historical, geographic and cultural aspects of this state.
Biased information will prevent dialogue, and it will not compensate for a policy with an inadequate guarantee of human rights.
China is an important partner for Europe, alongside the US and Russia.
Combating the financial crisis, fighting poverty, stopping climate change, providing energy security and guaranteeing the water supply - none of these things can be achieved without the efforts of the People's Republic of China.
The majority of Uighurs are dismayed over the events of the past week and above all want to live in peace once again.
The Chinese Government knows that this conflict cannot be solved with violence.
We can support the dialogue between the Han Chinese and the Uighurs and other minority groups instead of continuing our decade-long interference from the outside with our inapt methods.
Establishing a structured dialogue aimed at developing the rule of law in China is a more important task for the European Parliament.
