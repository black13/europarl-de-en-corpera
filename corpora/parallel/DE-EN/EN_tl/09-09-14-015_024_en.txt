Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit discussed a motion put forward by my group in the Conference of Presidents last week.
We put forward the motion in question as we believe that it is not really the issue of the Irish referendum, nor the issue of the Constitutional Court in Prague, but the issue of the lack of cohesion in the opinions of the Council that is responsible for the confusion currently prevalent.
It is abundantly clear that a community based on law - and the European Union claims to be just that - must act in accordance with applicable law.
The applicable law is the Treaty of Nice.
There is therefore no alternative to working with the Treaty of Nice, and that means working with the President of the Commission and all the Commissioners.
The Council wants to elect the President on the basis of the Treaty of Nice but to then do what Mr Cohn-Bendit referred to, namely to apply the Treaty of Lisbon to Commissioners, which would mean that we would have a President of the Commission elected on a different legal basis than his Commissioners - which, by the way, is something the President of the Commission himself thinks is very regrettable.
That is why he is going around talking of the Lisbon majority that he needs but will not get.
That, on its own, shows the confusion that the Council has given rise to, something that is in no way beneficial to the EU or to the President of the Commission himself.
For this reason, we were of the opinion that the vote should be delayed until the Council has managed to agree what it wants.
We therefore support this ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
We believe that this postponement is necessary for reasons that differ little from those enunciated by Mr Cohn-Bendit, and for the reasons we have mentioned, we support the motion.
