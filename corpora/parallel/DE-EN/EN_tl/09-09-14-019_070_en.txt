Mr President, we need a democratic revolution, I said, and now we face a situation that represents an untenable state of affairs for all those of us who, of our own free will, are not represented in a political group in this Parliament.
I would like to ask the Bureau to find an amicable solution to the issue of coordinators.
In this respect, we are discriminated against, as we are not permitted to take part in coordinators' meetings in various committees and be duly active.
I would be glad to help avoid a situation where proceedings before the European Court of Justice - as previously in the wake of the discrimination case from 2001 - resulted in a finding that all the coordination decisions made thus far are unlawful.
That would not only harm Parliament tremendously, but it is also unnecessary from a political point of view.
I therefore ask the Bureau, in urgent terms, to put in place appropriate measures to end this discrimination against non-attached Members and return to the sound working methods of the last ten years.
