Mr President, the economic crisis has hit agricultural production hard.
The situation in dairy farming, in particular, has deteriorated drastically over the last 20 months.
With prices below EUR 0.21, farmers have to sell their milk at a price that is less than their production costs.
The survival of many family-run farms in the EU is in grave danger, and at present many of them are only able to survive by relying on their personal savings, something that is clearly not sustainable.
The Commission's figures provide a dramatic picture of the fall in prices for milk and milk products.
The support measures for dairy farming are vital in order to prevent a collapse in agriculture.
Quality has a price, but this principle no longer seems to apply in the agricultural sector.
At present, the producer price bears no relation to the consumer price.
Our family-run farms urgently need market support measures.
This is about ensuring the security of Europe's food supply.
Above all, we must not forget that hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe depend on agriculture functioning.
