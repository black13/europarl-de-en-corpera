Mr President, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) very warmly welcome the fact that Commissioner Å pidla has confirmed that the European authorities were involved in three areas of this long, drawn-out change of ownership process of a car company.
As a second point, I agree with Commissioner Kroes that there is a need to check carefully whether there are any non-commercial considerations.
I would ask the Commission, however, to proceed with the necessary speed.
It need not necessarily be as quick as in the take-over of Dutch and Belgian banks within 24 hours, while the same process requires 24 months for German banks, but I would still ask that this checking process be carried out rapidly and purposefully.
My third point is that it is true that there are overcapacities in the market, and indeed that these are on a stupendous scale.
In 2007, 58 million cars were sold worldwide, while capacities were 72 million.
That means that the restructuring of the industry - including with regard to environmentally-friendly vehicles - is in full swing and the parties most affected are the manufacturers of large vehicles.
Opel is clearly not a manufacturer of large vehicles, but of energy-efficient vehicles.
Opel has had problems.
It has made losses.
Its vehicles perform well, they are technologically sophisticated and I am sure that this company - even if it will not enjoy the market presence of the giants in the marketplace as an independent company - has a chance of surviving if it can succeed in implementing this restructuring plan.
As far as restructuring is concerned, I have read in the press that only one site would be affected.
According to my information ...
