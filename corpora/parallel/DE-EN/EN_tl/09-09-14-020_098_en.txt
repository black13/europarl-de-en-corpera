As I said, the process must be allowed to go ahead.
It must not be obstructed.
That is, ultimately, the question.
When I look at examples from the banking sector, where this process has taken years, then a shorter period than we had in some cases in Germany would certainly be appropriate.
I would, however, like to conclude by saying the following: in total, the plan - if my information is correct - envisages 10 500 out of the total of 50 000 jobs being lost, 4 500 of which would be in Germany, with the remainder across Opel's other sites.
I believe it is justified to ask the Commission to check whether this is accurate and that it does not take place according to political criteria and, in that regard, we look forward, along with the workers, to what will hopefully be a bright future.
