Madam President, I'm delighted to be given the opportunity of taking the floor in the first meeting to be chaired by you.
I am very pleased, in fact!
Most of all, however, I would like to thank Commissioner Å pidla for having spoken German, and I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to Commissioner Kroes.
Many people believe that the Opel-Vauxhall case is a German issue.
It is not - it is a European issue!
It relates to jobs all across Europe, and special treatment here for Germany would not be right.
I am therefore particularly pleased to see that the Commission is willing to examine this case.
The issues at hand are questions under European law in relation to competition law and State aid.
We do want to save every job, but at what price?
As counsel for the citizens and taxpayers, it is unclear in the Opel-Magna deal what long-term commitments will be laid at taxpayers' doors.
The Opel case is also questionable from an industrial policy point of view.
It is always only the biggest who receive help.
The smallest and those in the middle are left to look after themselves, yet they are the backbone of the economy.
The fixation on one investor was clearly a wrong move.
Better and more favourable offers were turned down early on - and by politicians, in fact.
The Opel case has more to do with electioneering than with economic and industrial policy that is pure and above board from the point of view of EU law.
To restate the point, it is important the Commission now plays an active role, even if the German Government does not approve.
The Opel deal is a sham.
That is becoming ever more obvious.
It could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of Germany.
We want Opel to survive, we want it to be healthy and we want to fight for every job, but we do not want there to be costs involved, nor do we want a solution at the expense of our European partners, on whom Germany, as the biggest exporter in the world, is also dependent.
