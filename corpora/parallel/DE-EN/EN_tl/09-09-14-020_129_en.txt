Madam President, I greatly appreciate a subject as important as this being debated here in the European Parliament.
Personally, I worked for more than three years in the automotive supply sector.
In my home country, we give top priority to foreign investment in the automotive sector.
I therefore think that the car industry has an important role to play in connection with regional development.
As well as supporting innovation, we should also create incentives for automotive suppliers and car makers throughout Europe to restructure and expand, as one of the most important objectives of the European Commission and the European Parliament is to ensure a high degree of economic cohesion.
The Commission should do more, including with regard to awarding grants to the car industry.
For the time being, this should be regarded as a measure aimed at combating the financial and economic crisis, although it should also be seen as one of the building blocks of innovation in the car industry.
In this context, Opel is only one example of how this sector is currently on the rocks, but, of course, many car makers are in the same situation.
That is why we want the Commission to treat this sector and this area as priorities.
