Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is, of course, not the first time that we have debated the subject of Opel and the car industry.
I am pleased that the rescue succeeded.
There were other proposals on the table, such as a structured insolvency.
In the supply industry - and I have just come from Bavaria, where I visited a supply company - people are very urgently dependent on orders.
Things have got out of control.
If Opel, too, had been driven to insolvency, things would have been very, very bad and the consequences would have been devastating.
We have just heard the Commission's conclusions.
There was a car industry summit, in which the Commission took part, but we actually heard nothing after the summit.
Today we have heard where the problem may lie. what is not possible.
That must change in future - we need to hear from the Commission what is possible, so as to forestall nationalistic debates.
The Commission needs to mediate more effectively so that we pursue a common European industrial policy.
That is also what I hope for from the next Commission.
