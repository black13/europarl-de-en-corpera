Madam President, first of all, I feel I must state that I am speaking from a doubly biased position.
My wife works in the management of a car company in Germany, and in Austria people are pleased that Opel appears to have been rescued in this way.
When we look at the events more closely, however, I have great doubts about whether we are not doing exactly what we in Austria have already experienced in connection with the apparent rescue of the nationalised industry and what already happened in Germany in relation to the Holzmann company before a pivotal election.
I do not know whether there are Members in the House from Germany who would be prepared to enter into a wager with me about whether presumptive German taxpayers would be supporting Opel in this way if such an important election were not taking place in ten days' time.
I would like the Commission to consider the sine ira et studio, to really think over whether this is reasonable.
If we are going to constantly talk of competition, then that is what we should have and it should not result in a downward spiral which takes with it those who have actually kept house better, financially speaking, than Opel!
