This summer, again, there were devastating forest fires in some areas of Europe that not only caused considerable economic damage, but also claimed 11 lives.
Europe needs to show solidarity in the face of such natural disasters.
Pressing situations of this nature give the Community the opportunity to demonstrate its qualities and enable Europe's population to experience direct added value on the part of the European Union.
In practical implementation, however, the rules of subsidiarity absolutely must be complied with.
It is the Member States who are responsible for precautionary preparations for disasters and for drawing up emergency management plans and the EU must not meddle in this important competence on the part of the individual Member States.
The Community's Solidarity Fund is a sound and valuable financial management tool.
In the long term, the strategy to prevent fires of this nature in Europe must be improved and we must end the reliance on short-term crisis management.
