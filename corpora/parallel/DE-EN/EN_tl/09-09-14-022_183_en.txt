Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for the information that you have given us this evening in the extraordinary committee meeting and here in plenary.
Clearly, the free trade agreement with South Korea is close to being concluded.
From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union.
In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far.
That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha?
Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union's free trade policy?
As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry - in particular, in the car industry.
This clause could lead to supporting business in low-cost countries such as India and China, thereby threatening European manufacturing.
Can you see a way that these concerns on the part of a number of Member States in respect of such refunding of duties can still be addressed?
