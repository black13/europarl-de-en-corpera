Mr President, the question tabled by Mrs Joly on behalf of the Committee on Development brings up the issue of what we, as development policy makers, are actually trying to achieve in this debate.
The promises of the last G8 and G20 summits ultimately never made it off the page.
They are amongst the promises that are trotted out again and again but that have never led to adequate, tangible assistance.
In this regard, I really cannot comprehend why we are not debating Parliament's resolution before Pittsburgh in order to apply appropriate political pressure.
In light of the Commissioner's accurate analyses and of Mr Michel's observations, it seems clear to me that we know what is at hand here.
Yet we are not in a position to apply political pressure in order to force the Member States to finally move away from this policy of 'charity begins at home'.
Looking forward to Pittsburgh, that would seem to me to be the big danger.
If we do not succeed in applying pressure and making it clear that we need new institutions specifically in order to support the poorest countries in the world, then we will still be sitting here after Pittsburgh pointing out that, ultimately, nothing has changed.
That is also my request to you, Commissioner.
I ask you, here in Parliament right now, to comment again specifically on the results and to tell us what can actually be demanded with the support of which Member States and to what extent we have actually made progress here.
What we need is rapid and effective action because people are dying before our very eyes and they are doing so as a result of circumstances that we have helped bring about.
I call on us all to act together!
