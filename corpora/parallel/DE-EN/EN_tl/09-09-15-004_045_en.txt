Mr President, border officials of European states are forbidden to turn away potential asylum seekers who arrive by sea or to escort them away, prevent them from travelling further or return them to countries which do not form part of the EU.
This is laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights.
Today, we have once again heard numerous examples of how Frontex does not comply with these rules in practice.
For this reason, we need controls in this area.
We need these controls as Members of the European Parliament, because it is our responsibility to ensure that the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights are observed.
My question to you is as follows: To what extent are we able to monitor whether border officials in international waters are complying with these legal requirements relating to human rights?
For years we have been aware that Frontex has violated human rights in individual cases.
However, in all its activities, it is also seriously undermining the credibility of the EU when it comes to the protection of human rights.
