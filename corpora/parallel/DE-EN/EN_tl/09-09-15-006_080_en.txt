The motions submitted by Spain and Portugal to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) once again make clear the consequences of globalisation.
In the countries of south-east Asia and, in particular, in the special economic zones, where people are exploited and employed without minimum social standards, textiles are being produced at dumping prices and then sold on the European market.
European companies, which respect the social rights of employees that have been established and acquired over decades, are left at a disadvantage because of the higher costs that they incur as a result.
We must stop this development from going any further immediately.
A ban must be imposed as soon as possible on the import of products into the EU which are not produced under specific minimum social standards.
Until this has been achieved, we can only work to reduce the damage caused by globalisation in the relevant countries.
Therefore, I have voted without reservations in favour of releasing aid from the fund.
