In January 2009, France was hit by a severe storm.
Storm Klaus caused devastation, in particular to the country's infrastructure.
The objective of the Solidarity Fund is to cover part of the cost of damage which has to be paid for out of the public purse.
This case meets all the requirements.
For this reason, and particularly for reasons of cross-border solidarity with the French citizens who were and, in some cases, still are affected by storm Klaus, I have voted in favour of the Draft amending budget.
