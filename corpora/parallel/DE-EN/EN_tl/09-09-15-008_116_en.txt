Mr President, I would like to congratulate you and I would like to say one thing to you in particular.
A Parliament is measured by the way in which it uses and puts into practice its rights and by the fact that it does not withdraw from major political debate.
We are all responsible for working together with you to ensure that this Parliament is not subjected to pressure from Commission proposals which are half-baked or which represent the unilateral interests of specific lobbyists.
We are responsible for speaking up clearly at this point and we must do so.
We must think about how the Treaty of Lisbon will change our situation.
I hope that we will be able to do all of this.
We must demonstrate clearly - and, in my opinion, this also concerns the question of the election of the Commission President - that we are making use of our rights and we must send a clear signal to the Commission.
This means that there must now be no direct election of Mr Barroso.
