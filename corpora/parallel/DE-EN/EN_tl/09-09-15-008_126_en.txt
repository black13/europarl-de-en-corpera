Mr President, I would like to congratulate you warmly on your speech.
The process of bringing an end to the division of Europe was the result, on the one hand, of the desire for freedom among Central and Eastern European countries and, on the other, of course, of the attractiveness of Europe as an economic model.
I believe that we have too little confidence, too little confidence in the future.
If we cannot achieve this in Europe, then who can?
We should explain with greater conviction that we can work on resolving our problems with confidence.
We have a great deal of potential and there are still opportunities for growth throughout the world.
While there are still people in the world who need goods and services, there will still be opportunities for growth.
We can make sure that in Europe, we have a slice of this cake and everyone involved will benefit.
I would like to encourage all of us to have more confidence in Europe as a successful model and I would like to ask you to convey this idea in your speeches.
