Mr President, we are aware that Mr Barroso is a walking compromise between the powers of Europe.
We know also that he is the lowest common denominator among the governments of the Member States.
We know that Mr Barroso also has something to offer for everyone: a hint of Maoism for those on the left, a touch of conservatism for the members of the Christian Social party, a smattering of neo-liberalism, plus a green and socialist approach.
Mr Barroso will, of course, stand as a candidate without opposition, without an alternative.
For this reason, he is now having a few tough days and having to listen to unpleasant remarks from the united left and from other critics.
However, this will pay off, because we know that after these tough days, Mr Barroso will probably once again be Commission President and that there will, once again, be uneasy compromises between the large and powerful groups in this House, but also between the governments in the Council, and that Mr Barroso, who has personified the failures of European integration during the last five years, is likely to continue to do so over the next five years.
When it comes down to it, we all have very little influence.
