Madam President, Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, what is tomorrow's vote all about?
It is about doing what many people in this House cannot do and others do not want to do.
It is, in fact, about taking responsibility for Europe.
I would like to highlight one point.
Mr Barroso, I am very grateful to you for mentioning this again in your interruption.
It is about taking responsibility for Europe's ability to act during a difficult time, in order to overcome all the problems which have been the subject of justified criticism from citizens and also from this Parliament.
I believe that today's debate has helped to clarify the issue of whom Europe can and cannot rely on in future when it comes to taking political responsibility in the years to come.
However, I would like to point out, Mr Barroso, that there is, of course, a whole series of subjects on the agenda which need to be dealt with and you have a great deal of responsibility in this area because you have a monopoly on launching initiatives at a European level.
I would like to look at one more subject which seems to me not to have been covered in sufficient detail in the debate so far and that is agricultural policy.
In this area, we are faced with several new challenges.
It is not enough simply to mention the fact that the agriculture ministers came to a resolution in the autumn of last year.
It is not enough that we have begun a programme of comprehensive agricultural reform, because when the basic conditions change, you must, of course, take a corresponding initiative to help farmers in the European Union.
My request is that you take the Commissioner for Agriculture on one side and point out to her that her model will not succeed in guiding this important sector out of the crisis.
We are prepared, and I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues here, to take over responsibility for Europe in the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe.
