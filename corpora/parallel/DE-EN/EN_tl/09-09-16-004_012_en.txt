Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, there can be no 'as you were' in the current economic situation.
That will only allow us to make a slow recovery and we shall see a further dramatic increase in unemployment figures, including here in Europe.
You must therefore be bold.
That is the most important message this Parliament can give the Pittsburgh delegates.
Be bold!
Mr Almunia, I have listened to a refreshing speech from you, on which I should like to congratulate you.
Now you need to start putting it into practice.
It is good to start with the bonus systems, but it is not enough.
We need a gear shift wherever short-term speculators are at an advantage on the international financial market, because the rules are wrong, over those who wish to make long-term investments in jobs, in products of excellence and in the long-term success of their company.
It is right to say that no risky players, no risky financial centre can remain without reasonable regulation, which is why we need regulation of the offshore centres from which dubious products are flooding the entire world.
That is the most important task that we must now set ourselves.
Nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy - it is not prohibited.
A global transaction tax which benefits long-term investors would take us forward in this discussion as a whole.
We need strong, improved coordination of our international, as well as our European, economic policy.
It is right to think about an exit strategy, but it is even more important at the moment that we work out how we can give more solid support to the economy and improve the coordination of our economic policy.
