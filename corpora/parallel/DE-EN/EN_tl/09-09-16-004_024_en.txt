Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, who should regulate whom and how?
That will be one of the controversial questions at the G20 Summit.
Even if there is unanimity on the fact that there can be no return to unbridled developments on the financial market, the methods and extent of regulation are still the subject of fierce argument.
It will still be possible to reach agreement on equity rules, on rating agencies, possibly even on questions in connection with derivates and their licensing, but there will be argument on the question of unfair competition, taxes and control.
There will be arguments over bonuses and there will be arguments over Europe's demand for a Tobin tax.
In other words, as Europeans we have a responsibility to do our own homework, regardless of the outcome of the G20 Summit and the Commission is on the right path by not relying solely on it.
The motto must be: no financial market players, no financial products and no financial centre with no supervision in future.
However, global economic recovery is also on the agenda.
We cannot carry on here as in the past and maintain the imbalances in the world for the benefit of the US and for the benefit of the large industrial countries.
We must devote ourselves to overcoming poverty and hunger in the world and the G20 Summit must give new momentum to this.
I should like to add one point that no one, with the exception of Commissioner Almunia, has addressed so far.
It will be necessary to abide by the Stability and Growth Pact in Europe, not to bury it.
It is only because we had this pact, because we revised and maintained it, that it was at all possible for Europe to remain capable of action.
This should remain a European objective: a fast exit strategy out of excessive debt into a stable economy, to the Stability and Growth Pact as we know it.
