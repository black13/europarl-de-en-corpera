Mr President, the Presidency and the Commission talk constantly of strengthening civil rights and of a Europe of the citizens.
In fact, however, fundamental rights are being eroded and proper public debate on them frustrated.
Every effort is being made to exclude parliaments and hold back information.
This sort of untransparent approach is unacceptable for a democratic Europe.
It is not enough to just tap at the door; a responsible parliament must stop this undesirable development.
The Presidency must interrupt negotiations until it can guarantee the rights of citizens and parliaments.
The horse-trading which you are planning for banking data, with no binding protection mechanism, will sell the data protection rights of Europe's citizens down the river and create a preventive general suspicion towards all citizens.
We Greens will have nothing to do with this.
Not even temporarily and certainly not if we have servers here in Europe and no longer just in the US, because the data will continue to be sent to the US nonetheless and legal protection will not be guaranteed.
