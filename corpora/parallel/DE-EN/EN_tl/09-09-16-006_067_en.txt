Mr President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has put cooperation in the Baltic Sea area at the top of its agenda.
There is no need for argument here: we need to protect resources and we, too, need to help protect the climate and nature.
On the other hand, we must also focus cooperation in the Baltic Sea area on economic development, of that there can be no question.
You have our full support here.
However, some questions do still arise.
You just said that there are no additional funds.
As we discussed this in committee, all the funds are to be made available under the current cohesion policy.
For me, this raises the question of whether this means under existing projects that are already being financed from cohesion resources or under new projects.
If so, we need to ask which cohesion policy projects already approved will lose funding.
This is a very important point, because I already know that the towns, local authorities and regions will come and ask me, what should we do in order to become involved in the Baltic Sea Strategy?
How do we get the funds to run this sort of project?
If we do not give them a good answer and cannot indicate how this cooperation is to be organised, then citizens' enthusiasm for Baltic Sea cooperation will probably quickly turn to frustration.
That is not the objective that we are working together to achieve and we therefore need to hold very intensive talks on how to organise this cooperation.
I therefore ask - and I would ask the Commissioner to take this on board - that not only the Council and the Commission participate in the Baltic Sea Strategy, but also that Parliament is properly involved in this cooperation and in the implementation of this strategy, because we would like other regions to profit as well, as with the Black Sea policy or with cooperation between the states bordering the Danube.
That would be very important to us.
