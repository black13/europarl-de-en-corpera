Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in theory, projects such as these on the regional promotion of cross-border cooperation are to be welcomed and make a great deal of sense.
However, strategies often have the disadvantage that, although targets are set and even reached, sustainability is ignored, even during implementation.
Sustainability must therefore be included right from the planning phase.
It is therefore important when implementing this integrated strategy for the Baltic Sea area - a very important exemplary EU project - for regions and organisations to cooperate as a network, because these organisations know best what is important for them in the various sectors, such as nature, social structure and infrastructure; they know what to do for the best.
This is an area with 100 million inhabitants and an investment budget of EUR 50 billion.
We need to proceed very carefully here if we are to make a success of this pilot project.
This pilot project is, as already mentioned, very important for other projects along the Danube, too, for the states bordering the Danube in central and south-east Europe.
