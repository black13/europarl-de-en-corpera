Mr President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, Commissioner Samecki, as a newly elected member from Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania, I very much support the development of a Baltic Sea Strategy and the associated action plan.
The Commissioner referred earlier to the flagship projects, 80 in total.
Our common objectives are, of course, to improve the competitiveness of our economy in the Baltic Sea area, taking particular account of the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and of a common energy policy which also takes account of renewable energies.
That raises the question of how we deal with offshore installations in the Baltic Sea.
Maintaining clean water, because that is our foundation and our resource, plays a very, very important role here, when we think of fisheries and when we think of tourism.
That is why investments in treatment plants need to be promoted.
I think a common planning programme needs to be agreed for all Member States in the Baltic Sea area, because we need to answer the following questions: where will traffic routes be positioned in future?
Where will offshore installations be built?
How will safety at sea be addressed?
That is why we also need to be clear on where the energy routes will be for Nord Stream, for the supply of electricity, and on many other things.
(The President cut off the speaker)
