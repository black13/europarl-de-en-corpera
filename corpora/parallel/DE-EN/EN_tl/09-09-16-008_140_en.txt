Unfortunately, the summer of 2009 was marked by devastating forest fires in southern Europe, which caused huge material and ecological damage.
It was clear in this context that arsonists, who profit by destroying forests, are encouraged by shortcomings in or the lack of forest registers, or by poorly defined land use.
It was therefore important in this motion for a resolution to call on the Member States to revise or amend these registers.
In addition to reforestation, cooperation between experts, fire brigades and other groups deployed is required both in emergencies and for prevention.
This motion for a resolution contains logical proposals, such as how the Member States can be supported in a disaster in accordance with the principle of solidarity.
That is why I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on the forest fires in the summer of 2009.
