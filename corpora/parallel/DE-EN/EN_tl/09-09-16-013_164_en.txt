Madam President, thank you for the report.
As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I questioned the competent representative of the Commission in a debate on the role of this agreement within the framework of EU immigration management.
He clearly stated that, when it entered into force, it would pave the way for cooperation with the border security agency (Frontex) and for numerous immigration regulations, such as within the framework of readmission agreements and border security with Afghanistan.
The 1 200 km long border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has already been addressed here.
It will then also become another target of the EU's repressive policy to keep out refugees.
Thus, the European Union wants to seal itself off from refugees far beyond its external borders.
Yet again, we see that this is a fundamental component of EU foreign policy.
As a result of such partnership agreements, refugees are interned in camps, in which, as we all know, inhumane conditions prevail, as is currently the case in Ukraine.
The problem has already been addressed here in general terms.
This form of so-called international immigration management involves serious infringement of the Geneva Refugee Convention and of international human rights.
I therefore call on the EU to start fighting the cause of flight rather than the refugees.
The European neighbourhood policy is one means of making fortress Europe even more impenetrable, which is why it is looked on very sceptically from our point of view, from the point of view of the GUE/NGL.
