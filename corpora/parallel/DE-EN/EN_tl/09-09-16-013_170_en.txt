Madam President, I would also like to say that Mr Peterle has produced an excellent report.
We should be clear about one thing: the freedom-loving people of central Asia are among our most important partners.
This region has often been dominated by foreign powers.
For the first time in a long time - for centuries - it is again free.
We should exploit this opportunity to establish a real partnership of the free.
I heard talk earlier of crime.
Of course, we must work together to combat crime, but first we should look at the culture in these countries and understand that these are ancient trading nations.
They do not just trade in drugs; they trade in goods which were always important for Europe and the world.
We should therefore say that this is about partnership, not paternalism.
