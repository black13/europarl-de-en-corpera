Madam President, that visa requirements for Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro are to be abolished shows that the reform efforts of these countries are clearly bearing fruit.
However, ten years after the end of the conflict, the graves are still deep and ill-feeling is still simmering beneath the surface.
Clearly this has to do with the fact that Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia, which have not been included this time, are feeling disadvantaged.
Clearly people there prefer to cultivate old antagonisms, rather than ask themselves what their neighbouring states have done better and how progress can be achieved in order to earn visa waiver.
In any event, Serbia should soon acquire the status of candidate country, as it is moving towards accession on several counts.
However, the wounds are far from healed and every measure by the EU is being evaluated accordingly.
That is why we need, on the one hand, to communicate the reasons for our decisions better and, on the other hand, make it clear to Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia that they still need to make an enormous effort to move equally towards accession.
In any event, peace in the Balkans, on the doorstep to the EU, has become far more important than the accession of Turkey, which is being so fiercely advocated on many sides.
