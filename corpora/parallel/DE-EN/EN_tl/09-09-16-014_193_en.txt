Madam President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, Commissioner, we Greens obviously welcome visa liberalisation for Montenegro, Macedonia and Serbia.
That is something I campaigned for very strongly in recent years when I was still a member of the Austrian National Assembly.
It is an important step in the direction of fulfilling the dream of a unified and peaceful Europe.
However, the path on which you have embarked has a number of stumbling blocks.
It will result, above all, in the Muslim citizens of Bosnia feeling discriminated against.
This was already the case when you merely announced that there would be liberalisation for the other states.
You argue on the basis of technical conditions that Bosnia and Herzegovina has not yet met, but you apparently overlook the fact that there are still problems in other states which are now being liberalised.
Bosnia has already issued 40 000 biometric passports and has already passed a regulation for displaced persons, which other states do not yet have, and it has introduced an anti-corruption agency, which Serbia, for example, does not yet have.
I get the impression that there is also political discrimination here and I consider that very dangerous for peace in the region and for a multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina.
So to name this danger once again: there is a danger that ethnic dividing lines will be formalised here too.
I therefore call on you to conclude a common package with Bosnia and Albania and to start visa talks with Kosovo.
