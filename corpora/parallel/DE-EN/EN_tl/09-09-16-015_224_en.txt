Madam President, as the previous speaker said, this law passed in Lithuania endangers European values, European law and also the freedom of people, namely the freedom of young people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or perhaps transgender, to live their life without fear.
According to this law, factual information on this is supposedly damaging to these young people.
I can tell you what that means: it means that these young people must live in fear and possibly suffer depression.
We know that there is an increased rate of attempted suicide among young people who are lesbian or gay or who are confused in their coming-out phase about how they will live their lives.
This law flies in the face of European values, which is why I was delighted that Commissioner Barrot responded on this back in July.
You also told the European region of the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) that the Commission would analyse this text and explain what its next steps would be.
What I am interested in today is what you intend to do.
What have you - and the Council - already promised the Lithuanian Parliament?
We know that the former Lithuanian President and the new president, who used to be a commissioner, do not approve of this law, but the parliament is insisting on it.
I am delighted that a proposal is on the table today, including a motion for a resolution.
I truly hope that we shall all accept the resolution tomorrow and can petition the European Union Agency on Fundamental Rights to take a position on this law, as that is what it is there for.
In the meantime, it should be quite clear in our common Europe that lesbians and gays will not disappear from families and schools merely because a law prohibits information on them.
Being different is normal, including in this, our common Europe.
