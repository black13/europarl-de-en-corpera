Thank you, Mrs Malmstr√∂m.
That is the first good answer I have received from the Council on this subject.
Thank you.
Nonetheless, I have a brief supplementary question: does the Council intend to address the question of Chechnya again under the Swedish Presidency, because the Russian leadership has issued a series of announcements about changes.
However, action needs to follow and we see none, which is why I would ask that you brief us properly once again on this issue in the run-up to negotiations on the agreement.
We intend to have an urgency debate on this matter tomorrow.
