on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, extremely difficult to summarise this problem in two minutes, but I will try to do it in the style of bullet points.
The dairy sector is in trouble.
Many dairy farmers are seeing their very existence under threat.
The main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sales.
The Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard.
I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry.
Last year, when the price of butter reached more than EUR 4 for a short time, a large proportion of the ice cream industry stopped processing butter fat.
I know the figures for Germany, which show that around 100 000 tonnes is no longer being processed by the food industry, which corresponds to a million tonnes of milk.
We must try to stimulate sales once again, in order to clear these quantities from the market.
I would like to thank the groups that have helped in drawing up our joint motion for a resolution.
Unfortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in this discussion.
Commissioner, as a short-term measure we are calling for an increase in the de minimis subsidies in an additional motion which is being tabled with 40 signatures, because this would be an opportunity to help the smaller dairy farmers in particular.
It would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation.
I know a lot of farmers who are 58 years old and who would like to stop working soon.
An appropriate regulation would be needed for this.
Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for your work.
I would ask you to put in place appropriate regulations to improve the situation of our dairy farmers.
Perhaps you will still have the chance to remedy this situation in the near future.
