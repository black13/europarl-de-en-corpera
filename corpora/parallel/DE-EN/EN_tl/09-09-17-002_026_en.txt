Madam President, Commissioner, Council, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Member Mr Capoulas Santos, who has made this resolution possible.
Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner.
I do not believe that we should leave them in the lurch, but should be honest in our dealings with them.
Yes, short-term measures to overcome the crisis are urgently needed.
Yes, intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom, and additional subsidies, loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified.
However, what is totally unacceptable is, firstly, to start up discussions about milk quotas again and, secondly, to reintroduce tax-funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries.
We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers.
