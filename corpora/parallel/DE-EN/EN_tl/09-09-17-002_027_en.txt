Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world economic crisis has thrown the global market off balance.
As milk producers we are suffering the effects of prices having hit an all-time low.
We are hearing over and over again that the adopted milk quota regulations should be amended.
As a dairy farmer myself, I can only warn you against doing this.
The Commission's intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing.
However, I do not think that this intervention is really a good means of achieving this, because it will result in stocks piling up which could burden a recovering market later on.
I therefore call on the Commission to explain how it is going to deal with this problem.
