on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, energy security is quite rightly on the external policy agenda today.
However, instead of securing power and influence and the last reserves of fossil fuels, instead of insisting on giving priority to dependency, we are, in my opinion, facing completely different challenges when it comes to establishing a sustainable energy policy.
Firstly, there needs to be a global switch to more renewable sources of energy, more energy efficiency and energy saving.
In other words, we do not need disputes about external energy policy - and certainly not if that is all we are going to do - but rather we need intelligently-provided, affordable energy for everyone.
Secondly, energy security must be part of a responsible peace and development policy for the EU.
Access to energy is vital for every individual, for economic development and for the fight against poverty.
A project like Desertec must not therefore be a way of using energy policy as a means to continue colonialism.
What will the people of the African countries, where the population is growing and energy requirements are rising, get from this?
Why have they not up to now been involved on an equal footing in the planning and decision-making processes?
The global energy supply is also part of crisis prevention and peace policies.
This approach is also lacking in the European Union's relations with the South Caucasus and Central Asia.
As energy suppliers - for example Nabucco - these countries are becoming of more and more interest to the EU, but I see no conflict prevention and sustainable development concept at a local level in these countries.
It is time that the EU put an end to an external energy policy that merely increases competition for oil and gas reserves or extends nuclear technology.
Genuine partnerships for renewable energy and for decentralised supply are what is needed now.
