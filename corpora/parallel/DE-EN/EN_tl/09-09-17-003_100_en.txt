Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much liked what the Commissioner described here today with regard to the Desertec project.
This project has huge potential and its appeal indeed lies in the fact that it is made up of many separate small projects.
This will create jobs and will prepare the way for the environmentally sound industrial policy that we are striving for.
I have a question for the Commission.
When you were talking about the Desertec project, I had the feeling that the handbrake was on to some extent.
What concrete measures are planned with regard to network infrastructure, which is a massive problem in connection with the development of renewable energy?
The idea is, of course, to transmit the electricity to Europe via high voltage direct current lines from the deserts.
What supporting measures can the European Commission take with regard to this?
Is something already being considered in this regard?
What can we expect from the next Commission in this area?
