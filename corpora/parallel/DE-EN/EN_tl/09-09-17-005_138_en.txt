Mr President, I am an enthusiastic pro-European and advocate of a European constitution as well as the Treaty of Lisbon.
I am also a fighter for human rights.
However, this resolution inflicts a lot of damage on Europe, particularly in the run-up to the Irish referendum, and it misuses the issue of human rights for ideological purposes.
The Lithuanian law has nothing to do with human rights, but if anything it actually protects the human rights of Lithuanian children rather than violating them.
I therefore consider this resolution to be an ideological disgrace.
The Left and the Liberals in this House have caused serious damage to Europe and to human rights with this resolution.
