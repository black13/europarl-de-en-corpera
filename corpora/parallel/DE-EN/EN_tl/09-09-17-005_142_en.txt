Mr President, the survival of many farms is in serious jeopardy.
I am therefore pleased that we have today adopted a cross-party motion for a resolution on the crisis in the dairy farming sector.
I deeply regret that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in drawing up this motion.
It should be made clear that we cannot overcome this crisis with the measures proposed by the Commission alone.
First and foremost, we must increase the consumption of milk products in order to reduce the strain on the market.
In this regard, the promotion of sales is more important than stockpiling.
Constructive proposals such as the use of milk powder to feed calves, establishing minimum prices for cheese products, clear labelling of cheese analogues and the use of butter fat to assist in the manufacture of ice cream and bakery products have been around for a long time.
Why they have not, as yet, been implemented by the Commission is beyond me.
I would urge the Commissioner to take note of the proposals in the motion for a resolution and implement them as a matter of urgency.
