Mr President, this proposal from the Commission is essentially to be welcomed and it is a sensible one, at least from an economic and politically realistic point of view.
However, it should be added that, if we look at this situation from all angles, the drop in prices is not merely the result of a fall in demand.
We also need to take into account the problems of the dairy farmers in Austria and the Alpine region.
The small domestic farms cannot realistically compete with the huge dairy farms in northern Germany and the Netherlands.
This gives rise to an imbalance.
The release of the entire quantity of milk would force dairy farms in Austria to close down and it would have serious and unpredictable consequences, including for the cultivated landscape.
A few multinational companies would then dominate the European market.
I can well imagine what consequences this would have for food quality as well.
