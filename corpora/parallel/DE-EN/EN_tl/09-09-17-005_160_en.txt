in writing. - I agree with the Commission's short-term solution of purchasing butter and milk powder.
However, I call for a long-term solution to the dairy crisis, for example by using flexible quantity control to give a milk price that covers costs.
The milk surplus must be stemmed at national level by imposing European requirements.
