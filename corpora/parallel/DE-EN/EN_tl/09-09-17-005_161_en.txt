in writing. - The crisis in the dairy sector has also led to a slump in the price of butter and skimmed milk powder.
I welcome the Commission's proposal to continue to subsidise the market and to extend the intervention period up to 28 February 2010.
It is to be hoped that, following this, the market will recover and that prices will once again be determined by supply and demand.
For a limited time, however, I believe that this intervention is necessary and have therefore voted in favour of the rapporteur's proposal.
