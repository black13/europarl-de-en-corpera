in writing. - We saved the banks, because we had to.
That was recognised and accepted by all responsible politicians.
Now we are faced with a situation in the agricultural industry where we need to prevent the imminent bankruptcy of farmers, particularly in the dairy sector, because prices no longer cover production costs.
However, we need to ensure that our production potential is sufficient to supply European citizens with high quality foodstuffs.
I belong to a generation that experienced food rationing and the need to hoard food in order to have enough to eat.
Hopefully, things will never get that bad again.
However, those who have never experienced hunger do not understand how important a strong common agricultural policy is for Europe.
We need security of supply and not just in the energy sector.
I would ask you to consider the fact that, if too many farms in too many regions are forced to cease operating because we are not able or prepared to take the necessary short-term measures that are called for in our resolution, the cost to the EU and the Member States would be many times greater than the cost of taking appropriate short-term measures within the framework of the common agricultural policy.
The army of unemployed is large enough.
Allowing farms to go bust would be irresponsible on social, economic and environmental grounds.
I hope that our warning will be heeded.
