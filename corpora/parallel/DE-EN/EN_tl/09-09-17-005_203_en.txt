in writing. - In recent months a situation has developed on the dairy markets that is threatening the existence of many dairy farmers.
The price of their products has fallen rapidly.
Small and medium-sized farms have been particularly hard hit and they are having to draw on their reserves in order to survive.
For this reason, rapid action by the EU is sought.
The Commission has previously been far too tentative in its attempts to get to grips with the crisis, for which is it partly responsible because of its decision to increase the delivery quotas.
Parliament's initiatives, most of which are also referred to in this motion for a resolution, are therefore even more welcome.
These include, first and foremost, the creation of a milk fund to which EUR 600 million will be allocated, measures for increasing demand for dairy products, greater quality control and precise labelling obligations.
With a view to supporting our farmers, it was therefore a foregone conclusion for me to vote in favour of the proposed motion for a resolution and the measures it contains.
