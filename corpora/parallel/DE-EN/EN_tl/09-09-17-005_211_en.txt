in writing. - This joint motion for a resolution on external aspects of energy security contains important options for Europe's future energy policy.
In particular, I consider the significant increase in the proportion of renewable energy sources in the current energy mix to be particularly important and I am therefore also in favour of the Desertec project planned by a private group of investors.
This is not least intended to reduce the dependence of the EU on individual states from which we have hitherto acquired our fossil fuels.
The planned Nabucco project will not, unfortunately, contribute to this, since, it will leave the EU open to blackmail with regard to the planned accession of Turkey to the EU.
Given the direct influence of the Islamic regime in Turkey, the project in its current form is therefore to be rejected.
For this reason, despite numerous positive elements in this text, I abstained from voting on the text as a whole in the final vote.
