in writing. - The dairy sector is currently in the midst of a crisis on an unprecedented scale: producer prices have fallen dramatically, consumer prices have risen and many farms in the EU are fighting for survival.
The Commission has stood by and watched this development for far too long.
In our motion for a resolution, which is supported by nearly all the groups, we make it clear that the decisions made in November 2008 in connection with the health check are not sufficient for the current situation.
The comprehensive agricultural reform that we have adopted is too little.
If the basic conditions have changed, the Commission must seize the initiative and implement a measure that will help the farmers of the EU.
In our resolution we call for comprehensive measures: market stabilisation, sales promotion, a comprehensive school milk programme, increase of the maximum amount of minimum payments from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 for all areas of agricultural production, an early retirement scheme/quota buy-back scheme, the strengthening of producer organisations, proper labelling of dairy products, export credit insurance similar to that which exists in the US and, for particular measures, the dairy fund.
With this resolution, we are ready to take responsibility for European agriculture.
That is why I voted in favour of the present resolution.
