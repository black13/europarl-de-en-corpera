author. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that my group was somewhat surprised to see the judicial evaluation of a dramatic car accident on the agenda as an urgent resolution on human rights issues.
For the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) it is therefore important to establish that we do not in principle wish to question the judgments made by an independent court, unless we are talking about an obvious show trial that does not comply with any principles of law.
We have already seen this in Iran.
There must be a clear line drawn here.
As far as we are concerned, an independent judicial system is the key element of any democratic order.
That being the case, we must first take account of the judgment handed down.
We must also acknowledge the fact that a person has been killed in a car accident - and we should be saddened by that, indeed we are saddened by that - but also that a judicial review has been carried out.
The fact that Yevgeny Zhovtis, a well-known civil rights activist, is involved in this case has brought it to the attention of the world and has prompted the response, as a result of which we are discussing this here today.
The PPE Group acknowledges Kazakhstan's efforts and progress towards democracy and the rule of law.
We would like to assure Kazakhstan of our explicit support and encourage this country to continue resolutely along this path.
With regard to this particular case, we urge the Kazakh authorities, in their own interests, to provide the public with as much information as possible and to present their view on these events, and to enable a fair appeal or review procedure to be carried out for Mr Zhovtis under the rule of law.
Kazakhstan is to chair the OSCE.
That will be quite a challenge!
