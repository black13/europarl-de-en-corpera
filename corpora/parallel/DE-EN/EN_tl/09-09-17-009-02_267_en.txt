Mr President, first of all I would like to say that I am pleased to see Mrs Hautala back here.
However, she has not been here for a few years and during this time we have had the Council on Thursday afternoons.
The Czech and the German Presidencies were here on Thursdays.
I do not think that we should move the debate, as we cannot get through everything on Wednesday, so we need to be here and we need to force the Council to be here on Thursday afternoons as well.
That is the solution, not condensing the whole agenda into Wednesday.
This is actually a very difficult case.
However, precisely because we cannot yet fully trust the Government of Kazakhstan in respect of the rule of law, we must insist that the case is investigated in an objective manner.
In this regard, I fully support Mrs Jeggle.
We have therefore signed the resolution.
This matter must be investigated objectively and nothing must be covered up or glossed over.
