Mr President, I believe that we should, of course, be very critical of the human rights situation in Syria.
It is a dictatorship and a police state.
Mr Al Hassani must be released.
However, we must also take note of the fact that President Assad - who is becoming more open and opening up his country - and also his father, as Alevites, have, for example, supported the coexistence of Muslims and Christians in such a way that a leading Syrian Christian, Cardinal Daud, told me that Christians in Syria feel safer than they do in Iraq, which is protected by Western troops.
We should therefore be discriminating in our dealings with Syria, denounce the violations of human rights and not give in and stop supporting the country along its path towards rapprochement and openness.
Of course we should be critical, but we should also acknowledge that there are the beginnings of something here that we should encourage.
