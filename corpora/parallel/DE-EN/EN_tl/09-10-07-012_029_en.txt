Mr President, Mr Daul is quite right in what he has just said.
Yes, it is true that Mr Daul is someone who respects all aspects of the freedom of expression.
He is well-known for this.
However, there are clearly some people in Europe who do not respect the freedom of expression to the same extent as Mr Daul does, but instead have a different understanding of the freedom of expression.
That is why we need this debate.
We therefore believe it to be appropriate, given the debate that is going on in one of the Member States, namely Italy, although not only on account of the Italian situation, but on account of the question of whether, as a result of the concentration of economic, political and media power to an extent the like of which we have not known in Europe before, freedom of expression poses a risk to democratic development in Europe.
That is precisely the point that we want to discuss.
We should therefore do that and reject the motion proposed by Mr Daul.
(Applause)
