Mr President, Mr Daul, we are a parliament that should, quite rightly, vote on and take responsibility for providing money for the people in Abruzzo as quickly as possible.
We are also a parliament with a responsibility.
When we debate something, we must subsequently vote on a resolution so that the debate serves a purpose.
We are therefore in favour of adopting a resolution after this debate.
(Applause)
