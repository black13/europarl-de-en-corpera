Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the majority is happy and relieved.
I expect the minority to accept the outcome.
The majority in 27 nations and in the European Parliament has repeatedly said 'yes' to the further development of the European Union.
We can see a democratic majority and a blocking minority.
This 'yes' of the democratic majority was the 'yes' of common sense, a 'yes' to a more democratic, more transparent European Union that is closer to its citizens, the 'yes' of positive pro-European thinkers and actors, a 'yes' to the strengthening of the European Union's position in the world and an important step in the right direction.
We still have a long way to go, because we need a common foreign and security policy in order to be a global player.
We need to continue to further democracy, for example, by allowing the possibility of a European referendum, a uniform European right to vote and many other things.
We have work to do now and we must not waste any time.
I expect the Commission to expedite the reform of the dossier and to begin talks with the Member States regarding the commissioners.
I expect the Council to provide clarity with regard to its position on this outcome.
I also expect us, in Parliament, to improve our communications and dialogue with citizens and to provide them with better information.
We have clearly seen that the better the information, communication and dialogue, the larger the majority.
Politicians who do not believe themselves capable of this are in the wrong place, as are politicians who hide behind referendums because they do not want to approach the citizens themselves and take any responsibility.
The more the debate was focused on Europe, the larger the majority was.
We say 'no' to the nationalisation of European policy and 'no' to national referendums on European matters, except with regard to the accession of one's own country.
