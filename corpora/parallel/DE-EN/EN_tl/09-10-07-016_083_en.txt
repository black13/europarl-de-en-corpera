Mr President, Mr Zahradil asked who will benefit from this.
He thinks it is we parliamentarians.
That may be the case, and it is not such a bad thing if, in a parliamentary democracy, the parliaments - it is, of course, not only about the European Parliament, but the national parliaments as well - benefit to some degree.
However, it is, in fact, the citizens who will benefit if we are able to represent their interests in a stronger and better way.
Mr Schulz has already pointed out that we live in a changing world, a world in which China is strong, India is growing in strength, Brazil is growing in strength and the United States of America is still as strong as ever.
If we look at Washington today, we see that even the new administration is asking what Europe has to say about various issues, from Afghanistan to other matters.
Do we have a clear statement and a clear language in this regard?
If not, we will not be taken seriously.
Russia is always trying to play the EU Member States off against one another because that is, of course, more satisfying for our partners.
To anyone who today is still fighting this treaty in the erroneous belief that it is a treaty that strengthens the European Union, I would say: those who fight this treaty are, in actual fact, strengthening our so-called partners or, if you like, our opponents.
It has already been said that, yes, we still have a few institutional issues to resolve, in particular in connection with the External Action Service.
However, let us not attempt to conduct further institutional debates now.
Our citizens want a clear and substantive answer.
They want us to speak forcefully on matters to do with climate protection, security issues, financial regulation.
In every single case, we can show that Lisbon brings improvement.
However, our arguments must have substance so that people do not feel that the European Union is only concerned about itself, but can see that it is concerned about the interests of its citizens.
