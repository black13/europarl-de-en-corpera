Mr President, I also had a question for Mr Karas that I will perhaps still raise.
I will direct my question to Mr Swoboda - since Mrs Lunacek has already criticised our Chancellor, Mr Faymann, and his party colleagues.
What is his position, as a social democrat, with regard to the suggestion by his national party leader and Federal Chancellor to hold a referendum in Austria?
