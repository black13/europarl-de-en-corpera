Mr President, I do not think that we should be conducting an internal Austrian debate here, but one thing is perfectly clear and that is that there will be no referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon in Austria either.
That is absolutely clear.
The Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified and must enter into force as soon as possible.
That is my, and our, opinion.
