Mr President, in all of the debates we have had over the past few years on the Treaty of Lisbon, even its supporters have always said that this treaty is not as good as it could be, that it has a lot of shortcomings, and that it is, in fact, a not particularly successful compromise.
Now these supporters are happy because this treaty is close to being implemented, and that is fair enough.
However, when we now hear these supporters say that the majority has given its opinion in a democratic way and the minority will simply have to accept that, they are indeed right, but I would have expected to hear that statement after the first referendum in Ireland, too.
After all, one thing is clear: we do not know whether this treaty will be beneficial for the European Union or whether - as I believe - it will be disastrous.
I believe that it will result in a centralised superstate.
One thing is clear, however: this Europe will only be a good Europe if it is a democratic one.
A democracy in which voting takes place until the establishment obtains the result it wants is not a democracy.
I hope therefore that we will not now attempt to put pressure on the Czech President in order to finish the job as quickly as possible.
