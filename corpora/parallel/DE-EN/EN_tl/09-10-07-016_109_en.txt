Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, I am very sorry that those who, during the first referendum, spread lies during the Irish campaign now have to admit that the parliaments of 26 countries have ratified the treaty, that Ireland has ratified the treaty in a referendum and that so far, all decisions by the constitutional courts regarding the Treaty of Lisbon have been positive.
They cannot get away from this fact.
Secondly, compared to the Treaty of Nice, the Treaty of Lisbon is a treaty of the parliaments and the citizens and therefore, a treaty for more democracy.
Thirdly, I would like to thank the Irish Members, the Irish people and also their opposition leader, Enda Kenny, who should be included in the list mentioned.

I cannot believe that the Czech President would rather adhere to the letter-borne requests of the opposition leader of a country that has already ratified the treaty than the views of his own parliament and his own constitutional court.
It would be like a French opposition leader writing to the British Queen and asking her not to sign a law passed by the House of Commons.
One last thing: Mrs Malmstr√∂m, I would ask you to take seriously the views that we expressed yesterday in the committees regarding the European External Action Service.
