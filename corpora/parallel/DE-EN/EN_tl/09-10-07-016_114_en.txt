Mr President, it is a disgrace to democracy that the established politicians are denying their citizens a referendum in their own Member States while demanding two referendums in Ireland.
It is also a disgrace that these politicians are demanding that we accept the outcome of the second referendum when they did not, in fact, accept the outcome of the first one.
Irrespective of whether this Constitution Reform Treaty of Lisbon enters into force or not, we need a new basic treaty.
This new basic treaty should include the genuine separation of powers, a truly independent court of justice for matters relating to subsidiarity, total transparency and economy and, most importantly, binding referendums.
This way, we can still escape the Europe trap, and this is something that we should put all our efforts into doing.
