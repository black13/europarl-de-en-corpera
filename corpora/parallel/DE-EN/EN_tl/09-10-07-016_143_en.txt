Mr President, after eight years and many debates and negotiations, there is a real chance now that this Reform Treaty will enter into force, thanks also to the hard work of many people in this House who were committed to this project from beginning to end in the Convention and later in the intergovernmental conferences.
I believe that Parliament has played a constructive part in this Reform Treaty.
I think that, if the constitutional court in Prague in the Czech Republic gives a positive ruling, there will no longer be any legal grounds for President Klaus to block the EU any further.
The other constitutional bodies in the Czech Republic will also find ways to overcome any such illegal blockade.
We are, of course, hearing that there is a new threat of trouble from the United Kingdom.
However, if a British Government were to allow a referendum, then it would not be on the Treaty of Lisbon but on whether the British people are in favour of the EU or whether they want to pull out of Europe.
That would have to be the subject of the referendum and not a treaty that has been ratified.
That would be totally unacceptable.
I think we need to learn something from this, and that is that our citizens need more information.
I therefore hope that, in the new Commission, we will also get a vice-president for communication and for information and perhaps even a commissioner for European citizenship.
That would be the answer to these controversies on European policy.
