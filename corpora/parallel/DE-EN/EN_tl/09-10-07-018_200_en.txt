Mr President, the whole ratification process for the Constitution Reform Treaty of Lisbon was a tragedy for democracy and also for the European Union.
Perhaps you would allow me, as a new, young MEP, to say that, through referendums for all citizens in the European Union, we had the opportunity, historically, to unite the very elitist drawing board project of the European Union with the people of Europe.
You had the opportunity to use referendums to breathe life and spirit into the emotional wreck of the European Union.
However, you did not utilise this opportunity.
On the contrary, you quite simply said 'no' to more direct democracy and 'no' to citizen participation.
All I can say to that is that this is not what I call democracy.
Democracy requires the separation of powers and a clear line between opposition and government.
That is what we stand for and that is what we are fighting for.
