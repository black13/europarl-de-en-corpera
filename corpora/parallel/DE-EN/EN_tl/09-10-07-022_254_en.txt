Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial preconditions for market access for airlines have, of course, already been discussed in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
The issue of guarantee funds was brought up then, but it was clearly not considered sufficiently important or significant by the majority at that time.
Now we are seeing cases which indeed give us cause for consideration and for regulation, because we need regulation in this area.
Firstly, we need to continually ensure that the passenger rights that we are adopting here for the protection of consumers are complied with.
The issue of denied boarding and the many cases of this that we have unfortunately seen show that any existing loopholes are utilised immediately.
That requires our attention and it requires regulation.
We will probably have to resort to the solution of a guarantee fund or some sort of insurance in order to adequately protect passengers from such business practices.
We only need to look closely at the last case: even on the final day, there were still announcements stating that everything was alright and many people believed that.
For this sort of solution, however, it must be guaranteed that all parties involved pay their fair share and that it does not result in a few airlines, including low cost airlines, sitting back in comfort and letting others bear the risk.
A fair market will not only protect passengers from unfair practices, it will protect the competitors, too.
