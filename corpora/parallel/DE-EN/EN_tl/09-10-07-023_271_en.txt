Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2001, the European Council reached a decision on the Statute for a European company.
For various reasons, this Statute did not enter into force in this form until 8 October 2004.
As is customary with European Union legislation, the Commission was asked, after a certain time, to submit a report on the application and implementation of the Statute in order to draw conclusions about whether there is a need for amendments to this legal act.
The date I mentioned, 8 October 2004, was almost exactly five years ago.
The deadline was five years, but there is no report from the European Commission.
Since we all obey the law and the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, is particularly required to obey the law, this gave the Committee on Legal Affairs cause to ask why this report is not available and why it has not even been prepared.
We quite simply want to give the Commission the opportunity to justify this to us.
In any case, this will make it clear that Parliament, and the Committee on Legal Affairs in particular, is fulfilling in full its obligation to monitor the Commission.
I will not use my five minutes' speaking time, but would be pleased if the Commission would now provide an answer on the basis of this short oral question that I have posed.
