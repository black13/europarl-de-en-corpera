Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy.
Mr President, would you be sitting here today if, in Western Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, Italian conditions had paved the way for Belusconi-isation?
What we are concurrently discovering, however, is that it is not only Italy that is a problem, but that a Belusconi-isation of Europe is taking place and that is very, very dangerous.
As a member of the Convention to draft the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, I was able to witness how tough a struggle there was about this key issue of the concentration of the media.
Unfortunately, due to the resistance of certain forces, we did not succeed at that point in making progress.
Almost 10 years later, we are paying the price.
This is a highly dangerous development.
If I take a look just at a single country in which I worked for many years: what happened to the assault gun of democracy, as Spiegel magazine once called it, under the real conditions of the new economic concentration?
Why, moreover, have we not, under these conditions, where Europe really is required in this area of freedom of the press and expression which is so crucial, had the progress that so many Europeans have been waiting for, for which, in fact, some of them started revolutions?
Where is this directive?
Mrs Reding, what are you afraid of?
What forces are at work here?
Are those forces called Murdoch, or something else?
Turning now to public service television - in Austria, that is where 62% of the population get their information from.
So, who controls it?
It is almost exclusively the governing political parties.
When I look at the government apparatus in Germany, I can see that, there too, the wrong people are at the helm.
We need freedom of the press - and not just in Italy!
