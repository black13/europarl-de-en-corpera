Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Mauro something.
In preparing this debate, I spoke with him a number of times.
He was in my office yesterday, and we have a very, very cooperative relationship.
That is why I feel able to ask the following questions without a surge of emotions.
Can you imagine that the reason for the complex debate in Italy is that Italy is, to my knowledge, the only democratic state in which the largest media operator is also the Head of Government?
Could it be that this combination of interests is precisely the reason that we are having this debate?
(Applause)
