Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of Mr Mauro's persuasive speech, suddenly even Mr Schulz has conceded that it would be a good thing for us to talk about Europe as a whole now.
Alas, the title of today's debate is Italy.
I can absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about Europe as a whole.
If, for example, I were to look at the media interests of Germany's Social Democrats, I would observe that they own 90% of the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau and that the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) owns 57% of the Neue Westf√§lische newspaper and holds an interest in the WAZ media group.
The largest source of income for the SPD today is its media interests.
I can therefore absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about ownership in other cases, but instead only want to discuss Italy.
This debate is fizzling out because of the situation in Italy and the positive statements that we are hearing.
I am not Italian, as you can tell when I speak, but the most convincing argument that comes to my mind is the question of what was the matter between 2006 and 2008 when Italy had a leftist government and, of course, at that time - as Mr Mauro has pointed out - everything was fine and dandy.
There were no legislative proposals tabled by the then government to finally end the concentration of the media, though the power was there.
Today, when there is once again a clear majority for the conservative parties in Italy, there are suddenly problems again.
This debate must not give way to dishonesty.
As long as the socialists, the leftists in this House, no longer have arguments to back us into a corner, I can very happily carry on with this debate!
