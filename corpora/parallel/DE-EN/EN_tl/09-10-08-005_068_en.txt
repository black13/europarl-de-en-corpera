Madam President, before I make my personal observations, I would like to start by raising a point of order.
I do not believe that any member of the Commission or the Council, or even of this very House, should be expected to address the House in the conditions that Mrs Reding faced just now.
It is just not acceptable!
(Applause)
I therefore ask the Bureau to consider how we can bring an end to this dishonourable state of affairs whereby, during the final stages of debates and during ongoing statements, conversations can be held here, such as between Vice-President Vidal-Quadras and his former colleague up there, who are interested in absolutely nothing other than their bilateral relations.
I do not believe that that is acceptable.
I would ask the Bureau again to give some consideration to this.
I would now like to make a comment on something that Mr Weber said.
Mr Weber addressed me personally in the debate on the freedom of the press in Italy and brought up the media interests of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
(Uproar)
As a Member of this House, but also a member of the executive of my party, I would like to say that I have some sympathy for Mr Weber.
Anyone who has lost as many votes as the Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria and my party needs to ensure that he attracts attention.
(Uproar)
I would just like to point out that the media interests of the SPD in their present form are the result of the restitution of the German media after its expropriation by the Nazis and by the Communists in the GDR.
We German Social Democrats are proud of our media interests!
