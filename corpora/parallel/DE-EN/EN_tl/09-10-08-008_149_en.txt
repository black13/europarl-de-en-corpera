The joint motion for a resolution on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh contains a great many positive elements.
It plainly points out, for example, the difficulties with the fiscal policy stimulatory measures that have been implemented by the majority of states.
The consolidation of national budgets must be given a significant role over the coming years.
I also welcome the fact that an attempt is being made to get to grips with the causes of the crisis, with reference being made to unbridled speculation and the lack of regulation in the financial market.
This has only been done in a superficial way, however.
There is no penetration through to real, needed reforms.
Given the immense crisis that we still find ourselves in and that will, sadly, still bring us many more unemployed, this is far too little.
It is for that reason that I have abstained from voting.
