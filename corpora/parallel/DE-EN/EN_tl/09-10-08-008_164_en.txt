Developing countries have been hard hit by the current financial and economic crisis, which was caused by banks and other speculators in the United States.
This has a massive impact on their already weak economies and will put millions more people out of work.
The unemployed will, where possible, seek their salvation in Europe, thereby increasing the migration pressure on Europe even further.
We Europeans must therefore support these countries in building up their economies.
The current form of development aid is an unsuitable tool for this purpose, as lots of funds disappear into dark channels or are diverted back into European bank accounts belonging to corrupt despots.
For this reason, despite numerous positive ideas, I abstained from voting on the Committee on Development's motion in the final vote.
