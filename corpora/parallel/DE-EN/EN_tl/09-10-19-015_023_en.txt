Mr President, I should like to support and speak in favour of the motion.
Not every issue in Europe is an issue for Europe.
We practise subsidiarity and we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have confidence in our colleagues in the parliament in Rome and trust in the Roman courts, in the Italian courts, which can rule independently on what is good for Italy and what is not good for Italy.
The Italian parliament has just proven that it is independent.
We are happy to debate freedom of opinion, but then we should also debate freedom of opinion in the European Union.
That must be clear in the motion and its title, which is why we are asking for support for our motion.
