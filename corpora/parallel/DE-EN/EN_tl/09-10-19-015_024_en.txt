Mr President, this is actually something of a humiliating spectacle.
We said clearly beforehand that this started with the Italian case, but we do not want to concentrate on that.
We want to say something in general about freedom of opinion in Europe.
That is why we chose this title; it is about the case that started in Italy, but it is also about general statements.
We should not try and do everything.
For weeks, we have tried again and again to put the starting case to one side.
At least be honest: if you say we want to defend Berlusconi, whatever he does, that is an honest position, but now you are acting as if you wanted to be neutral, to be objective.
Let us stick to this title.
That is reasonable.
(Applause)
