Mr President, one short comment and one request to you, Mr President: on Thursday, we shall be discussing, among other things, the terrible death penalties in Iran, which are totally unacceptable and which are often handed down for so-called crimes which, under our sense of justice, are not even prosecuted.
We should take this opportunity to say clearly - and perhaps you should find an opportunity, like the Council, to say that, because we are against violence, we condemn terrorist violence in general, even if it is directed against the government bodies of Iran.
I think that our objective position would be stronger if we said clearly that the attack that cost 42 people their lives is not in keeping with our policy.
We are against violence, against the death penalty and also against terrorist violence as a matter of principle.
