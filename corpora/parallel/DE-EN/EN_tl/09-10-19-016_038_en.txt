Mr President, the extraordinarily dangerous Temel√≠n nuclear power plant, at which there have already been 127 incidents since 2000, is very close to where I come from in Upper Austria and there is another close to Vienna at Mochovce in the Slovak Republic.
Together, they form an unpleasant cocktail of old Soviet design and American engineering.
From a legal point of view, the whole issue is problematic, as environmental impact assessments are not carried out in compliance with European legislation in either country.
The parties to the proceedings have no possibility of obtaining judicial review of the final decision.
That contradicts Article 10 of the Community Directive on environmental impact assessments.
I should like to take this opportunity to call on the Community to firmly oppose this construction project.
