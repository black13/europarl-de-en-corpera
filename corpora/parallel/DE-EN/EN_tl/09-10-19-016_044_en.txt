Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'equal pay for equal work' is a principle of the 1957 Treaty establishing the European Community.
This principle is still topical today because, although more and more women occupy managerial positions, there is still a blatant income divide.
It is incomprehensible that women, merely because they are women rather than men, are paid a lower wage for the same work, especially the same standard of work.
The benefit to a modern democratic society when it finally fully implements this principle, which we should rather call a demand, should be clear and obvious to everyone.
I therefore think it is important for something to be done to improve current laws and wage transparency.
One small example is Austria, where the income divide is about 28%.
