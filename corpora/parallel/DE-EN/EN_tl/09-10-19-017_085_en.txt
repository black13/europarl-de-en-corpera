Mr President, we need a democratic revolution.
You just heard what the previous speaker said; we often see that when you go too far too fast, you achieve the opposite of what you were actually trying to achieve.
The motto of this group is that if the European Union develops too fast, it will result in precisely what it does not want, namely new nationalism.
That is what we are seeing at the moment in my country.
I come from what has become a divided country; in the west, in Voralberg and a bit beyond, we are happy about the open borders, while in the east, you can see that we have gone too far too fast with Schengen.
What we are getting in return is new revanchism and nationalism in my country and elsewhere.
We must not hide behind technical debates.
We need to face up to these challenges.
Of course, this must necessarily mean that the European Parliament is granted codecision rights and that you, Commissioner, must wait until we have this codecision or it is at least granted to us by default.
