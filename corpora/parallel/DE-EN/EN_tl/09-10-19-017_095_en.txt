Madam President, as you know, there are now 28 countries, including 25 EU Member States, which have done away with passenger traffic controls at common borders.
This degree of freedom of movement obviously depends on broad-based trust between the states concerned.
It is absolutely necessary for the free movement of passenger traffic to be sustainably regulated by effective flanking measures.
Of central importance in this context is efficient supervision and control of the external borders, which - as we know - are to be carried out to a uniform standard through the Schengen Information System and by introducing harmonised entry requirements for third country nationals.
However, we are still miles away from that.
Compliance with accompanying mechanisms is therefore an essential factor for the security of EU citizens.
My country, Austria, is particularly affected, due to its geographical proximity to the eastern European states.
You only need think in this context of the latest incidents during the confiscation of a refrigerated lorry in Austria, which was found to contain 64 illegal Kurdish immigrants being smuggled from Turkey, via Hungary and Austria, to Germany.
This case shows how important it is to be able to rely on proper and effective control of external borders and how rare that is the case.
In internal affairs, we also have to battle with increasing crime in numerous regions of Europe which, increasingly often, stems from organised, cross-border gangs.
This being so, I believe that we should carefully consider temporarily re-introducing controls at internal borders.
As you know, this proved to be very effective during the 2008 UEFA Championship.
As the introduction of an evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis is a core concern of the Member States and, more to the point, of their citizens, I believe it is very important for the European Parliament, as the representative of the citizens, to be involved in these decisions.
