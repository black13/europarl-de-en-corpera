Thank you Madam President.
I shall try to keep to my speaking time.
In principle, we welcome the introduction of SIS II and its functionality.
In my time as Minister for the Interior at the beginning of this millennium, I lobbied intensively for this system.
At that time, we were promised that it would be introduced in 2007, one reason being that we urgently needed it for the new Member States so that they could participate in this security architecture.
The new Member States are here, but SIS II is still not here.
The delay needs to be relentlessly analysed and investigated.
There must also be clear consequences.
We should learn from past experiences for the future.
We must admit that the Commission has done everything to advance the SIS II project, including putting up with less than perfect test results.
However, we must not forget that it makes no sense to make too big a compromise here because it would be at the expense of the stability and reliability of the system.
We should therefore prevent any additional financial burden for the Member States which might come out of the analysis or the tests and any further delay in the system.
What we need for this is 100% transparency, as well as clear language for those implementing the project on the Commission's behalf, and that must also mean that, where necessary, there are financial consequences for these project managers.
