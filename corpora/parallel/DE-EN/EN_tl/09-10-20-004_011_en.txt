Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the request to use the urgent procedure put forward by the Commission is certainly not perfect.
I can partially agree with what the previous speaker said.
However, to not allow this request to use the urgent procedure now would send completely the wrong signals to the dairy farmers, who are expecting at least initial responses.
That is why I support this request to use the urgent procedure.
In the course of this procedure, we will have the opportunity to improve the motion by means of amendments and, as Mr HÃ¤usling suggested, to cede powers.
It is absolutely the case that there are possibilities to put a time limit on these powers so that we only give the Commission a power for two years before we then decide on the matter again.
I would therefore ask for your support in order to put this request for use of the urgent procedure on the agenda.
(Applause)
