Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Carlgren, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of climate change will keep us occupied much longer than the financial and economic crisis.
There are parallels - both cost lots of money, and Copenhagen will be about reaching an agreement on the financial tools for the third world and the developing countries.
The Copenhagen conference must succeed, and we can play our part in achieving that.
Yesterday, we did a good job, we adopted the resolution in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by a large majority, and I think that the resolution will achieve a large majority here in Parliament, and in so doing, we will change the political climate as Copenhagen approaches.
There is often a psychological side to it, and we should all play our part in that.
I do still have one specific concern.
In the European Parliament, we have worked to get aviation included in emissions trading, and in the end we succeeded.
I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to ensure that this subject is pursued consistently in Copenhagen.
We must achieve international agreement to the effect that shipping, and also aviation, are incorporated into the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.
This is because these two transport sectors are growing to a disproportionate degree and are therefore contributing in a disproportionate way to global warming.
We should not exceed the 2 degree Celsius mark.
That, in fact, is where the parallels between the financial crisis and climate change cease.
If we go over this mark, we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and that means that it is damage that we will not be able to reverse.
