Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a gathering involving the Health Commissioner, Mrs Vassiliou, and medical experts from across Europe a few days ago in Brussels discussed the subject of 'Health and climate change'.
It was a very informative event entitled 'Prescription for a healthy planet'.
The President of the Standing Committee of European Doctors (CPME) used a very good image - the patient planet Earth is like a person suffering from a serious illness.
The later you intervene, the more painful is the treatment and there comes a point when it is even too late for treatment.
At that point, the patient is damaged beyond recovery.
That is why we need to act quickly and determinedly for patient planet Earth.
I hope that we all agree on that.
It is equally as true that climate change affects everyone - every country on earth and every sector of the European economy.
I see an imbalance - we put very heavy burdens on the traditional participants in European emissions trading, yet they represent less than 50% of the European Union's emissions.
We therefore need more shoulders to bear the burden - we decided that last night.
We also adopted Amendments 198 to 202 on the inclusion of aviation - as mentioned by Mr Groote - and marine transport.
Perhaps this needs to be better worked out and differentiated, but it is a move in the right direction.
The Commission and the Council must finally get more involved in this regard.
At the EU summit in the run-up to Pittsburgh, and in Pittsburgh itself, no progress at all was made on this.
The Council and the Commission must do more in this connection.
I have one final word to add.
Other regions in the world, too, must do more.
I am pleased that Barack Obama has won the Nobel Peace Prize, but if he does not come to Copenhagen and if he does not put forward a decent proposal, then he will be frittering away his credibility and, for that reason, he must deliver something at Copenhagen.
