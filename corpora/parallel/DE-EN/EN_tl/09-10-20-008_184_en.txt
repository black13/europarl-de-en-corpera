Under the current regulations, where a shipment that violates animal protection laws is discovered, the authorities must, following a 'seizure' for animal protection reasons, hand back to the owner any unvaccinated animal young that have been separated from their mothers much too early once the problem has been rectified.
In practice, of course, this situation is shamelessly exploited.
This codification would be a good opportunity to amend the EU Transport Regulation so that pups could be seized on a permanent basis in the case of shipments that are not in accordance with the rules, thereby closing this back door.
Unfortunately, we have allowed this opportunity to be missed.
All the same, the codification overall does seem to effect an improvement of the regulations on animal protection, for which reason I voted in favour of the report.
