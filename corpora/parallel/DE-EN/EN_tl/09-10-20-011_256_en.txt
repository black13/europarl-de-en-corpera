Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, you are calling for us to leave behind the economic stimulus programmes soon and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be quickly reduced.
Yet even your most recent forecast promises growth in EU GDP of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
For 2009 as a whole, that would represent a 4% decrease.
According to your own forecasts, unemployment rates in the EU will rise to over 11% in 2010.
Do you not think that early, drastic cuts in public expenditure could stop the small beginnings of recovery in their tracks?
Or do you believe that the financial sector, for the moment, has got over the problem and the ordinary people should bear the costs of the crisis?
Already, you are forcing scandalous conditions for EU emergency credit on the people of Latvia, Hungary and Romania: lower wages, lower pension benefits, fewer public services and higher VAT.
Is that your idea of a social Europe?
