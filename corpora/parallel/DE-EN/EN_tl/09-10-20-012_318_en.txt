draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety takes the view time and again - this year included - that the funds provided in the European budget absolutely do not suffice to provide effective environmental programmes, to maintain our biodiversity and for a fight against climate change that has a chance of succeeding.
The fact that the Council makes even further cuts from these meagre funds is as incomprehensible as ever.
That is why 'back to the preliminary draft budget' is the standard response.
There are two things that we must impress on the Commission.
The first of these is that we expect it to immediately include what are known as the 'assigned revenues' for those agencies that are partly dependent on fees - such as the European Medicines Agency in London or the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki - in the preliminary draft budget and not to achieve an artificial margin by omitting them.
The second point is that we expect the Commission to bring forward a proposal as soon as possible for how it will fund the anti-smoking campaign Help in future after the tobacco fund has run out.
You see, it is the same every time.
