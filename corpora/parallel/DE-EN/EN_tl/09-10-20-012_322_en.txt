draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the budget for the Committee on Agriculture I would like to thank the overall rapporteur, Mr Surj√°n, for his constant willingness to talk in order to find a compromise.
This is necessary as European agricultural policy is, at present, the only policy area where responsibility lies fully at the Community level.
It is right that the funds for school milk, school fruit and a few other projects have been increased.
Stockpiling and export refunds, however, were even being labelled as yesterday's tools two years ago.
At this moment, they are indispensable tools to overcome the crisis on the markets.
We are therefore calling for an increase of approximately EUR 81 million for stockpiling from 2009 to 2010 and of approximately EUR 440 million for export refunds and we will be voting in favour of these.
Nonetheless, this is actually too little at this time.
As before, I would, of course, have preferred EUR 600 million when it comes to the dairy fund.
The EUR 300 million that we are now calling for for 2010 is what is absolutely necessary and I ask that this money be fixed in the budget on a permanent basis as the dairy fund.
That would be the right signal to send, and also an important one.
The situation on the agricultural markets is drastic.
The Commission has put its hopes in self-regulation for far too long.
The agricultural markets, too, need budgetary and general policy frameworks and rules.
