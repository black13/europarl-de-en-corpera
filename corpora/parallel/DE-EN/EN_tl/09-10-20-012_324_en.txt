draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Commission and the Council, why are the Council's cuts, which we have to implement every single year in different policy areas, so stupid, so wrong and so short-sighted?
The answer is because they are not oriented towards the common European interest, and that is what I criticise from a political standpoint.
You, as the Council, and the Member States are also encompassed by common European responsibility, and our European expenditure is expenditure for our common European interest.
It is absolutely incomprehensible that the funding for training and education could be cut at this point.
One of our most successful programmes is the student exchange programme that enables our young people to study in Europe, to get out into the world.
Why are you cutting back on that?
We need to do more for culture, cultural exchange and town twinning because these make Europe real and generate acceptance of Europe from the bottom up.
And how can we cut back on the communications policy, where we have agreed that there is a need to really let the voters and the citizens know about the European Union's positive achievements?
I can only observe, regrettably, as has been said already, that this type of cuts is completely counterproductive from a political point of view.
