Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only in the figures that the crisis shows up, in the falling markets and in the billions of euros spent on propping up the banks and re-initiating our economy.
It can also be seen in the exploding unemployment figures.
This crisis can be seen most of all in the very real fears and anxieties of the citizens of the European Union.
They fear for their jobs and they fear for their pensions.
Our citizens are worried about climate change, about energy supplies and about the curtailing of their individual rights in the fight against terrorism.
The EU can make a positive contribution to calming the thoroughly justified fears of its citizens, even if, at present, there is a need for the relevant processes to be made more effective and efficient.
In this regard, I am primarily thinking of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for example, in the case of Nokia, and of the Solidarity Fund to support the Italian earthquake victims.
In order for the money from these funds to actually reach those affected, I think it is important both to redesign these processes to be more efficient and to ensure crystal clear oversight, as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund must in no way be confused with an EU back-up for the multinationals.
Europe was a guarantee for peace and prosperity for a long time.
Let us work together to make sure that it continues to be just that.
We are Europe.
