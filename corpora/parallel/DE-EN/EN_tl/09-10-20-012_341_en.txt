Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of the world economic crisis in which we currently find ourselves cannot yet be foreseen.
We have to be aware that the crisis still has not hit the labour market with its full force.
What does the European Union do in this situation, where more and more people are threatened by poverty and unemployment and fear for their existence?
The European Union decides on new focal areas in its budget.
Or, to be more precise, it adjusts its finances in favour of a sealing off of its borders, in favour of hi-tech military projects and in favour of a more and more sophisticated monitoring of Europe's citizens.
Believe it or not, there is to be an increase of 16% for the area of freedom, security and justice.
The fund to secure the external borders is to receive 12% more funding next year.
The expenditure on strategic military security research is being almost doubled and will now rise to a total of EUR 215 million.
From the point of view of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, this means that the EU is taking leave of its founding idea of being a peace project for Europe.
This draft budget instead follows the logic of the Treaty of Lisbon, with its obligation on the part of the Member States to constantly modernise their military apparatus and to secure the external borders.
Europe's Left instead demands that the European Union implement a consistent peace policy.
Instead of an agency for armament, we call for a disarmament agency.
Europe must concentrate its resources on civilian conflict resolution strategies such as a Europe-wide civilian peace corps and promoting independent research into peace and conflicts.
In our view, this budget sets our sights increasingly on war instead of on crisis management and the Left in the European Parliament will not, therefore, support this budget.
