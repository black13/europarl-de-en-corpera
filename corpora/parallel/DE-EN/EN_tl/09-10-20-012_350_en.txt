Madam President, Commissioner, I think that, with this budget, we have succeeded once again in developing new strategies.
I am pleased that the House has decided to support the Small Business Act, at least with EUR 1 million for obligations and EUR 500 000 for payments.
Commissioner Verheugen has promised that he will use these funds accordingly.
We have also increased the allocation for the programme of research for small and medium-sized businesses.
Doing so is especially important in a crisis situation, and the SOLVIT programme is also to be significantly reinforced.
This relates to getting across borders within the internal market, which often represents a very particular challenge for small and medium-sized enterprises.
I am pleased that the 'ERASMUS for journalists' programme is finally on the agenda and that 'ERASMUS for young entrepreneurs' is successfully operating.
