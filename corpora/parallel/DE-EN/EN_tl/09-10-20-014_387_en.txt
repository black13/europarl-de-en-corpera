Mr President, Commissioner, what you have just had to say did sound very good, but politicians must always have an eye on whether their actions live up to their words.
I have a question for you, namely how can it be that, over the last five years, it has only been male high-ranking members of the Commission that I have had the opportunity of working with?
How can it be that the Commission does not have gender parity in its composition?
It also appears that it will not be possible for the Commission to have a balanced gender make-up in future, either.
Would it not be a good thing to set an example for once, in order to be much more credible when taking further steps?
