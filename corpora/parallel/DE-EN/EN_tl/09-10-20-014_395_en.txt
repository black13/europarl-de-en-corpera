Mr President, you are an impressive example of multilingualism.
First of all, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether a similar project to the one he mentioned, namely between Austria and Hungary and between Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, could not be put in place between Hungary and Slovakia?
That would certainly be very beneficial and useful from a political point of view.
My second point is that I believe that there should be more real-life learning of the languages of the neighbouring countries in border regions, such as Czech in eastern Bavaria, but that this should not be restricted to schools.
In Schirnding, for example, we have a German-Czech nursery school.
Could you also support nurseries?
I am also interested in adult learning - lifelong learning - whereby older generations in border regions, too, have an opportunity to learn the neighbouring language.
