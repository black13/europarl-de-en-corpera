Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the fact that this request to use the urgent procedure was passed here in Parliament today by a large majority.
In this way, we have sent a signal to our dairy farmers and have not shied away from the responsibility.
In contrast to a minority of my fellow Members from other groups, we see, in this request to use the urgent procedure, an additional tool to get help to dairy farmers at a difficult time.
It is certainly true that this request from the Commission did come very late in the day and that it is less than what is possible.
That said, it is always better than doing nothing at all.
The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back programme also diverge widely.
The programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all.
Yet I see no majority for that in this Parliament or in the Council.
Furthermore, such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas.
The indication that quotas are to be raised for priority groups is a decision that is already the law in force.
The inclusion of milk and milk products in Article 186 for immediate measures in the event of market disturbances is to be welcomed.
Nonetheless, I will be tabling an amendment to the effect that this measure should be restricted to two years.
If it proves its worth, we will then agree to an extension.
Finally, I would like to say thank you for the EUR 280 million.
Commissioner, you have indeed largely accommodated Parliament.
I know that you do not have any more money available to you.
I ask that the - possibly amended - motion for a resolution be approved on Thursday.
