Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, finally there is movement in this debate.
The Commission must now bear the overall responsibility again.
This morning, we saw something different, although we would have liked Parliament to have been more involved.
Let me say quite clearly that we are not against financial support.
We must be clear, however, that such support is just a drop in the ocean, in the truest sense of the expression.
The decisions made in Luxembourg unfortunately also did not help us bring about a rebalancing of supply and demand - which is, of course, the crucial element here.
The voluntary buying up of quotas is all well and good, but it will not have a major impact as it does not contribute significantly to a reduction in volume.
I already mentioned yesterday that we must give proper consideration to the Court of Auditors' report and set about implementing a policy aimed at the long term and that we need to look at what the Court of Auditors has said.
The Court said that we need supplies to be managed in future or else the whole system will be incapable of being financed, and we need a dairy policy based on quality products in the European market.
We must move away from export refunds as quickly as possible - this is an old demand on our part and we have often pointed out the disastrous consequences of these measures.
We really need a policy that goes beyond this current crisis and we also expect longer-term answers from the Commission.
Regrettably, the Commission has not given us such answers so far, specifically as regards how we need to strengthen the producer organisations in order to give them more market power and restrain the supermarket chains.
