Mr President, unfortunately, Mr Bov√© cannot be here tonight, so I am speaking again.
I have more questions for the Commissioner.
Does she really, seriously believe that paying out this money will end the protests?
As I said earlier, I believe that Parliament's decision this morning equated to granting the Commission a blank cheque because we do not know what it will do with it.
I will say it again: the Commission is not part of the solution to the problem, but is actually part of the problem.
I stand by that view.
Yet I also simply accept the decision - as you have to see the facts as they are and this is what has been decided - and I would say to the other Members that we must limit these measures.
We should limit them to a manageable period, so that we in Parliament can also get our hand back on the tiller.
I have another question for you, Commissioner, as it is repeatedly said for all the programmes that we need to continue to promote restructuring.
So what do you mean by restructuring?
Do you really think it is right that we continue to give out money in order basically to encourage smaller-scale farmers to give up so that we can give money to the bigger farms?
This policy is no longer an effective means to an end.
We must ensure that we employ the money in a targeted way, specifically in the disadvantaged regions, in order to maintain the structures in those regions that are in greatest jeopardy.
