Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a farmer, I see the tabled amendment of Articles 78 and 79 as a deviation by the Commission from its hitherto sound route through agricultural reform at the expense of efficient and forward-looking farms.
It is dangerous to tamper, simply because of a desire to do something, so close to the final phasing out of the milk quota system, a system that has really been to the disadvantage of dairy farmers hitherto.
It has also been left behind by developments on the ground, as the market is currently finally beginning to recover.
I therefore reject this amendment.
It is easy to see how the Commission is seeking to exploit Parliament's call for urgent measures for its own ends.
It is doing this by attempting, shortly before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure for itself permanent scope to act without Parliament's consent through this amendment of Article 186.
I therefore reject this amendment.
However, I could live with Parliament granting the Commission scope to act for a limited period in cases of crisis.
This ability would also be available to Parliament in future times of crisis, with very rapid effect, through Rule 142 of its Rules of Procedure.
