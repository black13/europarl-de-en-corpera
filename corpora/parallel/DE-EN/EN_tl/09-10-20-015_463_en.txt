Mr President, Commissioner, yes, we should agree to milk being incorporated into Article 186, and I hope that we will do so tomorrow.
We cannot always criticise the Commission for acting too slowly, for lagging behind, for saying that there is still a silver lining that is not there in reality.
The Commission now has the chance to act quickly and we should grant it this chance and in so doing, we should always demonstrate our own willingness to hold it to account.
Mr De√ü's amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will enable us to do that together.
The EUR 280 million that many have spoken about is just a drop in the ocean.
We must also recognise, though, that it is the end of the financial year.
We have to understand that there simply is no more money available.
How should we handle the overall situation?
We would like to see those dairy farmers who have been hardest hit by the crisis receive the EUR 280 million.
We talk about the milk market, but these are real people and the rural areas that we discuss and that we are always saying we want to protect when we are debating other subjects.
Commissioner, support the dairy fund!
This afternoon, the Commissioner speaking in the budget debate spoke out in favour of the fund, I want to make that quite clear.
I was very pleased about it.
We also need this signal urgently, and this money, too, is within the 2010 budget.
