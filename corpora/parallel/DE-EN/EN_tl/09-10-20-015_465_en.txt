Mr President, Commissioner, I very much welcome your motion.
There is one point that I feel the need to criticise, however, which is the voluntary buy-up programme for milk quotas.
A programme of this kind, if it is to succeed, must be obligatory, not voluntary.
I find this voluntary arrangement to buy back milk quotas counterproductive.
I believe this not only because this arrangement will initially mean that we retain a quota increase which it will then be very difficult to rein back in.
By buying back the milk quotas, we will be giving them a financial value again, and the main effect of that will be that it hampers the ability to do the balancing out.
I feel I must reject any measure that restricts balancing out.
Particularly in the phasing out period for the milk quotas, balancing out is a necessary tool in order for individual farms to be able to orient themselves better in the market.
For the reasons I have mentioned, I will be forced to reject this part of the motion, although I will vote in favour of the motion as a whole.
