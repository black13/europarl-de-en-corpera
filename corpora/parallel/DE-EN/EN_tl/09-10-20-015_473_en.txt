Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased, Commissioner, that, just a few weeks after this House adopted a resolution on milk, you are here bringing forward measures to meet our demands.
I agree with your proposal, in respect of Article 186, including with the time limit, which seems reasonable to me.
I am also in favour of the differentiated granting of quotas that you propose.
I have to say that the proposal concerning the buying back of quotas leaves me more perplexed.
You yourself said over weeks and months that the current crisis was not caused by the quota system and, with that in mind, personally I do not think that this buy-back proposal is completely coherent.
Finally, I would also like to say that this cannot be the end of the line just yet.
We must continue to take steps, and specifically as regards the dairy sector in difficult areas, in mountain areas, where there are simply no alternatives to dairy farming.
