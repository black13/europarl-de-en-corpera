Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks for the EUR 280 million.
I really hope, above all, that the full extent of this money reaches our 40 000 Austrian dairy farmers, as they really need it.
You are surely aware of the situation in mountain regions and the situation in small-scale family farms.
Commissioner, Austria was always against the phasing out of the quotas.
OK, you have chosen your path and followed it consistently.
We will, of course, attempt to prepare our farmers for it and to help them with it as much as possible.
With the best will in the world, I cannot understand your proposal for a voluntary quota buy-up programme.
If we apply this, it will result in an appreciation in value and price of exactly the quotas that you are phasing out.
How are we supposed to explain that to the farmers of Austria?
