Mr President, I have become heavily involved in this issue, because many Sudeten Germans live in Austria and I recognise their rights, hardships and worries.
However, we must finally lay the ghosts of the past and look to the future.
The future is not about the Bene≈° Decrees.
It is about a free Europe with free citizens whose rights are based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
That is my vision of Europe.
