Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Farage is now leaving.
I hope that there is no one in this Chamber who hates what he has implied about us.
Hate goes against the European ethos, and egoism, protectionism and nationalism are the greatest enemies of the Community of the European Union.
Secondly, I hope that there is no one in this Chamber who is playing off parliamentary democracy against the citizens and who sees a dividing line between us and our job as representatives of the citizens, as he has implied.
We have all seen the sparks flying in the run-up to the summit and we are hoping for a decisive, liberating judgment from the constitutional court.
We expect the Council to fulfil its responsibility to Europe, not to allow itself to be held hostage by one person and to take the necessary decisions concerning staffing, the institutions, the schedule, the content and the finances.
However, I also call on the governments not to look for the lowest common denominator when selecting and nominating the commissioners, but instead to find the best solution for the Community of which we are all a part.
I call on the governments not to play the familiar old party political games when selecting the commissioners, but instead to put common European responsibility at the heart of the selection process.
I call on the President of the Commission to produce an ambitious set of requirements for the commissioners and the Member States.
My second point concerns supervision of the financial markets.
I welcome the proposals for macro-supervision, but they do not go nearly far enough.
We also need micro-supervision and, in my opinion, the Commission proposal represents the lowest common denominator, the minimum.
We must go further.
We must put in place a supervisory body for the European financial markets which has the authority to take the necessary measures, similar to the European Central Bank.
(The President cut off the speaker)
