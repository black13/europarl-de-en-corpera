Mr President, the demand from VÃ¡clav Klaus for an addition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is both arbitrary and superfluous.
However, it is easy to oppose, because the charter refers only to EU law and applies only to the future.
Therefore, if necessary, the Council should make a political declaration.
In a few weeks, the ratification of the treaty, which we have been waiting nine years for, should then take place.
The European Council must make the necessary preparations, but should not jump to any hasty conclusions.
This applies also to the European External Action Service.
The High Representative is responsible for proposing a concept for the service, not the Council bureaucracy.
I would therefore ask the Council Presidency to ensure that the service is not in a position off to one side, but can integrate itself into the community system, as Mr Barroso has said.
This treaty gives us the legal basis for a common energy policy and for a common climate protection policy.
I can only hope that the fog lifts before Copenhagen, because we must not leave these questions open until the conference.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear demands, including with regard to financing.
I hope that there will be agreement on a financing concept next week at the summit.
Furthermore, we need internal burden-sharing within the EU.
Germany and other countries must give way, as we need a fair deal both within the EU and between the EU and the developing countries throughout the world.
