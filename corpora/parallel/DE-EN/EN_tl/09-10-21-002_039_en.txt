Mr President, with regard to the subject of illegal immigration in the European Union, I would like to point out that there has been a significant and very serious increase over the last year.
According to the Commission, the number of illegal immigrants recorded has risen by around 63%.
In 2008, 62 000 sets of fingerprints of illegal immigrants who had been apprehended were entered in the EURODAK database.
We cannot even guess at the number of immigrants who were not caught.
The geographical situation of Austria, where I come from, makes it a particularly popular destination and this has had disastrous consequences.
For example, 58 of the 64 Kurds who were apprehended recently disappeared into the reception centre and immediately submitted applications for asylum, which involves a long-winded procedure.
The burden represented by the constantly growing number of illegal immigrants - I would like to emphasise the word 'illegal' here - is becoming unbearable for the citizens of the EU.
If we do not solve this problem quickly, we should not be surprised by the growing scepticism about the EU and the sense of resignation among our citizens.
I therefore ask the European Council to consider this subject on 29 and 30 November.
