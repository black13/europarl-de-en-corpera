I would like to say to my fellow Member that the institutional changes resulting from the Treaty of Nice, the Constitutional Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon have always had the broad support of the people of Europe and the broad support of the majority of European states.
There have always been individual states which have made different decisions, partly for internal political purposes.
Now the decision has been made in the parliaments of 27 states - and parliaments are not a second-class form of democracy - or in referendums as in Ireland.
As a result, a vast majority is now in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, including the majority of your own people.
