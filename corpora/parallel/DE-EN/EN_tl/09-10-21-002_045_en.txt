Mr President, I would like to make three comments on the forthcoming Council meeting.
Firstly, the Irish 'yes' vote is, in my opinion, primarily a result of the financial crisis, while the banks were rescued a year ago with taxpayers' money.
Now the bankers will once again be receiving record salaries.
The EU will certainly be measured by the extent to which it can bring an end to the disappearance of billions of euros of tax payers' money into this black hole.
Secondly, new faces are filling the top positions within the EU as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Their professional qualifications are definitely second-rate, because the majority of the candidates are failed politicians who have been voted out of power in their native countries.
Who will represent the EU now?
The Council President, the High Representative or the Commission President?
There is certain to be chaos.
My third comment, Mr President, is as follows.
If President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic signs the Treaty of Lisbon, on the condition that a footnote is included which ensures that the Beneš Decrees remain in force, in other words, decrees which run contrary to international law and human rights, then there will be two types of fundamental rights: those for Germans, for Sudeten Germans and for all the others.
That cannot be allowed to happen!
