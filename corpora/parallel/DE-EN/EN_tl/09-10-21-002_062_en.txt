Mr President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m and Mr Barroso have covered the subject of climate change and the preparations for Copenhagen.
I agree with everyone who says that the Council must draw some ambitious conclusions.
However, I would advise against looking only at the industry which has been covered by the Emissions Trading System since 2005, when considering both financing and the issue of who must bring about the reduction.
We need more industries to shoulder the burden.
More than 50% of emissions are not yet included in the Emissions Trading System.
We need more industries to take responsibility in order to achieve our objectives and to guarantee financing.
I am referring to the air transport and shipping industries.
I have been disappointed by the actions of the Council and the Commission up to now.
During the preparations for Pittsburgh, this subject was not included in the Council's conclusions.
If we want to be successful in Copenhagen, it is essential that we speed up what we are doing.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety did this on Monday.
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look at this in more detail.
Secondly, I would like to say that I know that the discussions will be very informal, but the Council must also be discussing the composition of the new Commission.
In all modesty, I would like to make a suggestion.
For historical reasons, pharmaceutical legislation has come under the supervision of the Directorate General for Industry and the Commissioner for Industry.
Of course, pharmaceutical legislation is a matter for industry, but it is also a health issue.
In all the Member States, in the European Parliament, even in the US, this area forms part of health policy.
Therefore, perhaps it is now time to try a change in this area.
Please ask the Commission President to take a look at this issue.
