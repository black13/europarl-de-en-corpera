Today's votes on the motions for resolutions are based on a debate which takes some beating in terms of its political one-sidedness.
The United Left has launched an attack on Berlusconi and taken its revenge on him.
It is true that there is a high media concentration in Italy, but the threats to freedom of speech and democracy have been exaggerated.
It is obvious that they will oppose everything which is not on the left.
In the joint motion for a resolution, the Greens, the Social Democrats, the Communists and the Liberals have asked for the EU to be given the authority to monitor pluralism of the media, as it is euphemistically called.
I strongly reject this, because the authority in this area must lie exclusively with the Member States.
I felt that I had to speak out against these party-political attempts to intervene and that I had to vote against the joint motion for a resolution put forward by the left, because for me and for the Freedom Party of Austria, freedom of the media and freedom of speech are among the most important aspects of democracy and they need to be defended.
