Mr President, our group supports the basic structure proposed by Mr Brok in his report and, in particular, the retention of the controlling rights of the European Parliament and the retention of the Community tasks as Community tasks.
However, in order to ensure that our common External Action Service is a great success and not just an appendage of the Commission or the Council, we must now discuss its content and its functions.
The EU needs a new, integrated foreign policy which will allow it to confront the world's problems effectively.
The External Action Service must enable the EU to implement comprehensive, integrated political strategies and campaigns.
We need this service now, for example, during the discussions on climate change in Copenhagen.
We must do away with traditional diplomacy, otherwise this service will bring very little added value.
I would therefore like to promote four areas which, in our opinion, will help the service to create a new foreign policy.
Firstly, we want the new service to have a directorate for peacebuilding and crisis management.
We have the corresponding financial instruments and missions, but until now, we have only had small and fragmented organisational units.
Secondly, we want the staff to be given comprehensive education and training.
Simply having attended a diplomacy college is not enough.
In addition, we want to ensure that those members of staff who wear uniforms have not merely been educated at the defence college.
All of them must complete at least part of their education together and this is why we are calling for a European External Action Academy.
Thirdly, we do not want a dual structure for the Council President within the Council Secretariat.
Therefore, the External Action Service should also be supported by this organisation.
As far as appointments to the top jobs are concerned, my colleague, Mr Tarand, has already mentioned that we firmly believe that it is time that a woman is appointed.
