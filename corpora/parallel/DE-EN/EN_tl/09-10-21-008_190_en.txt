Mr President, the Council's actions are not transparent.
The decisions are made de facto in the numerous, largely non-transparent working groups and in COREPER.
In 2008, only 1% of the agenda items in the Council of Foreign Ministers were debated publicly.
Against precisely this background, the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) has been developed since the end of the 1990s without any consultation or democratic control.
Against precisely this background, the European External Action Service will also be established.
My response is a clear 'No'.
This must not happen!
We need genuine democratic parliamentary control and we also need genuine transparency.
I am also rather surprised that you in particular, Mr Brok, are now suddenly in favour of parliamentary control.
Is it not the case that specifically in the area of the ESDP, the Treaty of Lisbon will remove this parliamentary control?
However, you are in favour of this treaty.
On the subject of budgetary control, it is quite clear from the discharge of the Council how your group is acting.
Is it not the case that in the next few weeks, your group will vote in favour of the discharge of the Council in the Committee on Budgetary Control, although the Council has not given adequate responses?
It is unfortunate that although your draft has very good beginnings, it is in fact hypocritical, it is not credible and it is ultimately an admission of the failings of the Treaty of Lisbon.
