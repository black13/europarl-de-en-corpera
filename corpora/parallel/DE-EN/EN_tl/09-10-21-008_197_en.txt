Mr President, what do we want to achieve with the European diplomatic service?
We want to set the political priorities of the European Union for the 21st century.
Many countries and many people outside Europe expect Europe to play a strong role in peacekeeping and conflict prevention and, in areas where this has not worked, to restore peace and to help reconstruct the country in question.
For this reason, it makes sense to establish a peacebuilding department.
However, in the negotiations, some of the representatives of the Member States in the Council have put their foot heavily on the brakes, including the representatives of Member States which are generally regarded as pro-European.
At best they have one foot on the accelerator and one on the brakes.
This generates a lot of heat, but not much movement.
We therefore hope that the negotiations for a really strong European External Action Service (EEAS) controlled by the European Parliament are successful.
The citizens of Europe want Europe to speak with one voice.
People outside Europe expect this.
The EEAS will not be able to achieve this on its own.
However, it represents a step in the right direction.
Let us make sure that it works.
