Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am concerned about the way in which the Commission and the Council are excluding the European Parliament when it comes to the question of the External Action Service.
We have no documents and we are the only ones who have no documents, who have not been involved and who are forced to accept what has been negotiated.
This is outrageous!
What I have seen during this debate and following the statements by the two representatives is that the Community instruments are being dismantled.
We will also see an opt-out from the instruments which involve parliamentary rights, such as the Budget Regulation.
We in the European Parliament must pay attention.
The answer to the question of 'Who decides what?' has not become clear to me in the course of the debate.
I believe that this is an open question.
I also believe that if our budgetary and control rights and our codecision on this issue are not respected, it will be very difficult for us to work together with the Council and the Commission over the next few years.
