The Treaty of Lisbon promised to bring about all sorts of changes.
The EU was to become more responsive and more democratic, the European Parliament would have more powers of codecision and the citizens would have their EU referendum.
However, Member States are, in fact, being put under pressure by the threat of commissioners being removed.
Now is the time for the EU to show its goodwill and finally to ask the people about the accession of Turkey.
However, referendums seem only to be held in order to be ignored.
It is also difficult to work out how the EU is to become more responsive if the responsibilities of the newly created posts are only outlined in the treaty.
Conflicts are as inevitable in this area as they are in the new External Action Service whose rights of access have not yet been clarified.
Our extraordinary budget is already becoming increasingly costly and covers an increasingly dense network of EU agencies which inevitably involve duplication of effort and overlapping authority.
Therefore, it is important to maintain the balance so that the new system, on the one hand, does not result in any duplication, but allows synergies to be exploited, and so that, on the other hand, parliamentary control cannot be circumvented, the Member States cannot be blocked and national authority remains unchanged.
Along with all of this, the new body must have the necessary authority to complete its tasks and to work efficiently with Europe's strategic partners.
