Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have drawn up a major resolution which covers a number of themes.
However, one important point - trade - is only touched on briefly.
I believe that international trade is a decisive factor.
The fall in world trade is one of the causes of the economic and financial crisis and I would like to see a greater focus on world trade, even now in the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC).
It is not the case that the US and the European Union agree on every area.
On the contrary, we have only a few trade agreements, there is a risk of bilateralism and there is the possibility that the Doha Development Round will not be continued by the US.
Therefore, we should address the critical points and I hope that the TEC will introduce some new stimuli to revive international trade.
