Madam President, I would like to look again at one aspect of transatlantic cooperation in the field of policing and justice relating to Swift, which has already been mentioned, that is, the transfer of Swift bank details to the US.
I believe that we should remember when discussing this point that the Council has given itself a mandate for negotiations with the US on the transfer of data.
We should remind the Council to keep to this mandate in its negotiations with the US.
I am very concerned that the European Council will be pressurised to accept the demands of the US and to circumvent European data protection standards.
I believe that this would send out the wrong signal, particularly because there will be many areas where the level of data protection will be brought into line as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon over the next year in agencies such as Europol and Eurojust, etc.
I believe that we would be sending out the right signal if the Council and the Commission were to adhere to the data protection standards and uphold them in the face of the US or to insist on a postponement.
