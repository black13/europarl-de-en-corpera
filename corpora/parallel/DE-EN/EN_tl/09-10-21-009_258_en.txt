It goes without saying that the economic relationship between the US and the EU must be maintained.
However, we must not, under any circumstances, allow the US to monopolise Europe in economic terms.
On the contrary, we must learn from the economic crisis, which had its origins in the unsupervised financial markets in the US.
Europe must maintain its economic independence and find its own way out of the crisis, particularly as bonuses amounting to billions of dollars are being paid out on the New York stock exchange as we speak.
Therefore, I am calling for the European position on the Transatlantic Economic Council to be strengthened.
At the EU-US Summit in Prague in April 2009, President Obama pressed the European Union to offer Turkey full membership in the near future, claiming that the EU would be contributing to better understanding with the Islamic world.
The fact that the US is supporting its strategic NATO ally (so that Turkey would clear the way for Rasmussen to become Secretary General of NATO) should not result in the negotiations on full membership being accelerated.
Despite American support, Turkey will not become a suitable candidate for accession, because there is no sign of huge cultural, geographical, economic and political differences being reduced.
The EU should take a clear position with regard to the US on this issue.
