In the light of the economic crisis and the preparations for the climate conference in Copenhagen, it is important for us to take the opportunity of the Transatlantic Economic Council meeting to strengthen further the relationship between the EU and the US.
In the area of the environment, we must discuss new types of foods in particular.
The opportunities and perspectives of nanotechnologies are also a relevant subject.
We should definitely hold open discussions on the topics of genetic engineering and animal cloning.
Europe should not be afraid to explain clearly to its trading partner the concerns of some Member States.
In the area of chemicals and toxic substances, we must work towards high standards of protection and better coordination.
This will not only make trade and economic relationships easier, but will also guarantee in particular that consumers in Europe are protected against toxic substances in the environment and in the products they use.
Constructive discussions will help to ensure that the special relationship between the EU and the US is maintained.
