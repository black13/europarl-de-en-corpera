Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Malmstr√∂m for her excellent, detailed answer.
Mr Brechtmann from the International Commission for Human Rights has given me comprehensive information about the conditions in prisons.
I would just like to ask whether the Council can attempt to investigate the conditions in which individual prisoners are held and how does it evaluate the developments in Cuba as far as relationships with the European Union are concerned?
