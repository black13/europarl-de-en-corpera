Madam President, the fellow Member who asked the question naturally focused in her remarks on the situation in those Member States where parts of the population are emigrating to look for work elsewhere.
I can understand this.
However, in contrast, Austria, like Germany, is a country with massive immigration and it could obtain an extension of the transitional period until the labour market is fully opened.
The reasons for this are clear.
Negative displacement and distribution effects resulting from major differences in income, in particular, against the background of the current problems on the labour market, and increased immigration could have resulted in the labour market being significantly overburdened, leading to social tensions that everyone wants to avoid.
Therefore, my question is: will these problems which are affecting Austria and Germany be recognised and are appropriate solutions being planned?
