Mr President, I should like to make three comments on the resolution on the dairy sector: firstly, I expressly welcome the fact that the Commission can now react more quickly to market disruptions in the dairy sector.
Secondly, I am delighted that we have together managed to grant European dairy farmers financial support.
Thirdly, precisely because money is not everything, we must now use our time to prepare for the period after the milk quota.
That is why I hope for intensive dialogue between politicians and the industry, because the question of how we are to configure the dairy market for dairy farmers post-2015 has still not been answered and that, from my point of view, is the main problem.
