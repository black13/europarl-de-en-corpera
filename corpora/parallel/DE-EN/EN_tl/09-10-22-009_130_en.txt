Thank you, Mr Siekierski.
I have received another two explanations of vote, both of which are from new Members.
I should point out that, under Rule 170, no further requests to give explanations of vote shall be accepted once the first explanation of vote has begun.
I shall allow these two explanations as an exception, but I should like to ask the services to bring this to the attention of the groups in a suitable manner once again.
Unless we proceed to some extent by the book, then things will get out of hand.
Mr Se√°n Kelly has the floor.
