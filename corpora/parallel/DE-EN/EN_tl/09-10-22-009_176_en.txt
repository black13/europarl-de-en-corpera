The crisis in the dairy industry has brought numerous farmers to the brink of bankruptcy.
After months of waiting for better milk prices, the European Commission has finally taken emergency measures to save dairy producers.
Aid for private stocks of cheese is to be increased to EUR 15 million, which will mainly benefit the Italians.
The intervention period for milk powder and butter is to be extended and export refunds are to be increased.
These measures should stabilise milk prices in the medium term.
A milk fund of around EUR 280 million is to be distributed to the Member States in order to finance national aid measures.
However, this is little more than a drop in the ocean.
The Commission is offering the Member States a voluntary quota buy-back scheme in order to motivate milk producers to partially or definitively give up milk production.
Productive operations that deliver too much are to be asked to dig deeper into their pockets.
These measures involve a high national cost because in times of general economic crisis, there is no margin left in the national budgets.
I have no high hopes here.
The most tangible measure in the crisis package is the inclusion of milk in Article 186 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, so that the Commission can take fast measures to combat the crisis.
However, it would seem questionable to me to limit this measure in time.
With this reservation, I voted in favour of Parliament's position.
