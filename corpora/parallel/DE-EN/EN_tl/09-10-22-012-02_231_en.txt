Mr President, at the beginning of this part-session, President Buzek pointed out that the abolition of the death penalty is a basic concern of the European Parliament.
It applies to all regions of the world that this inhumane and barbaric penalty must be abolished.
He referred to the executions taking place in Iran.
Four death sentences in particular are mentioned in the motion for a resolution before us.
The persons in question have been sentenced to death because they allegedly took part in the protests against the elections, but they were all in custody at the alleged time of the offence.
So this could still go to appeal and we need to keep an eye on these cases.
The fact that minors were still being executed in Iran at the time of the offence has also been addressed.
Iran is the only country which was still executing minors at the time of the offence.
Iran has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and is therefore obliged to pass a national law prohibiting the execution of minors.
A bill has been tabled before the Iranian Parliament and we must call on our colleagues there to do everything they can so that the passage of this bill stops being blocked.
I consider this a very important task.
To close, I should like to express my high respect for all men and women in Iran who are risking so much, who are taking to the streets, who are engaging in various activities to demand respect for the rights to which they are entitled under the Iranian Constitution.
Their determination, their commitment and their courage deserve our unreserved solidarity.
