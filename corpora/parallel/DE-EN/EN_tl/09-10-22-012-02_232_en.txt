Mr President, on 2 October this year, the Iranian police stopped a man from boarding an aircraft at the last minute.
The lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, was due to receive the International Human Rights Award for 2009 in my home town of Nuremburg for his courageous work on behalf of victims of political persecution.
Despite having a valid passport, the Iranian powers refused to allow Mr Soltani to leave the country for no legal reason.
His wife was allowed to leave.
She rightly stated, and I quote: 'It pains me that in a country that calls itself a theocracy, acts are committed that have nothing to do with God'.
Iran is bound under international law by its ratification of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates the human right that everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.
I find it scandalous that Iran is trampling this right underfoot.
I am therefore lobbying for the Soltani case to be included in our joint resolution today, in our resolution on Iran, and I ask for your support.
