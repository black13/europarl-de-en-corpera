Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have a proposal to make to you: human rights, democracy and the rule of law are issues that are too important and too urgent to deal with on a Thursday afternoon.
Unfortunately, there are only a few of us here.
A month ago, we debated the murder of journalists.
Today, it is the horrendous human rights situation in Guinea, Iran and Sri Lanka.
I know that many of you share my opinion.
Let us find another - a better - date for this important debate.
