Mr President, I have two minutes.
The 25-year civil war in Sri Lanka appears to be over.
In May, government troops captured the areas in the north held by the LTTE.
Hopefully, a new beginning will bring peace and, with it, freedom.
The people are suffering not only from the effects of the civil war, but also from the consequences of the tsunami and other natural disasters.
The EU has stepped up foreign trade and is granting higher tariff preferences than to any other country in southeast Asia.
International aid brings with it the obligation for the political forces in Sri Lanka to implement human rights.
Two hundred and fifty thousand people are being held in overcrowded camps with poor drinking water and medical supplies.
The aid organisations are being refused access.
It should be in the government's own interest to organise the return to home villages as quickly as possible.
The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is lobbying for the International Red Cross to be given a key role.
Another sector in which change is needed is freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
The abduction and arrest of journalists must end.
Critical articles should stop being punished with prison sentences.
As a member of the SAARC delegation, I have been able to visit Sri Lanka many times.
I believe a new beginning for this country will be rich in opportunity if the Tamil leaders are included in a constructive manner.
However, this means rejecting all forms of terrorism and violence and it means cooperation on a strategy to implement human rights.
I wish, for the sake of the citizens of Sri Lanka, that an expression which I have heard time and again - 'war is an institution' - will finally be consigned to the past.
(Applause)
