Mr President, victors should be generous and I think that, in Sri Lanka, a lot of people have still not understood this.
The point here is to resolve the cause of ethnic conflict, which has escalated terribly.
We simply have to realise that there is no plan in place which will guarantee the Tamils their legitimate rights.
Both sides must move towards each other in order to find a political solution.
Violence was rightly fought, the perpetrators of violence have been defeated and there is nothing about violence that can be glossed over.
To abolish the causes of violence, that is the real task.
It is easier to end a war than to create peace.
We see that at the moment in Bosnia where, well after the end of the war, a sustainable solution for peace has still not being found.
I worry about the stability of Sri Lanka, because this minority problem has existed for centuries, exacerbated during the period of colonialism, which is why we must do everything to mediate between both sides and get both sides to come round.
