Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon, which, fortunately, has entered into force, will give us more democracy and a hearing procedure for the High Representative.
All of the commissioners come here, first so that we can listen to what they have to say and then so that we can subject them to scrutiny, and rightly so.
However, the President of the Council does not undergo a hearing here, nor is he subject to scrutiny by us or by any national parliament.
His position is badly designed from a democratic point of view.
He cannot be the political President of Europe, he has to be no more than an honest broker between the different interests of the Member States in the Council, and the minimum requirement for his appointment is that there is a consensus in the Council.
As Mr Verhofstadt has just said, when choosing a pope, we choose a Catholic, when choosing the President of the European Council, we choose a European, in other words, someone who believes in the European ideal.
I think that is absolutely right.
We need someone who can put the 'European' back into the European Council.
If this debate - requested by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - had not taken place in Parliament, we would all have only discussed this matter in the media or in the corridors.
I believe that transparency is necessary for the forthcoming appointments.
To Mr Reinfeldt I would like to say:
This is not just about balancing Centre-Left and Centre-Right; this is about balancing the Centre, the Left and the Right.
