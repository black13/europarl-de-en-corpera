Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago, we peacefully ended the violent division of Europe into freedom and dictatorship.
The European Union is the political project that made the reunification of our continent possible.
The European Union is the political project that sets itself the goal of extending the zone of peace, freedom, democracy and stability in Europe.
We are responsible for strengthening the community of values and the community based on law.
We must do everything we can, starting right here and now, to ensure that the joy over what has been achieved will give us the strength and determination to make sure than no new walls or barbed-wire fences are constructed between the people of our continent and the rest of the world.
The Treaty of Lisbon is the greatest advance for democracy since the first direct election thirty years ago and it gives the European Union, the institutions, the opportunity and the ability to become the voice of the continent.
However, we must seize this opportunity!
We must have the political will to transpose and implement the treaty.
If we have this political will, then it also means that we need to stop always looking only for the lowest common denominator.
Any form of opt-out weakens the Community.
We will only have put a stop to the crises once unemployment falls consistently and we once again have sustainable growth without having to inject billions that cause our public deficits to soar.
My last point is also clear: European thinking is about meeting each other half way and seeking out the best solutions.
The discussions about appointments over the last few days lead me to fear that we are not looking for the best, European solutions, but for the easiest solutions for the Member States and the political parties.
That is the wrong response to the developments of the last few years and to the Treaty of Lisbon.
