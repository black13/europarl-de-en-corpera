What happened a few days ago at the summit of the European Council is outrageous and shakes all faith in the community of values so often emphasised by the EU.
The EU wanted to make President Klaus sign at any price, even by indirectly giving its approval to historical injustice.
On the basis of the Bene≈° Decrees, up to 1947 around 2.9 million people were declared enemies of the state and expelled purely on the basis of their nationality.
As a result, around 230 000 people met a tragic death.
The decrees do not judge people on the basis of specific crimes they have committed; the starting point is purely ethnic origin.
Today, we would call this ethnic cleansing, something that should, in fact, be openly rejected by all of the Member States.
From a legal point of view, the displaced people were denied the right to the presumption of innocence, a proper trial and appropriate compensation for expropriation.
Felix Ermacora, professor of international law and former UN rapporteur, even came to the conclusion in his 1991 legal report that the expulsion was tantamount to genocide.
In spite of all this, and without any objective justification, President Klaus was granted a derogation in order to ensure the non-application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
However, this 'footnote' will not enter into force until Iceland or Croatia ratifies the treaty.
Claims for compensation could be made during this window of opportunity.
