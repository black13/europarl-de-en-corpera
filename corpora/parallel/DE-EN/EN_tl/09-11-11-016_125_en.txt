Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have already clearly highlighted many points and problems, such as the human rights situation.
It is important for us to make these points clearly, as only then will we be able to have an open and frank debate.
If Russia is currently once again seriously discussing introducing the death penalty according to the US model, we cannot neglect to express our opinion on this.
I have two brief points to make.
My first point relates to Russia's accession to the WTO and my sincere request, including to the Council and the Commission, is to provide as much support as possible for this.
Of course, Russia must play its part, too, but we are both relying on this and it would be good for both of us if developments in this regard were to move in a positive direction.
The fact that Russia wants to join the WTO and not just enter into a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is a step in the right direction.
My second point is a sincere request for us not to lose sight of the development of our cooperation in the areas of science and research as well as in the area of civil society.
We need a new impetus for cultural exchange as well as youth exchanges, not only in one direction, as Mr Gahler said, but in both directions.
Every young person who takes part in this will develop an understanding for others and will become a messenger for a more positive development of our relations.
I hope that we will talk more about these common interests and that these aspects will also assume greater importance.
