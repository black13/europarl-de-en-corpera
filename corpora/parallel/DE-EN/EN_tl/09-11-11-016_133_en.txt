Madam President, Commissioner, the war in Georgia, the gas dispute and the inability of the European Union to agree on a reasonably unified line to take with regard to Russia have left their mark.
At the same time, Russia is, without a doubt, an important strategic partner for Europe, and not only in terms of energy supply.
We will soon see whether the new memorandum to prevent energy crises and the European early warning system are worth the paper they are written on - at least we will when the next gas dispute arises.
The fact is that our dependence on Russian gas cannot be eliminated easily and even the Nabucco project will barely make a difference to this situation.
It would be naive to believe that Tehran would not be able to put pressure on Europe.
I believe that the European Union must pursue a sensible and realistic policy towards Russia.
It needs to find the balance between European and Russian interests and also show respect for Russia's historical sensitivities with regard to geopolitical matters.
Otherwise, we may soon not only have to worry about a bilateral ice age, but also about citizens freezing in Europe on account of the gas dispute.
