Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's response is, of course, not only discouraging, as Mr Schwab said, but also very disappointing.
When it comes to the transposition, we need to realise that if you say that around 50% are on schedule, then we have to assume that the other 50% are a long way from achieving that.
Take my own country, Germany, for example: the individual Federal Länder are currently transposing this directive.
In Rhineland-Palatinate, where I live, I had the opportunity, on 2 September, to participate in the first reading for the transposition of the Services Directive for this Federal Land.
As you can imagine, it will be impossible to achieve the transposition on time, and I believe that the other Federal Länder are in a similar position.
The crucial factor for us, of course, will be how the transposition is carried out.
If Article 13(2) stipulates that 'authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service' then we must take great care to ensure that this does not happen in practice.
A decisive factor, for example, will be how the single points of contact are equipped.
Will they have language skills?
Will they work closely enough with the administrations to also be able to deal with the concerns put to them?
We very much doubt it.
In fact, the committee should now be asking which countries are behind schedule with this, which countries make up the 50% and when do they expect to achieve this.
It would then be better to create a moratorium, or something similar, for these countries.
I am certain that, in most countries, this directive will not be transposed by 1 January 2010, even though these countries have had more than four years to do this.
That is a major problem and it is very disappointing.
