Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today we are debating a motion for resolution on neurodegenerative diseases.
The intention is actually for this to become a directive, and so next time, we should also be debating a directive on this subject.
The diseases that we are discussing today - Alzheimer's disease, although Parkinson's disease is also referred to in the text - are diseases of the brain which constitute a major challenge for Europe.
The long-term costs are set to soar and there is still a lot of research to do.
Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in Europe.
Thus, with this motion for a resolution, we want to eliminate the duplicated research, bureaucracy and fragmentation.
The Group of the United European Left - Nordic Green Left has tabled a motion for the research results to be made publicly available.
I think this motion is a good one.
Unfortunately, the wording is wrong, and I would therefore ask for it to be reworded so that it can be incorporated better.
Essentially, there is a problem with regard to European patents.
It would be good if the Commission, and the Council, too, could take up the subject of European patents in the areas of pharmaceuticals and bio-research and make it clear that we need this.
In any case, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this motion for a resolution.
