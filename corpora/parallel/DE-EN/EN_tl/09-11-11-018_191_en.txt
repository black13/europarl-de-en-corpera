Madam President, I will be very brief.
The importance of this has already been stated by several speakers.
It is a disease that affects many people and that number is growing.
It is even more essential for the Member States to work together, to combine forces, in order to be effective.
As far as this goes, this is a right and sensible path to take.
It is a shame that, when it comes to the procedures, we have difficulty getting Parliament involved.
It is regrettable that this resolution had to be prepared at the last minute.
However, if a good result is achieved in the end, then that is what is important.
