Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid we must conclude the one-minute speeches under Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure at this point.
According to Rule 150, we can conduct this type of debate for no more than 30 minutes.
These speeches have now gone on for almost 40 minutes, because, unfortunately, many speakers did not keep to one minute.
I tried to give priority to those who did not have a chance to speak in either of the last two debates and I hope you felt it was fairly balanced.
We still have four more debates this evening and, as you know, the sitting must close at midnight at the latest.
