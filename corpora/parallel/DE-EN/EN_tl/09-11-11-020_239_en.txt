Madam President, I would first like to join with the previous speaker in expressing my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs, Mrs Fajon and Mrs Ludford, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and also to the shadow rapporteurs.
We have succeeded in presenting a proposal demanding that the Commission and the Council come up with an overall package for all the people of the entire Western Balkans, leaving no one out.
I very much hope - and I am addressing Commissioner Barrot in this regard - that you can convince the Council that the goal of visa liberalisation should also apply to Kosovo, so the dialogue will now begin, and so that visa liberalisation will also be achieved for Bosnia and Albania by no later than the middle of next year.
I would prefer it to be sooner.
I would like to make one thing clear.
Of course, it is a matter of implementation, but I have heard that everything has not yet been implemented in Serbia.
I would like to know what you think about this.
It is important to implement everything.
I would like to thank everyone involved and I hope that all of the people ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
