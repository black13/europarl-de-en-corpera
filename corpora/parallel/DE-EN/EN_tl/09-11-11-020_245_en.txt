Madam President, I believe that we are on the right track with regard to the Balkan States.
We have drawn closer through visa facilitation and that will help to create stability, although it is also a sign of our appreciation of the efforts that have been made.
However, I also think that it is good for us to retain a clear set of rules and for the requirements relating to these also to be complied with.
In this regard, I would particularly like to thank Mrs Corazza Bildt for the efforts she has made.
Anything else would, in my opinion, be a pure Brussels-based decision, in which a clear system would be abandoned and no honesty would be shown to the people affected in the Balkan States, just as little as is shown to our own people.
Political signals should not be placed in a footnote or in an annex to a European directive or regulation; they need to be formulated properly.
