Mr President, on the day on which VÃ¡clav Havel spoke in this House about the freedom that was fought for 20 years ago in Eastern Europe, I would like to ask all of those from the ranks of the Group of the European People's Party who have pleaded today for the European Union to send election observers to Honduras what they would have done if, more than 20 years ago, the European Union had declared that it was sending election observers to monitor an illegitimate election in their country - where everyone had said there was no freedom and a climate of violence, and that there was a lack of security.
What would you have said then, more than 20 years ago, if the EU had declared, 'yes, we are sending election observers there because the regime currently in office says that is alright'?
You would all have said that it is unlawful for the European Union to send election observers there.
For that reason, ladies and gentlemen of the EPP, I ask you today to use precisely the same criteria in respect of what is currently happening in Honduras.
In other words, do not send election observers there for an illegitimate election.
I am grateful to the Commission for taking precisely this position.
