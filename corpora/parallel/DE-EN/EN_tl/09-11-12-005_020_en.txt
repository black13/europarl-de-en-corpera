Mr President, young students have asked me to report on current events and goings on in Austria and also in parts of Germany here in the plenary session of the European Parliament.
Ombudsman, my apologies, as I am going to comply with that request at this point.
A social movement known as Die Uni brennt, or University Ablaze, has taken shape in Austria over a number of weeks.
It is a movement the like of which has not been seen in Austria and other parts of Europe for decades.
Thousands of students are demonstrating, they are taking to the streets and occupying lecture theatres.
They are demanding academic rather than vocational education, they are calling for a democratisation of the universities and, above all, they are demanding free access to education.
One of their main points of criticism is the Bologna Process.
For example, there is a banner at the University of Vienna reading 'Make Bologna the process!', which is very fitting, I think.
Traditional politicians have been vaunting the Bologna Process as the crucial step towards a European Higher Education Area for years and have told us that that would make us all much more competitive.
Ultimately, the result is a highly inflexible schematic approach, partly-privatised universities, that would make it possible to plan educational output.
Scholasticism, however, is anything but a plannable process.
It is the way in which enlightened people communicate with one another and articulate themselves.
Scholarly curiosity and scholarly creativity likewise cannot be planned: this movement has proved that once again.
For that reason, we should, in fact, support it - it is democracy in action.
