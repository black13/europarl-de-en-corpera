Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have four comments to make on this report.
The first is that the Ombudsman is an indispensable part of a democratic European Union and, most importantly, one that is close to the citizens.
My second point is that, after initial teething troubles, the collaboration between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman has been excellent.
Thirdly, the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman, together, are the key measurement station, if you will, for a citizen-friendly Europe.
Fourthly, as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I continue to look forward to critical dialogue with the citizens of the European Union, particularly now, once the new treaty has entered into force.
The European Union is there for the citizens, not the other way round, and we must together endeavour to ensure that it stays that way and that it is improved.
