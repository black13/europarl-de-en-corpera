Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Petitions, it is important to me to be able to represent the interests of the citizens even better than at present.
I would like a wider public to become aware of the possibility of airing its problems in Parliament.
This is particularly the case given the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Ombudsman, in any case, I wish you even greater success in the future.
