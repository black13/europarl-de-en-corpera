The EU is a jungle - not only in terms of its subsidies, but also in relation to its competences, its decision-making processes and even its Internet presence.
In a word, for the average citizen, the EU remains a riddle wrapped up in an enigma.
This very area is one that the Treaty of Lisbon could have tackled.
It could have ensured greater transparency, it could have ensured a Europe made up of its cultural peoples and the historic nation states in equal partnership, diverse, federated and subsidiary in its internal design, but united and strong outwardly in order to represent European interests.
There appears to be little interest in transparency, however - Council decisions and the appointment of presidents of the Commission take place behind closed doors.
A common Internet presence requires the consistent use of the EU's working languages - German, English and French, with which it is possible to reach the majority of EU citizens.
The current Presidency of the Council would do well to take note of this.
The establishment and work of the EU Ombudsman is a step in the right direction, but there is a need for greater efforts if we want to narrow the gulf between the EU and the citizens.
The most important step would be to hold referendums on subjects that point the way forward, where the results of these referendums would have to be respected.
The Bene≈° Decrees absolutely cannot legitimise injustice.
Even an ombudsman is of little help to second class citizens.
