Mr President, I would like to table the following amendment, which was formulated in consultation with the author of the motion.
I will read the text out in English.
'Condemns the brutal assassination of Maksharip Aushev, a popular human rights activist and an opposition figure who was shot dead in Ingushetia;'.
Then we would have a deletion, but it would continue as follows: 'calls in particular on the Russian authorities to adopt preventive protective measures as regards human rights defenders, such as starting an investigation as soon as threats faced by them are known by the prosecutor and the judicial system;'.
This would have a clear message, and therefore I would like to support that kind of amendment, together with the Green Group, which has put the amendment to the vote.
