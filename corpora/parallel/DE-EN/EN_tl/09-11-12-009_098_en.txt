Mr President, I would like to talk about Mrs Paliadeli's report, specifically because I believe that the European Ombudsman must actually represent the citizens of the European Union.
Over the last year, the Ombudsman has undertaken something that completely contradicts this remit as he has prostrated himself before economic interests and has allowed himself to be used by them.
He has put a question to the Commission in which he complains that several States have declared prohibitions on wild animals in circuses.
For me, that is not the Ombudsman's concern.
It is not the Ombudsman's job to protect a small number of circus owners who still work with wild animals and to fail to side with the great majority of people, who very likely support this prohibition on wild animals and are quite happy with circuses without wild animals.
I therefore do not see his activity in this case as a positive and I have therefore voted against this report.
