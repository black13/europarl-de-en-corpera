I generally believe that exemptions from and relaxation of visa rules are positive moves for the coexistence of peoples and for improving cooperation between countries.
For the Western Balkans, in particular, it is important that all the countries of the region should be granted such a prospect.
I therefore very much welcome the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are to be included in these regulations.
Visa exemption for some must not be to the detriment of other citizens of the Western Balkans, however.
That would be the case if only Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats were able to enjoy exemption from the visa requirement while Bosnian Muslims were not.
I also argue in favour of medium-term solutions for Kosovo.
In so doing, I would point out that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia and does not have any status under international law.
That does not relieve us of the obligation to consider how this state and its citizens are to be dealt with in future, however.
