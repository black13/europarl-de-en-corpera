Although the joint motion for a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit makes reference to our important mutual ties and common interests, in certain points, it represents an unacceptable meddling in internal affairs.
The motion seeks to forbid Russia from negotiating with individual EU Member States about energy projects.
The EU's one-sided view of the conflict in Georgia, where the Union is clearly behind Georgia, is contrary to the EU's role as a fair and independent observer.
The overall tone of this motion would not help to improve relations with this important country for Europe.
I therefore voted against this motion for a resolution.
