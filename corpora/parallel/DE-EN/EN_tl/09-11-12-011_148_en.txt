Around 7 million people in Europe suffer from neurodegenerative diseases.
Given Europe's increasingly aged population, this figure is likely to double over the next few decades.
What is more, it is a sad truth that, in the field of neurodegenerative conditions, at present the available treatment methods only slow down the progress of the illness, rather than aiming to prevent or actually cure the illness.
Dementia and related conditions, and in particular Alzheimer's disease, give rise to enormous health care expenditure: the annual costs for dementia patients are estimated to amount to around EUR 21 000.
Additional costs also arise as a result of the associated problems for these conditions, as patients tend not to get additional physical complaints looked at and often have a self-denying reaction to medical treatment.
Europe is facing a major health policy challenge here, where the exchange of knowledge and best practice in procedures and methods as part of a common, pan-European research framework is certainly a worthwhile approach.
I therefore support the motion for a resolution.
