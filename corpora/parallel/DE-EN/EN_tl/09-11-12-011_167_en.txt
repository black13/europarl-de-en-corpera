If you consider the excessive number of amending budgets, you could get the impression that the EU is incapable of planning.
Clearly, that view would not be completely mistaken.
You only need think of the tighter and tighter network of EU agencies with its constantly growing budget and the associated potential overlaps of competence and duplications of work.
This also applies to the new External Action Service to be created under the Treaty of Lisbon, for which it is necessary to shape the EU budget in such a way that the new system, on the one hand, does not result in any duplication, but instead, allows synergies to be exploited, and that, on the other hand, parliamentary control cannot be circumvented, the Member States cannot be blocked and national competences remain un-neutered.
This amending budget is premature, given that the Treaty of Lisbon is about to enter into force, as a number of issues still appear unresolved.
I have therefore voted 'no'.
