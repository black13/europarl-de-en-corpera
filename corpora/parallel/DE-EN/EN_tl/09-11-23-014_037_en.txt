Mr President, one in seven Europeans belongs to an ethnic minority.
In spite of this fact, protection for autochthonous minorities in Europe is not seen as a priority.
While Brussels never tires of taking all kinds of competences away from the Member States, the Commission, stating that it does not wish to interfere in internal affairs, has declared conflicts between minorities a matter for the states concerned.
There is no unified approach in Europe.
International law provisions are applied quite differently in different states.
France, for example, does not recognise any ethnic minorities and in Slovenia, the AVNOJ decisions still infringe international law.
In Austria, on the other hand, the Slovenian minority enjoys a full range of opportunities for development.
In my view, these obvious discrepancies reflect a need for a European law on ethnic groups.
If Europe wants to protect the ethnic diversity it has developed throughout history, it is vital to draw up an internationally binding European law on ethnic groups which covers autochthonous minorities.
This would be an opportunity for the EU to prove that it pays more than just lip service to the protection of national diversity within Europe.
