Mr President, in times of climate change and global warming, this much is obvious: we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we must save energy.
The EU is already trying to lead the way in this field, sometimes with more and sometimes with less success.
At times, there are also apparent attempts to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as in the case of the so-called Ecodesign Directive.
In my constituency, there is a very successful business, called Austria Email AG, which manufactures electric boilers.
This is particularly practical and useful in Austria, as the majority of our electricity comes from hydroelectric power, and is therefore very environmentally friendly.
It now appears that the Ecodesign Directive will ban these boilers in the future, and instead force people to use either gas storage heaters or gas stoves, which in my view makes no sense, as they are far less environmentally friendly than these boilers.
In addition to this, 400 jobs are currently at risk in Austria.
This is not what we are trying to achieve.
It is a negative development.
If we are to protect the environment, then we should surely take measures that are reasonable, beneficial and, above all, appropriate.
However, we should not risk jobs for the sake of a product that does not really seem expedient.
