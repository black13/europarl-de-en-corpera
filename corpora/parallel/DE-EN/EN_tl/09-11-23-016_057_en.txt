Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vehemently reject the measures being taken by the Federal Republic of Germany to deport Roma and other minorities to Kosovo.
Soon, around 2 500 people are to be deported per year.
These measures particularly affect 10 000 Roma, but also Egyptians and Ashkali.
Many of these people have lived in Germany for over a decade, having found shelter there from displacement, persecution and violence.
People are also beginning to be deported from Austria, Belgium, Hungary and France.
I oppose these deportations because the situation of minorities in Kosovo, especially the Roma, is unbearable.
The unemployment rate in this group stands at almost 100% and in Kosovo there is no way of providing these people with decent accommodation.
Their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead-polluted Mitrovica.
Finally, I would also like to appeal to the responsibility that Germany has, as a result of its history, to the victims of the Second World War, including the Roma and Sinti who were persecuted and systematically murdered.
A certain level of responsibility that must also be taken in this case ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
