Mr President, last Thursday, news of the unimaginably gruesome killings which took place in Peru was made public.
According to agency reports, over a period of years, a gang had beheaded its victims and removed the fat from their bodies, selling it at EUR 10 000 per litre to European cosmetic companies.
Are these reports true?
In any event, these were inconceivably grisly killings.
Having received these gruesome reports, it now falls to us to find out whether the reports in circulation are actually true.
The fact remains that we Europeans definitely need to get to the bottom of the matter, in order to rule out the possibility that, as alleged in the reports, European pharmaceutical or cosmetics companies are in some way linked to these unspeakably gruesome murders.
