Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficult discussions that were part of the mediation process had one main, important purpose, namely establishing basic rights and liberties on the internet, above all, respect for the rule of law.
These should not be rendered ineffective by the individual interests of the large economic powers on the internet because they want to fight tooth and nail to save an outdated copyright system which is not adapted to the internet era.
We need a completely new system to protect the intellectual property rights of creative forces on the internet, a system that we need to develop together.
However, in terms of protecting the rights of the citizens, we need to be consistent, and this includes monitoring implementation in the Member States.
It was, after all, the Council that was not in favour of protecting these rights and would have liked to see them fall by the wayside.
We must engage in this power struggle with respect to the protection of the rights of the citizens and we must win.
No Member State should now be allowed to worm their way out of these obligations.
