Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering the Commissioner my sincere thanks.
The telecommunications legislation passed during the last five years has shown that Europe is earnestly and systematically making progress, thanks to the commitment and the know-how which enabled us to introduce adequate legislation.
At this point, I would like to thank my colleagues and, above all, the rapporteurs.
We have seen that new generation technologies are appearing, and that these new generation technologies, such as the Fourth Generation LTE Network, need to be given space on the European internal market.
In order for this to happen, we also need to make sensible use of digital dividends, and we need data roaming that corresponds to the needs of the internal market.
I still foresee a great deal of work ahead of us in this field.
The issue of internet freedom has been discussed rigorously and in great depth.
I would like to thank everyone who took part in the debate.
However, we still need to take action on the issue of intellectual property, to allow us to take the necessary measures during the next legislative term.
In this respect, I also look to the national regulatory bodies, which have now been granted additional powers through BEREC.
It is their task to help their national industries and national consumers to assert their rights in the other 26 countries.
In this regard, there is a great need for the national regulators to take action, as this is a starting point for a future expansion in the field of digital communication in Europe and beyond, and for Europe to take a leading role in this field at international level.
