Mr President, our lives, and especially the lives of young people today, revolve around the internet to a significant degree, and both the digital revolution and the use of electronic means of communication are contributing to progress in this field.
As a result, many people view having easy access to the internet, and the wealth of information available online, as a necessity.
In this respect, we also should not, and must not, forget those people who have, until now, not had access to the internet.
That is why I specifically and strongly welcome the measures that have been taken thus far, as we are now on the right path to creating greater competition and improved access to important information.
I am sure that whatever remains to be done can still be achieved in the future.
