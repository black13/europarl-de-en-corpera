Mr President, if, in the recent past, Europol's actions have, once again, succeeded in putting an end to human trafficking rings which smuggle in illegal migrants, then that is laudable.
In the future, it would be equally laudable for Europol to be involved in tackling all kinds of serious, international crime.
Of course, cooperation between various authorities in the fight against crime is, in principle, a good thing.
However, the issue of data protection has not been resolved with regard to the plans to grant all authorities unlimited access to data.
We are being fobbed off with promises of a Data Protection Supervisor, when it is not even clear what supervisory powers they actually have.
The national data protection officials are already rapidly finding the limits to their scope of action, have barely any power to intervene and little real impact.
This will probably also be the case at EU level.
During the last decade, civil liberties and freedoms have been increasingly restricted in the name of the fight against terrorism.
If, especially now, before the Treaty of Lisbon grants the European Parliament these codecision rights, the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs want to rapidly push through an agreement on financial transactions, then it is only because they know that massive data protection issues are associated with it and that they would not get away unscathed in the case of the SWIFT agreement.
Given that even the national law enforcement agencies are not granted this right under their respective constitutions, then why should Europol and, via the back door of the EU, the United States, in particular, be granted such unlimited rights?
In my opinion, we should stop this attack on data protection.
