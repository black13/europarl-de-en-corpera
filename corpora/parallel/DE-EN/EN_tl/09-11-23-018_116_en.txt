Mr President, I would like to join Mr Busuttil in thanking the Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner Barrot, for the work he has carried out.
He has certainly not taken on an easy legislative dossier, and has often battled against the wind and rain, but trust me, Mr Vice-President, you would have found an excellent umbrella in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which you could have used in these kinds of situations.
Nevertheless, much has been said about Europol, so I do not think I need to repeat what fellow MEPs have already said, namely that it seems surprising that, before the 30 November, that is to say before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, we are still expected to pass this through Parliament.
In that respect, it is a natural reaction for Parliament to reject these proposals.
It is also a shame that the Council cannot honour us with its presence today, so that it can also take these comments on board.
I am sure that they will be taken into account.
I wanted, above all, to comment on Mr Kirkhope's report on forensic laboratories and standards, by saying that we often have to consider whether we should begin with the details of the matter, namely what data will be transmitted and how, and whether this data is truly comparable, especially in the case of forensic laboratories.
If DNA data is obtained in different ways and then transmitted and a match is not possible, then more harm than help is done to the person concerned.
Perhaps one should bear these thoughts in mind.
