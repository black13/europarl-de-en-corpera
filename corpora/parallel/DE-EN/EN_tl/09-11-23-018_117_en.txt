Mr President, Vice-President Barrot, thank you for your understanding of Parliament's clear stance in relation to procedural issues.
We are not rejecting the proposals of the Council and the Commission.
Rather, we want to take part in the decision-making process.
That is the crucial point, in terms of our vote.
It is quite clear that Europol is one of the European Union's success stories.
Particularly in the fight against drug crime, human trafficking, the funding of terrorism and the printing of counterfeit money, Europol plays a pivotal role in terms of the exchange of information and provides a focus for existing police cooperation networks.
It is of the utmost importance that its functions are expanded further.
That is why we should also welcome the fact that the agency will have a new basis.
That is where we will need an exchange of data and internal links between the police forces in the European Union.
We need this in order to successfully combat terrorism and crime.
We also need these things - and that must be made equally clear - in order to uphold the rights of European citizens.
Here is a European attitude, and clear European values, which were also reinforced here in Parliament by a broad majority in the Decision on SWIFT codes in mid-September.
We have to demand the following from the Council and the Commission: this fundamental principle, and these guidelines, now also have to be implemented in negotiations with the United States.
We need to do this in order to ensure the security of European citizens.
