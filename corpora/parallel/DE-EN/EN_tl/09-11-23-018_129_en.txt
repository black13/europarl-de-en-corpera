Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for its work in relation to Europol, and I would like once again to state that this is not a question of hindering the process of transforming Europol into an EU agency.
However, the question of what remits are given in terms of the relationship between the State and the citizens is, of course, as fundamental as it is sensitive, and one which ought to be discussed here in Parliament.
In a democratic system, it is a decision that must be taken by parliament, and one which must be discussed in depth to give the final outcome sufficient legitimacy.
I find it quite worrying that, as Mrs in 't Veld has already said, the Council is not even present to hear this criticism, something that I believe to be a fundamental part of any democracy.
I hope that the government will finally take on board the Parliament's criticism regarding the work that has been carried out to date in the field of security policy.
A debate on the rights of citizens is needed at parliamentary level throughout Europe, as is a debate on the effectiveness of our security policy.
The European Parliament and national parliaments must play a more significant role in both.
I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the signal we have given together here, and hope that it was unmistakeably clear and that the Council will also respond to it.
