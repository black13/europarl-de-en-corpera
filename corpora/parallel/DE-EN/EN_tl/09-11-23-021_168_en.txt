Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament moves fast, it does its homework and is capable of taking action.
It is worth pointing out this fact at this stage.
It has taken seven years for the Treaty of Lisbon to finally take effect.
In our case, it has only taken a few weeks - as Parliament had spent a long time making in-depth preparations for this event - for the new Rules of Procedure to be approved on this basis, so that once the treaty takes effect, we can immediately start working according to the new Rules of Procedure.
Rules of Procedure should be established according to a broad consensus.
That is why we have mainly limited ourselves to those amendments which are directly related to the entry into force of the new treaty.
Other proposals for amendments must be discussed in greater depth.
We will have sufficient time to do so in this House.
However, urgent matters must be addressed without delay.
In my view, it seems important that these amendments include new provisions on the simplified and the ordinary amendments to the treaty.
From my point of view, it seems important to unanimously support amendment proposals which aim to improve cooperation with national parliaments.
In other sections, we would like to go further, especially in cases such as our representation, namely the representation of the European Parliament, in COSAC, but this is something that can be discussed at a later date.
For now, I welcome the broad consensus achieved and wish to particularly thank the rapporteurs.
