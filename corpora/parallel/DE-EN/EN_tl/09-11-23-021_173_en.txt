Mr President, democracy needs a revolution.
I am always saying that nowadays, and this time I am directing the comment at you in particular, Mr President.
What is it that you are doing here?
You are making the lives of people who share the European ideal but who, because of their fundamental principles, do not wish to belong to a political party, quite unnecessarily difficult and are thereby shooting yourself in the foot.
To what am I referring?
I am referring to Article 192(1).
The provision stipulating that the Groups may elect a coordinator has been pushed through via the back door, and unnoticed by many.
Previously, Mr President, we always had the following addendum: 'the relevant provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to Non-attached Members'.
This interpretation no longer stands.
I wrote a letter to you.
Two months later, you responded and merely repeated the paragraph.
Please read my letter again.
Please understand that you are currently very close to letting a Parliament which, in principle, I support, degenerate into a two-tier Parliament.
In view of your personal background, how can you do such a thing?
Because we, as Non-attached Members, do not have the opportunity to obtain the relevant information in time and take an active part in making decisions concerning reports and similar matters.
In this respect, the Rules of Procedure must be changed.
Furthermore, I would like to know why Mr Corbett, who was voted out by right-wing radicals precisely because he does these kinds of things, is allowed to sit in Plenary today, virtually in the role of a supervisor.
This is a two-tier Parliament.
We will be forced to file a complaint, although I would very much like to avoid this course of action.
