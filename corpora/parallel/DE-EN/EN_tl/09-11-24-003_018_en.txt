Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the still ongoing economic and structural crisis has shown how the international community can quickly make large sums available in order to take the sting out of an acute situation, even if the way it actually does that is sometimes questionable.
The crisis also shows that the most varied of States are able to cooperate when there are larger, superordinate objectives at stake.
Like the structural crisis, the dramatic effects of climate change are largely man-made.
However, it must be the objective - and I am talking about an objective for humanity - to run our Earth and its resources sustainably and sensibly.
We must maintain the diversity of the biosphere for future generations.
If we succeed in creating a framework at European level that promotes science, innovation and modern, environmentally friendly technologies - green technologies - and renewable energy sources, we Europeans can achieve two objectives.
First of all, we will all be making a positive contribution to reducing climate-damaging CO2 emissions, enabling us to bring an end to our major dependence on fossil fuels.
If, secondly, we increase our support for science and environmentally friendly technologies, it will mean that Europe will remain a centre for innovation in the long term.
Only in that way will we create new jobs in Europe in the long term.
