Mr President, Albert Einstein once said, 'Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler'.
We must be careful to avoid falling into that trap.
We are fooling ourselves that certain weather phenomena - such as the flooding in Ireland - are directly linked to climate change.
We also say that the global rise in temperatures that has indisputably occurred across the different continents is directly linked to the anthropologically generated slight rise in the CO2 content of the Earth's atmosphere.
There are scientists who doubt these causalities and we should keep that in the back of our minds as we now go to Copenhagen.
We should approach the conference with optimism but also realism.
Europe, remember, is only responsible for 10% of the CO2 emissions.
There is no room for doubt there.
At the same time, we know that the United States, China and the APEC countries, which together are responsible for two thirds of the world's CO2 emissions, take a very critical stance on this issue.
It is now less about holding a numbers race and wanting to have 20% or 30% cuts and more about trying to bring about a global agreement, not solely a European one, and we must attempt to obtain binding targets for everyone which can then be monitored and, above all, complied with.
It is just as important that we take our citizens and also businesses with us.
It is to no one's benefit if Europe is threatened with 'carbon leakage' and businesses move elsewhere, when businesses here in Europe produce twice as energy-efficiently as those in other parts of the world.
It is likewise to no one's benefit for various countries around the world to clear rainforests - 12 500 km2 of rainforest was cleared in Brazil last year.
Mr Florenz mentioned Borneo.
It is therefore much more important to curb this deforestation than to take part in such a numbers race.
I therefore ask the negotiators to head to Copenhagen with realism, but also great optimism, in mind.
