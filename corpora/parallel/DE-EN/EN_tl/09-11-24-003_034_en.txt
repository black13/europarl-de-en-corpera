Mr President, in many parts of the world the consequences of climate change are visible.
The most recent calculations assume a global temperature rise of up to 4° C by 2060, and up to 10° C in the Arctic.
It is primarily Europe's soot emissions that are responsible for the significantly faster melting of the ice in the Arctic - they are borne there by the wind.
The rich industrial States of the EU are now obliged to support the poorer countries financially so that immediate measures can be taken to counter the consequences of climate change.
USD 100 billion will be needed every year from 2010 to 2050.
Of that amount, it is fair to say that USD 30 billion is not too much for the European Union.
The transfer of technology must also not be linked to patents, or else some of the money will simply be flowing straight back to the corporations in the industrialised countries.
The EU has an obligation to take a lead at the climate change conference in Copenhagen.
