Madam President, I have a specific question for Commissioner Dimas.
If my information is correct, it is as follows.
If we, in the European Union, implement the targets that we have set ourselves - 20% renewable energy sources by 2020 and a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 - then the EU's energy models show that this alone will achieve a CO2 reduction of 18 to 21%, based on the continued use of coal and gas-fired power stations.
On that basis, I do not understand why we are spending so much time discussing reaching a 30% target since, by implementing efficiency measures, renewable energy sources and also the emissions trading scheme and a little bit of carbon offsetting, we can easily achieve 30 or 35%.
I would be very grateful, Mr Dimas, if you, as a staunch conservative, could finally clear up this mess of Messrs Seeber and Florenz and others, who are once again bowing down before the old industries.
