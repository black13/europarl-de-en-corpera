Madam President, European climate policy should leave its reverie behind and take note of the international realities.
First of all, Kyoto was a failure.
It was very symbolic, but delivered no reductions in emissions.
Secondly, on the eve of Copenhagen, it is clear that important states in the world are not prepared to accept binding targets for reductions.
Thirdly, politics must take note of a debate emerging in science.
The same scientists who signed the conclusions of the IPCC panel two years ago today talk of natural influences on the climate - something that the IPCC categorically ruled out two years ago.
We should already know how sure we can be of what influences climate change when we make political decisions.
I therefore call for a change of strategy.
First of all, we need to adapt to inevitable changes to the climate, while we should also move beyond all the ideological discussions about CO2 and look for international allies in order to accelerate research into new energy sources and clean technologies.
