Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for all the noble objectives for the Copenhagen conference - when it comes to climate protection, we must not forget, of course, that our Europe, its companies and businesses, are in competition every day with the major economic and trading locations of North America and South-East Asia.
This relates just as much to industrial production and energy generation, but also, to a special extent, to transport.
Many transport firms are also global players.
If they are to be competitive, all those involved in this area must have the same opportunities.
What that means is that climate protection does cost money.
We, in Europe, really are the pioneers when it comes to cutting greenhouse gases in the transport sector.
I would simply remind you all on this point that we, in this House, together agreed that we were going to undertake to include aviation, in particular, but also maritime transport, in emissions trading.
Rail transport has been mentioned.
Rail transport, via the environmental levy on energy generation, has certainly been included in CO2 reduction measures, while road transport is included via various potential forms of road charging.
We also have to fulfil European Union technical requirements in relation to catalytic converters through the tightened-up Euro standards Euro 4 and Euro 5.
If we want to achieve something in maritime transport and aviation, however, it is necessary to re-intensify our negotiations with the 20 Annex I states.
What has taken place in aviation with ICAO has so far failed to produce any results.
We must push on with our activities in this regard.
It will be very important that this is discussed at the Copenhagen conference and the same applies to maritime transport which, of course, is also - when you look at the specific energy consumption per tonne and kilometre - very environmentally friendly.
In so doing, it is necessary, however, for us to also reach agreement with the IMO on joint concepts.
