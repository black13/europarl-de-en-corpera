Madam President, climate protection and sustainable development are subjects that - we are supposed to believe - affect us all.
Yet there can be no satisfactory progress without close collaboration, in particular, amongst the global players.
While the United States and China refuse to lay down common, binding greenhouse gas reduction targets, all that can be adopted in Copenhagen - as the UN's chief climate official tellingly observed - are morally binding resolutions, in other words, toothless ones.
Let me say something about nuclear power.
Nuclear power is definitely not the solution to the problem.
The benefits are minimal, the costs enormous and the risks very high.
I therefore support a resolution that has been drawn up by the anti-nuclear power delegate of my home region of Upper Austria, which calls on the EU to introduce a levy on nuclear power.
This idea makes sense, because it would mean that trade in emissions certificates would not be weighted in favour of nuclear power.
