Madam President, I would like to encourage the head of negotiations for Copenhagen to fight for a successful outcome.
The ambitious targets are good and, ultimately, the efforts that we are making today will also represent a contribution to tomorrow with a view to the consequences and the future damage in the form of migration, damage to coastal areas or also, perhaps, in the form of stable regions becoming more unstable as a result of climate change.
We should also set an example.
Yet if other States and, in particular, the really major States, do not pull in the same direction, we should only do so on a proportional basis.
With that in mind, I would point out that our businesses are, in the main, already suffering from quite a high burden.
There is one more point I would like to make, and that is that we are also fighting for the overall credibility of the EU, to provide an argument for the new generation that there is a need for the EU.
