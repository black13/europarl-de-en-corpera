I would remind the Members once again that the Blue Card system created by the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform does not apply to the Commission and the Council, but only to debates amongst Members of this House.
A motion for a resolution to close this debate has been tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
The debate is now closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
