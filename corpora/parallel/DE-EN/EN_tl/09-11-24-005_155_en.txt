I welcome the fact that the regulation concerning statistics on plant protection products will complete the legislative package of European plant protection policy, which can then enter into force.
In order to minimise the risks to people and the environment involved in the use of plant protection products, we need harmonised risk indicators based on comparable and reliable data from all the Member States.
That is exactly what will now be possible.
However, the collection of this data must not lead to more bureaucracy and thus to greater burdens for our farmers and administrations.
Where possible, the existing data should be used and there should be no new data collection.
It will be our responsibility to ensure, when monitoring the implementation of the regulation, that bureaucratic expenditure is kept to an absolute minimum.
On another note, I would have preferred the term 'plant protection products', as originally used in the regulation, to have been retained.
In German, the term 'pesticides' has completely negative connotations and generally refers to the improper use of plant protection products.
Unfortunately, the regulation will now contribute to this misinterpretation.
