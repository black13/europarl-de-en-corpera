I very warmly welcome the fact that the regulation concerning statistics on plant protection products will ensure that there is now a common legal framework for the collection and distribution of data on the marketing and use of pesticides.
It is beyond doubt that minimising risks to human health and environmental protection take priority.
Harmonised risk indicators and reliable data from all the Member States will now make that possible.
That said, I would like to emphatically point out that any additional administrative expenditure on the collection of data must not be a cost borne by our farmers.
By refraining from re-collecting data that has already been taken, we can exploit synergies that will lead to a reduction in bureaucracy and additional burdens.
