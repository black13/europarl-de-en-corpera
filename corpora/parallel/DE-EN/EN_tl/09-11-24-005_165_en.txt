In principle, close cooperation between the various authorities to fight crime is a desirable thing.
However, there is a complete lack of any regulation of data protection in the planned unrestricted access for all authorities and it is not even clear what rights of investigation the proposed data protection officer will actually have.
The SWIFT agreement, too, has major data protection concerns associated with it.
The European Parliament must be given the chance to curb this data protection rights fiasco on behalf of the citizens of Europe.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
