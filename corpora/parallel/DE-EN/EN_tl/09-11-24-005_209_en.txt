Specifically when it comes to rail freight and long-distance transport, the last few years have witnessed some change for the better.
Passengers must not be left behind in this, however.
Rules on compensation for delays to international rail services are not enough.
We must ensure that, in the rush to globalise, regional transport is not completely marginalised, with whole regions being cut off.
Equally, we must ensure that the delusional emphasis on privatisation hitherto does not lead to UK-style massive delays and safety failings.
It is important to overcome obstacles and technical difficulties in the way of cross-border rail traffic, and not only for environmental purposes.
That is why I voted in favour of this report.
