I would like to ask you whether, in the past, you had any difficulties with the Bulgarian Government of Sergei Stanishev or with Ivaylo Kalfin as the country's foreign minister?
Did you have any reason to doubt the democratic legitimacy of Mr Stanishev or Mr Kalfin or their loyalty to the institutions of the European Union?
If not, how do you view the statements by the current Bulgarian Prime Minister, Mr Borisov, who has said that the Bulgarian Socialist Party needs to be prohibited?
Mr Borisov has said that they - meaning the delegates of the Congress of the Bulgarian Socialist Party - are a bunch of impudent bandits.
Thirdly, there is this week's statement by Mr Borisov that 'everyone who hates the Socialists in Bulgaria must be with us.'
How do you evaluate this standpoint from a member of the European Council?
