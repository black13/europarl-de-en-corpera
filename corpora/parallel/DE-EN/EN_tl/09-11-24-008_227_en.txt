I understand that you do not want to interfere in Bulgaria's domestic politics.
I sympathise with that position.
Can I interpret your answer to mean that you believe that there is no need for the party of Mr Stanishev - the Chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, for whom you have expressed your personal high regard in respect of the work that he has done - to be banned?
