What I found pleasing about the special summit was that there was a gender balance.
We would like to pay tribute to that achievement.
I would also like to add that we will continue to support you if you continue to maintain this gender balance.
We now have two new figureheads for the European Union to deal with, about whom all sides have said that they will have to grow into their roles.
That, of course, will always be the case.
There is also talk of lightweights and heavyweights.
I see it like this: today's lightweights are tomorrow's heavyweights, and vice versa.
Many a heavyweight one day is a lightweight the next.
That notwithstanding, we also have a severe economic crisis to overcome.
The social consequences, especially, are giving us lots to deal with.
In Europe, tens of millions of people are affected by unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.
The number of crisis victims is going through the roof.
In the developing world, the consequences are much worse.
Are you prepared, Mr Barroso, together with the new Commission, to learn the lessons of the wrong turns taken through radical free-market policies?
Are you prepared to bring about an urgently needed change of policy to put people ahead of profits and social interests ahead of competitive ones?
