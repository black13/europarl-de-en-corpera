I am very grateful for your offer, Mr Barroso, and I will be happy to take you up on it.
Your oral dialogue is also at issue though, of course.
I am sure that we can come to an arrangement in this regard.
In the second part of your answer, you mentioned an absolutely key issue, namely that there is not only a race to carry out wage dumping, but also a subsidies race.
It was a very clever move to convene the summit yesterday.
What conclusions have you drawn from it?
How, in future, can we combat the emerging danger of a subsidies race, as we have experienced time and again between various EU Member States at the cost of European taxpayers, while also, of course, intervening in the economic process of these dynamics?
