You just spoke of how you have now opened the consultations for the post-Lisbon process.
The post-Lisbon process will, then, be taken care of by the new Commission collectively.
There is a great deal of irritation that the consultation process has been so long in coming.
There is also a serious fear that it is only a formality and that the results of the consultations will not have any serious influence on the post-Lisbon process.
What is your proposal for how all the stakeholders and a fundamental analysis of the consultation process can be integrated into this process and into the Commission documents?
Which Commissioners will you give the task of ensuring that this takes place, and what is your own responsibility in this regard?
