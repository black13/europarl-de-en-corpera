The Commission is pushing on with the accession negotiations with Turkey in an extremely uncritical way.
In so doing, it is paying scant regard to the mood of the Member States and their residents.
The appointment of Mr Van Rompuy as President of the European Council is the appointment of a clear opponent of Turkey's accession and I will quote him now, 'Turkey is not Europe and never will be Europe.
The universal values that prevail in Europe, which are also the fundamental values of Christianity, would lose vigour with the accession of a large Islamic country such as Turkey.'
I therefore ask, what is the Commission's position on this unambiguous statement?
Furthermore, if the concerns of the public in this regard are not to be taken seriously, what about those of the President of the European Council?
