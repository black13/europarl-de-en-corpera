Mr President, the fight against terror, against organised crime and against illegal immigration is certainly an important concern for Europe.
It must be said, however, that the Stockholm Programme, regrettably, is a consistent continuation of the path of constant degradation of and interference with guaranteed human rights, civil rights and freedoms that we have been pursuing since September 11, 2001.

That is all well and good, but there are already first signs and tendencies, expressions of opinion, that do not correspond to the consensus of what has come to be called political correctness, to restrict, to prohibit and, who knows, sooner or later, to punish.
George Orwell warned us of this - and we must prevent it from occurring.
