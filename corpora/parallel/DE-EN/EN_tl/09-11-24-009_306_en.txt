Mr President, the Stockholm Programme doubtless contains a number of useful initiatives, and I am all in favour of pushing forward the fight against child pornography and terrorist networks on the internet.
Measures against illegal immigrants and against organised crime also have my support.
Unrestricted access for the security services to the EU fingerprints database is justified in this regard.
However, monitoring must not go so far that the EU becomes a surveillance state which then also passes on its data to the United States.
There is therefore a need to ensure that the data collected is not abused.
Ultimately, this is about the key fundamental right of every EU citizen to have his or her privacy protected, and in this context we must observe the fact that freedom means freedom from the State and not freedom through the State.
I also want to say something about the harmonisation of EU asylum law.
This is definitely the right thing to do.
We need to make absolutely clear, though, that without harmonisation of the economic conditions in the different countries, this will not work, as people will, naturally enough, go to where they can find the best social security, the highest incomes, the cleanest streets and the safest towns and cities.
One thing is clear, and that is that we should indeed have harmonisation, but Europe must not become a land of self-service asylum policy.
