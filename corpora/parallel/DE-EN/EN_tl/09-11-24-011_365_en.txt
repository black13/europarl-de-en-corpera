Mr President, the European Security and Defence Policy is not, at present, a navy, but it is a ship of war in international politics.
Every year, when it comes to discharging this budgetary warship of the Council, it suddenly disappears into the Bermuda triangle and the European Parliament seems happy to apply the motto 'everything that is not on our radar screen does not exist in reality, either'.
Last spring, extra-budgetary accounts suddenly emerged and the Council was not granted discharge.
Four reasons were cited for this.
The first was that the Council refused to accept any kind of official, formal meeting with Parliament.
The second was that the Council refused to provide any comprehensive written answers.
The third was that the Council failed to supply either an activity report or a complete list of budgetary transfers.
The fourth reason was that it is impossible to determine whether the expenditure items in the Council budget are of an operational nature.
Now, suddenly, tomorrow - a few months later - there is a will to grant the Council discharge, all of a sudden.
Yet not one of these four grounds for refusing to grant discharge has really been cleared up or satisfied.
The representatives of the Council still refuse to have any kind of formal meeting with Parliament.
Likewise, no activity report has been forthcoming and the extra-budgetary accounts have not been closed or got rid of, as we demanded.
I would remind the rapporteur that his initial report put a total of twenty queries and questions to the Council.
Yet where are the precise answers to these questions?
Can you tell me that?
No, you cannot.
Instead of increasing the pressure on the Council at this point, what do we do?
We turn ourselves into supplicants, and these demands become requests in the new report.
Anyone who votes in favour of granting discharge to the Council now will be giving their support to precisely this situation, where Parliament stands before the Council making meek requests.
