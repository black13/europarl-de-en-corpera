Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, first of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency of the Council is present, and I would also like to personally thank Mrs Malmström for having made the procedure more transparent.
Everything that my fellow Members have said is true - the procedure is more transparent, and even if she expressed herself in a somewhat more cautious manner today, we can still say that we will be granting discharge.
There is still a very long way to go.
We ask the Council to follow this first step with further steps, especially given that the Council's competences in the field of foreign and security policy have been much more clearly defined under the Treaty of Lisbon.
In future, this policy will also have a face, in the shape of Baroness Ashton.
The citizens, however, did not previously know Baroness Ashton, and they, the European taxpayers, will still not know, in future, exactly how much money she has at her disposal and what she does with it.
We must change this state of affairs.
This, indeed, is an absolute must in a time where we are actually fighting for a transparent, democratic Europe.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Søndergaard for having applied pressure in our - Parliament's - name, and we will maintain that pressure.
