Mr RÃ¼big, you know my answer, of course, but I am grateful for your question.
Yes, I do believe that all the programmes that we have that facilitate access to funds for small and medium-sized enterprises can be extended.
These programmes are creating very positive experiences and we should extend them for that reason.
I have to ask for your understanding for the fact that I do not want to make any comments about the priorities for the Eighth Framework Programme for Research.
For one thing, it is not my responsibility, as you know, but for another thing, it would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt the new Commission which is about to be formed.
I can only say, as a view from the current Commission on the fundamental premise of your question, that there will have to be a focus in our research, development and innovation policy over the next ten years on the fields of energy efficiency, renewable energies and, in a broader sense, on the field of technologies that pave the way for a sustainable lifestyle and economy.
You know me well enough to know that I have always pointed out that increasing energy efficiency is probably the cheapest and most effective kind of sustainability programme, as it enables us to achieve a lot with relatively little expenditure.
If, therefore, the new Commission tables specific proposals moving in this direction, it will, in fact, be able to draw upon the preparatory work carried out by the current Commission and its policies.
