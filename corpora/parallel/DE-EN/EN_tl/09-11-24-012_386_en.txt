Mr MÃ¶lzer, this question simply does not arise, as it was comprehensively examined and decided upon in connection with the pharmaceuticals package that the Commission proposed last year.
We have clear and unambiguous case-law on this matter from the European Court of Justice, which includes parallel trade in medicines in the freedom of the internal market, and there is therefore no legal scope to counter this.
The pharmaceuticals package proposed by the Commission over the last year does not set out any specific rules that negatively affect parallel trade in any way.
In the very important and far-reaching proposals that relate to protection against counterfeit medicines in the legal supply chain, exactly the same rules apply to the manufacturers of medicines as to those carrying out parallel trading.
There is no discrimination at all.
I am not aware of there being anyone in the Commission with the intention of dealing with this subject.
Subject: Information on energy prices for consumers
The Commission recently opened the second meeting of the 'Citizens' Energy Forum' in London.
In her statement, the Commissioner for consumer protection emphasised how important it is for energy consumers to have gas or electricity bills - the best indicator of energy consumption - that are simple and accurate and that allow comparisons between providers.
Going beyond these major annual public events, can the Commission indicate specifically how it intends to compel energy producers and distributors to meet this objective, which is essential for citizens, despite having refused to adopt the Energy Consumers' Charter proposed by Parliament?
