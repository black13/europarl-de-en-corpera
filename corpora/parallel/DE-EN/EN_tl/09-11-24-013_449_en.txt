Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund helps people to attain further education and qualification.
That is the social side of Europe, and it is a good side.
The Commission, however, has also examined the subsidies given to Dell in Poland in terms of their compliance with State aid rules.
It has approved EUR 54 million in Polish State aid for Dell as this aid supposedly serves to benefit regional economic aid.
This raises the initial question of whether we really have to have competition between ourselves in Europe when it comes to public money.
The answer is 'no'!
We should change State aid rules so that relocation subsidies are no longer paid, including by the Member States.
I have another question to ask the Commission directly: does Poland's EUR 54 million for Dell also include money from Europe's structural funds?
Why, Commissioner, has the Commission not expressed a clear opinion on this?
I call on the Commission to truly take its monitoring duty under the Structural Funds Regulations seriously.
No European money should be paid out for company relocations within the European Union.
What you gave us today, Commissioner, was an evasive answer.
You are hiding behind the Polish Government's reports.
You have not examined directly, however, whether the European Structural Funds Regulation has really been complied with.
Let us finally obtain transparency and publish every individual subsidy under the structural fund, as happens with agricultural policy.
That is the only way that we can truly obtain trust in Europe's structural policy.
