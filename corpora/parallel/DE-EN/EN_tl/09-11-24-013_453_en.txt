Mr President, I would like to return to Commissioner Å pidla's second statement.
He said that we cannot influence business decisions.
That is simply not true.
Of course we do influence business decisions by paying subsidies, making European structural fund payments and paying aid.
That is why, when negotiating the regulation, Parliament debated this very issue of relocation.
Ultimately, however, Parliament gave way, with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) regrettably also voting in favour, Mr Pieper, and laid down only five years in the Structural Funds Regulation, which is clearly nothing like adequate given the scale of the subsidies.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was the only group to say, at the time, that we need at least 10 years for the part of the regulation that the Commissioner cited, which relates to repayment on the part of companies that leave.
All I can say here is that this case shows that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was right.
