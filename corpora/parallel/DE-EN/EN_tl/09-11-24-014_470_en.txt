Mr President, free trade can be a good thing, where it does not simply stop at free trade.
Agreements like this one are about much more than that, and they need to be.
They must not just be about setting up a free trade area, but they must also be about lasting effects.
They must be about bringing about development.
They must be about providing security.
They must be about creating prosperity for all.
That is much more important than ensuring that pure liberalisation takes place, that markets are opened up and that a few people benefit at the end of the process.
If we want to make trade freer, the aim of all these efforts - both here and in our neighbouring countries to the south - must be to combat unemployment.
These efforts must aim to create more opportunities, in particular for women, young people and the rural population.
If that is our aim, then we are on the right track.
If our aim is just to liberalise, open up, and enable a few people to make profits, we are on the wrong track.
