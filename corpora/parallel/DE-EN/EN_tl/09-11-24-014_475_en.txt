Mr President, I think I can say my piece in even less than a minute.
I, too, have a question for the Commissioner.
We are agreed that free trade agreements and trade agreements should not be limited to trade, but also have other objectives that ultimately benefit us all.
To what extent does this process mean that both we and our partners will enjoy more democracy, more human rights and a more equitable distribution of wealth?
Is there already some of this to be seen, or will it take some time yet?
If so, how long will it take?
