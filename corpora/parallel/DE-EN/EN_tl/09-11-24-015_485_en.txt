Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, safety is a sacred thing.
It must be given absolute priority.
What has happened in Berlin recently, where the suburban rapid rail system has gone to pieces as a result of profits being prioritised, must remain an absolutely exceptional case.
What bombs and shells were unable to do in the war, we have had to experience for the last six months in Berlin.
This state of affairs cannot go on.
Safety arguments are also often put forward when someone wants to stand in the way of competition.
In such cases, safety arguments are created in order to completely prevent the opening up of networks, something that we actually regulated through legislation and made compulsory for every Member State as from 1 January 2007.
You must intervene, therefore - the safety arguments must not be allowed to be abused.
Safety costs money, of course, but we need investment in the infrastructure and in safety.
The money is available.
I would remind everyone, for example, that the exemption from duty for kerosene costs European taxpayers EUR 14 billion every year.
If you were to spend this money on safety, we would have a European railway market and guaranteed safety, which is the order of the day.
