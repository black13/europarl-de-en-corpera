Mr President, it is not actually astonishing.
There is one thing that we can say, and that is that, where liberalisation and privatisation takes place, the numbers of accidents and incidents increase.
The reason is obvious, as where there is a need to generate high profits, there are poorly paid employees; there is poorer training and gaining of qualifications, as this is costly; there are fewer controls, as controls cost money; and ultimately - we have seen this everywhere - when everything goes wrong, there are incredible costs involved for the public in clearing up the mess caused by liberalisation and privatisation.
We have gone down the wrong road here.
Mr Bach believes it would be enough to investigate this thoroughly and to introduce better safety mechanisms.
We took the wrong road and we should now return to a road that offers quality, security and efficiency.
That road is certainly not further liberalisation.
It is the opposite route.
