Mr President, I have read the new Slovak law from beginning to end.
Mr Swoboda is right - amongst the people, there is usually good cooperation in day-to-day life, including in southern Slovakia.
For this reason, too, the new Law on the state language is superfluous, as the Slovak language is not under threat in Slovakia.
Unfortunately, it discriminates against local citizens in parts, since Czech is often better placed than Hungarian.
Why does it not, at the very least, provide for equal treatment for Czech and Hungarian?
This amendment of the law can only be explained by the peculiar composition of the current coalition government in Slovakia, where Comrade Fico is attempting to snatch away the votes of the nationalist SNS and the populist HZDS by invoking supposed Hungarian dangers.
I am pleased to report that this type of behaviour was not possible during the coalition government led by Mikuláš Dzurinda.
In those days, three member parties of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), including the minority party, worked well together and not against each other - and that, in actual fact, should be the aim.
