Mr President, after all this excitement, perhaps we need a more down-to-earth approach.
Energy-hungry emerging economies and wasteful industrial countries were not even prepared to implement the Kyoto Protocol.
I am therefore doubtful as to whether anything will change following the Copenhagen conference.
The purpose of certificate trading is also questionable, with millions being spent on this, while the genuine alternatives, such as renewable energy, are fobbed off with peanuts.
This must definitely not lead to nuclear power plants being promoted as a Kyoto-friendly alternative.
The second urgent crisis, in other words, the subsidy race for the failing car manufacturer Opel, is an equally explosive issue.
Signs such as a drop in orders were not taken seriously enough and the EU has probably contributed to the decline of a once flourishing industry with its raft of regulations.
The lesson we must learn from this is that we need, in future, to establish basic conditions which can be planned and predicted for all industries, and until we have fully-developed concepts in place, it is irresponsible to throw billions of euros of European taxpayers' money at the problem.
It is important to ensure at least that this money does not go to the US.
In addition, repayment rules must be introduced.
If nothing else, it should be possible to lay the foundations for finalising the 'transparent' European citizen at the forthcoming meeting.
The Stockholm Programme gives people fewer rights, not more, because they have no control over how the data is used.
There is no sign of an end to the monitoring of passengers, the controversial subject of data protection has not yet been resolved and if we are to introduce a European asylum system, then in my opinion, we should apply the strictest criteria, such as those in use in Denmark.
