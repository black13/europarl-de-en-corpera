Mr President, we have done it - the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force.
I would like to thank Cecilia Malmstr√∂m, the Swedish Presidency and the entire team who have all worked very hard.
This is a major achievement.
In this context, I would like to talk briefly about two points which formed the subject of this debate.
The first point is the Council President.
Mr Barroso, you have just said that you want to work in tandem with Herman Van Rompuy.
I think that this is a very good idea.
It is right that you should work together with the Council.
There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: the Council President is not responsible to the European Parliament nor to any other parliament.
This means that you in your role of Commission President are the legitimate democratic institution and the legitimate democratic president of Europe.
For this reason, by all means work in tandem, but please make sure that you are sitting in the front and steering the vehicle.
My second point is that the representative of the Council said that Cathy Ashton would take up both the office of High Representative and the office of Vice-President of the Commission on 1 December 2009.
Firstly, it is only one office - High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission - and secondly, she cannot take up office without the consent of Parliament.
From 1 December, the first Barroso Commission is in a legal no-man's-land between the end of the Treaty of Nice and the beginning of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Cathy Ashton will only fully take up office after receiving the consent of Parliament at the end of January 2010.
One final word on the debating culture in this House.
We only need to listen to Mr Farage.
If he and his party were ever to be in government in the United Kingdom, the British would really come to value the freedom of establishment in the European Union, because huge numbers of them would move to France, Germany, Spain and Italy and to Portugal, Mr Barroso.
