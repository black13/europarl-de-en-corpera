Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what position are we in now in the run-up to this summit in Europe?
Some speeches made it sound as if everything would be fine provided that we simply had enough social democratic or liberal - yes, Mr Schulz - commissioners.
I believe that is a mistake.
Everything will be fine when we agree on the major tasks facing Europe.
In Europe 20 years ago, we brought down the Iron Curtain and it seems to me significant that it was the people, the citizens, who achieved that and not the armed forces, the governments or the secret service.
I believe that in future, too, we will only be able to build Europe together with the citizens.
Secondly, there are other walls to be brought down, including those in our heads.
For example, many people still believe that we can play off freedom and security against one another, although we know that freedom is only effective when we protect it.
However, this protection must not be at the expense of our fundamental rights and must not lead to the creation of a surveillance state, given the example of SWIFT and other issues.
Many people also believe that it is possible to play off Europe and democracy against one another.
However, only a democratic Europe can be successful in the long term.
Many people believe that the environment and the economy are opposing concepts, whereas the only way to ensure long-term prosperity is to establish an environmental economy.
Finally, I would like to say one thing.
We are now in the run-up to Stockholm and if we do not do whatever is possible there, regardless of the cost - and many people are prepared to spend hundreds of millions on bailing out the banks, but are tight-fisted about the climate - if we do not act quickly and consistently, then what applies to me as a speaker now will also be true of the human race.
Its time will be up.
