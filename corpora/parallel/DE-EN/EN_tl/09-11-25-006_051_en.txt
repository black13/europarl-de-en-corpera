Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one clear priority for me, for all of us and for the entire European Union in future, and that is the labour market.
We must pay much, much more attention to creating new jobs and securing existing ones.
This highly important area can be the key to a successful and sustainable Europe and, in my opinion, has been seriously neglected in recent months.
We must be aware that a low unemployment rate has a positive influence on many other areas.
Let us make sure that we are applying the lever in the right place.
In addition, I fail to understand many of the speakers in this House who complain that some European politicians did not enjoy worldwide fame before their election.
Why should they be famous?
We need to be self-confident enough as Europeans to say who we like and who we think is appropriate and then to elect these people and not to decide on the basis of whether other people have or have not heard of them or whether or not they suit our partners throughout the world.
Any other approach would be ridiculous, just as ridiculous as many of the speeches from many of the people who, if they are here at all, are hiding behind their brightly coloured flags.
