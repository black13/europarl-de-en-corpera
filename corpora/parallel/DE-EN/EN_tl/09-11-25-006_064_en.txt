Mr President, I agree with the majority of the previous speakers that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon represents a new historic phase in European integration.
However, the people, the citizens throughout Europe are not always in the mood to celebrate when they think about it.
Many people are afraid that the Treaty of Lisbon could result in increased centralism in Europe.
Many people fear that the small EU Member States, for example, my home country of Austria, will have less influence, because the large Member States will be able to decide everything as a result of the new voting methods.
People also have the feeling that the choice of the people to fill the top positions in the European Union was based on the weakest and lowest common denominator.
That is not to say anything against the personal qualities of Mr Van Rompuy and Baroness Ashton.
However, people realised that the process did not involve democratic choice.
If we want to lead the European Union into a productive future, we in this Parliament must push for more democracy, including in the process of choosing people to fill the top positions.
