Mr President, I also took part in the debate this morning.
I did not have the impression that you were unfair or abused your office in any way.
On the contrary...
(Uproar)
I would like to say, on the contrary, that you listened with great patience and respect as the chairman of this so-called group demonstrated to us that he is a professional slanderer.
That was the reality of Mr Farage's speech.
(Applause)
