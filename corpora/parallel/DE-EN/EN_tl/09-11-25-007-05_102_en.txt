Mr President, an official delegation is representing Parliament in Copenhagen.
You will also be attending and, for the first time, we do not have to rent an office in the city.
Instead, we will have an official presence in the EU pavilion.
This is good and we are grateful.
Therefore, Article 61 is not needed.
The Treaty of Lisbon ensures not only that Parliament will be listened to with regard to international treaties, but also that it has to agree to them.
This is the beginning of a new era for us and, therefore, we are asking, in accordance with Article 60, to be admitted to the EU coordination meetings and not to be left standing outside the door.
The Commission must treat us in the same way as it does the Council when it provides information about treaty negotiations and we are asking it to begin with the Kyoto agreement.
This is our request to the Commission.
Perhaps Mrs Reding would like to say something on this subject.
(Applause)
