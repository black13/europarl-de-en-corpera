Mr President, what Mr Ferber rightly complained about has happened again.
We have heard three different numbers relating to the paragraph that we are just about to vote on.
I do not know whether this is because the numbers were not read out correctly or were not translated correctly.
I heard 33, then 30 and then 43, making it very unclear.
