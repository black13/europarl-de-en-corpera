There is very little to be seen of the much-vaunted increase in democracy and stronger voice for parliaments which the Treaty of Lisbon was supposed to introduce.
There are merely a few new procedures.
The procedure for evaluating respect for fundamental rights must not, under any circumstances, be misused for the mandatory imposition of political correctness or for anti-discrimination mania.
The lack of democracy within the EU remains unchanged after the Treaty of Lisbon.
Not much has changed when the European Parliament has to choose the Commission President from a pool of failed politicians who have lost elections.
The fact that the Stockholm Programme is being pushed through so quickly that we cannot bring up our data protection concerns demonstrates how strong our voice really is.
In reality, the changes to the Rules of Procedure brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon have not resulted in any increase in transparency or a stronger voice for parliaments.
For this reason, I have voted no.
