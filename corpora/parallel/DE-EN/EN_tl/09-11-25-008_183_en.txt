The German Free Democratic Party members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the Copenhagen resolution for the following reasons.
The resolution contains statements about financing for climate protection measures in third countries without defining the specific criteria or purpose of the financing.
We cannot justify this to taxpayers.
In addition, we believe that blanket criticism of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is wrong.
The ICAO is the organisation which deals with aviation matters at an international level.
Both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate.
The call for specific arrangements for a CO2 trading system for the aviation industry goes against current EU legislation and overburdens the EU's negotiating position in an international climate agreement with unrealistic demands.
