We will have to wait and see to what extent the Copenhagen conference will change this.
Against this background, rules are needed for the financing process, together with sanctions for non-compliance.
In order to bring about change, we need to restructure our environmental policy so that it does not merely involve millions being transferred to and fro as part of the certificate trading process, but also enables the promotion of real alternatives, such as renewable energy, and the reduction in the transport of goods all over Europe which is subsidised using EU money.
This report does not deal with this problem in sufficient detail and, therefore, I have voted against it.
