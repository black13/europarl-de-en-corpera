I welcome the adoption of the motion for a resolution on the Stockholm Programme.
It is important for this Parliament, as the representative of the citizens of Europe, to propose a route to be taken by the justice and home affairs policy.
We have achieved a good result.
In addition, the Treaty of Lisbon gives us security.
In future, the European Parliament will not only be playing an advisory role in these policy areas, but will also be part of the decision-making process.
We have found a good balance between security and citizens' rights.
The population needs increasing levels of security.
However, we must repeatedly answer the question about whether and to what extent citizens' rights and freedoms can be restricted by the introduction of security measures.
I think we have chosen a good middle way.
However, to ensure that this middle way really does feed into the justice and home affairs policy, we are calling for more control rights for this Parliament and for the national parliaments in the EU as part of the implementation of the Stockholm Programme.
Unfortunately, plenary did not support my call for police access to Eurodac.
This would have been another useful tool in the fight against terrorism and crime.
However, my motion calling on the Commission to present proposals for combating the abuse of the asylum system throughout Europe was successful.
Every abuse of the asylum system makes it more difficult to grant asylum to those who have a legitimate claim to it.
