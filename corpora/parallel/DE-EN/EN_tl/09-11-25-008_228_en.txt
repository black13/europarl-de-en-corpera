I very much welcome the fact that multilateral contacts with the Mediterranean region and, in particular, with the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries (SEMC) will be improved and strengthened.
I also support the European Union's efforts to start the process of modernising the economies of these countries and, therefore, to help the population.
However, I doubt very much whether this can be achieved by means of the planned Euromed Free Trade Area.
A sustainability impact assessment carried out by the University of Manchester warns of the negative social and environmental consequences for the SEMC involved.
I fear that this agreement will bring new sales markets for the EU countries, but will seriously damage the economies of the SEMC.
The parallel introduction of freedom of movement for employees called for in the motion for a resolution would also result in a huge wave of migration to Europe and lead to the drain of workers urgently needed in the SEMC.
In order to help ensure a positive future for the SEMC, I have therefore voted against this resolution.
