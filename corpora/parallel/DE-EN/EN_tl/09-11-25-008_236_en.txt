I am voting for the resolution, in particular, with regard to Regulation No 261/2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights and repealing Regulation No 295/91, which has already been adopted.
The right steps have already been taken in this regulation and strengthening and protecting passengers' rights is simply a logical development of this.
