I understand the need for a discussion about the creation of a European legislative framework for origin marking of commercial end products, in particular, against the background of consumer information and transparency between trading partners.
The use of a standardised marking system will result in improved and more accurate information for consumers and will indicate the social and environmental standards that the products comply with.
In addition, origin marking is an important step towards producing coherent trading regulations with third countries.
However, it is important to find the right balance from the perspective of producers and consumers.
The transparency offered to consumers must not be created at the expense of the manufacturers.
No additional costs must be involved for small and medium-sized businesses.
As part of the ongoing discussions, it is important to establish clear guidelines and to defend them, including on behalf of Austria.
One possible solution would be to create a voluntary European origin mark for commercial end products, taking into account existing national and regional quality labels.
