Madam President, you have made a good, clear and concise speech, Mr Bildt.
The things which you said about the European Union being a geopolitical stabilising factor and enlargement policy being a tool are all correct.
However, I believe that it is not intellectually or politically satisfying to behave as if the conflict of objectives between the increasingly large union and the increasingly close union did not exist.
This is a question which we have not definitively answered.
You are right when you say that a larger European Union has more influence, but it is also more complex, which has consequences for our ability to act.
Therefore, we must have a new dialogue about enlargement, as Mr Severin from the Social Democrats has proposed, which covers gradual integration and new forms of membership, in order to be able to reconcile these two legitimate objectives.
We need institutional reforms.
For example, I cannot explain to people in Germany why I am standing by Thessaloniki and why the Yugoslav successor states will one day have more commissioners than all the founder members of the European Union put together.
This is not right.
We need to be honest about our enlargement policy so that we once again have the support of citizens for this important policy area.
