Madam President, it is alarming how evident the EU's democratic deficit is in the case of Turkey's accession.
The majority of the EU population is clearly against Turkey joining the EU.
Nevertheless, the process of whitewashing, evaluation and negotiation is going on over the citizens' heads.
It is dishonest to behave as if we were not moving towards full membership.
As an accession candidate, Turkey is already receiving EUR 2.26 billion for the period from 2007 to 2010.
This is being paid for by the countries which are net contributors and whose citizens do not want Turkey to join.
This is obviously all about US interests.
It would be possible to resolve numerous non-European conflicts following Turkey's accession.
However, despite Turkey's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, I am of the same opinion as the highly respected former German president, Theodor Heuss, who gave a clear definition of Europe.
Europe, he said, is built on three hills: on the Acropolis for Greek humanism, on the Capitol in Rome for the concept of the European state and on Golgotha for the Christian Western world.
