Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the EU to include the western Balkans has been settled since Thessaloniki.
Accepting these countries once they have fulfilled the conditions is not an act of mercy, as many people maintain, but a simple necessity, given their geographical position in the centre of the European Union.
Our stability is determined by their stability as we unfortunately found out in the 1990s.
All the countries must, of course, meet the requirements of the Copenhagen criteria and, as these countries were formerly enemies, they must also take part in regional cooperation programmes.
This also applies to the countries which are the neighbours of these accession candidates.
I expect Slovenia and Greece to help the accession candidates to achieve their objective quickly and easily.
Unfortunately, Bosnia and Herzegovina is in a very difficult situation and I do not believe that I can cover it in one-and-a-half minutes, although I am the rapporteur for this region.
I will not even try.
I only wish, Mr Bildt and Mr Rehn, that the negotiations there could take place close to the people and not be dictated from the outside.
All the countries in the region have different distances to cover and we must help them to overcome their problems.
Mr Lambsdorff, the idea that the accession candidates will have more commissioners than the founding members is a quite pathetic argument.
It is actually not an argument at all; it is a knock-out argument.
This problem can be resolved, but the people in these countries should not be excluded just because you do not want to resolve the problem.
