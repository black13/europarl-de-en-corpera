Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am speaking as head of the delegation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and I will be concentrating on this country.
I would like to offer my very warm thanks to Mr Rehn for his courage.
His report and his green light for this country represent a bold step forward which has generated momentum.
At the same time, elections have been held in Greece and there is a new government in Athens, which gives us a situation and a window in which we can achieve something.
However, I would like to ask my fellow Members to react calmly.
A meeting is being held on Friday between Mr Papandreou and Prime Minister Gruevski, and if we set expectations too high, we may increase the pressure so much that the whole thing falls apart and we do not want to risk that.
We must encourage all sides to continue in friendship along the path that has already been taken.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Thaler, for describing this route so accurately.
I would also like to wish my friend, Mr Rehn, a successful future in the Commission.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
