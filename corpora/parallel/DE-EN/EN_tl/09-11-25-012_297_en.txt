Madam President, I have a question for Mr Chatzimarkakis, if he will allow me to ask it.
Mrs Pack obviously did not hear me when I said that we are standing by Thessaloniki.
I would like to repeat that here.
I wanted to ask Mr Chatzimarkakis what he believes to be the most urgent steps which the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia must take in order to make progress in the dispute over the name and to ensure that the negotiations which are just beginning are as successful as possible.
