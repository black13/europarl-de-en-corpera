Madam President, thank you very much for the question.
I believe that both sides need to change their spots and it is clear that both sides are ready to take a step forward.
We are now expecting a lasting solution.
For this reason, I expect the name issue to be resolved clearly and definitively in the course of a five-minute discussion.
That is not the problem.
The application of the name, the so-called scope, is the major issue and both sides obviously need time to resolve it.
I would like to see a lasting solution because the alternative is a short-term solution which could lead to disaster.
For this reason, all of us must give both sides friendly encouragement to find a long-term solution with a broad scope and a broad application.
