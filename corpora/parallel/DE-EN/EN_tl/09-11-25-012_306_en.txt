Madam President, I missed the beginning of this discussion, because as rapporteur for Croatia, I had to report to the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Bildt and Mr Rehn for their help in bringing about at least a temporary solution to the border dispute between Slovenia and Croatia.
This is a good example of how cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament can help countries to overcome their problems.
I have also made a contribution to ensuring that the treaty has been almost unanimously ratified, at least in Croatia.
However, it is Bosnia and Herzegovina which causes me much more concern.
I was recently in Banja Luka and Sarajevo.
It is true that Mr Dodik made some compromises and offered some changes during our meeting which he can agree to.
However, I would like to pick up on an idea that Mrs Pack has just mentioned.
How can we make contact with broad swathes of the population?
There is a great deal of interest there in overcoming this lack of a voice and the contradictions which characterise many policies at the top.
We must somehow manage to talk to the people directly, because in contrast to what the Earl of Dartmouth has once again said, there are many people in this region who are not interested in European Union money, but who want to move from a region of hate and war into a union of peace and understanding.
That is what Europe is about.
You do not want to understand that and you will never understand that.
However, the people in Sarajevo and Banja Luka know what Europe means and they are the ones who need our help.
