Madam President, we must bring Croatia into the European Union next year or at least bring the accession negotiations to an end and start the ratification process.
For 20 years, Croatia has been moving towards joining the European Union and towards freedom.
Artificial obstacles have been put in its way and I am grateful to the Swedish Presidency for helping to remove them.
Croatia has now ratified the agreement with Slovenia with a two-thirds majority and we must do everything we can to ensure that Slovenia also fulfils its obligations to the European Union.
The target date of 2010 is also important because this is a question of the credibility of the European Union itself.
As far as Macedonia is concerned, I hope that the Swedish Presidency will succeed in enabling accession negotiations to begin next year, so that we can finally resolve the bilateral problem which also exists in this case.
I hope that we can change the text of the report which rather one-sidedly places too many obligations on Macedonia and not enough on its neighbours.
Everyone must do their bit, including those in the European Union.
I believe it is crucial for us to include Kosovo fully in the Thessaloniki process and these are important passages in the Albertini report.
This country also needs a European perspective.
I would like to call on all Member States who have not already done so to recognise Kosovo, so that we no longer have any legal or technical problems and so that Kosovo can play a full part in the integration process.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
