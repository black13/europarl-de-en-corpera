Madam President, I would like to respond briefly by quoting my highly esteemed colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance who once said in this House: 'Macedonia is Macedonia is Macedonia'.
I am of exactly the same opinion.
Bullying a neighbouring country is never helpful.
