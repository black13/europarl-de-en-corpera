Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, violence against women is a dreadful violation of human rights, regardless of what form it takes, including forced marriage, beatings and rape.
I find the term 'honour killing' particularly repellent, because there is nothing honourable about it.
Honour killing is a hideous crime and we must do everything we can to combat it.
The Treaty of Lisbon is about to be signed and, therefore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights as an annex to the treaty will be particularly important.
This is why we in the European Union are obliged to do everything possible to combat this violence.
It has already been mentioned that rape can be used as a weapon of war.
References have already been made to the Congo, where these dreadful acts have been taking place for years and where rapists even claim young children and elderly women as their victims.
We have a number of programmes in place and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has referred to the fact that she has approached women in government all over the world.
Apparently that is not enough.
This is not just a problem for women.
It is a problem for everyone in the world.
We in the European Union must do everything we can to improve the situation.
