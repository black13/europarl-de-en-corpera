Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Atalanta operation represents a successful contribution by the EU to security in the Horn of Africa and it should be continued.
However, the EU also has a broader common responsibility.
This involves not turning a blind eye when illegal toxic waste exports or illegal fishing damages Somalia's interests.
For this reason, we must take a consistent approach to following up on these matters.
The resolution that we will be voting on tomorrow takes the wrong track in two respects and we do not endorse these approaches.
It is wrong to want to change the Atalanta mandate now, either with regard to enlarging the area of operations or with regard to the attempt by Members of this House to extend the mandate to include fishing.
We want the mandate to continue unchanged.
Secondly, it is highly questionable to launch a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) training mission which has not been properly justified and which will not make a demonstrable contribution to state-building in Somalia.
We should be working on the principle of caution rather than haste.
