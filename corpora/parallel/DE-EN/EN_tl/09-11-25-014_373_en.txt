Madam President, Somalia is a country in a constant state of emergency and has had no government for almost 20 years.
We in the EU must help to change this situation.
This is why we support the Commission's work.
However, we are very sceptical about the new European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) mission and the plan to train 2 000 soldiers for the transitional government in Somalia.
What is the real goal of this mission?
What is the overall political concept for Somalia?
What value can we add to the current US and French training projects?
We do not understand how this mission can contribute to state-building.
What legitimacy does the transitional government have?
Why are we supporting it?
Why do we believe that the soldiers will help it?
How can we prevent the soldiers from joining the war lords once they have been trained?
We believe that there are still too many questions relating to this mission for it to be possible to start planning for it.
Above all, I do not see what value the EU can add and I believe that the money would be better spent on other projects which the Commission is already running.
