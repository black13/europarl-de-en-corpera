Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the resolution.
Passive smoking is a huge problem, particularly for children.
The president of the German association of paediatricians once said that smoking in the presence of children constitutes intentional bodily harm.
I would not express it as drastically as that myself, but it is clear that we need to act.
I very much welcome the legislation that has been introduced in Ireland, Italy and other countries.
I think that the legal and practical situation in Germany is shameful from a health policy perspective.
We have a lot to learn from other European countries in this respect.
Nevertheless, it is not as easy as paragraphs 2, 10 and 13 of this resolution suggest.
We have only limited authority at a European level and introducing legislation in this area could be politically counterproductive.
We can only protect workers.
We cannot provide special protection for children by taking action at a European level.
However, it is this sort of protection that is urgently needed.
Therefore, I would ask you to support the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on this subject.
One word about the controversial tobacco subsidies, which we have been discussing for years.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has always called for them to be abolished.
Now we have a good compromise in the Council and, therefore, I would like to make a strong personal plea, subject to a discussion with my group, for leaving paragraph 9 unchanged.
It is an effective compromise and people will not understand it if we continue to pay subsidies as we have in the past.
We need this change and we should support it.
