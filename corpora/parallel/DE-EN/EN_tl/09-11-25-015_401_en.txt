Madam President, we need clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers to be introduced throughout Europe.
However, in my opinion 'throughout Europe' does not necessarily mean 'from Europe'.
Many Member States already have in place legislation to protect non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing laws of this kind.
Why are some of my fellow Members now saying that we in Brussels can do this much better than the Member States, regardless of the fact that the European Union has no authority on health policy and that we have to implement this via the circuitous route of health and safety at work?
In my opinion, the Member States should decide which regulations to put in place to protect non-smokers.
This makes sense, because they are closer to the local problems and issues.
I do not understand why Brussels should impose protection for non-smokers in Lapland and in Andalusia which is identical in every detail.
What has happened to the cross-border implications?
We in Brussels have come up against our limits in this respect.
For me, protecting children and young people is particularly important.
We need comprehensive protection in this area.
If we introduce protection for non-smokers on a European level via health and safety at work, we are not protecting children and young people, because they are not employees.
Therefore, I would ask you to support Amendments 2 and 13 put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
