Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often the case that good intentions cause problems.
No one here would question the fact that non-smokers need comprehensive protection.
However, the compromise motion for a resolution on smoke-free environments on which we will be voting on Thursday goes far beyond the protection of non-smokers.
Even though the current draft explicitly supports the principle of subsidiarity, it also undermines it.
The motion calls for strict and legally binding regulations at EU level.
It abuses valid concern for health protection in an attempt to transfer invalid authority in the field of health policy and of work and social issues to a European level.
We all want a Europe which is close to its people and the principle of subsidiarity is the key to this.
The Member States or, in the case of Germany, the federal states, must have their own discussions on the protection of non-smokers.
This is the only way to identify solutions which suit each country's traditions and culture and are therefore close to its people.
For these reasons, I would ask you to vote against the motion for a resolution in its current form on Thursday.
