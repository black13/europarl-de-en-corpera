The Member States in particular have some catching up to do when it comes to the protection of non-smokers.
Our central concern must be to protect vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.
However, the European Union has no direct authority in this area.
Health care is, and remains, a matter for the Member States and the countries must take on responsibility for these issues.
The EU should therefore focus on what it can do to protect non-smokers, which means protecting employees in the workplace.
However, attempting to achieve the fundamental aim of making Europe smoke-free by introducing a large number of regulations to protect workers is not a satisfactory solution to the problem.
In order to protect as many sections of the population as possible and, in particular, children from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke, we need more campaigns to raise public awareness.
This is the only effective means of changing the way in which people in Europe think in the long term and this is the only solution to reducing smoking in the private sphere.
