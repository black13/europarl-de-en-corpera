in writing. - I am a non-smoker myself.
I am fully aware of the damage to health caused by using tobacco and by passive smoking.
However, as is so often the case, these plans from the EU go a step too far.
Some of these regulations are completely absurd and, in some cases, do not even permit smoking in the open air.
The EU is focusing obsessively on the consumption of tobacco, while there are a number of other activities in daily life which have been statistically proven to be hazardous and harmful, such as fast food, sun beds, alcohol and coffee, driving a car, taking no exercise and having too little sleep, to name but a few.
I would welcome sensible regulations and awareness campaigns which aim to minimise the risks involved.
However, all adults should ultimately be responsible for making their own decisions about the extent to which they are prepared to accept the resulting damage to their health.
A total ban on smoking in businesses is planned for 2012 and this gives very little consideration to those businesses that will suffer most, in other words, those in the catering industry.
They can expect a drop in their takings of up to 20% which will result in the loss of numerous jobs.
In addition, in recent years, restaurants and bars were required by law to set up smoking and non-smoking areas on their premises.
A total smoking ban in 2012 would make these expensive investments obsolete at a stroke.
The draft Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments is not a sensible measure.
