Madam President, it is true, ladies and gentlemen, that in times of crisis, worldwide minimum standards protect workers from inhumane working conditions.
The EU always supports the core standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in soapbox speeches and in its contacts with third countries and rightly so, because they protect workers against discrimination and social dumping.
Unfortunately, within the European Union things do not go any further than these soapbox speeches.
The Member States of the EU and the EU itself ignore the ILO conventions.
They do not ratify them and they do not implement them.
This allows the Member States and the EU to shirk their responsibilities.
For example, the Court of Justice of the European Union has abolished the right to strike and the Commission has applauded the move.
For example, the convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers has been ratified by only three out of the 27 Member States.
This is scandalous and this situation needs to change 90 years after the founding of the ILO.
