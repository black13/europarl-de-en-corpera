Madam President, adequate food is a human right and hunger is a crime against humanity.
I also think that the human race has enough technical and scientific knowledge to ensure that no one in the world should have to suffer from hunger.
Of course, money is also needed to combat world hunger.
However, it is not just about money.
We also need to meet the following requirements beforehand.
Firstly, developing a stable democratic structure in developing countries, secondly, fighting corruption, thirdly, establishing a suitable agricultural system in developing countries and then, finally, investing in agriculture.
Too little is often said about the first three points.
In addition, a lot of funding disappears in these countries, gets into the wrong hands and is used for corrupt practices.
