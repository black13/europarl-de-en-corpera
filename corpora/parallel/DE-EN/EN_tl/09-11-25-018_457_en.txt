Madam President, long-term food security is one of the central challenges of the common agricultural policy.
In particular, in the light of food shortages, we must emphasise the importance of a strong CAP which will take on a key role in future in overcoming global challenges.
This means that adequate long-term funding for the CAP is required.
The CAP is an important element of the EU food and security policy and after 2013, it will play a significant role in development policy and in external food security policy.
Therefore, perfectly functioning ecosystems, fertile soil, stable water resources and further diversification of the rural economy are the highest priorities.
International cooperation and solidarity, together with balanced trade agreements which promote, rather than jeopardise, food security are an essential element of global food security and this is where a strong CAP can make an important contribution.
