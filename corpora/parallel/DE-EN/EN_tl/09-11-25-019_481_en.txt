Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mrs Herranz Garc√≠a for bringing up this topic today in Parliament.
This is a discussion which is fundamental to food policy.
I am not interested in shaming Brazil or other countries.
The basic question is this: Do we need these strict regulations for European agricultural production in the interests of consumer safety?
If the answer is 'yes', then this means that consumer protection is regarded as a coherent whole.
If the regulations are needed, then the same rules must apply to imports as to our own farmers.
The Commission must not allow imports from countries which do not fulfil these requirements.
Cattle farmers in Europe must not be punished because one cow in their herd has an ear tag missing, when imports are allowed from cattle herds which do not have a single ear tag.
This is not acceptable.
If traceability is so important for consumer protection, then it must also apply to imports.
If we cannot ensure that this is the case, then it is unfair to our farmers to demand it of them.
I have the impression that those people in the Commission who are responsible for imports are applying double standards.
As already discussed, I am not interested in partitioning off Europe.
I would like to see fair competition for our farmers in Europe so that we can continue to guarantee the food supply of half-a-billion people in future.
I can assure you of one thing, Commissioner, and you can pass this on to your successor, Parliament will continue to touch on this sore point.
We will not give up until equal competitive conditions have been established.
We have good arguments that we can bring up repeatedly to ensure that food security is guaranteed in Europe in future.
