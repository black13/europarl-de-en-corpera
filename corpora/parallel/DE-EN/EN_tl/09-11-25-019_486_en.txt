Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's agricultural experts have made a quite simple demand.
They are asking for no more and no less than the same conditions for production at home, that is within the European Union, as for imports.
I listened with interest as Mrs Vassiliou spent more than ten minutes explaining to us that essentially, this is not possible.
She could have answered more concisely.
She could simply have said: 'Yes, Parliament is right and I will put that in place and take it into account in future'.
What my group and now Parliament are asking for has nothing to do with trade restrictions.
On the contrary, it is a crucial requirement for fair world trade and for the mutual exchange of goods.
We want fair rules in the market economy within the EU and abroad, no more and no less.
We will be calling for this now and in future from the Commission.
You can be sure of that.
