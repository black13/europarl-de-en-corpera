Madam President, our citizens have high expectations regarding the safety and quality of their food.
This concerns not only animal health and food safety, but also environmental standards, production and animal welfare.
The traceability and accompanying transparency of foodstuffs from the producer to the consumer is only guaranteed in Europe.
It is in all our interests to ensure that our consumers are protected, that European agricultural products are competitive and, therefore, that the agricultural industry itself is competitive.
For this reason, I feel that it is essential and that it is one of our responsibilities as Members of the European Parliament to speed up this debate and to ensure that the related political framework is in place.
