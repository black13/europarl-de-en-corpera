Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer to Chapter 7 of the Court of Auditors' report which concerns research, energy and transport.
First of all, I would like to express my considerable gratitude to the Court of Auditors for its thorough work.
However, it is clear from this chapter that the Court of Auditors is not able to award good marks to this area in its annual report.
This is an area in which expenditure amounts to more than EUR 9 billion.
According to the assessment of the Court of Auditors, the error rate is between 2 and 5%.
In other words, on the basis of this calculation, between EUR 180 and 450 million has been incorrectly spent.
The Court of Auditors' conclusion is that this is 'partially effective' and I see this in terms of marks at school as at best a C minus.
In my opinion, it is strange that the Commission does not feel it necessary to give its opinion on this.
To me, the Commission's silence seems highly eloquent.
In its recommendation, the Court of Auditors says that the Commission should continue its work of simplifying the financial regulations.
I agree with this.
The committee responsible has had discussions along the same lines.
However, I do not agree that the Commission, in giving its opinion on the Court of Auditors' recommendation, is turning this recommendation on its head.
The Court of Auditors says that the aim of simplifying the regulations must be combined with the aim of cost-effective control which will be sufficient to ensure that the money is spent correctly.
In contrast, the Commission says that it wants cost-effective control and suggests that there is a tolerable risk of error, which must be taken into account from the start.
This is not a reasonable way of dealing with taxpayers' money.
The Commission should rethink what it has said and Parliament should support the Court of Auditors in its critical activities.
