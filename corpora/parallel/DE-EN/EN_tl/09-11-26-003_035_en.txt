Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Caldeira and his team.
His report will be very useful to us in our deliberations which lead up to the granting of a discharge.
I have a sense of déjà vu, because as far as I can tell, the Council is once again conspicuous by its absence, just as it was last year.
I am being so critical because the Council, as one of our major community institutions, cannot and should not stand outside this debate.
We rightly expect all the Member States to provide control and transparency, but we also expect this from our own institutions and the Council is jointly responsible for what happens or does not happen in the Member States.
Of course, the irregularities in the budgets do not affect the Council's budget as severely as they do the agricultural sector, but nevertheless, we will also have questions about public procurement, late payments or overdue payments and repeated overestimating.
We will be discussing this with the Council in the next few weeks.
It is true that errors are not the same as fraud and that the recovery of payments is a useful tool.
Another good tool is the process of naming and shaming in the area of agricultural policy which has proved its worth in Bavaria and in the rest of Germany.
I believe that we should continue to use this method because it has become clear that the Member States and the companies involved react to it.
We expect the Swedish Presidency to be ready to discuss this over the next few days and also...
