Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus until now has been on the cohesion fund and this is certainly justified because of the size of the budget.
However, I would now like to draw attention to an area in which only EUR 2.7 billion was spent last year, but which causes significant problems.
The European Court of Auditors, which I would like to thank warmly at this point, has produced a semi-masterpiece, as it has succeeded in bringing transparency to the fragmented administration in the area of development aid and in clearly identifying the problems which continue to occur.
I would not like to go as far as saying that this area has no universal principle and no transparent structures, but it does have considerable problems.
There have been improvements, for example, in the payments for projects, but nevertheless it is still the case that no audits can be carried out on some of the projects because the receipts are missing, not to mention the fact that some receipts are not even provided in the first place or that there are no opportunities for follow-up audits.
The subject of budget aid once again involves particular problems because it is not possible to follow up or trace the money and what it is used for.
In my opinion, we should carefully consider finally integrating the European Development Fund (EDF) into the general budget, for reasons of transparency, traceability and manageability.
This would allow us to combine and coordinate the EDF with other fields, such as development aid, foreign policy, neighbourhood policy and other policies in the same area, so that we could obtain a complete and transparent overview.
This is my proposal.
