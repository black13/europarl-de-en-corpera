I am reminded of two basic rules from my childhood.
I was once told: 'When someone speaks to you, let him finish talking.
If you ask a question, then at least wait for the answer'.
On that principle, it would have been nice if he had stayed in the House, so that he could follow the debate in Parliament.
That is my opinion.
The controls and the improvements suggested by the Court of Auditors make a significant contribution to the more effective and more economical use of EU funds.
As a Member with an interest in agriculture, I am particularly pleased that the use of funds in the area of agriculture was given a positive assessment and that on average, no significant irregularities were found.
However, this is on average and that is precisely where the problem lies.
There is a saying in agriculture that on average, the lake was half a metre deep, but the cow still drowned.
In other words, when, on average, everything is correct and when the overwhelming majority of countries are able to apply the administrative regulations appropriately, it is then in particular that we must deal with the countries which do not toe the line, the bad guys.
It is important to name names in this respect.
Mr President, please do not give in.
You can be more specific in what you say and Parliament will give you its support.
The situation regarding the error rate in rural development is rather different.
Even though the error rate is lower than the previous year, it is still significantly higher than that for agricultural expenditure.
However, I must say at this point that the majority of the problems identified are due to the incorrect application and lack of understanding of complex EU regulations.
This does not necessarily mean that money is being wasted.
We must all work together to modify and improve the EU regulations, so that the Member States can apply them more easily.
