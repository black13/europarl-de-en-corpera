Madam President, I am sorry that I have to take this opportunity to make a personal remark which, according to the agenda, I have been given three minutes for.
However, I will not need three minutes.
I took a very constructive approach in my speech and in the debate I pointed out very constructively what could now be done on this new basis.
In order to be able to come to this assessment, I followed the debate this morning very closely.
I was in the chamber much earlier than my fellow Member stated, left later and am now here again.
I feel that it is a great pity that Mrs Gräßle obviously feels it necessary to make personal attacks which really are below the belt.
I would like her to be constructive and I would like to see fewer incorrect stories by her in the German newspaper the Bild Zeitung.
I would prefer to hear constructive suggestions about how we can rescue the situation and how the Court of Auditors can be given the ability to do this.
In addition, it is a great pity that Mrs Gräßle, in particular, is the person who unnecessarily makes the work of the non-attached Members more difficult, discriminates against us, prevents us from accessing information, does not allow us the opportunity to work with employees and then feels that it is worthwhile attacking us on the basis of incorrect facts.
You should learn about democracy, Mrs Gräßle.
