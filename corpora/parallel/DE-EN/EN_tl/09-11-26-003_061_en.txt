It is true that there are still significant deficiencies in some areas, in particular, in the case of cohesion policy, but the fall in the error rate in the area of agriculture and natural resources to below 2% gives me cause to look optimistically to the future.
Particularly given that this area makes up the majority of the European Union's spending, the comparatively low error rate of 2% can be seen as satisfactory.
In future, we should put all our efforts into two areas.
The first of these is cooperation between the Commission and the Member States.
The aim here is to identify inaccurate and incorrect data in all the different areas of spending and to correct the errors.
The second area involves improving the EU's methods for paying EU money to the Member States and recovering it from them.
