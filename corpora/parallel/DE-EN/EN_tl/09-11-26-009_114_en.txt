Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also voted no, because I am of the opinion that Turkey must first fulfil all the criteria, before we can make such a positive statement here.
In particular, I would like to highlight the border dispute between Cyprus and Turkey, which has still not been settled this year, and the illegal occupation of Cyprus, which has not yet been brought to an end.
However, I did not want to vote against the other accession candidates.
I would particularly make an exception in the case of the Balkan States which I would like to welcome here in this House as soon as possible.
