Mr President, I would like to speak about two aspects of the smoke-free environment.
Firstly, I have voted in favour of the Member States being given the authority in this area, on the one hand, because of the concept of subsidiarity and, on the other hand, because we do not have any authority.
Although I am very much in favour of a smoke-free environment, I believe that in this case we should play by the rules.
The second aspect is that I find it annoying that the European Union subsidises the cultivation of tobacco.
This will be phased out and I have also voted in favour of this, because I cannot bring it into line with the other idea of banning smoking altogether.
Therefore, we must be consistent.
If we want to combat smoking, then we should not subsidise tobacco cultivation.
