Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German conservative group (CSU) would like to see clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers being introduced throughout Europe.
However, in my opinion, 'throughout Europe' does not necessarily mean 'from within Europe'.
Many Member States already have in place regulations for protecting non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing regulations of this kind.
I do not believe - in common with the majority of my fellow Members in the European Parliament, which is very pleasing - that we in Brussels must impose regulations for the protection of non-smokers or that we are able to do this more effectively.
The European Union has no authority in this area.
We are only responsible for health and safety at work.
This is where the problem lies, because for me the most important issue is protecting children and young people and this group, which specifically needs protection, would not be covered by regulations that refer only to health and safety at work.
Therefore, the Member States must take action in this area.
I have voted in favour and I am pleased that this amendment was accepted.
