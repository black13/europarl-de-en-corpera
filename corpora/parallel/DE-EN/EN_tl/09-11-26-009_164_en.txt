The motion for a resolution on the European Commission's current enlargement strategy is very balanced.
It rewards the progress made by the accession candidates but, at the same time, clearly identifies the problems.
Turkey, in particular, has taken a major step backwards.
Therefore, I welcome the explicit criticism of the serious threats to, and genuine restrictions on, freedom of speech and of the press.
The completely disproportionate tax penalty imposed on the opposition Dogan Media Group is a targeted attack against those who criticise the government.
Objections have rightly been made to the discrimination against religious minorities and Turkey's refusal to implement the Ankara protocol.
In addition, it is also important that we take a careful look at Turkish foreign policy.
Its openness towards Armenia and the Kurds has so far been nothing more than gesture politics and has even been opposed by the Turkish parliament and by large sections of the population.
The statements made by the Turkish Prime Minister also call into question Turkey's hoped-for role as a mediator between East and West.
Turkey's flattery of the Iranian President, its invitation to the Sudanese President, who is wanted for genocide, to attend a conference, and its dealings with Israel, seem to indicate that it is turning away from the West.
Therefore, our call for the Turkish Government to coordinate its foreign policy with that of the EU and to drop its objections to the cooperation between NATO and the EU is simply consistent.
