Health policy and, therefore, the protection of non-smokers clearly come under the authority of the Member States and should not be the subject of central regulations.
The Member States must have the freedom to determine the extent to which they want to protect non-smokers.
It must be made clear that the EU has no authority in this area.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of Parliament's resolution for next week's summit of EU health ministers.
