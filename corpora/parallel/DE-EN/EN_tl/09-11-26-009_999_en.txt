I strongly oppose the Commission's enlargement strategy with regard to Turkey.
The clear majority of EU citizens is against Turkey joining the EU and yet they must help to fund payments of billions of euros to Turkey in its role of official accession candidate.
Turkey is not a European country, either geographically or culturally, or in terms of safeguarding human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
The enlargement strategy takes almost no account of the concerns of the citizens of Europe.
Instead it represents the geostrategic interests of the US.
In addition, the unresolved conflicts on Turkey's borders will become EU problems if Turkey were to join.
I regret the fact that the entire enlargement strategy, which includes Iceland and the western Balkans as well as Turkey, was discussed as a whole and this made it impossible to have a proper, selective, differentiated debate.
The arrogance with which the subject of Turkey's accession is being handled is reflected in this procedure.
The unwelcome voices of those opposed to accession, who represent the majority of the population, are largely being ignored.
