Mr President, various things have already been said on this matter.
One speaker explained that this is the wrong subject for debate, because there are more urgent issues that involve more significant violations of human rights.
That may be the case, but I believe that we Europeans, who work to ensure that values such as human rights and freedoms - for example, the freedom of the press - are respected everywhere, must defend this freedom whenever we become aware that it is under threat.
It was also said, for example, that the Friedrich-Naumann foundation was involved in the coup.
As a member of the FDP, I explicitly reject this claim.
These are rumours which have been spread around and which are completely without foundation.
My third point is that it was said that Mr van Baalen was accused of discussing a coup and this is why he was expelled from the country.
If you cannot openly discuss all kinds of subjects - for us this is part of the freedom of the press and of speech, two freedoms which we have here and which we value highly - is this really a reason for expelling someone from the country, simply because a subject of whatever kind was discussed?
The fact that this happens in public is no justification for expelling someone from the country, simply because a discussion took place.
This is totally the wrong approach.
