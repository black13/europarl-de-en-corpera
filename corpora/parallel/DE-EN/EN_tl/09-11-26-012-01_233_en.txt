Mr President, one thing has come out of this rather difficult debate.
The Member from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has indirectly confirmed that the question of a coup really was the subject of these discussions.
She has defended what took place by using the argument that it must be possible to talk about anything, even a coup.
That is one remarkable result of this debate which helps to clarify the situation and I am grateful for this.
