Mr President, in recent years, China has seen huge economic growth.
Many Chinese people's quality of life has improved.
Unfortunately, there has been no progress of this kind in safeguarding and respecting human rights in China and this applies to all its citizens, regardless of their religion or ethnic group.
On the contrary, the oppressive measures taken against the Uighurs and the Tibetans have increased.
As far as the death penalty is concerned, it is a positive sign that the highest Chinese court has once again reviewed all the sentences since 2007 and we assume that some death sentences will be revoked.
However, sadly, China is the world leader in executions.
In 2008 alone, at least 1 718 people were executed.
The estimated number of unreported cases is much higher.
Even the minimum figure means that China is responsible for more than 70% of all executions throughout the world.
In addition, China has increased the number of crimes liable to the death penalty.
This means that Chinese people can be executed for committing more than 68 crimes.
That is why we are calling in this resolution for China to suspend its planned executions and introduce a moratorium on the death penalty immediately.
(Applause)
