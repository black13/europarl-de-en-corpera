Mr President, it was said that this was a speech on behalf of our group.
Following thorough consultation over the last week, our group proposed in the Conference of Presidents that this point should be included on the agenda.
We want to discuss this point and we want it to be put to the vote.
The speech expressed the personal opinion of my colleague and not the opinion of the group.
