Mr President, the question of human rights and respect for minority rights has been a constant source of conflict for years, if not for decades, in the relationship between the European Union and the People's Republic of China.
The situation of the minorities in particular worsened after the end of the Olympic Games and the Tibetans and the Uighurs have been subjected to strong pressure over recent months.
For this reason, I cannot understand why my fellow Members do not want paragraph 9 to be included in the resolution, because this would encourage peaceful dialogue rather than the prevailing oppression.
China is a powerful player on the world stage.
In order to be recognised as a player on the world stage as well, China must ensure that human rights are respected.
This must not only be included in the constitution, it must also be put into practice.
This and nothing less is what the Tibetans, Uighurs and human rights groups in China are calling for.
(Applause)
