Mr President, I have already mentioned in this House that the World Uighur Congress, the central organisation for free Uighurs, is based in Munich, for the same reason that thankfully many Czechs and many other people lived in Munich: because Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were also located there.
The city still retains this spirit of freedom today.
At the same time, Franz-Josef Strauß, who always defended these freedom radio stations against calls for their closure, ensured that we developed a relationship with China very early on.
The two things are not mutually exclusive, but complementary: positive contacts with China, but clear defence of religious freedom and human rights.
Several homes in Munich were searched by the police during a raid this week and Chinese agents who do nothing but terrorise and spy on Uighurs were arrested.
This indicates the sort of methods that China uses.
These methods are unacceptable.
They range from terrorising people in Munich through to death penalties in Ürümqi.
This is why we must make our opinions quite clear in this regard.
