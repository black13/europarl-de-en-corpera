Mr President, I would like to endorse what Reinhard BÃ¼tikofer has said.
My group had proposed that we discuss the imminent executions of the Uighurs in China and the participants in the protest demonstrations against the fraudulent elections in Iran who had been condemned to death, because these are two countries where executions are likely to take place very soon and, therefore, an urgent debate is needed.
It is true that the Chinese hold the world record for executions, as you have said, and that the Chinese regime is unjust, because it disregards human rights.
I would like to state explicitly that this is an intolerable situation.
However, in the Conference of Presidents, we asked for the two things to be kept separate: the urgent issues which we are discussing now, in other words, the imminent executions, and the question of the relationship between the European Union and China on economic, cultural, political and defence issues and in other areas.
We want to discuss this in a debate on the EU-China Summit and to summarise it in a resolution.
This is why the mishmash that has come out of this has nothing to do with urgent issues.
This is also why our group is insisting on a vote on the urgent matter which we proposed and not on the hotchpotch that you have submitted.
