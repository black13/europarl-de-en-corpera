Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are strongly opposed to the death penalty, wherever in the world it is enforced.
We are also opposed to the oppression of ethnic and religious minorities and both of these things are sadly happening in China.
Many people hoped that China would show more respect for human rights as a result of the Olympic Games and also that, because the Chinese are aware that the eyes of the world are on them, they would commit fewer abuses of human rights.
Unfortunately, that has not been the case.
The executions have continued and, therefore, it is very important for us to discuss this today, following the executions in November of nine Uighurs, which many people in the world are completely unaware of, and before that of two Tibetans.
The summit between the EU and China is not far off and, as several of the previous speakers have mentioned, China is an important trading partner.
This is what makes it so difficult to bring up the breaches of human rights repeatedly, but that is why it is particularly important to talk about this subject today in the run-up to the summit.
We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere.
It is good that Parliament introduced a moratorium on the death penalty in 2007 and we must do everything we can to keep this subject in the forefront of people's minds while the death penalty is still in place.
