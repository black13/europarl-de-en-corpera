Mr President, excuse me, but there is an error in paragraph 3 of the German version and I would like to ask you to have it corrected there and, if necessary, in all the other language versions.
The German version reads: 'Condemns the execution of the two Tibetans and another nine Uighurs'.
Of course, this is incorrect.
Uighurs are not other Tibetans and Tibetans are not other Uighurs.
I would like to ask you to have this corrected in all the language versions.
