Mr President, I do not know whether what I am going to say still relates to the agenda, but I think that this is the most appropriate time to mention it.
One of the consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon is, of course, that the number of MEPs will change, and for Austria this means that two new Members will be joining this House.
These Members are ready, they have been elected and it is important that they come here soon.
I would like to ask you what steps have already been taken to enable these Members to take their places here quickly, either as observers or as full Members, or what you intend to do to make this happen quickly.
