Mr President, on 8 December, the ESDP mission, Operation Atalanta, celebrated one year of existence.
According to the Swedish Presidency, the operation has demonstrated its ability to counter piracy effectively and there has been a significant fall in attacks.

According to a report by the International Maritime Bureau, in the first nine months of 2009, there were more attacks in total than in the whole of 2008.

The financial efficiency of this operation is also highly questionable.

The new planned ESDP mission in Somalia, once again, will not get to the root of the problem, but merely deal with the symptoms.
