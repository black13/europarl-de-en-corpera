Mr President, I would like to say a few brief words about two subjects.
Firstly, the question of equal treatment is linked, with the same level of urgency, to the outstanding problem of the equality of men and women.
It ought to be a given that men and women of equal calibre with the same qualifications and in the same position should receive the same pay.
In Austria, everything is turned on its head, because the better qualified women are, the worse their advancement is compared to their male colleagues with the same qualifications.
Very recent figures show that women's disadvantage increases with age, for example, women over 60 earn around 34% less than their male colleagues.
Secondly, I would like to make the comment that children require protection.
I would have liked to have seen the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrined in the Austrian constitution.
I hope that this discussion will soon be taken up once again in Austria and that it will have a positive outcome.
