Madam President, firstly, I would like to say that I am very grateful that we are debating this item today, because from the media, you might get the impression that the crisis has only been in the dairy sector.
That was, and is, not the case, and it is therefore extremely important for the farmers affected that we discuss their situation in the European Parliament today.
The economic crisis has hit farmers hard.
The last financial year was one of the worst of the decade.
For many farms, profits have fallen significantly, and therefore the situation is very difficult for many farmers.
Economic crises expose deficiencies - deficiencies caused by people.
Crises only become disasters if nothing is done about them.
It is precisely because economic crises expose human errors that we are able to address those errors.
In any crisis, there is also an opportunity, and it is of precisely these opportunities that we must make greater use.
In order to do so, firstly, the Commission must react quicker and more consistently in the event of any disturbances of the economic balance.
Secondly, we must create the necessary political framework to enable farmers to regulate the market themselves.
Thirdly, the legal authority of producer organisations must be significantly improved.
Fourthly, we must significantly improve and simplify the use of agricultural raw materials for the production of renewable energy by way of market regulation.
Fifthly, rather than merely talking about a reduction in red tape, we must actually address this problem at long last.
Thus, my appeal, once again, is the following: let us learn from the crisis and utilise the opportunity arising from it - we owe this to ourselves and, above all, to all of our farmers.
In this regard, I await a catalogue of measures from the Commission at the beginning of 2010 that we can then debate in detail in the committee responsible.
