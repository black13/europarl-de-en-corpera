Madam President, Mrs Fischer Boel, thank you very much for your report.
This is an important signal to our farmers, who are having to live with this strained market situation.
In your report, you also referred to the fall in demand in the agricultural sector.
This is precisely why it is important to invigorate this sector and stimulate sales.
Now, more than ever, the Commission needs to recognise crises at an early stage, irrespective of the branch of production, and quickly and efficiently take steps to counter them.
I am convinced that such a sensitive sector as food production is in particular need of market instruments.
The added benefits of agriculture in the form of keeping open our cultural landscapes, care of the countryside, biodiversity and many other things besides are irreplaceable.
We need to retain all of this and to take it into consideration in our future debates on the new agricultural policy.
