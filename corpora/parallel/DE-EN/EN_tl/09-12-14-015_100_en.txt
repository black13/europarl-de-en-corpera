Mr President, during the debate on his guidelines, Mr Barroso said that sustainability and the preservation of biodiversity would be priority policy objectives in the European Union in the current legislative term.
These objectives must therefore be pursued in all policy fields and, of course, in particular in the area of agriculture.
I would like to urge you emphatically today to promote and support those measures - and only those measures - that contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and to sustainability.
