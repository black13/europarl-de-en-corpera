Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed the case that there is currently a crisis in many agricultural sectors.
There are, no doubt, many reasons for this.
One of them is probably the liberalisation of agricultural policy in recent years.
If we remove more and more safety nets from the common agricultural policy, then the price fluctuations will increase.
This is causing ever greater problems for our farmers.
Therefore, in the short term, the aim must surely be to find a solution to this crisis.
Above all, however, in conjunction with the revision of our agricultural policy, we need to consider what we can do about these price fluctuations.
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we, as Parliament, have a duty to be active.
The fact that the agricultural ministers have met in Paris outside of the Council in recent days in order to discuss this issue is surely, in principle, a good thing.
However, in Parliament, it is our job to demonstrate our new role to our farmers.
We need to find democratic solutions for our future agricultural policy.
