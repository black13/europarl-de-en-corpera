Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, the Seventh Session of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference was held in Geneva.
I had the opportunity, as the representative of the delegation of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to attend the conference and, as co-author, to contribute to the present joint motion for a resolution.
There are four lessons that can and need to be learned from these experiences.
The economic and financial crisis also brought a sharp fall in world trade.
A speedy conclusion to the negotiations in the Doha Round is therefore crucial in order to give new impetus to the world economy.
The revival of fair and free world trade is something that Doha can, and indeed must, achieve.
The European Union has gone a long way to accommodate its partners, in particular those in the developing countries.
For example, we have promised to abolish all export subsidies for agricultural products.
Now we need to bring the negotiations to a conclusion.
For this to happen, we need a signal of political will.
In the ALDE Group, we are determined to achieve a conclusion to Doha.
Now!
It is therefore vital to join forces in order to bring the Round to a conclusion.
The European Union can and must play a leading role in this.
We should also take on a bridging role, for example, to bring together the United States and the emerging economies and developing countries, just as we call for in our joint resolution.
We must now also raise the public's awareness.
We need broader support from the citizens.
We should emphasise the advantages of global trade, as free and fair world trade is good for all of us.
I do not see any alternative to Doha.
The alternative would be competition for bilateral agreements, which would put access for the weaker countries and the inclusion of human rights and environmental aims at risk.
That must not happen.
We therefore need a conclusion to the Doha Round now.
