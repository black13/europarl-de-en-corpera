Mr President, Commissioner, the questions raised by the committee chair in this debate reflect global circumstances.
The balance of our global economic order is disastrous.
Two billion people live in extreme poverty.
Climate change has already forced more than 40 million people to flee their homes and the proliferation of global financial trading has led to the worst economic crisis in 80 years.
Mr Zahradil, we have here an historic task to initiate a completely new regulation of the global economy, guided by the aims of sustainability, environmental protection, social justice and food security.
Looking at Geneva, I can only say that the World Trade Organisation conference has failed in this task.
Despite all assurances, the opportunity that a gathering of the states might bring was lost.
The Doha mediators are clearly still operating within the framework of a completely out-of-date and - I think we should be honest here - failed negotiation mandate.
In the opinion of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, this needs to change as a matter of urgency, because the failure of Geneva and of Rome and the complicated negotiations now in Copenhagen are directly linked.
I therefore call on the Commission to work directly with the European Parliament in formulating a redefined negotiation mandate to further develop and transform the WTO.
This must include the importance of the world trade architecture in the creation of the world crises, and potentially also in combating them, whilst also addressing the necessary re-regulation of trade relations.
