Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the European Union has a budgetary instrument that provides financial support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns.
Now, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund is also providing direct assistance to people affected in my home country.
I have pointed out on many occasions that the Globalisation Adjustment Fund must not be wrongly seen as a backup solution for multinational companies, but must go directly to help the citizens affected.
For that reason, I am in favour of control mechanisms and would like to see regular progress reports from Steiermark.
This fund is utilised precisely where society needs it most, namely to help the affected people themselves.
That is something positive that the European Union does for its citizens.
