Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we are today debating how we can tackle the global crisis and unemployment in particular.
Of course, it is affecting very many innocent enterprises that quite simply have too few orders coming in and thus have no turnover.
They therefore also suffer from a lack of liquidity and with that, lose their creditworthiness.
I am grateful that the focus here is on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
I believe that transitional assistance is particularly important to allow them to continue working and to be able to take advantage of any appropriate new opportunities on the markets.
We should carefully analyse the results of this funding to see where we have used best practice and where we were actually able to help secure jobs and, above all, where we have succeeded in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
Now it is a question of providing help quickly and therefore I also support the mobilisation of the Fund as quickly as possible, particularly in Steiermark in Austria, where a whole region involved in car manufacture is affected and where there are many suppliers involved which, of course, are particularly important for the infrastructure.
I think it is good that this EUR 5.7 million is being made available.
However, in this regard I would like to ask that, for all cases that we take a positive decision on here today, an analysis be carried out and that the money does not merely flow out, but that proof is also provided that it is resulting in restoration or that new enterprises are being set up and that active economic activity will, in future, enable this region to regain the vigour that it has had up to now.
Thank you, Commissioner.
