Mr President, the Austrian application for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) concerns the former employees of a total of nine automotive suppliers in Steiermark.
If we look closer at this case, we can immediately see that it is a classic case for the EGF, namely the provision of remedial assistance.
The EGF can provide exactly that, and that is why it was set up, in other words to provide assistance to those directly affected by the negative effects of globalisation and who, through the abrupt loss of their jobs, have to suffer the consequences of the irresponsibility of financial market speculators.
Steiermark, unfortunately, is characterised by its large dependency on demand in the automotive industry.
That means that the whole region has been badly affected by the current slump in the market and, in particular, in the demand for cars.
Car sales have fallen by 59.4%.
In this context, the EUR 5.7 million represents an excellent investment for the reintegration of redundant workers into the labour market.
In other words, this investment will enable workers to attend local employment foundations, specifically for the automotive sector, while also facilitating the implementation of measures aimed at worker preparation and qualifications.
