Madam President, as you can see, this is clearly an Austrian issue, and Steiermark, one of our provinces that has been hard hit, is of great concern to us, with its above-average proportion of the population involved in the automotive industry on the one hand and, of course, a disproportionately high percentage of these products being exported on the other.
The global fall in demand has resulted in a total of 744 redundancies, as has already been mentioned, and we are very pleased that 400 of the people affected will receive support through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
That is very much to be welcomed.
In this case - and this needs to be clarified with regard to what the previous speaker said, too - it is not about subsidies for simple restructuring, it is about supporting individual workers by providing assistance with living costs and measures for further training.
In this regard, I agree with Mrs Cornelissen, who said that this further training must be particularly geared to the future.
We need to have better trained workers for the future and retraining in the areas of technology and renewable energy is certainly a worthwhile step.
Steiermark will surely be in favour of that.
