Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can undoubtedly see promising signs of the stabilisation of the economy and the financial markets in 2010, and I would also like to remind you that this was only possible because it was coordinated at a European level.
However, we are, of course, seeing a rise in the unemployment figures and we have to assume that they will rise still further over the next year.
I therefore welcome this new financing instrument for people who want to go self-employed.
It is, of course, common knowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises create jobs.
For many years, we have been discussing financial support for these enterprises.
However, every year, we discover that the funds have not gone where they were supposed to go.
I was able to follow the end of a pilot project last week, but as a result, there was not time to put the experiences gained from it in this report.
I would therefore like to mention it here.
The pilot project used participants who are self-employed or who want to go self-employed, and they were supported for a year along the path to self-employment.
It was so successful that I would like to call for it to be included in this project, in other words, that the project not only provide finance for people who are going self-employed, but also for those who support these people.
That is necessary because the banks, which will not, of course, give them credit, perceive a certain amount of risk in this regard.
I think we can neutralise this risk with this financing.
The second point that came up again and again in discussions in this regard was that we must not put a lower limit on the credits.
Up to now, someone could only receive credits of EUR 5 000 or more.
Sometimes, people do not need that amount.
In these cases, much smaller amounts are sufficient, and that is something that we should take into account in this programme.
