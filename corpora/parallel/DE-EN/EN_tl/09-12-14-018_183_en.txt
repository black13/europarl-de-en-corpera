Madam President, we have now listened to three or four speakers from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who have said that they do not want to take any money from Progress.
However, the amendments state that the instrument is to be called Progress, and Mrs Ber√®s has also said that EUR 60 million will come from Progress.
That is two thirds!
I would be interested to know what the Socialists' position actually is.
Should the instrument be financed from Progress - yes or no?
