Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last month, the Commission has presented its new EU Strategy 2020 as a continuation of the Lisbon goals and, among other things, has called for a more social Europe.
If we are striving to ensure lasting employment for Europe's citizens, then, particularly now in this difficult economic situation, we need to ensure that people can implement their own good ideas themselves in order to generate their own income.
The EU microfinance facility for employment is intended to provide the opportunity for a new start and to smooth the path to entrepreneurship.
The path to self-employment often goes in stages.
Initial small investments are easier to cope with than to pile up large mountains of debt.
A more manageable risk for starting out in self-employment is something that women, in particular, seek and they often ask for start-up capital in order to secure the start of the business and then, when the business is going well, to expand.
Women want to grow with their businesses.
Therefore, citizens need to be offered credit amounts that are as small as possible.
By that I mean amounts significantly lower than EUR 25 000, which is the amount generally provided for micro-credits.
Particularly during the economic crisis, the necessary liquidity needs to be provided to the population at large.
If this provides a way to help to keep the often high rates of interest and administrative fees for micro-credits low, then it would give us an opportunity to give new impetus to the economy.
I welcome the idea presented in the Commission proposal.
The European Parliament committees disagree about the financing.
Questioning the jurisdiction of European policy is certainly permissible in this area.
The Member States have the prime responsibility.
As I see it, however, funds from the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (Progress), particularly as proposed here, will enable people to go self-employed.
