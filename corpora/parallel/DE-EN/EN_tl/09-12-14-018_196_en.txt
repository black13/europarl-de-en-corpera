Madam President, today we have discussed the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and now we are talking about micro-credits.
Both instruments are absolutely essential to combat the effects of the financial and economic crisis in the EU and to stimulate the European labour market.
We need both instruments, as not everyone is destined to be an entrepreneur.
Neither should it be the goal of our employment policy to make new self-employed entrepreneurs out of former employees and the non-self-employed workforce purely for business reasons.
For such people, the term 'putative self-employed' would be more appropriate.
The Member States must also take appropriate precautionary steps in this regard.
However, for all of those who want to accept the challenge of self-employment, the resources must be made available to allow them to start or expand their business.
Along with this, however, it must be ensured - and this is the duty of the European Parliament and the Member States - that normal social security continues to be provided.
We need new money for new ideas.
