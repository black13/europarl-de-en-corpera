Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank you most sincerely for the clarity of your words.
Essentially, it should be said that, overall, the Toys Directive has brought a considerable improvement in the protection of our children.
We all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world.
However, many parents and grandparents are now concerned - as you said - because of the studies by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment.
We now need to ask ourselves whether or not the Institute's statements and opinion are right.
In any case, we need to examine the facts of the matter very closely.
It is a question of the protection of our children.
At this point, I would like to thank you most sincerely for having stated that you are willing to do that.
However, I think that things need to move more quickly.
Not until next year, you say, during the first half of the year, will the findings of the scientific committee be available.
It must be done quicker than that.
It is a question of the protection of our children.
I really cannot understand why the Federal Institute left it so long to come out with these statements.
I want to make that point here, too.
