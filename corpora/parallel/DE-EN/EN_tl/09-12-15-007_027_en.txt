Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of whether we live in urban areas or in the countryside, we all form part of an information and knowledge society.
Those people, businesses and organisations which are able to use modern information technologies most effectively have a significant competitive advantage.
However, this also requires the necessary funding to be made available for developing and extending the technological infrastructure in the form of broadband Internet in rural areas in particular.
This is where the second part of the European Economic Recovery Programme comes in and logically, this also supports the Lisbon strategy.
Energy security, both now and in future, is an important issue at a European level.
Bulgaria has decided to close the Kozloduy nuclear power plant immediately.
This will cost hundreds of millions of euros, but the radioactive waste will remain a permanent risk factor which will endanger the health and safety of future generations.
I am interested in the real, external costs of using nuclear power and how they should be calculated.
It is high time for us not only to research and promote alternative renewable energy technologies, but also to implement them more widely.
The joint declaration on building policy emphasises the importance of a medium- to long-term approach to building.
For me, three things are important in this area.
Firstly, energy-efficient buildings can result in a reduction of up to one third in CO2 emissions.
Secondly, the use of building materials which are harmful to health, such as asbestos, must be avoided at all costs.
Thirdly, I am, as always, in favour of policy being transparent and manageable, and this applies also to building design and planning.
