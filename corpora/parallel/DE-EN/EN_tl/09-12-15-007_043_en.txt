Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has come out well in these negotiations.
I would like to thank all my fellow Members who took part in the negotiations and who clearly stated their opinion to the Commission and the Council.
Now it is important for us to do full justice to all the issues relating to the Treaty of Lisbon, including the entire budget area.
We have shown that Parliament must be taken seriously and that it makes sense to take Parliament seriously.
These budget negotiations have made that very clear.
Many of my fellow Members have already mentioned the fact that we have achieved our most important objectives.
As rapporteur for the agriculture budget in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I can say that although our budget - the agricultural part - has been squeezed very tightly, we are still within our margins.
We have pulled in our horns.
We have achieved this ourselves in our committee and I attach great importance to this.
It is a success for Parliament to secure EUR 300 million for the milk fund in the face of all the arguments against this made by the Commission over the years and by the Council, especially given the difficult situation which dairy farmers find themselves in.
Other sectors of agricultural production are also having problems at the moment.
This affects not only agriculture and farmers but also many jobs in downstream areas.
Given the current situation, this creates even more difficulties.
We need a permanent budget line for the milk fund and we aim to achieve this in future.
We have allocated more money to the 2010 budget than we did in 2009.
That is the result of the current situation and we are aware of this.
We will act accordingly and do everything in our power to ensure that our agriculture policy is sustainable and innovative.
