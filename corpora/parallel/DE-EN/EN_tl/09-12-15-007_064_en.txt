Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members.
We have managed to find a common position with regard to the Council.
However, I would also like to thank the Council and the Presidency of the Council very warmly at this point.
Anyone who knows me will be aware that I am normally very sparing with praise and thanks.
Nevertheless, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, Mr Lindblad, for its work and its constant presence during the discussions on budget issues.
This made a pleasant contrast to the other Council presidencies that I have experienced during the course of my long career as a Member of Parliament.
Thank you very much.
This morning, many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion, there were many more Members involved than usual.
The majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure.
Ladies and gentlemen, we can confidently assume that the 2010 budget will be the last of its kind, the last with this structure, which leads us to believe that we can finance the necessary policies of the European Union and its new challenges and tasks in this way.
We expect the new Commission to carry out the mid-term review quickly, as, under the terms of the agreements made in 2006, this should have been submitted by 2009 at the latest, in other words, by the end of this year.
To spell it out, we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective.
We cannot wait until 2014 for reform.
We need sustainable instruments now, so that the European Union can meet the challenges of the immediate future with democratic legitimacy, as the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, has just called for on behalf of all of us.
