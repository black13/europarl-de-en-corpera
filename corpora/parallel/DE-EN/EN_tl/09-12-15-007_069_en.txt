During an economic crisis, when the citizens of Europe are being subjected to waves of redundancies and cuts in social services, the European Union must also make savings.
Next year, the EU plans to spend about EUR 123 billion, which is seven billion more than this year.
In difficult economic times, measures are, of course, needed to stimulate the economy, but it is doubtful whether instruments such as the European Economic Recovery Programme can achieve this.
In the past, much-vaunted EU programmes have turned out to be paper tigers.
In addition, various EU subsidies have proved to be an invitation to commit abuses of many different kinds.
For years, the European Court of Auditors has been identifying in its annual reports blatant faults in the agricultural and structural funds.
This means that hard-earned taxpayers' money has, for years, been trickling away into mysterious channels.
The complicated regulations which even Brussels eurocrats often find confusing are a major contributor to the defective nature of the system.
The EU does not even have control over the recovery of funds which have been paid out mistakenly.
Therefore, continuing to inflate the EU budget is the wrong route to take.
Instead, the errors should be eliminated from the system by means of far-reaching renationalisation measures, for example, in the agricultural sector.
This would allow the Member States to decide for themselves which areas they want to subsidise.
As far as the measures to stimulate the economy are concerned, these should form part of a coordinated approach by the Member States.
