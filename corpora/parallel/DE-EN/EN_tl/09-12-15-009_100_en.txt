I am voting in favour of the report on establishing a new microfinance facility which will help people whose jobs are at risk to set up or develop micro-enterprises.
These are defined as companies with fewer than ten employees and a turnover of less than EUR 2 million.
This finance opportunity will be available initially for a period of four years, starting from 1 January 2010.
This will give people who have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis or who are finding it difficult to gain access to credit for their company the opportunity to undergo training, to retain existing jobs and, in some cases, even to create new ones.
This will help to stimulate the economy and contribute to bringing the crisis to an end.
