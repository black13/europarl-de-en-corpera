I have voted in favour of the resolution to introduce the microfinance facility, because for me, the top priority is to adopt this resolution quickly.
This will give disadvantaged sections of the population the opportunity to take out loans and to help themselves.
However, I am calling on the Council not to take the funding from Progress.
It is important that this programme retains its funding in full.
In particular in this crisis, EU money must not be redeployed at the expense of the weakest members of society.
