Mr President, Mr Barroso, 2009 is drawing to an end in a difficult situation, with major unemployment and economic and budgetary problems.
At the same time, the five-year period of the Barroso Commission is coming to a close.
What conclusions do you draw from the first five years about the second five years, providing that the Commission is confirmed in office, in particular, with regard to these economic and social issues?
What will you be saying to our citizens and also to your commissioners about the things that should be different in this new period?
We should work together to set new priorities with respect to our economic and socio-political objectives and to avoid recreating the situation that we currently find ourselves in.
Therefore, I would like to ask you again what conclusions you draw from the first five years and what you want to do differently, better and more clearly in the next five years in order to fulfil the wishes of the citizens of Europe.
