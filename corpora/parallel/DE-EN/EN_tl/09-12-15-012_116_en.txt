I would like to ask a brief additional question, Mr Barroso.
If, during the hearings in Parliament, we are of the opinion that the allocation of the portfolios does not fully meet these objectives and we make proposals for changing the portfolios, are you prepared in principle to address our objections and to make changes?
Would you, in principle, reject any objections or are you prepared to accept them?
