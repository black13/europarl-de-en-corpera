I would like to ask you today about the structure of the next Commission.
The portfolio responsibilities that you have presented seem to us to have very presidential overtones.
In our opinion, you are organising this structure in such a way as to give you personally, as Commission President, a great deal of power.
We are surprised that you want to abolish the working groups of the members of the Commission.
In our opinion, these groups have produced good results during the last parliamentary term.
We are also surprised that the responsibilities in some areas have been fragmented in a way which seems to us incomprehensible.
It is a mystery to us how you will handle the division of responsibilities between Mrs Reding and Mrs Malmström.
It seems to us that Mrs Malmström will be creating a sort of homeland security office.
I definitely have nothing against making the climate into a separate responsibility.
However, if you appoint a climate commissioner, you must also show that she has real power and will have access to areas such as energy, industry, transport, the environment and agriculture.
We do not believe that this is the case.
