Mr President, I have a question for you about the Tobin tax.
This tax is a worthwhile proposal, but as yet, no one has introduced it.
Everyone says that it will never be introduced unless all the Member States do so at the same time.
I am now afraid, after the decision at the European summit, which I welcome, that this will once again be postponed, because we are not all starting at the same time.
I would like to know what your opinion on this is and what you think are the chances of the Tobin tax being introduced.
