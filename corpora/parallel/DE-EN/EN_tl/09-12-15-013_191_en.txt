Mr President, I would like to welcome Baroness Ashton to her new position.
I would also like to thank the Swedish Presidency for the resolution and for acknowledging that it will not be possible to implement the two-state solution in the long term unless we can solve the settlement problem.
The Heads of Mission report has been mentioned several times and we also believe that it is very good.
On this basis, I have two questions.
What is the current status of this report and where will it be published?
Secondly, what will you, the Commission and the Council, do to implement the recommendations in the report?
I would now like to quote three of the recommendations from the report.
The first is:
'prevent, discourage financial transactions from EU Member States' actors supporting settlement activity in East Jerusalem by adopting appropriate EU legislation'; second, 'ensure that products manufactured in settlements in East Jerusalem are not exported to the EU under the EU-Israel Association Agreement'; and, third, 'provide guidance on origin labelling for settlement products to major EU retailers.'
The proposals made in this report are very specific and precise.
What steps do you plan to take now to implement them?
