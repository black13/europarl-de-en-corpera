Mr President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, in other words, the Palestinian parliament.
Last week, our delegation was refused entry to Gaza by Israel.
The situation in Gaza is very disturbing, particularly now that winter has come.
Only 10% of the population can obtain the supplies they need by smuggling goods through the tunnels and this is exactly why the tunnels are tolerated by everyone.
Before operation 'Cast Lead' the situation was exactly the reverse and 90% of the population of Gaza could take care of themselves.
As an occupying power, Israel should be responsible for providing for the population in all the occupied areas.
Israel is shirking its responsibility under international law, which means that the international community and, above all, the EU have to step in.
If we are supplying food to 90% of the population of Gaza, we have a right to see where European taxpayers' money is being spent, whether it is being used appropriately and whether it is reaching the people who need it.
