Mr President, firstly I would like to say how pleased I am that Baroness Ashton is sitting on the Commission side.
I hope that she will continue to do so.
I have two questions for the Presidency.
In the conclusions from the Council of Foreign Ministers there is no reference to the Middle East Quartet.
Is the Council not in agreement about the role of the Middle East Quartet in the peace process or what is the reason for this?
Secondly, the same thing applies to Hamas.
No reference is made in the conclusions to this group which, unfortunately, is politically important.
What lies behind this?
