Mr President, the question of transparency and citizens' access to documents in the European Union is undoubtedly of importance to the extent that people throughout Europe are still highly dissatisfied with the European integration policy.
It is the case in Austria that a large proportion of people are dissatisfied with or sceptical about the European Union, because they have the feeling that there is no transparency and no access to policy.
The processes for introducing and then pushing through the Treaty of Lisbon together with the election of the President of the European Council and of the High Representative have given citizens the feeling that they cannot see what is going on, that there is no transparency, and that they have no idea why these things have been done.
I believe that if the Treaty of Lisbon is to be a success for the citizens of Europe, it is important that we should give people the feeling that they can identify who is making decisions within the Union and why and how they are being made.
