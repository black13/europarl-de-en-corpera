on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to discuss two subjects in particular.
The first is the relationship between economic aid and support, on the one hand, and democratic development, on the other, and the second concerns some fundamental questions addressed in the Tagliavini report.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, you have rightly said that financial and economic support for Georgia is needed and that the European Union should continue to provide it.
You have also placed three conditions on the provision of this support, which are democratic reform, basic freedoms and legal certainty.
One question is particularly important to me.
In the past, it was sadly the case that Georgia and its government purchased huge quantities of arms, in particular, in the run-up to last year's conflict.
How do you intend to ensure that the European funding is not used for this purpose?
Secondly, I would like to mention a human rights case which the Council of Europe and Mr Hammerberg have also addressed.
Two teenagers in South Ossetia are still in custody, although Mr Hammerberg was promised that they would be released.
Have you taken any measures in this respect?
Do you think it is likely that they will be released in the near future?
One last point: the Tagliavini report has clearly described for the first time how the conflict came about with the build-up of xenophobia and the language of hate.
What will the Commission and the Council do in this area in order to defuse the situation and to make it clear that these things are the precursors to armed conflict and that it is important to put an end to them before they even begin?
