Mr President, Commissioner, in my opinion, the EU's foreign policy in this region is not really coherent.
The Caucasus is known to be an energy transit region in the same way as Russia, which is an important strategic partner and of major significance to us.
Given the sensitivity of the situation, the EU has allowed itself to be tricked by President Saakashvili in the Georgian crisis, possibly under the influence of the US-dependent approach of some Member States.
Political short-sightedness in the Georgian crisis will not only widen the internal divide within the Union, but will also put massive strain on relations with Russia.
The reckoning will come in the form of the gas dispute.
It remains to be seen whether the new people at the head of the EU will prove their worth in this case.
If Brussels genuinely wants to uphold human rights, then it should intervene in Georgia with regard to possible electoral manipulation, working conditions that are the equivalent of slavery and restrictions placed on the right to demonstrate which are in breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Brussels should adopt a balanced approach with regard to the Georgia question by taking equal account of the legitimate interests of both Georgia and Russia.
