Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently in the middle of a financial and economic crisis and I believe that liquidity is the most important factor in a crisis, not only for banks and businesses, but in particular for employees.
Creditworthiness is, of course, always a prerequisite of liquidity and, therefore, the discussion about the creditworthiness of companies, banks and employees is particularly important.
Of course, creditworthiness is based on earnings, whether you are an employee, a company or a bank.
If you are not earning anything, you have, of course, no creditworthiness and no liquidity and this is where the negative spiral begins.
For this reason, it is highly important for us to ensure that no additional taxes are imposed in future on commodity trading.
Instead, we should be considering how we can make a financial transaction levy on purely financial transactions which are not based on a service or on commodity trading.
This levy could be used to refinance the banks and national budgets and could therefore form the basis for creating new jobs.
In reality, unemployment is completely unacceptable.
It is ultimately the main factor behind the emergence of the financial and economic crisis.
