Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate everyone involved in putting in place the food hygiene regulations, because this communication from the Commission gives a mainly positive picture of the experiences of applying the regulations.
This should not be underestimated, because as has already been explained, these new regulations represent a paradigm shift in food hygiene policy.
The innovative character of the regulations was the reason why an initial report on the experiences with the regulations was planned only three years after they came into force.
The Member States and the food suppliers and producers were generally happy with the regulations and have reported making good progress in applying them.
In the opinion of the Member States and the private interest groups, there are no major difficulties either for the companies or for the authorities.
They are unanimously of the view that these regulations need some adjustments, but that a fundamental review is not required.
The challenge of ensuring that consumers receive the highest possible quality and safety with regard to product hygiene and of responding flexibly to the needs of the companies and, in particular, very small companies, is met by the current regulations.
In line with the saying 'If you stop improving, you stop being good', the problems identified in the process of drawing up the report, as Mr Schnellhardt has already mentioned, will have to be investigated in order to determine the cause and, if necessary, solutions will have to be found.
It is, of course, also necessary to continue to follow closely the implementation of the hygiene package, as it was too early for some Member States to provide a balanced and detailed evaluation.
Only when we have a comprehensive assessment in front of us should we decide whether changes should be made to the food hygiene regulations and, if so, which changes those should be.
