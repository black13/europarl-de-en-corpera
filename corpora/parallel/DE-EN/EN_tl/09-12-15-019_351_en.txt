Madam President, in Austria we have, thank goodness, not been subjected to terrorist attacks for many years.
However, Vienna has not always escaped unscathed.
I would like to add to the remarks made by Mr JÃ¡uregui Atondo.
On the one hand, we definitely need the victims' charter and the support for victims of terrorism.
However, at the same time, we need as an accompanying measure to change the environment in which the violence occurs that leads to terrorism.
In my opinion, we need to start with education and information.
In addition, this House must clearly reject the brutalisation of language.
We are constantly calling for tolerance in many areas.
However, in one area, we must show no tolerance and that is with regard to violence.
