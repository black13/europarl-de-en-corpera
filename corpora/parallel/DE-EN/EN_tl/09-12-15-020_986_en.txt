Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what does freedom of religion actually mean?
The answer is quite simple.
It is the freedom to practise religion.
Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion but the freedom to have religion.
Freedom of religion does not create a religion-free society, but rather gives people the right to practice their religion openly within society.
A crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe, or not to believe.
Therefore, it does not violate the freedom of religion.
Nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols.
If this were the case, we would, in fact, immediately have to prohibit all crosses on gravestones and all church spires.
The crucifix ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is therefore not only an attack on the principle of subsidiarity, but it also violates the right to religious freedom itself.
We, the European Parliament, cannot and must not accept this ruling.
The European Court of Human Rights should administer justice and not become a puppet for ideological and anti-Christian interests.
Otherwise, we will have to seriously consider whether this Court actually still has a purpose at all.
