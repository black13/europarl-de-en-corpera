in writing. - The ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is the expression of an aggressive secularism and gives authority to those who want the public domain to be religion-free.
In so doing, they are overlooking the fact that our continent cannot exist without Christianity.
Christianity has defined Europe, its people, culture and art and its way of thinking to the extent that the continent would lose its identity if all traces of Christianity were to be removed.
It is certainly not about calling into question the freedom of religion.
The separation of the Church and the State is a supreme benefit of our democracy and I would like us to take care to ensure that both carry out their own tasks with mutual respect for one another.
However, this respect is exactly what it is all about.
The Christian Church must not demand that everyone subscribe to its beliefs, but it is entitled to demand to be respected by everyone.
