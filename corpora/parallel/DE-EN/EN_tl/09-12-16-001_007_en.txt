Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that this is a difficult matter to settle.
I do not think it is impossible, but, from the point of view of my group, I would like to say that, with regard to the discussion in France, we find it unacceptable for observers, whatever their status, to at the same time remain members of their national parliaments.
We believe that those who come here as observers should relinquish their national mandates.
