Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Svensson, will speak on the subject of the Swedish Presidency.
I would like to highlight two points from the conclusions of the first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Firstly, I regret the fact that the European Council did not communicate any clear messages with regard to the future strategy of the EU.
On the contrary, it fell into line with the old Commission, which wanted to hold on to the basic principles of the failed Lisbon strategy.
However, even though it has been acknowledged that a new political approach is needed, where is it?
I have not seen it.
With the new Commission, the new Parliament and the President of the European Council, however, there would now be a chance to start a totally new debate.
Of course, there is the new treaty and the still to be implemented opportunity for the citizens initiative, too.
Our starting point is clear: our priority, above all others, in particular, above the interests of profits, must remain the social and environmental concerns of the people.
That needs to become the new basic principle of the European Union's strategies and legislation, as only then will the citizens perceive the EU as representing progress in the long term.
My second point is that we on the Left in the European Parliament welcome the fact that the Council is finally fulfilling the request for a capital transfer tax.
In yesterday's debate, we were pleased to hear Mr Barroso promise that the new Commission under his leadership would table the relevant proposals in the near future.
We will continue to bring this subject up and we remain of the opinion that the European Union can and must take the first step in cases of doubt.
Waiting for someone else at a global level to take this role away from us is not something we can continue to do.
