Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, your calm and steady Presidency was a success.
You had difficult political issues to resolve and overall you did a good job.
The people chosen by you for the important new EU posts can now define these without any preconceived ideas, as they are as yet largely unknown to most European citizens.
As an aside, if I may say so, your best decision is sitting on your right.
Nevertheless, Mr Reinfeldt, I cannot give your Presidency full marks.
There are two reasons for this.
Firstly, you increased the development towards making the European Council into a kind of EU 'supergovernment'.
Its comprehensive jurisdiction is increasing, from the environment to financial policy.
At the same time, you are closing the doors ever tighter.
This is not what transparent debates by representatives of the people look like.
The second reason is this: the fact that you pushed SWIFT through the Council just hours before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon demonstrates a clear disregard for the European Parliament and hence a lack of respect for the citizens.
Nevertheless, I would like to thank you for the last six months.
