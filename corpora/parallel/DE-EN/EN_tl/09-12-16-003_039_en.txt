Mr President, the Swedish Presidency is now coming to an end - with no great disasters, but, in my opinion, without any outstanding successes, either.
In any case, the ambitious goal of getting the economic crisis under control could not be achieved.
We have pumped billions into a system from which only a few benefit, whereas the public has to bear the risks and the costs.
It is unacceptable for European taxpayers' hard-earned money to end up in the bonus pots of bank managers.
If we are already holding a climate summit, then, in my opinion, we also need, at long last, a truer reflection of costs and some honesty in the debate about nuclear reactors.
If we are looking for climate protection solutions, we also need to put a stop to the deception surrounding emissions certificates.
In the case of the SWIFT negotiations, the Swedish Presidency has, in my opinion, allowed itself to be dictated to somewhat by the US with regard to the disclosure of bank data.
As a result of this and of the Stockholm Programme, citizens are becoming ever easier to manipulate and ever more transparent.
With Sweden, Turkey is also losing an advocate for its accession.
In my view, it is time to stop the accession negotiations and offer Turkey a privileged partnership.
