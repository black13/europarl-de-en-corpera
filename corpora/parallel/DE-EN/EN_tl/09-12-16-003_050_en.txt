Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in debates about the Council Presidency, we often talk as if the Presidency was the European Union.
The Council Presidency is not the EU; it is an important manager of a European institution.
I would therefore ask everyone to be a bit fairer and calmer.
The Council Presidency has done a good job over the last six months.
It has helped to open a new chapter in the history of European Union success.
However, none of us wants a Europe of governments.
We are working towards a Europe of the citizens and towards greater cooperation between the institutions and the various parts of the European Union.
Each one of us is a part of the European Union.
The institutional debate has been closed, the new posts have been filled and, on a few important points, the Council has moved into a position that will enable us to continue to work.
Let us look to the future.
Someone said that we have a major problem because the Treaty of Lisbon has not yet been taken into account in the working methods of the Council.
The Council has more opportunities to influence the European Parliament and the committees of the European Parliament than the European Parliament has to influence the working groups and the Council meetings.
In this respect, too, we demand the equal treatment of the two institutions, as we have equal status as legislators.
Yes, it was a mistake - we can argue about the content - to push SWIFT through in advance of the change in Parliament's power of codecision one day later.
The decision on financial market supervision has still not been finalised.
We need to make improvements, we need executive power, we need more European supervision where cross-border institutions are concerned and we need to achieve better coordination between the Member States, the Commission and the European Central Bank in the Basel Committee, because otherwise, a parallel structure will be created.
