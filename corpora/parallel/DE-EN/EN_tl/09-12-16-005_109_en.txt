in writing. - I am voting in favour of the report on the provision of EUR 15.9 million in assistance to Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands.
As a consequence of the global economic crisis, a total of 744 workers have had to be made redundant in the automotive supply industry in Styria alone.
The application rightly submitted by Austria for assistance totalling EUR 5 705 365 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has now been approved by the EU.
That is absolutely justified, as Austria has been hit particularly hard by the slump in exports.
For example, exports of road vehicles and cars have fallen by 51.3% and 59.4%, respectively.
As a result of the close interconnection between the companies in the automotive industry and the low-level of diversification of many suppliers, the crisis is being felt throughout the automotive industry.
