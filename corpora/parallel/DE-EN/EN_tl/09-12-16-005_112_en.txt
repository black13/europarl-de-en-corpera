Once again, the consequences of globalisation are having to be cushioned through the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF).
This time, unfortunately, Styria has also been hard hit.
A total of 744 people from nine different companies have lost their jobs over the last few months, and that is why the Province of Styria has asked the EU for assistance.
As with previous applications, everything has been examined very thoroughly and I am pleased that the people of Styria meet all of the requirements.
Especially during the current financial and economic crisis, we are being very clearly reminded once again of the negative effects of globalisation.
With that in mind, it is even more incomprehensible that Parliament has today adopted a resolution promoting more liberalisation and the breaking down of trade barriers, and hence more globalisation.
Until a change of thinking occurs in the EU, we can only work to reduce the damage caused by globalisation in the countries concerned.
Therefore, I have voted without reservations in favour of releasing aid from the fund.
