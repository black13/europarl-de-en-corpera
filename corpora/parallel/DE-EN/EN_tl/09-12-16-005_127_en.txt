The joint motion for a resolution from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the Doha Development Agenda and the WTO continues the trend of global liberalisation in all economic areas.
There is no doubt that breaking down barriers to trade and increasing trade in some areas brings greater prosperity.
We have also seen that free trade, in particular, between similarly developed countries, is also beneficial.
However, if the trading partners are too different in terms of their stage of development, there are, in many cases, negative effects for both parties.
The complete opening up of the markets of the developing countries to exports from industrialised countries has sometimes resulted in the destruction of the local economic structure, an increased level of poverty for the people and, as a consequence, more people wanting to migrate to Western countries.
On the other hand, Europe has been inundated with cheap goods from the Far East, the manufacture of which has, in many cases, involved the exploitation of workers.
Domestic production has been relocated or shut down, which has resulted in unemployment in Europe.
From this point of view, therefore, certain barriers to trade, for example, to maintain food sovereignty in Europe, make perfect sense.
It should not be forgotten that the liberalisation of services on the financial markets played a huge part in the current financial and economic crisis.
Nevertheless, the motion for a resolution speaks in favour of continuing the process of liberalisation and of giving the WTO a greater role as part of a new global order policy and, for this reason, I voted against it.
