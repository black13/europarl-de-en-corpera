I have today voted against the resolution on the Doha Development Agenda because I am opposed to any kind of liberalisation of public services.
I am thinking in particular of the liberalisation of the water supply, health services and services in the energy sector.
For the cohesion of society, it is essential that all citizens have access to public services.
These services must be provided to a high quality, with respect for the principle of universality and, above all, they must be affordable.
In this regard, the national authorities should have a great deal of discretionary power and broad opportunities to shape their services.
