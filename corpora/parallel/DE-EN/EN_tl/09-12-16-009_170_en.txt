Madam President, the heading chosen here of a 'new action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan' is an appropriate one.
However, what has been presented here seems to me to be more like two separate action plans presented one after the other.
I essentially support what has been said about both countries.
In Afghanistan, I hope that we have learnt from the mistakes of the past and that we will adapt our policies and structures accordingly.
As regards Pakistan, I am pleased that the new policy is seen as a follow-up to my election observation report.
In the countries in which we have carried out election observation missions, I believe that it is only right that we incorporate the recommendations into our specific policies towards those countries.
In the response to this debate from the Council and the Commission, I would like the joint strategy for these two countries to be explained more clearly, as we have to acknowledge, for example, that we have a thousand kilometre border in this region that cannot be controlled properly on either side, while the policies that we pursue on one side of this border will have direct effects on the other side.
Therefore, what structures do we actually want to set up?
How do we want to establish the dialogue between the Afghan and the Pakistani Governments?
How can we ensure that our policies are accepted by the local people there?
These are questions to which we still need answers, and I hope that we will get them.
