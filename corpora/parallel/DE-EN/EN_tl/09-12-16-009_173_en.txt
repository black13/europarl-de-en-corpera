Madam President, an Afghan friend once said to me that it is a good thing that the West invaded Afghanistan, but remember that, in Afghan history, anyone who stayed longer than a year became an occupier, even if they previously went there as liberators.
That was in 2001.
We are now in 2009 and exactly that has happened.
The Taliban governs de facto 80% of the country and the US military leadership as well as the European defence ministers are saying that this war cannot be won by military means.
What, then, is the goal?
A country that we do not have under control cannot be turned into a democracy and whatever else from the centre if that country has never had a centralised form of government.
In other words, would it not make sense to concentrate on al-Qaeda and terrorism and then get out of there?
These questions need to be answered.
We also need answers to the questions that were, quite rightly, raised by Mr Van Orden in connection with the integration of this action plan with the general strategic goal, the London Conference, President Obama's Afghanistan plan and so on.
Are these things consistent with each other?
It is therefore very right and necessary to have a combined approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan here, and also to include what was ultimately said in connection with India.
Most importantly, we need to keep an eye on internal developments.
When foreign military pressure leaves a country having trained soldiers and police officers who have no goal of their own, I have never known these soldiers and police officers to then leave behind the ideology of the civil war, which does indeed have a goal.
It always wins!
History shows this, too, and therefore I am deeply concerned that what we are doing here may lack continuity.
We really should consider what sort of plan would enable us to get our troops out in a reasonable manner and, at the same time, to put an end to terrorism.
