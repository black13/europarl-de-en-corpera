Mr President, perhaps you would allow me, as a member of the Iran Delegation, to just make one brief comment.
A while ago, the European Parliament in Brussels held a debate with the Iranian ambassador in Brussels.
When asked why the number of death sentences in Iran had quadrupled since the Iranian President took office, he put it down to the increase in the drugs trade in the border region between Iran and Afghanistan.
I wanted to mention this statement to you in order that, alongside corruption, this problem might also be given adequate consideration in the action plan.
