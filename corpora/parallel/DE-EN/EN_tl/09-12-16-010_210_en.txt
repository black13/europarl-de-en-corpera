Mr President, the policy of the European Union towards Belarus is certainly an example of a sensible neighbourhood policy.
We ought to thank the outgoing Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, for her successful work in this regard.
Belarus certainly should be supported by the European Union in its reform process and also in its democratisation.
However, the European Union and the Member States of the European Union should not be so arrogant as to believe that their own democratic standards should be a model for the rest of the world.
One thing is certain in relation to Belarus: if we want our relations with Russia to flourish, we will be obliged also to respect the historical and geopolitical interests of the Kremlin somewhere.
That is probably the most sensitive issue in connection with European policy towards Belarus.
