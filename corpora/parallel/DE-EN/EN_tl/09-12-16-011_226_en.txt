Mr President, in no other country in the world have there, as yet, been more European Security and Defence Policy operations than in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
As always, the question arises of whose security is being defended.
Is it the security of the Congolese civilian population, the women and children?
The UN mission MONUC did not prevent thousands of people being killed, tortured and raped and hundreds of thousands of people being expelled - atrocities in which the government forces supported by the EU were involved.
So what is being defended in the Congo?
Humanity?
Or are we safeguarding a regime that, between 2003 and 2006, for example, concluded 61 contracts with international mining firms, not a single one of which was judged by international NGOs to be acceptable from the point of view of the Congolese people?
President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms.
This change was suspended when the war escalated once again.
My question is, why are the people who pull the strings of the largest group behind the murders in eastern Congo - the FDLR - reputed to be in Germany?
I am referring here to the resolution that I have tabled on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left.
