Mr President, the expulsion of millions of people, thousands of rapes and hundreds of murders must not be the sad legacy of the largest UN peace-keeping operation in the world.
The Congo operation was decided on ten years ago, but nothing much has been achieved.
Militias continue to plunder the rich supply of natural resources in the region, terrorise the inhabitants and commit crimes against humanity.
Embargoes have been ineffective so far.
Rebels are simply changing sides and they carry out their crimes in the safe uniforms of Congolese soldiers.
Two war criminals were recently brought before the war crimes tribunal in The Hague and development projects and elections were able to take place - a partial success, at least.
We also succeeded in striking a small blow against the global Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR).
However, we have not been able to put an end to the cruel civil war.
The fronts are always changing.
It is particularly disturbing when accusations made against the UN mission turn out to be true.
UN soldiers must not stand there and do nothing when atrocities are being committed and, even more importantly, the army's logistics support must not be associated with support for human rights violations.
The Congo mission simply must not turn into some kind of Vietnam for Europe.
Essentially, we need a coordinated European security policy and peace-keeping operations, but above all, in the area surrounding Europe and not in far-off Africa, where the ethnic fronts are unclear.
In my opinion, the EU must concentrate its peace-keeping operations on the crisis regions in its own backyard, such as the Balkans or the Caucasus.
Therefore, we should, perhaps, end the EU's involvement in the UN mission in Africa.
