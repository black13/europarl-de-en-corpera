Mr President, in November 2009, there was an exchange of ambassadors between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo - a tiny ray of hope for this ravaged country and its ravaged people.
In addition, the leader of the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda was arrested.
These are both signs of improvement in the situation in eastern Congo.
My question for the Commission is this: what measures are you intending to take to bring about further rapprochement between Congo and Rwanda?
With regard to the UN mandate, a great deal has been said here today about taking all forms of action.
Let us be frank: if there is a UN mandate, then it should clearly be for the protection of those who are oppressed, tortured, violated and abused, in particular, the women and children of this country.
In this regard, one thing must be quite clear: if a UN mandate is issued - and we Austrians are a bit restrictive in this area - then it should be consistent and, if need be - including for the protection of the oppressed people - those on the ground must be armed.
