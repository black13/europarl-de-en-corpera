Mrs Malmström, thank you for your excellent reply.
We are, of course, talking about three regions: two border regions - Vojvodina and the southern Serbian region of Preševo, in other words a tri-border area.
I would also like to ask you, in your future role as Commissioner, to ensure that these countries are developed further within the framework of the cross-border support programme.
Inner Serbia, in particular the Sandžak of Novi Pazar, is, of course, completely cut off.
This area must also be supported in order to improve the economic conditions so as to help resolve the problems in relation to the minorities.
However, there is a great deal of violence in southern Serbia in particular.
I would ask the Council to continue to address this explosive situation.
