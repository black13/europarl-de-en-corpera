We must prevent discrimination, which is a social problem.
It is up to all of us to prevent discrimination of any kind.
Do you share my opinion that there are no clear standards for determining whether discrimination has occurred, an example being a situation where a landlord rents out a flat and an applicant claims that he had been discriminated against because he did not get the flat?
Do you agree that a European directive can only lay down requirements that the Member States would then have to transpose into national law?
It is very difficult for Europe to establish a European law in this area.
