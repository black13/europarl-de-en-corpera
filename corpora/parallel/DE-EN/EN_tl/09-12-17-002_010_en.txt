Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission.
This shows contempt for Parliament.
It is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable.
(Heckling)
Yes?
Yes, he did not get up.
Well, I am sorry.
I cannot accept that.
Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work.
We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date.
I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement.
There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect.
I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament.
We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced.
This will put into citizens' hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe.
There are organisations which are attempting to do this.
However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up.
