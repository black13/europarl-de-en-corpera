One stated goal of this directive is to implement fully the current legal provisions concerning the freedom of movement of professionals within the EU.
The free movement of professionals has already been adopted in Directive 2005/36/EC.
However, problems are occurring repeatedly, particularly in regions near national borders.
Many people in the region I come from work in Luxembourg, Belgium or France.
I receive numerous enquiries from citizens who cross into one of the neighbouring countries to work.
These enquiries often relate to the recognition of professional qualifications.
This situation must change.
Agreements have been reached by the professional organisations for specific professions, but this does not help in every case and all too often, citizens have to fight to have their qualifications recognised.
It becomes particularly difficult when a particular country does not have a specific profession or that profession is organised differently, for example, physiotherapists or people with a PhD in business administration.
At the same time, many areas are short-staffed.
Nurses or toolmakers, for example, must, in future, have better opportunities on our labour markets and, above all, the internal market must function effectively as far as work is concerned.
We need a transparent, simple and clear recognition procedure.
