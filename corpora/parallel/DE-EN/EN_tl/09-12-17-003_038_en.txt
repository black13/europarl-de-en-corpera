Mr President, Commissioner, not much has been said about the significance of the European cohesion policy in Europe.
It lies at the centre of the European Union, as it is the policy which holds the EU together at its heart.
It is a symbol of solidarity and of overcoming national egoism.
It is an instrument for all the regions.
This is why the European Parliament is so concerned that this solidarity mechanism may simply be abolished behind our backs.
It does not say much for good governance when the Commission secretly issues strategic documents, instead of holding an open debate about how we can continue with the solidarity mechanism in the light of the major challenges which face us, such as climate change and demographic change, given the tight budgetary constraints.
We need reform, but it must result in genuine change.
It must bring about sustainable development in the regions.
It must provide the regions with support for their projects and not consist of top-down policy, in the way that this earmarking mechanism currently does.
Instead, it must develop a bottom-up process in close partnership with all the players in the regions.
We are familiar with this process.
We already have the LEADER method for the development of rural areas.
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and getting everyone involved in order to ensure a very high level of local acceptance.
However, we need a Commission which is brave enough to say yes to the solidarity mechanism and yes to the regions deciding on their own development, rather than this being the responsibility of national governments.
