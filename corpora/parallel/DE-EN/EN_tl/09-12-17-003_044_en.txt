Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, funding for the regions and structural funding form part of our practical economic policy and make Europe widely visible.
In local authority areas, towns and municipalities in the regions, different players are working closely together.
For this reason, we must retain this integrated approach for the entire European Union.
I call on the Commission to focus much more closely on small and medium-sized enterprises and to involve the local authority areas, the towns and the municipalities much more in the future cohesion policy.
We will definitely need to invest in the infrastructure in future, but most importantly, we must ensure that innovation and technology transfer are guaranteed for small and medium-sized enterprises.
In future, we should also enable jobs to be subsidised.
These are the crucial issues in choosing a new direction for the structural and cohesion policy in the European Union.
