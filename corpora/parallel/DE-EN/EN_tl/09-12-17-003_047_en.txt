Mr President, you will probably have heard in the meantime that there is serious consternation and disquiet among the members of the Committee on Regional Development, because a so-called secret document from the Commission has been circulating since October.
This document contains the draft of a budget reform for the period 2013-2020 which represents a U-turn in budget policy.
The original regional focus of the budget has been replaced by a sectoral approach.
The new draft represents a huge restriction on the principles of subsidiarity and multi-level governance, which is in contradiction to the Lisbon strategy.
In specific terms, the draft includes plans to abolish Objective 2, in other words, competitiveness and employment policy.
As there are Objective 2 regions in every Member State, this would, of course, sadly affect two thirds of all the EU regions.
This unfortunate proposal is justified on the basis that the difference between new - or in other words, future - Member States and Western Europe at a national level is so great that a new budget policy is needed.
In the light of the financial crisis, this is said to be a way of stimulating the economy.
It seems obvious to me that this proposal is anticipating the possible accession of Turkey.
We know that increased funding would be needed and this is a way of planning to ensure that the huge amounts of money required for the accession will be available.
However, I would like to say quite clearly that at a regional level, the success of the cohesion policy lies in its proximity to local economic problems.
As a result, money will be invested sensibly and efficiently, as it has been until now.
If the regional component is not included, it will not be possible to bring an end to the economic crisis.
I was not convinced by Mr Barroso's answer to Mrs HÃ¼bner's open letter, which indicated her concern, and, therefore, I expect to see a concrete statement soon.
