Mr President, I believe that the job of Parliament and of the European Union is to establish the basic conditions to allow people from all the Member States to have the best possible quality of life in the regions in which they live.
However, these conditions vary widely throughout Europe.
This is why we need a strong and adequately funded cohesion policy.
We must strongly reject any proposals that involve leaving our chosen path and we have heard today that some have been made.
We do not need renationalisation.
We need funding instruments for all the European regions, including those which are disadvantaged and those which already have high levels of development.
We must not put at risk what has already been achieved.
We need a transparent subsidy system which allows for easy access to funding, but also ensures that the money is used correctly and efficiently.
We must think on a European level, but act on a regional level.
