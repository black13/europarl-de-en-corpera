The Europe of the regions is a principle on which the EU has long agreed.
The cohesion policy after 2013 must continue to make this vision a reality.
One good approach is to make territorial cohesion the main objective.
In this context, interregional cooperation plays an important role.
In recent decades, the interregional approach has had some significant successes.
The various EU projects in this area allow citizens to experience Europe directly and bring the freedom of action characteristic of European policy down to a regional level.
However, there is still work to be done in the future.
An interregional approach requires effective coordination to bring the different structures in the different countries into line.
Other important cornerstones of regional policy in the years to come will be additionality in funding, cross-sectoral cooperation and conditionality.
In order to ensure that the funding reaches the areas where it is needed, projects must have clear and specific objectives.
In my opinion, careful long-term planning also brings added value and prevents funds from being wasted.
