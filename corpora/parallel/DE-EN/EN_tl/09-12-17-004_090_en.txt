Mr President, for many years, I was responsible for human rights debates in this House on behalf of my group.
I am dealing with this case with great care.
I would like to mention that I had a very long discussion about this case with the Moroccan foreign minister last Sunday.
I have the impression that there is the possibility today of ending Mrs Haidar's hunger strike and finding a solution for her.
If I had the impression that a public statement would help to resolve this case, I would make a public statement.
However, because I believe that in complicated diplomatic cases of this kind, discretion is the best way of solving the problem, I would ask my fellow Members to use the necessary discretion to ensure that this lady is saved.
That is my only wish.
