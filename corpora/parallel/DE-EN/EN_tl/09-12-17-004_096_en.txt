Mr President, I very much regret having to ask once again for the patience of the House.
On the voting list today, we have the vote on the principle of subsidiarity.
Under the terms of Rule 177(4) of the Rules of Procedure, I request that we postpone a vote on this point until the next plenary session and investigate the legitimacy of passing a resolution on this point.
I believe that there is substantial agreement throughout this House that the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights should be guaranteed.
However, there is absolutely no point in raising this to the level of the European Union.
I would also like to say specifically on behalf of my Italian fellow Members that the debate taking place in Italy is an Italian and not a European debate and that, like us, my fellow Members will defend diversity and plurality.
However, it does not make sense to do this in a resolution of this kind.
(Heckling)
Mr President, it is amazing that groups which have the concept of democracy in their name are not even familiar with the democratic principle of allowing a speaker to finish what he is saying.
Under the terms of Rule 177(4), I request that the vote is postponed until the next session and that the legitimacy of the resolution and the vote is investigated.
(Applause)
