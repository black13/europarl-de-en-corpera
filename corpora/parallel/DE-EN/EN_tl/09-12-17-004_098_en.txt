Mr President, now that the urgent matter has been removed from the agenda, I would like to ask you to divide the speaking time for the Western Sahara item between the other two urgent matters, as we had some tough discussions yesterday about the speaking time for urgent matters.
This is my practical proposal for this afternoon and I would ask you to accept it, as we will be spending an hour discussing urgent matters.
