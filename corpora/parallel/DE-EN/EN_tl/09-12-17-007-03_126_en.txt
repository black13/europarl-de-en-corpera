Madam President, I would like to repeat my point of order:
(Uproar in the Chamber)
I am pleased that I am always able to wake my fellow Members up.
This is good for the circulation.
Once again, under the terms of Rule 177(4), I request that the vote is postponed and that the legitimacy of the resolution and the vote is investigated in the meantime.
