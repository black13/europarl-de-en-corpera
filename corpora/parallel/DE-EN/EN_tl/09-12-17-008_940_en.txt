This joint motion for a resolution on the Democratic Republic of Congo reflects the complicated situation in this African country.
Despite the large amounts of human resources and funding provided by the international community, it has not yet been possible to bring peace and stability to the area.
On the contrary, the UN soldiers are being accused of taking sides and of helping to escalate the situation further.
It is important that this issue is resolved.
The huge cost of over EUR 7 billion for the UN mission, including humanitarian aid, can only be justified if it is clear exactly how the funds were used.
As the resolution does not specifically call for this to be clarified, I have abstained.
