Transparency is important and its importance is growing in the age of globalisation.
Therefore, I support the efforts to introduce more transparency at an EU level.
However, we need to maintain a balance.
The resolution presented to us goes far beyond the transparency required by citizens and, therefore, I have voted against it.
This motion for a resolution fails to find a balance between the necessary transparency and reasonable activity by the administration and the Members of Parliament at an EU level.
In the current version, it is no longer possible to ensure the confidentiality of the written word, citizens' privacy can no longer be guaranteed when questions are asked, data protection is called into question and the consequences for our security and for the financial market policy of the European Central Bank cannot be predicted.
In addition, it would give rise to a level of bureaucracy for the administration and the Members of Parliament that is totally out of proportion to its objective.
