In the vote on Thursday, 17 December 2009, I voted against resolution from Mr Cashman on the improvements needed to the legal framework for access to documents following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001) for the following reasons: this resolution refers to facts which have nothing to do with the subject of transparency and calls for changes, the consequences of which would not make a constructive contribution to improving transparency.
I would like to emphasise that I am very much in favour of transparency and public access to documents.
However, these important objectives will not be achieved by fulfilling Mr Cashman's demands, but only by dealing with the subject responsibly as highlighted in the resolution of Renate Sommer, Simon Busuttil and Manfred Weber of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on this subject.
