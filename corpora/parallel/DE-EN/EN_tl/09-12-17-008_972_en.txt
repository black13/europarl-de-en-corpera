During an economic crisis, when the citizens of Europe are being subjected to waves of redundancies and cuts in social services, the European Union must also make savings.
In difficult economic times, measures are, of course, needed to stimulate the economy, but it is doubtful whether instruments such as the European Economic Recovery Plan can achieve this.
In the past, much-vaunted EU programmes have turned out to be paper tigers.
In addition, various EU subsidies have proved to be an invitation to commit abuses of many different kinds.
This means that hard-earned taxpayers' money has, for years, been trickling away into mysterious channels.
Instead of continuing to inflate the EU budget, far-reaching renationalisation of the subsidy system is needed.
For this reason, I reject the draft budget.
