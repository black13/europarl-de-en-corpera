I am voting in favour of the report on the 2010 EU budget.
I am particularly pleased that, although this is the last budget negotiated on the basis of the Treaty of Nice and although, on this basis, the European Parliament has no formal decision-making authority on agricultural spending, we have succeeded in negotiating a budgetary item of EUR 300 million to support dairy farmers.
