Mrs Bilbao Barandica, this concerned a point of order under the terms of Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure which allows the agenda to be changed.
I regret that I can now only permit points of order.
We will not be restarting this debate.
I would like to point out that I will immediately cut off any speaker who attempts to begin the debate again.
