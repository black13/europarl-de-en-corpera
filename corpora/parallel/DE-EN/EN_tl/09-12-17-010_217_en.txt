I have explained my understanding of the Rules of Procedure to you.
Therefore, the procedure is in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
I am not able to acknowledge other new points of order.
I would like to ask for your forbearance.
We have two further important points.
Mr Salafranca, if you have a point of order, please go ahead.
However, I must tell you that I will cut you off, if this is not the case.
