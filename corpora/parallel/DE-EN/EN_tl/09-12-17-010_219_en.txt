Mr Salafranca, I am very sorry, but it is no longer possible for us to investigate the motives of the Members of Parliament from earlier today.
The question of what information has been received this afternoon is no longer a subject for today's agenda.
I will therefore return to the agenda.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
