Mr President, the previous speaker has already mentioned some of the details of this resolution.
The resolution was prompted among other things by an incident in July 2009 in which two young bloggers, Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, were attacked in a restaurant, went to the police to report the incident and were then arrested themselves.
They were prosecuted and, according to all the international observers, including Amnesty International, the court proceedings were far from fair.
For example, the video which was apparently taken in the restaurant, which clearly showed who had been attacked and that the attackers were other people and not these two bloggers, was not played.
It is therefore clear that the judgment does not meet the criteria required by a state under the rule of law.
I very much hope that all the evidence will have to be presented in the second trial when it takes place.
I am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a resolution which is supported by almost all the groups.
I regret that Mr Provera's group is not joining us and instead is emphasising that we should wait for the case to resolve itself and to make use of the diplomatic channels.
Mr Provera, I believe that it is necessary for Parliament, which is in partnership with the Parliament of Azerbaijan, to express itself clearly.
Human rights represent a fundamental issue.
Mrs Schaake referred yesterday to the Sakharov Prize.
We must speak out in support of freedom of thought in all parts of the world and ensure that it is protected.
President Aliyev has often said how important the rights of every journalist are and that they must be defended by the state.
It is our job to remind everyone of this and I very much hope that in future, there will be another resolution on partnership between the Parliament of Azerbaijan and the European Parliament, as unfortunately this was unsuccessful two weeks ago.
