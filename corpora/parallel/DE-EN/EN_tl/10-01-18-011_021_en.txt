Mr President, we have had some very heated debates.
We have seen that there are actually very differing opinions on these findings of a court of justice that is not an EU court.
We should not now lapse once again into a debate on this very serious topic, a debate that divides us more than it unites us.
We should let the subject rest.
We had differing opinions, we still have differing opinions, and that is why we should not come back to it to try and arrive at a new resolution.
