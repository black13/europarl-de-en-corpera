Mr President, it is not the intention that we should now arrive at a resolution.
It is good that we have had a discussion, but one without a resolution.
It is also my considered view that we should draw up such a resolution only after such a visit, if we do so at all.
The discussion, however, should certainly take place now, so that the Members who will visit that country can take with them some of the feeling in this House.
