Mr President, most European Union Member States are also experiencing a devastating earthquake; one, however, that is not recognisable on the surface.
I refer to the continuing upheaval of the financial markets.
We now hear that in a bank in Carinthia which went bankrupt or was taken over by the state, EU funds were also in circulation.
I hereby demand that OLAF mount the appropriate investigation.
Under the new Presidency, there is perhaps a chance that it can act a little more independently than previously.
In this context, I should also like to bring to your attention a study by the Corporate Europe Observatory on the 'captive Commission', that is to say, to this continuing central problem: namely that large corporations are far too heavily represented in the expert groups that should actually be looking for ways to protect us from just such upheavals.
Small and medium-sized enterprises, not to mention consumer associations and trade unions, can say next to nothing.
Generally, the ratio in these groups of experts is 80 to 20.
That must be changed without delay.
