Mr President, the most recent events, in particular, have made clear that the handling of civil liberties in Iran has clear failings, from the European point of view.
The death sentence handed down to the recently sentenced protesters is a sign of how differently fundamental rights and their observance are handled in that country.
It is also important to stress, however, that the EU's external policy must not be lopsided, as we often gladly turn a blind eye to such things in the case of economically and geostrategically important partners - such as China or, perhaps, Saudi Arabia - despite the fact that serious deviations from our European ideas of democracy and the rule of law take place in these countries, too.
As a member of the Iran delegation, it is a particular concern of mine that the delayed trip to Iran be reinstated as soon as possible in order to improve bilateral communications with the EU and, in so doing, possibly also make a contribution, through the dialogue, to defusing the dramatic situation in Iran.
