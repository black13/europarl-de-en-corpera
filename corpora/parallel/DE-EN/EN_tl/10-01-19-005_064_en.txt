Mr President, even if the conflict in Iran often appears to be a power struggle between the old and the new establishment, it is still very clear to see that this very closed social system has very clear cracks.
The situation in Iran is certainly proof of the significance of democracy, namely the ability of every single citizen to give expression to his or her political will.
Those with political responsibility in Iran are currently responding to this legitimate will of society with repression by the State extending as far as the death penalty.
These assaults on the citizens must be stopped immediately, as State repression will certainly not bring an end to this will of society.
On the contrary, Iran's long history shows us this.
On the subject of the planned trip of the European Parliament's delegation to Tehran that was cancelled by the Iranian Government at short notice, I would just like to say that, at this point in time, this trip was really important in order, above all, to lead to talks and dialogues with everyone, including, and in particular, with the local citizens and civil society.
