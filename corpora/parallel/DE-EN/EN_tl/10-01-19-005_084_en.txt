Mr President, in this context, as always, I would like to point out that we here in Europe actually only recognise individual liability and reject blanket suspicion on principle.
I am sure that, as a Briton, Baroness Ashton might well have great sympathy for the idea of targeting the guilty parties in situations like this with a blockade, but not an entire people, who have found themselves in this situation more or less innocently.
We should seek talks.
My question is as follows.
