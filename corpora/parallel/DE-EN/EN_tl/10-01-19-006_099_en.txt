Madam President, the media are already mobilising the populace for a third front in the war on terror.
At this point in time, however, the strategic options for the US and the Member States of the EU in Yemen and the Horn of Africa region are not really open.
The fact is that the ruling elites surrounding President Saleh brutally discriminate against and suppress the Shi'ite population in the north of the country and are waging a war against the separatist movement in the south, in the area of the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, that is causing a great deal of suffering to the population there.
There is no real provable connection to speak of between the Shi'ite population and al-Qaeda and this idea thus merely serves the corrupt and de facto autocratic government as a smoke-screen behind which to obtain massive military aid.
Supporting this government to build up security forces should be avoided - doing so merely pours further oil on the fire.
Any aid provided must benefit all the regions, irrespective of their religious, ethnic or political orientation.
A reconciliation process including the UN and all local players, including in the neighbouring states - such as Iran - must be initiated and promoted.
We must not provide one-sided support of the government against the rebels.
Operation Atalanta should not be continued and expanded, and absolutely not onto the territory of the Yemeni mainland, because this would only serve the geostrategic interests of Western industrialised nations.
We should focus all our efforts on ensuring that the EU does not go along with the US's completely erroneous strategy of escalation in Yemen, too.
