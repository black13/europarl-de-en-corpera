Madam President, it is well known that Yemen is currently a hotbed of Islamic extremists, a poverty-stricken country with ineffective security and a high density of weapons that is convulsed with conflicts and suffers from an acute water shortage.
It is a country in which the government appears not even to have the capital completely under control.
Yemen has thus found itself in the spotlight of the fight against terrorism and is therefore another country in which the presence of radical Islamists is an unfortunate consequence of past US policy failings.
That should be very consciously borne in mind in the debate, along with the CIA's overflights, the secret prisons and the disastrous consequences of the US campaigns thus far in the Middle East.
In my opinion, it would be naive to equate terrorism with poverty, just as it would be irresponsible to allow ourselves to be dictated to by US policy and to trustingly believe that only increasing military aid to Yemen could solve the problems there.
The dictatorial president is quite happy to collect the West's military millions, but in the past he has time and again fallen back on Islamists in order to permanently silence opponents of the regime.
Of course, we cannot stand idly by and watch as this country is transformed from a retreat area of the Jihadists, which it has been so far, into their operations and training base.
There is also a clear need to discuss how to improve development aid, even if only to take a proportion of the Jihadist recruits out of the equation.
Finally, the EU must not allow itself to be forced into the role of the US paymaster.
Instead, the Union must assume the role of an impartial broker in order to bring about a dialogue and pave the way for a long-term political solution.
