Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, over recent months, the conditions for the people, as well as the overall political and economic situation, have dramatically deteriorated in Yemen.
We Europeans must therefore do everything we can to finally stabilise the country.
High Representative, might I ask you to please prevent Yemen from becoming a second Afghanistan.
We must do everything in our power to fight international terrorism.
We will only be able to achieve that, however, if we also support a peace process in Yemen.
We need to achieve peace in the region and we need to support the peace efforts of the government there.
The Yemeni Government could also be reminded, once again, that it needs to ensure that there is no discrimination in Yemen - only then can there be peace.
Peace requires democratic structures that uphold the rights of minorities.
That is our European path, and it may differ from other paths.
I ask you, in your new role, to spare no efforts to walk this European path with us.
Without political stability, Yemen has no chance.
With political stability, the local economy can recover, then an economy can be built up and people can be given future prospects.
I ask you to work hard for this.
I also ask you to make your influence count to ensure that the auxiliary troops there can provide humanitarian assistance.
There are over 130 000 refugees from Somalia in Yemen.
The situation on the ground is dreadful.
I put all my hopes on you, Baroness Ashton, in the expectation that you will use your influence here.
Please also stand up for the six hostages, for the European citizens - one Briton and five Germans - who are being held as hostages in Yemen.
Maybe you can also help to get them freed.
Many thanks.
