Madam President, Baroness Ashton, my question relates to the forms of cooperation, in your view, that we, the European Union, should develop in Yemen, for example, in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises, or perhaps in the area of the provision of energy and water supplies, as communication and building up connections could play a special role in future.
Which programmes would have priority here, for you, High Representative?
