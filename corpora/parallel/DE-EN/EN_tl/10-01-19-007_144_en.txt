Madam President, Baroness Ashton, my question relates to the memorandum of understanding that has been signed in the energy sector.
Do you think it is possible to achieve further development together with either Mr Oettinger or Mr De Gucht?
In my opinion, economic reconstruction would be the very thing to bring more stability to Iraq.
If we were to improve relations in the energy sector, particularly through greater provision of European equipment to make better use of the energy reserves that are present there, with us buying energy there to compensate, we would have a win-win situation for both sides.
An initiative in the next few weeks would make great sense in this regard.
