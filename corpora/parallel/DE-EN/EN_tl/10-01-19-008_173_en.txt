Mr President, I will come straight out and say this: I think there is little sense in paragraph 31 of the present proposal for a second revision of the agreement.
I, too, am opposed to the kind of relay race that the various readmission agreements for migrants create, whereby the people in question are passed from one country to the next.
In this regard, there is definitely a need for such cascade agreements to be better regulated at the international level.
It seems to me even more important, however, that this kind of situation is avoided in the first place.
I therefore believe that the idea of facilitating the circular visa for people from the ACP countries is the wrong way to go.
Let us, therefore, support self-help.
Let us promote self-sufficiency.
Let us turn charity cases into producers with a sense of self-worth.
That would certainly put a stop to social emigration and the flight from social poverty.
