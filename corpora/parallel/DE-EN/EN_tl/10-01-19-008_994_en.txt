Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be voting in favour of this report, as I think that the deepening of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP states within the framework of the partnership agreements is important.
That said, I would like to point out that this report contains the wording 'protection of sexual and reproductive health'.
Yet what is behind this phrase?
Does it, first of all, mean ensuring people's physical and mental well-being in relation to all areas of human sexuality and reproduction, for example, by combating sexual violence and genital mutilation?
Does it, secondly, mean access to information about what has come to be called family planning?
Or, thirdly, does it also include abortion?
In the past, the Commission and the Council have made it clear in relation to questions from MEPs that this 'sexual and reproductive health' does not include abortion.
That is exactly how I see it.
I therefore think it important to establish that the term 'the sexual and reproductive health of women' is not in the context of abortion and I am therefore proposing a clarification to that effect in the text of the agreement.
