Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment and excellent cooperation, as this really is an important subject.
As we have said already, human trafficking is perhaps the very worst form of crime.
Europol's figures, cited in the question, show that there has been no improvement in this field.
The opposite is true, in fact.
In the area of forced labour, specifically, the figures are going up, whilst the figures on the trafficking of women remain unchanged.
It is thus absolutely clear that there is an urgent need, above all, for consistent action.
In order for such action to succeed, it is necessary, first and foremost, to adopt an integrated approach in the most varied of areas.
One absolutely essential element is to increase awareness - including amongst the population within Europe - that human trafficking takes place right in the middle of Europe, in every country.
We need, above all, to get to work on education in this regard, as we did, for example, for the football World Cup in Germany, in order to bring the issue of forced prostitution to light, and to show that this really happens everywhere, and also to inspire debate amongst the populace so that there is an awareness there which will lead to the victims being helped.
My second point concerns the protection of victims.
Precisely when people are rescued from such a dramatic situation, the Member States, too, must ensure that there is medical and psychological care for them so that they are supported in going back to their countries of origin where appropriate or so that the way is opened to asylum or other similar possibilities here to find a new home and to begin a new life.
