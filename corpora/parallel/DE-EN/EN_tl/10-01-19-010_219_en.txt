Mr President, human trafficking is, in reality, a scourge of the present day, and it feeds on poverty and ignorance.
Its worst form is the trafficking of children, which is often linked to sexual abuse.
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left believe that there is an urgent need for action on the Commission's part.
One of the most important prerequisites for successfully combating human trafficking is strengthening the rights of the victims.
Only if this succeeds - and not only through punitive measures - can human trafficking be combated at all.
That requires very clear rules whereby human trafficking will not result in any sanctions against its victims.
One of the things these victims need is effective protection and support before, during and also after criminal proceedings in which they testify as witnesses.
This must be a high priority for the period of reconsideration, specifically, as well as where witness testimonies are retracted.
Long-term witness protection programmes are urgently needed.
Another thing that I think is important is that all victims of human trafficking, not just children, must be given free counselling.
When dealing with children it is also necessary - coming back to this point - for it to be made possible to make use of child-specialist lawyers.
There is a need for urgent measures to strengthen prevention, such as training for lawyers, the police, judges and counsellors.
I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency intends to address this issue.
