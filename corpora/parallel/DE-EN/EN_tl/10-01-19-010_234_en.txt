Mr President, it is quite significant that we should be debating the subject of human trafficking here today, as this is a subject that remains taboo and since, unfortunately, in our highly developed society, it is women who, in particular, are very often victims of such human trafficking.
I am thinking of prostitution, first and foremost, but also of children.
Very often, we do not want to see it.
For a successful programme against human trafficking, we need to prioritise education, awareness-raising, and we will need money later on.
We should take this into account in our considerations right from the start, as it cannot just be the aim to arrest the perpetrators and enforce a just punishment; we must also seek to have victim protection that means victims do not become victims a second time, but that we also have the funds to re-integrate them into society.
We must aim to take away the traumas experienced by children and integrate the women, as a top priority, into our working world, a legal working world.
