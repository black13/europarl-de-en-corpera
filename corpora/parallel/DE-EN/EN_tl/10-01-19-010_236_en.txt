Mr President, begging, prostitution, theft and burglary - human traffickers and people-smuggling gangs need people, primarily women and children, for these and other, similar objectionable activities.
We are talking about hard-to-monitor criminal activity here, with a very high number of unreported cases.
At this point, I would like to point out that my home country of Austria is particularly affected, as a popular transit country, but also as a popular final destination.
We therefore need to be aware that the vast majority of people-smuggling gangs are active in moving people from eastern and south-eastern Europe to central Europe and that the victims are not only recruited in third countries but also come from the Member States themselves.
The fact is that there has been a rise in such cases and that our external border controls scarcely function.
In the light of this development and the verifiable reality that these journeys are often undertaken in buses - criminal tourism - the question must be asked as to whether it would not make sense, in these circumstances, in addition to the drawing up of reports by Europol, Frontex and others, to re-introduce border controls in the relevant border regions and suspend Schengen for a limited period where necessary.
