Mr President, Mr Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, I must compliment you on your eloquence.
However, what do you really have to say?
What is your message to us?
What is the substance of what you said?
I have heard many speeches - you are the 32nd Head of Government that I have witnessed - but I have rarely heard anything so non-committal in content.
In view of the crisis, the forthcoming summit, the necessary stringency of financial market regulation and the fact that the Council has left the Commission to its own devices over the last few months, where is your strategy?
Mr Schulz must have been in a different room if he is recommending that we adopt your Spanish Government model here.
I would like to make one thing clear: Europe cannot afford a 20% unemployment rate.
What is so good about this Spanish model then?
How have you responded to the crisis?
How can you coordinate things here?
We call for your leadership.
Then we will support you.
However, what can we do with something so non-committal?
Of course we are opposed to marital violence, who would not be?
Your only concrete proposal was the electric car - and with the crisis and the summit in mind - is that all you can come up with, Mr Zapatero?
I am also amazed by the fact that the President of the Commission had to read the Treaty to you with regard to economic policy coordination, and you listened very attentively because it was clearly the first time that you had heard it!
All I can say to you is that you should follow the recommendations of your fellow party member, Mr Almunia.
He resisted the opposition of the Council to the Stability and Growth Pact.
He is the example you should follow.
Help him to secure the Stability and Growth Pact.
Help him to do this and you will have us on your side.
However, with this non-committal pie-in-the-sky approach, we will not make any headway in Europe.
