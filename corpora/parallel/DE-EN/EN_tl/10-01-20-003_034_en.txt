Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not think that Mr Langen was listening very closely, because otherwise he would have heard a clear modernisation strategy and a social pact mentioned.
I am not surprised that you did not hear the social pact mentioned, because it is an important part of this strategy.
Mr Zapatero most definitely mentioned unemployment, including unemployment in his own country.
Unemployment as a whole is something that worries us.
However, he is not the one responsible for this; it is those who, in the last few years, have pursued a policy of maximum deregulation who are responsible.
Those in your ranks who played their part in causing this bear the responsibility.
This social pact is needed now in particular, because we know - and this is the point on which you are right, although only partly - that we must consolidate the budgets.
However, we also know that this must not be at the expense of the vulnerable members of society, as there are currently many - you only need to read today's newspapers - who, for example, do not have unemployment insurance.
It is not only a tragic fate for these individuals, it is also something that affects economic growth, because we know very well that people in the lower levels of society tend to cut their consumer cloth accordingly, and one of the reasons that economic development and economic growth is at risk is because there is not enough consumer spending.
If we do not protect the vulnerable members of society by means of a social pact, it will not only be humanity that we will be failing, but we will also have failed to bring about economic development.
Therefore, this social pact is very important.
Mr Zapatero, with regard to the social pact in particular, you have our full support.
