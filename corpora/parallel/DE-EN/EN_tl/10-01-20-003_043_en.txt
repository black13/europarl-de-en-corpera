Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain is now taking on the Presidency of the European Union for the fourth time.
You know what it is to cooperate with the European Parliament in a very wide range of situations.
We now have the Treaty of Lisbon, which means that the European Parliament is now your key contact partner.
In your programme, you say that you want the EU to take root in the will of those who render it legitimate, namely European citizens.
That is a very ambitious aim.
The path to achieving it can only be found via the representatives of European citizens, in other words the parliaments.
I am therefore very pleased to hear you say that cooperation between the national parliaments, the parliaments of the EU Member States, and the European Parliament is the cornerstone of such a path.
You want to bring the parliaments closer together in order to bring citizens closer together.
That is a good thing.
You have a great responsibility in this regard, as you are the first Presidency following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Other Presidencies will use you as an example.
You are therefore creating the blueprint, so to speak.
I would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned.
I wish you much success!
