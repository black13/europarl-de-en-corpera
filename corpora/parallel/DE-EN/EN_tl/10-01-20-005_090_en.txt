It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling for us to combat the economic crisis and wants to make implementation of the economic policy objectives mandatory.
Coming from a country whose unemployment rate, at almost 20%, is twice the European average, this sounds absurd.
What is even worse is that it is promoting the old idea of European economic governance.
Such violation of the principle of subsidiarity must be rejected in the strongest possible terms.
The EU must remain a union of diversity and of nation states - it owes that to its citizens.
It also owes it to its citizens to finally do some plain talking in the negotiations with Turkey.
The Spanish Presidency is shutting its eyes to reality, in other words, to the fact that Turkey is not part of Europe, either geographically or from a spiritual and cultural point of view.
Ethnic and religious minorities are still being discriminated against in this Anatolian country and Ankara stubbornly refuses to recognise Cyprus, which is an EU Member State.
To say here that the conflict that has been going on for decades will shortly bring 'positive results' is nothing more than a pious wish.
For financial reasons alone, the EU could not cope with Turkey's accession.
A mass influx of Turks and exploding parallel societies would finally finish the EU off.
It is high time that we ceased our accession negotiations with Ankara at once and worked to secure a privileged partnership.
