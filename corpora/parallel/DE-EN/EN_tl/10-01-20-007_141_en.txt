The proposal from the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs proposing the appointment of Ana Palacio Vallelersundi to the panel set up under Article 255 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is, in principle, to be welcomed.
However, from an institutional point of view, it is incomprehensible why a separate panel of seven people should make binding proposals to the national governments.
I therefore voted against this proposal.
