Mr President, I apologise for taking the floor once again.
It is a rare event in my life, but we are not at a fun fair here.
Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, the agreement was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 13 January.
You are not responsible for that, but if you now say to us 'I need first to find out which language versions are available' then I have to say again that this is not a recreational event for the mutual enjoyment of MEPs and ministers.
This is a legislative chamber in which serious work is required!
I would now like to say something to you - not to the Spanish Presidency, but to the Council - and that is that the way in which the Council has dealt with these matters shows that it has no regard for Parliament whatsoever.
The time has now come for us to say to the Council that these little games are finished.
There is a serious legislative procedure - in Europe, this, of course, involves all documents and all dossiers being available in all languages at the start of the procedure and does not mean that we have to go in search of the documents with a divining rod after the procedure has supposedly finished.
This is not a sound procedure.
I ask you now to tell us which language versions were available when the agreement was published in the Official Journal on 13 January.
That is something that I am now formally requesting to know on behalf of our group.
