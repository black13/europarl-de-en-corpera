What is being referred to as the SWIFT agreement (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) governs the passing on of data from the global bank network.
On a daily basis, 8 000 monetary institutions from 200 countries communicate with each other via the channels of the society, which is based in Belgium, with data centres in the Netherlands and the US.
According to the Commission, requests for data can only relate to international transfers and use of the service is strictly limited to terrorism investigations by the secret services.
However, both high-ranking politicians and criminal experts doubt that, in the US, the data would be used solely for combating terrorist activities.
Data abuse, violations of civil rights and the passing on of data to third parties are all very real dangers that could result from the SWIFT agreement.
As Members of the European Parliament, we absolutely must not allow the entry into force of this agreement and the associated data transfer to the US, and certainly not without the approval of the European Parliament.
Provisional entry into force of the agreement pending the debate in the European Parliament in February would constitute a huge violation of the fundamental principle of democracy.
