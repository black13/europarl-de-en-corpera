Mr President, the United Nations climate conference failed due to the hard-nosed political interests of the industrialised nations.
As a result, the basis for existence of billions of people in developing countries and in the island nations at risk of being submerged is in jeopardy.
There is no agreement on how we are to effectively limit the further warming of the planet.
The EU played the game in the interests of its national undertakings and the profits of the large concerns.
The target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States by a total of 30% by 2020 was not brought to the table early enough.
Making better climate protection targets dependent on the prior concessions of other States is playing dice with the future of humanity.
The facts are clear: in 2007, CO2 emissions per person were 4.6 tonnes in China, in Germany they were 9.7 tonnes and in the US 19.1 tonnes.
We urgently need climate justice for the whole of humanity.
Next year in Mexico City, the industrialised nations and emerging economies must come to a binding agreement with specific and ambitious targets.
