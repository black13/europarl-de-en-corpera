Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the only concrete result of the climate summit in Copenhagen was the limiting of global warming to two degrees Celsius.
The measures needed for this, however, have remained a mystery.
This minimal compromise is disappointing for us, particularly since it is now up to each individual State to decide whether or not to accept the agreement on climate protection goals.
Time really is running out.
It is up to us to now decide what happens next.
We should promote sustainable, climate-protecting development, which allows us to use the resources of our planet in a responsible way, for us and for future generations.
The EU and its Member States should develop their world-leading role in green technologies.
Then we will at least have made a start.
