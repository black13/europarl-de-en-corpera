President-in-Office, I have two further specific questions.
Firstly, do you believe that, during the Spanish Presidency, we will succeed in making headway with regard to visa arrangements for Kosovo, so that Kosovo will not remain a prison within a free Balkans region?
Secondly, what will you do over time to try to get the Member States that do not currently do so to recognise Kosovo?
However, as I said, the primary point is the visa arrangements.
