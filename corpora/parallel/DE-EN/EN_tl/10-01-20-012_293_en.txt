Mr President-in-Office, as we all know, certificates were introduced in order to achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions, and this is what my question is about.
Not so long ago, it came to light that there were underhand dealings and abuses of the system associated with emissions trading.
To what extent have the accusations been investigated, or are they being investigated, and are there any changes planned in this regard?
