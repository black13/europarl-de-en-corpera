President-in-Office, the issue you mentioned has occupied us for a very long time.
Much of what has been said could have been said 10 or 15 years ago.
I have some specific questions in this regard.
Do you agree that, in order to properly implement and make visible the adoption of corporate social responsibility, sanctions as well as incentives would be necessary?
Do you think that a system of naming and shaming could be introduced by the European Union?
When we consider how often products are labelled, could you also envisage a clear reference being placed on companies' products with regard to whether they comply with these basic rules of corporate social responsibility or whether they contravene them?
We are used to so many other types of labelling.
Why not use this method with regard to social matters, too?
