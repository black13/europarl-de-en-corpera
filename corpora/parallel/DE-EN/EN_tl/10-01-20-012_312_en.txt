Thank you for your statements, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido.
You mentioned the macrosupervision area of the European Systemic Risk Board.
You are surely aware that there is already a great deal of criticism in this regard, firstly with regard to the size of the Board, because it has, once again, been put together according to a typical European Proporz system.
Do you see a risk here, too, like many others do, that it will not be possible for this Board to work efficiently?
The second problem with regard to this European Systemic Risk Board is its lack of independence.
Do you think that you could go a step further during the Spanish Presidency and attempt to ensure that it has a greater degree of independence and make any appropriate improvements with regard to the size of the Board, because it will hardly be possible for it to work in any meaningful way on this basis?
