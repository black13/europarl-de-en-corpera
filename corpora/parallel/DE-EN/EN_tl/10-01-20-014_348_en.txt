Madam President, I would like once again to point out that the Kurdish Democratic Society Party ban means that a total of 27 Kurdish parties have been banned by the Turkish Government in recent years.
Since the ban - we have only just heard about this - more than a thousand people have been arrested.
I think that, in a country in which parties are routinely banned, it is no longer possible to talk of democracy.
The prohibition of 27 Kurdish parties almost constitutes an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of Records.
It is not only about the minorities in Turkey - and this is something that I would also like to mention again at this point.
There is currently a strike being held by tobacco workers at the firm Tekel that is very intense and is now escalating.
Several thousand workers went on hunger strike today in order to enforce their rights.
They feel they have been severely oppressed by the Turkish Government and the Turkish authorities.
This aspect must be taken into account, because the protection of the rights of workers and trade unions is an integral part of democracy.
The trade unions, but also the minorities, in Turkey are awaiting a clear and unambiguous opinion from this House.
