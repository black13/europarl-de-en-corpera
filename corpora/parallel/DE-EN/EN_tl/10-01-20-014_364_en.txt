Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is, of course, an emotional topic, that is quite clear.
There is one thing that we should, of course, always take into account in this context, and this has been mentioned several times today, namely that, although the prohibition of the party is totally unacceptable, it was not pronounced by the government, but by the judicial system.
We need to draw a distinction here in order to be fair and honest.
However, that was not what I wanted to say.
As Europeans, we must ask ourselves where we actually want to go.
If, as a global player, we want to pass on not only economic - and as a Social Democrat I would like to emphasise this - but also political values, not only in Europe but also beyond European borders out into the world, then for this, ultimately, we need Turkey.
It will also give us the opportunity to be firm and clear in our dealings with Turkey, which is exactly what is required.
Only then will we succeed in setting a democratisation process in motion in order to succeed in our overall purpose.
