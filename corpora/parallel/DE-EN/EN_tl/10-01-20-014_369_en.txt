It is good that the European Parliament is at least addressing the issue of the democratisation of Turkey.
The Commission and the Council tend, in principle, to talk up the situation - as dramatic as it might be.
They call it 'soft power'.
However, where has this 'soft power' got us?
It is quite clear that, since opening the accession negotiations, there have been considerably more backward steps than steps in the right direction in Turkey.
Now there is yet another party ban.
However, there is also the continuing massive restriction of civil freedoms, the oppression of religious minorities to the extent of attempting to expel or destroy them through bloodshed, curtailing their freedom of information and freedom of the press, attempting to annihilate the opposition press and the free trade unions, and the list goes on.
'Pacta sunt servanda' - that is always emphasised in connection with Turkey, and rightly so.
However, this applies to Turkey, too!
With its entry into the accession negotiations, Turkey entered into an agreement with the EU to comply with the Copenhagen criteria.
If it continues to refuse to do so, it will have to ask itself whether it really wants to become part of Europe.
The 'softies' in the Commission, the Council Presidency and the Council ought finally to act in a consistent manner instead of continually opening new negotiation chapters.
