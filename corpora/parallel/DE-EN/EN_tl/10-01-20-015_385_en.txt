Madam President, like Mr Theurer, who has just spoken, I, too, come from the European Watershed area.
We are, in fact, Rhinelanders, but nevertheless, we are very interested in the Danube, although it actually flows in a direction with which our life paths have relatively little to do.
At this point, I would like to ask you not to view the strategy for the Danube Region only in the terms outlined by many of the previous speakers, but also as an opportunity for cultural integration.
Using the example of the Danube, young people, in particular, can come to an understanding of how erroneous nationalism can be overcome, of how these tremendous cultural riches - whether it be Nobel prizewinners for literature or the famous avant-garde music events of the Donaueschingen festival right along to the delta - can be grasped and understood.
My request is - it is still possible to wish for something more at this early stage - that you also incorporate a cultural identity and cohesion into the strategy as a whole, particularly for young people.
