Madam President, the strategy for the Danube Region is one of the most important current European regional policy projects, because the Danube has always been a lifeline between the various countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which historically provided a basis for economic cooperation, but also cultural exchange.
I am also thinking here of the positive results of the former Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.
What are we expecting?
We are expecting a great deal from this project, including the development of environmentally sound mobility, away from roads and onto ships, the switching of goods transport to the railways, modernisation and clustering of industrial structures in appropriate places, cooperation in environmental matters and tourism - ecotourism in particular is desired - and, of course, the prioritising of research and development, and a lot more besides.
However, I also expect the efficient use of resources, both financial and human.
The wealth of experience and knowledge possessed by the people in this region must be brought together and pooled.
I expect a rise in the quality of life and numerous good and inspiring ideas.
