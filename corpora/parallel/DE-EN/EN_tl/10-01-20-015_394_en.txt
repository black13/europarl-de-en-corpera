Madam President, the strategy for the Danube Region could be a wonderful example of a regional strategy for using available resources in a coordinated way in a geographically and culturally unified region, resolving problems and, above all, breaking down barriers in people's minds.
Two areas are of particular concern to me in this regard.
The first one is ensuring that the labour market is not only open, but also regulated in an appropriate and cooperative manner.
Brain drains and commuter journeys are everyday occurrences in the Danube Region, the labour market is under pressure and, from 2011, the region will more or less constitute an integrated labour market.
We need coordinated compensation mechanisms here.
The second particularly important concern in this connection is that this is an opportunity for innovation and cooperative research.
I am thinking in particular of inland navigation, which could really do with a push in the direction of environmentally sound technology.
