Madam President, in my opinion, the general goal of politics is to create the framework conditions for achieving the highest possible quality of life.
It is under this premise that I would also like to view the European Strategy for the Danube Region.
The Danube is a lifeline, as we have heard today, and the Danube Region is the living space.
The Danube should and must be a transport route.
It is a source of power - we have a large number of power stations.
The Danube is a nature reserve and must be protected to preserve its biodiversity, but it is also a protected area for leisure and tourism.
The Danube is a life source for agriculture and fisheries, but - as Mrs Regner also mentioned - for future jobs, too.
However, the Danube is also a source of danger - you only need to think about last year's floods.
In order to continue to develop the aforementioned quality of life for everyone living in the Danube Region, we need joint, sustainable and, above all, environmentally sound development of the entire Danube Region in order to make it a key region of Europe for the 21st century.
The goal must be to make the available resources more efficient in terms of territorial cooperation and to use them more effectively.
