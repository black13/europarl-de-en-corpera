Throughout history, the Danube has played a central role in Europe.
The nation states with interests in this area were involved in active exchange long before the founding of the European Union.
I therefore think it is an important step to use the Danube Strategy to now bring these countries even closer together within the framework of regional policy.
There are many points of contact in this context.
These are, of course, in the area of the economy, but also in the areas of culture, environmental policy, energy security and Neighbourhood Policy.
Macro-regions are ideal instruments for dealing with cross-border challenges.
Thorough and long-term planning and preparation are essential if the Danube macro-region is to have lasting success.
The European added value of a macro-region will be particularly evident in the areas of the preservation of biodiversity and sustainable energy generation.
In order to make this cooperation successful, the strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, which can already go down as a successful European project, provides a good model for comparison.
As an Austrian, a regional policy politician and rapporteur for numerous water-related pieces of EU legislation, I give my express support to this initiative and hope that the Danube Strategy will open up new dimensions of territorial cohesion for the countries along the Danube.
