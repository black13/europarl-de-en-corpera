Mr President, we have a good foundation for our cooperation with Tunisia.
The association agreement and the free trade agreement have been mentioned.
Mrs Kroes said that we are talking about integrating the Tunisian economy into the single market.
That is really as far as we can go with a country outside the EU, and therefore this forms a stable foundation.
Tunisia is a solid and friendly partner with the potential for further strengthening our relations, to quote Mrs Kroes once again.
Precisely because we have these close relations, we are also able to talk to our colleagues about all of the issues that may cause us some concern.
I, personally, am in talks with our colleagues, who are here in the gallery, and my feeling is that we should talk about everything.
However, in this connection, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
In Tunisia, we also have a situation where the country, as an Arab country that wants to develop in a secular manner, is threatened by extremists.
I am sympathetic towards anyone who takes action against Islamic extremists.
However, as regards other matters, I think that we will make progress in the ongoing talks.
We can talk about anything with Tunisia because it is a reliable partner.
I therefore look forward to continuing our dialogue.
