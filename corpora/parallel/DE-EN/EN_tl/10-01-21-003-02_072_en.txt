Mr President, when China was selected to host the Olympic Games, I initially hoped, after all China's promises to improve the human rights situation, that this would perhaps actually happen.
However, during and after the Olympic Games, we, unfortunately, had to admit that there was no improvement, but rather a worsening of the human rights situation.
Now, following the judgment against Liu Xiaobo, we have even seen a homosexual party banned by the police, which clearly threatens to result in a political ice age in China for dissidents, human rights defenders and homosexuals.
For this reason, we demand the immediate release of Liu Xiaobo and other human rights defenders and we call on China in particular - if it wishes to be a recognised partner in the international community - to put an end to its hysterical censorship measures and monitoring methods.
This, of course, applies in particular to the Internet.
We cannot accept political filtering of the Internet.
It is an essential element of fundamental rights that the freedom of expression must be defended in all nations of the world.
Human rights are universal and indivisible, whether here in Europe, in the US, in Sudan or in China.
The People's Republic of China will have to get used to that if it really wants a different role.
I am firmly convinced that we, as Europeans, need to make it clear to China within the framework of our official relations at summits - precisely because we have an interest in cooperation in the areas of climate protection policy, environmental policy and regulation of the financial markets - that it urgently needs to change its human rights policy.
