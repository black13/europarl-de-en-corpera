Mr President, we have talked about various different things as regards what would be the right way to go about talking to China and putting it under pressure, because clearly, very little makes much of an impression on this country.
Mrs De Keyser said that, for this reason, her group had withdrawn its signature.
I do not think that that is the right way forwards.
As the EU, which has enshrined human rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the Treaty of Lisbon, we of all people should keep on pointing out violations of fundamental human rights.
There are no other options available to us at the moment.
When we think of something better, I will be there straight away to give it my support.
However, it is not only about Liu Xiaobo; it is also about Gao Zhisheng, who has disappeared and, from what we now hear, has allegedly committed suicide.
Everyone assumes that he has probably been killed in one terrible way or another.
That is not acceptable.
In connection with the Olympic Games, we discovered that if we go to China and make contact there, absolutely nothing changes with regard to the human rights situation.
We all hoped that it would, but it did not work.
Therefore, we should not let up with our urgent appeals.
