Mr President, the reason for this urgency is the brutal murder of 57 people, who were accompanying a politician on her way to register as a candidate in the elections for the position of provincial governor.
The perpetrators belong to a local militia and some local police officers were involved.
This brutal attack is an extreme example of the menacing rise in politically-motivated extrajudicial executions and the forced disappearance of people that has been going on for years without these serious crimes ever being investigated.
The government has not shown any discernible will to take decisive steps to counter this development.
Out of hundreds of cases, only two were investigated and not one senior official has been prosecuted in relation to these.
In 2008, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions wrote that 'These killings have eliminated civil society leaders, including human rights defenders, trade unionists and land reform advocates, intimidated a vast number of civil society actors, and narrowed the country's political discourse.'
This is the climate in which the Philippines is preparing for the elections in May.
There is a danger of there being further political murders.
It is therefore of the utmost urgency that the Philippine Government should take effective measures to put a stop to this.
I would like to propose an oral amendment.
Paragraph 6 states: 'to release all disappeared persons who are still in captivity'.
We would like to replace this with: 'to make every effort to ensure that all who have been abducted are safely returned to their families.'
