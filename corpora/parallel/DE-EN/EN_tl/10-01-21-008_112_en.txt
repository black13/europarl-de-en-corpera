Mr President, I welcome the Danube Strategy as something that is profoundly European.
It connects a founder Member of the EU, namely Germany, with the two most recent Members, Bulgaria and Romania.
It also connects the next candidate country, Croatia, with a country that is striving for candidate status, namely Serbia.
I am pleased that the intention is to also include the Czech Republic, Montenegro and a few others which, historically and geographically, belong to this group, although they are not directly situated on the Danube.
However, I would ask that Bavaria not be neglected in all this.
If it was independent, Bavaria would be the second largest state on the Danube after Romania.
Bavaria has a particular interest in the Danube Strategy.
I am therefore grateful and pleased that we are now pressing forward with this strategy.
