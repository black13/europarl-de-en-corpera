Mr President, we believe that the item on Madagascar is not particularly important today.
We would therefore ask that that time slot be used to discuss the case of Mr Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Afro-American journalist who was found guilty of murdering a policeman in 1982, following a trial based on circumstantial evidence.
Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death and has been waiting on death row for 30 years.
Up until now, no satisfactory explanation has been found for the events surrounding this murder and the evidence has never really been properly investigated.
In any case, the death sentence is one of the clearest violations of human rights we know.
Although, in this trial, the death sentence could have been commuted to lifelong imprisonment, the prosecution rejected this possibility at the end of January.
The life of Mr Abu-Jamal is now more at risk than ever.
We would like this matter to be debated in plenary so that we can decide what action to take in order to ensure that his death sentence is suspended and that Mumia Abu-Jamal is given the opportunity to prove his innocence in a fair trial.
