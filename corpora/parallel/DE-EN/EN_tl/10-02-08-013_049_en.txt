Mr President, in two days' time, we will be debating the question of body scanners.
During that debate, we will be addressing the overall question of security in airports, i.e. our approach to airport security in the European Union.
The European Union has been known, time and again, to adopt precipitate legislation, based either on alleged or sometimes real terrorist threats.
This does not improve airport security.
What it does do is produce ever more laborious and ever more ludicrous measures.
If you consider, for example, the situation in railway stations, it is fundamentally similar to that in airports.
In general, railway stations do not use security measures, at least as far as inter-European and national traffic is concerned.
This begs the question as to whether our concern with security in airports is exaggerated.
Rampant bureaucracy and a never-ending stream of security measures will not contribute to security, but to inconvenience for air passengers.
