Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, VAT fraud is not a mere peccadillo.
It is a criminal act and a problem which either escalates or diminishes over time.
According to the latest estimates, citizens, and thereby taxpayers, lose up to EUR 100 billion every year, perhaps even more.
At a time of accelerating public debt and crisis, citizens have no sympathy for the fact that the European Union has so far not been able to tackle this problem successfully.
This is why I welcome a fresh attempt to introduce the reverse charge procedure, on which we will be taking a vote the day after tomorrow.
What we are trying to do with the reverse charge procedure is effectively eliminate the problem of VAT evasion or at least reduce it.
We have to wait and see, however, whether or not this procedure will generate the desired increase in VAT receipts and deter new cases of fraud.
However, it is certainly worth the attempt.
We will monitor closely the results of the procedure, the application of which is currently limited to 2014, and carry out a critical assessment.
However, I would have liked an amendment to one specific point: I am in favour of enterprises which duly discharge their duty of care in the context of a review of their VAT registration numbers, being exempted from any liability, even if the recipient commits fraud.
I explicitly regret that my amendment to that effect did not command a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
