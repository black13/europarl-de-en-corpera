Commissioner Kov√°cs, Mr President, financial legislation is, of course, a national responsibility and excites the self-interest of Member States.
Here in the European Union, however, we should be thinking of how we are going to sustain the internal market, in particular, the four freedoms, in the future.
One of the main problems which we have to tackle here is, of course, dual taxation.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which cannot keep track of all the legislation in this area, have particular difficulty offering their services in other countries.
The Commission should therefore come up with a proposal on how dual taxation should be managed, and it must be one which puts in place a straightforward and transparent taxation system for these enterprises because, ultimately, it is the credit rating of a company that determines whether it can survive in the market and whether it will stay solvent.
I would also very much welcome a one-stop-shop for SMEs, so that they can have a specific point of contact and so that tax refunds can be paid out quickly, efficiently and transparently.
