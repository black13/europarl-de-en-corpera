Mr President, even as we today congratulate Mrs Alvarez, Mr Domenici and our other fellow members on their excellent reports, even as we congratulate Commissioner Kov√°cs on his committed work and wish him all the best with his future work, and even as we express the hope that he will pass on to his successor the passion with which he has fought for a common tax policy, we must also then mention Member States, those Member States who continue to hesitate in taking action that is more than necessary in this crisis situation, action which will finally usher in better cooperation.
It is quite shocking that we still have not made any breakthrough on the question of the tax base.
Anyone who thinks that they will be able to defend their sovereignty in this way will lose it, just as they will lose their tax revenue.
Therefore, the main message of these reports is that we must forge better cooperation in Europe.
Only that will lead to progress!
