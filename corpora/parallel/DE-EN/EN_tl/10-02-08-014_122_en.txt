Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against tax fraud is a necessity.
Of course, tax evasion and tax fraud are not the causes of the economic and financial crisis.
It seems important to me to make it clear once again in this House that we must regain the confidence of the taxpayer through simple tax systems and through low and fair taxes.
However, that is not to say that we should not actively fight tax evasion and tax fraud, because any tax evasion undermines our sense of justice.
That also brings us to the subject of tax havens.
Germany's neighbour, Switzerland, has voiced concerns that it is being placed under pressure.
On this point, I would like to ask the Commission specifically: are proposals being made, or rather, are measures being taken to place Switzerland under particular pressure?
My personal view is that Switzerland cannot afford to treat the EU any less well than the USA.
Therefore, that means that Switzerland must actually join in our concerted efforts to fight tax evasion.
