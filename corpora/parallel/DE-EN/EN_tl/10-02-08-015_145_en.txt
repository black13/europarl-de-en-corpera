Commissioner Å pidla, Madam President, the Commission should protect European interests and on that point I agree with what previous speakers have said.
The Commission should reconsider its approach.
From tomorrow, General Motors will be trying to rake in EUR 2.7 billion worth of public aid across Europe, without contributing a single cent of their own.
We have to make it clear that Europe, i.e. the Commission, will not make any money available if that means that further plants will be shut down or that production will relocate outside Europe.
However, at the same time, Member States should not support General Motor's plans to that effect and should not think only about saving their own plants.
We should not allow workers to be played off against one another, nor should Member States allow themselves to be so, because any such divisions would result in further off-shoring.
The European taxpayer and Opel's other workers in Europe should not foot that bill.
Nobody will understand that over there!
People want to understand what the European Union is doing.
Whatever plans General Motors might have for Europe, the Commission should ensure that they play to European rules.
The European Works Council has proposed a solidarity-based solution and a sound financial rescue plan for Opel, whereby all the plants would remain in Europe and whereby adjustments would be made in all plants on the basis of solidarity.
Management should not be allowed to ignore this plan, nor should Mr Reilly and his colleagues disregard the consultation process with the European Works Council or the rights of consultation and participation which we have secured for European workers.
A solidarity-based European solution for Opel is possible, but the Commission must get involved.
