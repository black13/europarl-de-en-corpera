Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, more women have entered the labour market.
However, more jobs does not always mean more quality jobs.
There are high numbers of women in part-time work and in jobs that have been particularly hard hit by the present crisis.

That is why we have to establish binding minimum standards: EU-wide minimum standards for parental leave, improved child care and improved health care.
That is how we can break many gender-based stereotypes and finally achieve the imperative of real equality between the sexes.
