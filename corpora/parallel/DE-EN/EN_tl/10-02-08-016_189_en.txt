Madam President, we have the European Year against Poverty and Exclusion.
Women are still at a very high risk of becoming poor or having to live in poverty.
There are many small steps which land them in that position: girls tend to choose jobs which do not pay so well.
They then decide to have children, which often leads them to only be able to work part-time.
Alternatively, they might decide to look after their parents or grandparents, which again puts older women in a situation where they are unable to return to work.
These periods add up and, as a result, women's professional careers progress much more slowly.
This is also reflected in the fact that they have lower pensions, for example.
There are many aspects to this, and many have been included in this report.
The really important message we need to put across is that there are already many opportunities out there, but girls and women need to make use of them.
The awareness that a girl is studying engineering, and that she is brave enough to do so - that is what we have to promote in schools.
This also applies particularly to immigrant women.
I would also like to make another point: if you look around the Chamber today, you will see that two thirds of us attending this debate are women and one third are men.
We must also win men over to taking a much greater interest in this subject, so that, one day, we can have the two remaining thirds of men attending and supporting women's issues.
