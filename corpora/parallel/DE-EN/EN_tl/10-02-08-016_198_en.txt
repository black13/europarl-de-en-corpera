Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this extremely interesting debate has already covered just about everything.
I can hardly think of anything new to contribute to it.
However, there is one brief point I would like to make: we should all aim to ensure that women are no longer in a situation where they have to choose between family, on the one hand, and work, on the other.
We need to create the conditions for that to become a reality.
It should be possible for us to take swift action in order to ensure that a woman can fulfil her maternal and occupational roles as well as possible.
Realistically, exclusion from an existing salary scheme is probably inevitable.
However, it should be possible for a woman, once she returns to work, to make up for lost working time.
I believe this is the solution we should and ought to be working towards, particularly in challenging economic times.
If we are successful, and we in the European Parliament can contribute a great deal to such success, then we will achieve a modern Europe of real equal opportunity.
It is clear to us all that this is really only possible with consistent equality between women and men.
