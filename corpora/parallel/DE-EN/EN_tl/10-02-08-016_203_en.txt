Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a short while ago, I gave a speech about my work in the European Parliament, about my tasks here and about my many appointments.
Then a man asked me this question: 'What does your husband say to that?'
I have heard this question many times.
I know that women get asked it, but I believe that, the other way around, no man is ever asked the question: 'What does your wife say to that?'
(Heckling)
Yours has?
Well then, in your case, we can talk about real equality.
Let me give you another example: A young married couple, friends of mine, have just had a baby and the parents share one job, that of looking after their baby.
For the wife, it is considered normal, but the husband gets asked why he spends half the day changing nappies and does he not feel this has set him back career-wise.
That is not equality, either.
In conclusion, let me touch on equal pay, which we have discussed today.
Although there are companies which pay union wages, there is evidence that women work in departments where they have fewer opportunities to progress and where they are paid smaller allowances.
One final example: companies whose management consists of at least 30% women achieve better business success.
Equality does pay off!
