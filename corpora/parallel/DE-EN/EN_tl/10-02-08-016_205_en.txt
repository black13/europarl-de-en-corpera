Mr President, Commissioner, I would very much like to thank my fellow Member, Mr Tarabella, for his report.
The fact that this report contains more than 40 paragraphs is clear evidence that equality and equal opportunities for women are not a subject that we can do justice to in just under an hour.
There is enough material here for several debates.
Today, however, I would like to focus on two points.
The first one is paragraph 8 of the report, which is critical of the fact that gender mainstreaming in the current Lisbon Strategy is basically non-existent.
I would like to join the call that the Commission and Council include a gender mainstreaming chapter in their post-Lisbon 'EU 2020' strategy.
Furthermore, it is essential that Member States carry out a gender-based impact assessment, because if we want to be serious about fighting the effects of the current crisis, we need action which will take into account the particular position of women.
I think that Member States really should be urged to take action based on such data and impact assessments in order to promote economic recovery.
I am also of the opinion that women have rights over their own bodies and health.
