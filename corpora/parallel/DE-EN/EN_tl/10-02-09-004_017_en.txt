Mr President, Mr Barroso, in September 2009, I had to tell you that your political guidelines were continuing a failed Commission policy.
Your neoliberal guidelines do not reveal a strategy for more social justice, nor do they provide better protection for Europe against crises.
They provide no basis for the work to successfully combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe.
Now you are presenting to us the College of Commissioners that best suits your programme.
You can expect no applause for this from my group.
Already during this new parliamentary term, this Parliament has demonstrated that it takes democratic control and codetermination seriously, and I very much welcome that.
I am thinking of the new Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission and of the rejection of one of the candidate Commissioners, and I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will once again be conscientious in its addressing of the SWIFT agreement.
Transparency and fairness are vital in the agreements between the institutions - only when we have these can we begin to talk about policy.
It is about the people of Europe and the rest of the world, it is about good jobs and more rights to a good education and fair pay, it is about their right to peaceful development and an intact environment.
Therefore, Mr Barroso, my group will not support your guidelines or your staffing proposal.
Prepare yourself for our harsh, but fair, exchange of views with you and your College.
