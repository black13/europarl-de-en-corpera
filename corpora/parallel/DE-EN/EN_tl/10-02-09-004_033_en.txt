Mr President, I finally have the feeling that things are starting to happen.
It took more than eight and, indeed, almost nine years for us to get the new treaty and the same number of months for us to get the new Commission.
That is not a Europe that takes action, yet action is what we need.
People are looking for work, businesses are looking for markets, consumers are looking for reliability, Greece is looking for stability and Europe is looking for its role in the world.
It is therefore a good thing that the time of complicated debates that only experts could understand is over and, for that reason, it is also good that the Commission can now work in a way that will really benefit the people once again.
There are two things we want from you, Mr Barroso.
Please be courageous and make Europe strong, both inside and out.
We want you to be courageous and we also want Europe to be more involved in areas which perhaps differ from those that the Member States or people answering polls want - in the economy and financial affairs, in justice and home affairs, but also in foreign and security policy.
This comment is intended for you, in particular, Baroness Ashton.
The shortcomings are clear.
The internal market is not functioning well enough for small and medium-sized enterprises.
This is often due to national, rather than European, bureaucracy.
Greece needs help, of course.
For this, we need a strong Europe.
I am pleased that the Commission has now put forward a proposal.
Anyone who thought that we had already achieved enough in foreign policy will now surely have learnt otherwise in the light of Copenhagen.
We therefore repeat: Mr Barroso, make Europe strong, inside and out.
You have our support to do so.
