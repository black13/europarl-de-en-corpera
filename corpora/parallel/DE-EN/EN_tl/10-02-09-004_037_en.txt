Mr President, Mr Barroso, we were very happy to have got the Treaty of Lisbon in place on 1 December and, along with that, a stronger social policy and a strengthening of the position of consumers in the area of internal policy within the European Union.
However, we now find that you - contrary to what is contained in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely a horizontal commitment to protect consumers - have done exactly the opposite with the division of the portfolios in your European Commission, because now there is not just one commissioner responsible for consumer protection, but several.
I would like to ask you how you actually intend to handle this.
How do you intend to establish coherence in this policy area, an area that is extremely important to consumers, to European citizens?
The responsibilities have been divided up.
Which commissioner will provide this coherence?
Please do not tell us that it is the College that will decide.
We need clear areas of responsibility.
Please do not say to us, either, that ultimately you will decide in the event of a dispute between the different commissioners.
You are not almighty and you belong to a College.
I have serious difficulties with this, Mr Barroso.
You need to explain to me how you can truly get to grips with this fragmentation of policy in the area of consumer protection, but also in other areas like foreign policy, so that we have a policy that, after five years, will allow us to say 'yes, it was worth having a Commission like this'.
I do not yet know how I will vote later.
That will depend very much on your answers to our questions.
