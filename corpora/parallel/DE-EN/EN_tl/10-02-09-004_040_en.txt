Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we now have a second Barroso Commission.
The way the system has changed has already been mentioned.
It is the fourth Commission since I came here.
The first two Commissions, led by Mr Santer and Mr Prodi, were both collegial bodies.
The first Barroso Commission was notable for its individual players - I am thinking of Mr Dimas, Mrs Kroes or even Mr McGreevy, who remained inactive for years under your leadership.
If you now introduce the presidential system, Mr President, then I would recommend that you take the lead, but return to the college system.
That is better for Europe and better for cooperation with Parliament.
The citizens have expectations - you spoke of being bold - with regard to the European agenda.
Firstly, you need to stabilise the euro, extend the euro area and make the national governments honour their obligations.
Secondly, you need to create modern, technology-based jobs to a global standard, because the Lisbon Strategy from 2000 has failed, although the goals were the right ones.
Thirdly, you need to continue to develop Europe on the basis of its previous successes, not on the basis of cries of doom and renunciation scenarios, and make Europe an equal partner with the US and China, and, fourthly, you need not only to ask questions about the future, you also need to answer them together with Parliament.
Open markets and more education, growth and prosperity must not be topics that are consigned to the past; they need to remain topics of the future, as must social security, an industrial base and no expansion of the financial markets.
We want fair cooperation with you and the Commission.
In this, the Commission must be the engine, not the master of Europe.
Two groups have decided to totally oppose you - the Greens and the Communists.
They represent barely 13% of Members.
If the Commission President and the Commission work well with the rest of this House, then we will, together, have the success that we need.
