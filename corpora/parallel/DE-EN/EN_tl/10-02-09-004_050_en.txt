Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a democracy, an approval is never a carte blanche, it is always a credit of trust that first needs to be justified.
Let us therefore open up a new chapter together, let us not merely carry on as before, as you, President of the Commission, have said.
The treaty, the crisis and globalisation make it necessary for all of us to change the way we operate.
We need greater European awareness in the Member States, more honesty towards the European Union, more EU in Europe and more EU in the world.
It requires leadership from every single commissioner and the readiness to turn European Union debates into policy.
The European Parliament and the Commission must enter into a new partnership - a partnership for a Europe of the citizens, a partnership to counter nationalism, protectionism and extremism, dishonesty, dumbing down, irresponsibility and a lack of respect.
In addition to the stability pact for currency, we need a sustainability pact for all policy areas in order to be more credible and to regain lost trust.
It will be necessary to develop the excessive deficit procedure, the exit strategy and Europe 2020 into one joint concept to bring down national debt, deal with deficits, promote innovation and growth and create long-term jobs.
Finally, Mr President, I urge you to draw up an opening balance sheet and submit proposals for coordinating economic, social, fiscal, research, innovation and education policy, because we need more Europe.
