Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the new College, ladies and gentlemen here in plenary and in the gallery, in these times of economic, financial and climate crisis, the citizens of Europe expect leadership from you.
They expect bold and clear projects.
Mr Barroso, you said a couple of times today that we cannot go on as if it is business as usual and we need to be bold and courageous.
This is not something that we have seen in your guidelines or in the hearings of most of the commissioners.
Take foreign policy, for example.
Baroness Ashton, you are the one who should and must be the united voice of Europe.
It is not only a matter of good coordination or consulting the Member States.
You should present bold, specific projects to the Council, for example, for European civil disaster prevention in line with the Barnier report.
You need to lead the way, including in matters relating to the financial crisis.
We need common financial market supervision and a financial transactions tax.
Present these proposals to the Council.
Please do this and do not wait for the Council to say 'yes' or 'no' or for individual Member States to start lobbying you.
If we get this leadership from you, then you will also receive the support of the European Parliament.
You do not have it yet.
