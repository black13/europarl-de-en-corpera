Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon is intended to strengthen the European Union and with that, naturally, primarily the European Commission and also our Parliament.
It is disgraceful, however, that, despite this, politically weak representatives are placed at the top of the EU institutions.
Political observers agree that the new Commission contains no real political heavyweights.
If the President of the Commission is already the smallest common denominator among the powers of the large EU States, this situation is clearly continuing unchecked with the individual commissioners.
The new President-in-Office of the Council and the High Representative, in particular, are also more like political lightweights.
Our important political partners like the US are already letting us know this, and we do not know what will happen with other partners like Russia, for example.
As a result, the question arises as to whether a strengthened European Parliament in cooperation with a weak Commission can actually do any positive work in terms of integration and satisfying the interests of the European peoples.
