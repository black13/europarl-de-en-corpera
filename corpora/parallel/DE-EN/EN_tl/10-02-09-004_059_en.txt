Mr President, my request to the new Commission is that it do more for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Two thirds of our workers work for these enterprises and they generate 50% of gross domestic product.
We must, above all, see to it that the creditworthiness of the small and medium-sized enterprises is increased, because, particularly in times of crisis, venture capital is of particular interest in order to be able to continue to pay good wages.
We need to be more competitive and for this we need to provide better support for the infrastructure.
The trans-European networks in particular ought to be improved.
We must see to it that the small and medium-sized enterprises also have research opportunities so that they are able to offer new products and services via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
We also need to improve vocational education and training.
That is a major task for the European Commission.
I wish the new European Commission every success and good luck for the future.
