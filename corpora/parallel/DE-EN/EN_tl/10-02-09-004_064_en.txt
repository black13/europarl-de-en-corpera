Mr Barroso, Mr President, I am disappointed not only about the people in the Commission, but also about your allocation of portfolios.
You have split up some of them in such a way that it will, in future, be very difficult to conduct specific negotiations in the committees.
Moreover, you have taken away from some commissioners a portfolio with which they had actually proved their worth and you have given them one they are not so happy with.
Looking at this from more of a psychological point of view, an unhappy commissioner, Mr Barroso, can do a lot of harm, because, particularly at the start of his job, he will be faced with a lot of people putting forward suggestions that he is not able to deal with.
In my opinion, that is a wrong decision.
The second point I would like to make is about the interinstitutional agreement.
We will definitely fight for this to be implemented, as the Treaty of Lisbon is now in force.
We will have our say on international treaties and we will succeed in this, even in the face of delaying tactics by both the Council and the Commission.
The Commission should be prepared for this.
