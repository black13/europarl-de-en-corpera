Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to mention two things that, for me, are absolutely crucial.
A great deal has been said today about overcoming the crisis.
In this regard, we must be aware of one thing: this crisis will not be overcome if bonuses are paid out again once the banks are stable again.
This crisis will only be overcome when those who have now become unemployed get their jobs back again, and when those who, as yet, have not had any work are able to work.
Then we will have overcome the crisis.
It is therefore vital for your Commission that you pursue the goal of creating and safeguarding jobs and ensuring that those who work hard also receive adequate pay for their work and have a greater share of the general prosperity than was previously the case.
If you succeed in doing that, Mr Barroso, then, in my opinion, the future Commission will be more successful than the previous one.
