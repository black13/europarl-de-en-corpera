Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, my group also participated actively in the hearings of the candidates.
Some of them made a thoroughly positive impression on us.
We are less enthusiastic about the new arrangement of many of the portfolios.
That also includes the rather mysterious - although perhaps soon to be less mysterious - area of responsibility of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is also Vice-President of the Commission.
However, we found many of the candidates disappointing in terms of their specialist knowledge.
In this regard, all of our questions related primarily to political projects.
In what direction should the European integration process go?
Which measures are most important to the Commission candidate?
There were far too many vague answers to these questions and answers that, politically speaking, we do not support.
Despite claims of a more social Europe, they persisted in advocating a route towards deregulation, privatisation or the flexicurity concept.
The flexibility of workers was the top priority and social security was right at the bottom.
Climate protection is on the agenda, but we are not seeing a move away from coal-powered generation of electricity or from nuclear power.
I do not see the EU taking a leading role in climate protection and in development aid.
Nothing has been said about consistent disarmament, especially with regard to nuclear weapons within Europe.
Mr Barroso, Mr President, as much as I appreciate the candidates coming forward for the hearing, my group is unable to give your College a positive vote.
