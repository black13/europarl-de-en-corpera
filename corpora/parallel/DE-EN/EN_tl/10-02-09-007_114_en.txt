Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Commission and I am also in favour of the Framework Agreement, which represents an historic step forward.
Despite this, I have voted against the resolution, because we received it yesterday as a finished text and were not able to debate it seriously and because the devil is in the detail.
For that reason, I would like to make it clear that I have concerns about the wording in many places, for example, with regard to the rights of individual MEPs to ask questions or the risk of collusion between the Commission and Parliament in respect of the agenda if the Commission attends the Conference of Presidents.
I therefore ask that further corrections be made in the final negotiation of the text.
It has rightly been said that Parliament has more power.
We need a close partnership with the Commission, but we do not need collusion.
We need more democracy, not less, because with this additional power comes the need for more democracy within Parliament.
