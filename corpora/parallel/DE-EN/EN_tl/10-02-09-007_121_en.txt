Mr President, in view of the enormous challenges facing Europe, it is important and a very welcome fact that we have an effective Commission.
In addition, cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, on an equal footing and based on trust, is vital if we want to succeed.
The agreement adopted today will form an important basis for this.
Parliament now has full powers of codecision and therefore has equal standing with the Commission and the Council in all areas.
In light of this, we will cooperate intensively with the Commission - on the basis of trust, but not without discernment.
The SWIFT agreement in particular demonstrates that no more issues may be decided without Parliament.
I very much expect us in this House to be able to debate the SWIFT agreement once more.
