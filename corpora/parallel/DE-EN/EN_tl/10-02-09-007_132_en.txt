Mr President, I am pleased that there has been a high level of consensus in Parliament today.
Many have called for a strong Europe.
Consensus makes us strong, and I am therefore pleased to see such a positive outcome of the vote on the new Commission.
At the end of the day, only an effective Europe can also be a social Europe.
The Commission has made a clear commitment in this regard, because ultimately we can only distribute what has already been produced.
It is therefore important for us to concern ourselves with training and education and to focus on infrastructure and research in Europe.
It is relatively simple to make the rich poor, but it is a rather more intelligent, challenging and far-reaching task to make the poor rich.
That should remain the goal of Europe.
