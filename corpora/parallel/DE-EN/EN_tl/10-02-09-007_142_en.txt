The approval of the European Parliament for the new Commission does not constitute a carte blanche, but a vote of confidence.
However, now we can finally begin our work together with a fully competent Commission.
The role of the European Parliament was consolidated and strengthened with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and, with the Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission that was adopted today, the establishment of the European Parliament as an equal partner with the Commission has been duly confirmed, and this is something that I expressly welcome.
With this, we have created a good foundation for future cooperation and we will also insist emphatically on this dialogue as an equal partner.
It will probably also be very much in the interests of the Commission to involve the European Parliament in legislative initiatives at an early stage in order to ensure an efficient process that is in the interests and for the benefit of the people in Europe and of an active democracy.
