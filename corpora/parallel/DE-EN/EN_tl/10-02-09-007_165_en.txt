As a committed pro-European, I cannot give my approval to the new European Commission.
It is based on non-transparent decisions in the national parties and government offices.
The proposed EU commissioners are not independent political heavyweights, as rightly desired by younger citizens in particular.
No criteria relating to specialised knowledge were applied in the selection process.
The fact that there were four weeks between the nomination of the Austrian Commissioner, Johannes Hahn, and the allocation of his portfolio is in itself evidence of this.
Despite the EU's reform treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, which is now in force, the European Parliament still cannot elect individual commissioners or express a lack of confidence in them.
Political personalities like the French and Spanish European Commissioners will founder here.
This European Commission does not stand for more democracy and an awakening; it is a continuation along the path that led us into the current crisis.
