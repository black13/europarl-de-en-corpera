I have voted in favour of this Commission, because overall it has shown - particularly with the (new) appointments - that it can carry out the work successfully.
The outcome of the negotiations between the Commission and Parliament is also satisfactory.
I think it is particularly important that the Commission does not receive a carte blanche for the next five years, but is to be subject to a form of ongoing assessment.
There remains a particular challenge to bring coherence to the policies in the different areas, for example, the environment and social and economic affairs, and to formulate our communication with the outside world in such a way as to make European policy more transparent and comprehensible for all citizens.
