I have just approved the election of the European Commission, although this was not an easy decision.
The reason for this is that, during the hearing, it emerged that some of the candidates proposed by the Member States did not have adequate specialised knowledge, nor were they in a position to develop concrete ideas about their portfolios or, indeed, any vision for the future at all.
The Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on their future cooperation also leaves many questions unanswered.
It is currently merely a European Parliament wish list, with no obligation.
In specific negotiations, it will now need to be specified in detail the extent to which our rights as representatives of the people were able to be significantly strengthened through the Treaty of Lisbon.
However, the interinstitutional agreement does contain some important steps in the right direction.
The impact of all measures taken by the Commission is to be assessed regularly by an independent party.
Parliament will be informed at an early stage of staffing changes in the Commission.
The Chair of Parliament's delegation will be granted observer status at international conferences.
The European Parliament will be entitled to be involved in preparing and implementing the Annual Work Programme of the EU.
Finally, the European Commission will undertake to submit a report on its legislative initiatives within three months.
I have therefore voted 'yes' today to the new Barroso Commission.
