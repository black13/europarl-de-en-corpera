Mr Barroso, the pragmatic reason for voting 'yes' to the Commission-designate is simply that the work that needs to be done can now finally be started.
This will save valuable taxpayers' money.
Mr Barroso, you have shown skill in electing the Commission.
Some of the Commissioners-designate are excellent.
There are also some who definitely have the potential to develop.
They should be given the opportunity, as they wish, to familiarise themselves with Europe's challenges.
However, there are some Commissioners-designate who leave something to be desired, do not seem to possess the specialised knowledge and seem to lack the necessary ambition to occupy the top positions in Europe.
For these reasons, I have rejected the proposal for the Commission-designate made up in this way.
I would like to see commissioners appointed in a much more transparent way - and I would like better qualified female commissioners to be found.
