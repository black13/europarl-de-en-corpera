Madam President, it has been rare for me to be overlooked.
Nevertheless, I will gladly begin my speech now.
We all know that not all Member States in the euro area have been equally hard hit by the financial and economic crisis.
In my opinion, however, countries that have been particularly hard hit need to take more extensive measures than those that have not been affected as badly.
The stability of the euro must, of course, remain the crucial and overarching goal.
That also applies to the measures for consolidating the budgets of the individual Member States of the euro area.
These measures are not only in the interests of the countries themselves, but also of the countries that are not as badly affected.
However, we must also consider carefully what measures are necessary and what measures might perhaps be less effective in helping the countries out of this crisis.
Although we could help the countries with the greatest economic problems in the monetary union to obtain money on favourable terms, for example, by means of a Union loan to several euro area states, this favourable external credit would hardly be able to alleviate the acute problems they are facing and would also do nothing about the causes of the problems.
In my view, these countries have, in the past, failed to make important reforms, for which they are now paying the price.
The problems are therefore largely of their own making and therefore need to be solved in future by the relevant countries themselves.
For that reason, we need to implement strict austerity and reform programmes, as announced by the Commission.
In my opinion, it would be disastrous if the taxpayer always ends up footing the bill.
