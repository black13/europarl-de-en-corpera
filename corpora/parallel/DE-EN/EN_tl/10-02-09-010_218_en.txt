Madam President, Commissioners, the euro is our shield and it has proven to be a stabilising force.
That also demonstrates that the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact need to form the essential basis for the deficit strategy and the exit strategy.
However, they should not form this basis alone.
Both strategies need to be supported by sustainable growth and employment policy.
We need to combine the Europe 2020 strategy with the other strategies.
We need an innovation agreement, an investment agreement and a coordination agreement in the European Union, encompassing all Member States.
I am therefore in favour of the finance ministers implementing the three-point plan proposed by Mr Almunia on 22 December 2004 for strengthening Eurostat as quickly as possible.
These sensible, necessary measures have been obstructed for five years.
We need to raise the status of Eurostat and we need to review the statistics of the Member States and to coordinate the statistics of the ECB and the European Union.
We need an opening balance sheet for the European Commission, we need to review the finances of the Member States on the basis of common criteria set by the Commission and we need a steering committee between the Commission, Eurostat, the ECB, the EIB and the Member States for national action plans.
Responsibility, honesty and transparency are required - and no games of hide and seek or cat and mouse by the Member States and the finance ministers.
