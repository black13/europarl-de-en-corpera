Madam President, despite all the criticism that people like me have expressed about particular deplorable states of affairs in the European Union, we were always very much in favour of the introduction of the euro.
Back when I was a correspondent for der Spiegel magazine, I saw speculation against particular currencies and the euro has protected us against that.
However, what we are seeing now is a massive loss of confidence by savers and, in particular, by citizens in countries in which the budgetary criteria have, to a certain extent, been met.
My question to you, Commissioner, is this: has it not become abundantly clear to you over the last few years that Greece is deceiving us?
There have been abundant rumours in this regard.
However, we knew that Greece did not actually fully meet the criteria at the start.
Why has this not been monitored more intensively?
How do you intend to deal with such a difficult issue in future?
I ask this with my own country, Austria, entirely in mind, where similar rumours are currently circulating in the same way they did about Greece a few years ago.
