Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I expressly welcome the fact that the European Parliament is once again debating the subject of the immediate closure of the prison of torture in Guant치namo Bay, and I endorse the words and standpoints of all my fellow Members who have called for decisive action by the European Union and the Member States.
In reality, it is a transatlantic cooperation problem.
Almost 800 people from over forty countries have been detained there in disregard of the Geneva Convention - without charge, without a lawyer and without a trial.
There are numerous reports of the murder and of the most dreadful abuse and humiliation of the detainees.
The fact that most Member States of the European Union have, up to now, shied away from declaring their willingness as third countries to receive detainees from Guant치namo Bay is, is, in my opinion, a disgrace and quite deplorable, and I call on the Commission to immediately bring this issue before the Council once again, including the subject of the discovery of the part played by European countries in the illegal detention of prisoners there.
I will perhaps finish with one last thought: the use of Guant치namo Bay as a torture prison constitutes a clear violation of the original lease agreement, and Baroness Ashton and the other Members of the Commission responsible for foreign policy should perhaps join with me in calling on the US Government to draw a symbolic line under this disgraceful chapter and give Guant치namo back to Cuba.
