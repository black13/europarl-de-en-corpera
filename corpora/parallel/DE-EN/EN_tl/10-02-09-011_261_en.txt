Madam President, the closure of Guant√°namo is surely a sign that the US has to concede that it has violated human rights, including for the purpose of the fight against terrorism, and that it wants to put an end to it.
I therefore welcome this step.
Slovakia, Italy and other Member States have declared their willingness to accept detainees.
In my opinion, that needs to be discussed at European level, as former prisoners could end up in any Member State as a result of the Schengen Agreement.
In essence, however, we first need to clarify three points.
Firstly - and this is neither disgraceful nor deplorable, Mr Scholz - the security risk for the host country needs to be clarified.
Any specific relation of the detainee to the Member State in question must also be examined.
Finally and fundamentally, it should first be clarified conclusively why the prisoners in question cannot also be accommodated in the United States.
