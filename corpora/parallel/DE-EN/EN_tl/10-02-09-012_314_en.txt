Mr President, as a European from the Alpine region, allow me to move from the water back to the land.
I would like the Commission to take a request to Doha concerning the proposal for an identity marking requirement.
As we know, bred birds of prey - I am thinking specifically of falcons - are subject to an identity marking requirement when traded.
The animals are registered, ringed or, in the case of larger animals, tagged with chips so that they can be identified if necessary.
Without this identity marking, there can be no trade.
Thus, the point I would like to make is that for other species of animals that are endangered or bred, like the lynx in Central Europe, for example, there is no such requirement.
Thus, it can happen that free-roaming, escaped or traded animals are not identity marked and it is not possible to identify them precisely.
That is bad, both for behaviour research and for stock level research, and, of course, it also makes illegal trade easier.
I therefore propose that this identity marking be taken to Doha as a useful contribution to the debate.
