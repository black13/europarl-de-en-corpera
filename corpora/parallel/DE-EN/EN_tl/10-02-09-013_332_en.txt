Mr President, support for housing interventions for households with particularly difficult socio-economic circumstances is, in itself, a very good idea.
The fact, too, that urban and rural areas are now to benefit equally from the support is very much to be welcomed.
However, the support must by no means only be allocated to certain Member States and certain communities, thus clearly favouring those groups.
That would be blatant discrimination against the other groups.
However, that is precisely what this proposal does.
It focuses, in particular, on the Roma people and also on legal migrants.
Furthermore, marginalisation must always be fought bilaterally - on the one hand, by the public authorities but, on the other, also by the groups affected, who should also play an active part in their own integration.
Finally, we need to evaluate very carefully how worthwhile all of these measures are and we need to say a definite 'no' to preference on account of ethnic criteria.
