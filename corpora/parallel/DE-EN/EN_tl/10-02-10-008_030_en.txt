Mr President, as the head of the delegation, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Thaler on his very balanced report.
Skopje has carried out reforms and is on the way to joining the European Union.
We welcome this very much and are very pleased about it.
The visa liberalisation was perhaps the clearest and most visible sign.
It was a milestone in our cooperation.
This objective has only been achieved as a result of close collaboration with the EU Member States.
It represents openness, interaction and cooperation.
However, we must not forget that Macedonia was granted the status of accession candidate four years ago and since then, we have constantly been asking ourselves when it would finally join the European Union.
I would like to call on all the parties to ensure that the name conflict, which is currently the focus of attention, is resolved.
We must make use of the momentum generated by the Council decision in December and by the new Greek Government.
This momentum is diminishing day by day.
I would like to explain to the parties that if we concentrate now on other topics, such as the financial crisis, the goal of Macedonia's accession will be pushed further into the background.
We surely do not wish this to happen and this is why we must continue to make every effort in this area.
