Mr President, I did not say that the United Kingdom is in breach of its treaty obligations.
I simply referred to the fact that the United Kingdom opted out of certain important areas of policy relating to European integration, such as Schengen, the Euro, the Social Charter and - if I have understood this correctly - the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
These are all areas which are not exactly marginal.
