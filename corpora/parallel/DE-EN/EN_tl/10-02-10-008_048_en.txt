Mr President, first of all, I would like to say to Mr Lambsdorff that I reject your accusation.
You said that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wanted enlargement at any price.
It is quite clear to us that we are in favour of enlargement, including Turkey and the Balkans, of course, but only if all the criteria are met.
On the subject of Turkey, I would like to say that, despite all the problems that have been referred to today, I believe that the Turkish Government has the will to continue.
For example, the Ministry of Interior has annulled the protocol which, until now, has allowed the armed forces to intervene independently in security issues.
This is very important.
I hope that a majority of this House will support our Amendment 10 which concerns keeping track of the goal of accession.
This is the only way in which the EU can maintain its credibility with regard to the promises it has made - the goal of accession, with all the criteria being met.
On the question of Macedonia, there has been a great deal of progress in many areas.
I recognise this and I am pleased about it.
However, with reference to one point which Mr Cashman has already mentioned, it is not right for a government to introduce anti-discrimination legislation that does not include sexual orientation.
That is European law.
Human rights are not negotiable and I hope that a majority of this House will also vote in favour of these common European human rights in our amendment.
