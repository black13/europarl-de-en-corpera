Madam President, firstly, congratulations to Mr FÃ¼le on his appointment as Commissioner.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, on his report.
It is a very balanced presentation of the progress made in Croatia.
At the same time, it clearly indicates the areas where Croatia still has work to do in order to be able to complete the accession process.
It is also significant that statistics taken from a Eurobarometer survey carried out in the autumn of last year show that 84% of Croats are dissatisfied with democracy in their country.
This means that not only are reforms to the judiciary required, but also an improvement in the situation of minorities.
It is also important to ensure that the freedom of the press is guaranteed.
These reforms must be initiated and implemented and, above all, they must be supported by the population.
In formal terms, the criteria can certainly be met very quickly, but the entire population must be behind the process and must welcome Croatia's accession to the EU.
