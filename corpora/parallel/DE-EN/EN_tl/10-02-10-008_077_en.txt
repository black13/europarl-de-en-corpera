Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate you, Mr FÃ¼le, on your new appointment and wish you luck in this very important task.
You have already made it clear to the committee that the negotiations with Turkey are about its accession and not about the crazy idea of a privileged partnership, which has never been adequately publicised by those in favour of it.
However, you have also made it clear - and we welcomed this very much - that both sides, Turkey and the European Union, must meet their obligations and undertakings.
In this case, Mr Posselt, the principle of pacta sunt servanda applies.
You must be familiar with this phrase which was used by your former prestigious leader.
One further point is also very important to me.
Of course, Turkey still has a great deal to do, but so does the European Union, whether it concerns the issue of Cyprus, the implementation of minority rights in Turkey or the political and military aspects.
However, one thing is clear.
The process will never be linear.
We know this from the history of the European Union.
You only need to look at the processes and procedures relating to the Treaty of Lisbon.
There will always be progress and setbacks in the process in Turkey.
Something else that is obvious is that when Turkey has fulfilled all the requirements, when it can accept the acquis communautaire, Turkey will be a different country.
However, the Treaty of Lisbon will also have brought about lasting changes to the European Union.
We should be aware of this.
As I have said, both sides must fulfil their undertakings.
