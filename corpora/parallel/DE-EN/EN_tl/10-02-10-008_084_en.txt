Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is high time for the EU to begin negotiations with Macedonia at last.
Macedonia has fulfilled the conditions and has been waiting for negotiations to start since 2005.
Greece has had so much solidarity from the other 26 Member States that it should not now put a veto on starting negotiations with its neighbour Macedonia.
The name issue is a purely bilateral question, even if the UN has given its help in this respect.
On the subject of Croatia, I would like to say that this country is combating corruption to such an extent that other countries, including some within the EU, should take an example from it.
My second point is that the return of the refugees, which Mr Bo≈ütinaru has just mentioned, has, in my opinion, been handled in an exemplary way.
As Mr Swoboda said, many things cannot be resolved in the way that we imagine they will be.
My third point concerns the cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
Croatia handed over all its wanted war criminals years ago.
The documents from the homeland war which have been called for are either no longer available or have never existed.
Therefore, a common sense approach is needed to these questions.
The government is searching for the documents and it has set up a task force, but it cannot do more than look.
If it does not find anything, then it is important to take a step forward, in the light of the fact that Croatia has been cooperating with the tribunal for years and, therefore, has, to a large extent, met the conditions.
I hope very much that the chapter will soon be opened, so that the negotiations with Croatia can be completed by the end of this year.
