Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr FÃ¼le, I would like to wish you every success with your work in future.
It is hard to ignore the ambivalence of the Cyprus issue.
We in the European Union must not dismiss apparently unpleasant issues or try to pretend that they do not exist.
We have not kept our promise.
That is a fact and we must resolve these double standards.
We know that the Ankara Protocol must definitely be implemented with regard to the Cyprus question.
However, it is also clear, as stated by the Council in 2004, that the isolation of Northern Cyprus must come to an end.
I am pleased that Southern Cyprus is providing the north with the necessary support, but this was not the intention of the European Union.
Its intention was that everyone, the entire EU, should bring an end to the isolation.
In order to overcome the final obstacle in this area, we must take a step forwards and put a stop to this isolation.
