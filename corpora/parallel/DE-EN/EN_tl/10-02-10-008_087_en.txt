Madam President, I would like to comment on two aspects of the Turkish issue.
It is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed, and rightly so.
There is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain.
However, what people usually overlook is the fact that there are still significant problems in Turkey with regard to trade union and employee rights.
The Turkish Government continues to oppose trade unions - in some circumstances even using the power of the police - which provide support for their members, in other words, for Turkish working people.
This has happened recently in the dispute involving the Tekel workers.
That is one of the comments that I would like to make.
A democratic society must protect the rights of employees and trade unions and it is important to fight for these rights.
The EU also supports these rights, in particular, in its role as a social European Union.
The second factor is privatisation.
Turkey is adapting to the EU and this includes the area of privatisation.
The Tekel employees, of whom 12 000 are currently on strike, are threatened with the loss of their jobs or have already lost them as a result of privatisation.
However, it is not only the Tekel employees who work in the tobacco industry.
Around 500 000 people employed in growing tobacco in south-eastern Turkey have lost their jobs in recent years, with the result that, having been one of the major producers and exporters of tobacco, Turkey has now become an importer.
A week ago, I had the chance to go to Ankara and speak with the Tekel employees.
If the process of cutting jobs and destroying whole sectors of industry continues as a result of privatisation, the people of Turkey will lose their enthusiasm for accession to the EU.
Therefore, we must put the focus on the social aspect of the EU.
I would like to emphasise that once again.
