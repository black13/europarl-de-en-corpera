Madam President, once again, the report on Turkey is not a progress report, but a report on Turkey's failings.
The EU is calling on Turkey to do more in the area of minority rights, but instead of resolving the issue of the Kurds as it had said it would, Turkey is planning to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP).
For the fourth year in a row, the government in Ankara has failed to implement the additional protocol to the association agreement, but, via its ambassadors, it is calling on the major EU Member States to resolve the Cyprus question.
In my opinion, the long-awaited negotiations on the Mediterranean island are not a cause for celebration, because the most recent Turkish Cypriot proposal goes against the existing consensus on some points, which means that it actually represents a step backwards.
So much for the positive results which the Spanish Presidency announced that we could expect.
Turkey is not a part of Europe either geopolitically or in spiritual or cultural terms.
Human rights, the rights of minorities and international law remain concepts that are foreign to Turkey.
In my view, the only honest response which is in line with the wishes of EU citizens would be to bring the accession negotiations to an end and to aim for a privileged partnership.
