It is commendable that the new Macedonian democracy has made further progress in all areas of society and business.
I very much welcome the fact that the presidential and local elections in March 2009 went smoothly.
This is an indication of the growing democratisation throughout the entire region which was reflected in Macedonia.
Macedonia has met all the criteria for liberalising the visa regulations and, therefore, from 19 December 2009 onwards, its citizens have visa-free status.
This represents a major step forward.
However, Macedonia still has a number of reforms to implement.
I very much hope that we can use the experience which we gathered during the first phase of the eastern enlargement of the EU to help it in this process.
In this context, I am thinking of the implementation of institutional reforms, where political foundations and a range of different NGOs have achieved so much.
There are two areas where we should strengthen our cooperation with regard to transformation and EU standards.
These are reform in the public administration, in the judiciary and in the police.
Personally, I would like to see the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece put aside in the immediate future.
It is important that progress towards the unification of Europe is not brought to a standstill because of bilateral disagreements.
