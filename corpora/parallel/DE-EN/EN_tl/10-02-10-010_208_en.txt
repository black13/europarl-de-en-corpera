Mr President, personally, I feel that it is completely wrong to focus only on reducing CO2 emissions when combating climate change.
Firstly, many people forget that the research into the causes of climate change is still in its infancy and, secondly, it is totally incorrect and unscientific to define climate change as a phenomenon with a single cause.
This means that concentrating solely on CO2 will not make the world a better place.
I believe that it is more important to focus our attention on saving resources.
Cutting our consumption of fossil fuels and making greater use of renewable raw materials and energy will reduce our impact on the environment, improve efficiency and create a better world for our children and grandchildren.
A more efficient and sustainable use of resources is a far more valuable approach for us, our society and the environment than simply reducing CO2 emissions, regardless of the cost.
