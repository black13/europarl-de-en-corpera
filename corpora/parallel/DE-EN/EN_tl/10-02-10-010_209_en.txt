Mr President, the climate negotiations in Copenhagen were disappointing for the European Union, as has already been mentioned.
The result was a long way from the EU position and from the position that we need to be in to protect the climate.
The only positive aspect is the recognition of the two-degree goal, as this could lead to the necessary reduction commitments.
We must now ask ourselves what we can learn from the failure of the negotiations and what we should do next.
It is important to have a period of reflection and to take a critical look at different points on the route that we have been following.
We have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states.
How can we ensure that the EU is also present at the table when the US, China and India meet to negotiate a compromise?
How can we negotiate more effectively with the developing countries and emerging economies?
Is it essential that these negotiations take place under the aegis of the UN?
Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that I was able to vote for the resolution, because in my opinion, it continues to emphasise the pioneering role played by the European Union.
We must now answer these questions and continue on our current path, both from a domestic and an international perspective.
