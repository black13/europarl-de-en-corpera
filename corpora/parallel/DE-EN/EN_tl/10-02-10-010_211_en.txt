Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution, because in my opinion, it is lacking some important data.
Recently, there has been an increasing number of reports of climate scientists having faked data.
It is important for us to discuss this and make our opinions known.
In order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, I would like to explain that I have been committed for many years to reducing our use of fossil fuels and, therefore, our impact on the environment.
However, I cannot understand the scaremongering that has been associated with the phrase 'climate change'.
I have experienced a great deal in my long career as a politician.
In the early 1980s, people said that there would be no trees left in Germany by 2000, but Germany is greener than it has ever been.
It is true that the climate is changing, but this has been happening throughout history and will continue to do so in future.
For this reason, I have voted against this motion for a resolution.
