Mr President, I am very pleased that we Christian Democrats from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have voted against this dreadful ideological report put forward by the Socialists, Communists, Greens and, in particular, the Liberals.
It is an attack on the right to life of unborn children and an attack on the principle of subsidiarity.
In particular, I am horrified by the way in which the Liberals have become the dogsbodies of those on the left and have acted contrary to the principle of subsidiarity.
This type of report damages our acceptance among the population and among the candidate countries.
Some of the ideological elements relating to Croatia and Macedonia in the progress reports are also doing us harm.
This is why we must explain clearly to people about the acquis communautaire, which I am fully in favour of, about the responsibilities of the EU and about dangerous ideological nonsense.
To continue the metaphor started by my Italian colleague: we are, of course, in favour of the soup, but against putting cyanide in it.
