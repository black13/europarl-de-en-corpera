Mr President, I am pleased that this House has rejected by a large and clear majority the attempt by the Socialists and the Greens to set the goal of full membership for Turkey.
The process must remain open and, to put it even more clearly, it must be diverted immediately towards a tailor-made special status or a privileged partnership.
Turkey is not a European country, but it is our most important partner on the margins of Europe.
This is why we want close cooperation, but, in response to Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler who brought this up earlier, without Turkey becoming a member of the European institutions and without full freedom of movement.
However, we do want close economic and political cooperation.
This is a very precise concept and I believe that it has a chance of being implemented, because the majority of the people of Turkey and of the European Union are not in favour of full membership.
Therefore, it would be more sensible not to waste any more of our effort, but instead to focus solely on the goal of partnership.
