There are many countries where democracy and human rights are in a precarious position.
The EU must continue its attempts to change this situation by means of appeals and similar methods.
We should not be surprised by the actions of Iran and its attempts to become a nuclear power.
This is a result, among other things, of misguided US policy.
The situation can only be defused by the use of diplomacy, but the EU must not let itself be taken advantage of by the US in this respect.
The motion for a resolution states that no significant progress has been made and that dialogue is the only solution.
I am in agreement with this.
