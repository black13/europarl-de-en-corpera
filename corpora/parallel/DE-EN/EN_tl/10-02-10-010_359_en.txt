I have voted against the resolution.
Unfortunately, a number of good amendments were rejected.
People's sense of reality with regard to climate protection seems to have gone out of the window.
Critical comments and correct scientific work on climate protection have been rejected, while approval has been given to Europe going it alone.
This is not what I understand to be a responsible policy for our citizens.
