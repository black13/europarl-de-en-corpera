Although there have been many improvements in the area of equal opportunities for women, there is still much to be done.
One of the most urgent issues is to provide greater support for reconciling professional and family life, which, for many women and, in particular, single mothers, is an insurmountable obstacle.
The fact that men are still more likely to be entrusted with positions of responsibility proves that equality at work can only be achieved by a change in attitudes and not by imposing quotas, particularly because quotas are controversial and can easily lead to conflict.
As this report fails to deal with the criticism that gender mainstreaming can also swing in the other direction, I have voted against it.
