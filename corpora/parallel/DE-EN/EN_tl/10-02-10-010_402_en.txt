I have voted against the report because my fundamental convictions do not allow me to accept the unrestricted right to abortion and to reproductive freedom.
For me, the right to life is a fundamental right which must be defended and respected in every case.
The other parts of the report are perfectly acceptable and demonstrate that Europe has made progress towards equality for women.
Another positive feature is the fact that much greater importance is given to the commitment to the family.
