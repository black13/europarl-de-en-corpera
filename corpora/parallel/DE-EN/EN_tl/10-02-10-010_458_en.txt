In contrast to the Commission and the Council, the European Parliament has been able to describe the many problems in Turkey and those relating to Turkey very clearly.
The ban on the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) is an attack on the infant democracy in the country and, in particular, on the Kurdish minority, which represents as much as 20% of the population.
The fact that this is the 27th party ban within 10 years gives a clear picture of the Turkish understanding of democracy.
The annulment of the legislation limiting the jurisdiction of military courts is yet another indication of the disunity within the country.
As soon as the Turkish Government plans a small concession to the EU, it is exposed by the nationalist opposition.
In almost every area, progress has come to a standstill or things are moving backwards.
The Turkish Government is attempting to nip criticism in the bud by taking reprisals against hostile journalists and media organisations.
Double standards are being applied to religious freedom.
The prime minister wants to lift the ban on wearing headscarves and the age limit for Koran schools, while at the same time discriminating against religious minorities and harassing them on an ongoing basis.
These are dreadful developments.
Against this background, it seems only logical that the Turkish chief negotiator, Mr Bagis, does not take seriously our resolution and, therefore, our democratic decision-making structures.
Turkey has shown very clearly that it is still generations away from joining the EU.
