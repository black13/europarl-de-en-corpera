It is extremely important for us to reopen the dialogue with Iran.
Therefore, I very much regret the postponement of the EU delegation's visit to Iran and I hope that it can be rearranged as soon as possible.
There is definitely a lack of respect for human rights and democracy in Iran in its current situation.
However, tightening sanctions against Iran is not the right approach to take.
The opponents of the Iranian Government are also against the imposition of more stringent sanctions, because their main impact would be on the people of the country.
Apart from this, the EU is once again applying double standards.
In the case of important economic partners such as China or India, it is happy to turn a blind eye.
For these reasons, I have abstained.
