Mr President, anyone who has followed the many discussions about SWIFT over recent weeks might get the impression that without SWIFT, we would descend into chaos and that rejecting the agreement would bring an end to the transatlantic relationship and the joint war on terror.
These attempts to threaten us can be described in one word: ridiculous.
The US and the Council are not trying to rescue an essential tool; they are simply saving face.
There are many agreements and measures in place to combat terrorism.
SWIFT could be a useful addition to these.
The failed attack on 25 December has clearly demonstrated that it is not data we are lacking, but the ability to make effective use of the data which we already have.
The idea is to divert attention away from this fact.
The interim agreement simply could not be worse.
It is full of contradictions and inconsistencies.
Instead of suitable precautions being taken to ensure that only data relating to people who are actually under suspicion is transferred, huge volumes of data will be sent to the US every month.
The agreement represents a flagrant breach of citizens' rights, data protection and the principles of the rule of law.
If the Council and the US were really prepared to take on board this criticism and to incorporate these points into a new agreement, then there would be no need for us to accept this dreadful agreement.
In the interests of the citizens, we must say no to the interim agreement and we must start new negotiations immediately, so that we can put in place a really good agreement which acts as an additional, effective tool for combating terrorism and which preserves our fundamental rights.
