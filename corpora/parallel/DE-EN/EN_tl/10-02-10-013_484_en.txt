Mr President, in the era of mobility, we cannot have security without an effective and rapid exchange of data and our job is to protect our citizens against terrorist attacks.
Therefore, we must find a balance between security and privacy.
This balance must be reflected in the agreement that we are currently debating.
However, given the importance of this issue, the Council has taken a really amateurish approach in this case.
Therefore, I would like to see more concessions made to the rapporteur, including some specific help, so that we can perhaps achieve a majority in Parliament.
If we do not have this, then the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme will remain a single central programme and it will be important for us to ensure that SWIFT only transfers individual items of data.
If we do not have this, then the full agreement is the right thing and the current agreement remains important.
Therefore, I believe that we should aim for a postponement and then ultimately ....
(The President cut off the speaker)
