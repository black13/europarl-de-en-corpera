Mr President, no one has any serious doubts about the need to combat terrorism.
However, the question for advanced democracies based on the rule of law always concerns what should be done and how it should be done.
In this case, this question is easy to answer.
We must not act in such a way that 500 million people are placed under suspicion and that there is a massive intrusion on their rights, without giving them recourse to legal protection.
In particular, these measures must not be put in place with a total disregard for existing democratic regulations.
Now Parliament is in the position of having to carry the can for the actions of the arrogant Swedish Presidency.
We must not do this.
Therefore, I am in favour of voting against this agreement tomorrow.
