Mr President, today, the Council has admitted that the results of the negotiations may not have been as good as they could have been.
We should pick up on this and take the opportunity to improve the agreement.
However, simply postponing matters will not help, because the postponement process is not governed by any conditions.
We will therefore find ourselves in exactly the same situation again during the next plenary session.
I do not believe that this will change anything.
Secondly, I would like to say that we have already had enough promises that things will be better during the next round of negotiations without the involvement of Parliament.
We have already been promised before this agreement that this time things would be quite different.
Once again, postponement will not help.
The only thing that will help in this case is to send out a clear signal.
Thirdly, the security loopholes which people have repeatedly claimed will be created if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement simply do not exist.
We have legal reports that prove this and we have agreements on mutual legal assistance.
