Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba, I have listened carefully to what you have said, along with all the Members of this House.
You have used the following words: 'Give me more time to discuss this with the other members of the Council.
Give me more time to come back to you with a better agreement.'
I would therefore like to ask you very specifically whether it is the case that the Council is no longer insisting on this agreement and on the vote on this agreement and whether you want to have to time to negotiate with the US on a new and improved agreement.
Have I understood what you said correctly?
