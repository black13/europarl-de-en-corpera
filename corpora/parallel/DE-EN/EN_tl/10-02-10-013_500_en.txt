Mr President, that is very helpful.
Thank you very much for making this possible.
If I have understood things correctly, because this is a sensitive issue that we are discussing, then Mr Rubalcaba cannot assure us that the existing agreement will not come into force.
In other words, if we postpone matters and give ourselves more time, it will come into effect.
Therefore, my next question is: Can Mr Rubalcaba assure us that, for example, a long-term agreement will be in place within a month with higher standards or is the Council telling us that we must still wait nine months until the end of the period?
It is very hard for Parliament to accept an unconditional assurance.
Therefore, we must have clear conditions relating to the Council's assurance, in order to be able to decide tomorrow about a possible postponement.
