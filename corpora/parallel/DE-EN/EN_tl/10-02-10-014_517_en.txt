Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba has rightly said that we currently do not have a secure system for air travel.
We need more security in this area.
The events in Detroit and Munich have shown that there are security loopholes.
For this reason, body scanners are being introduced in a mad rush as if they were a miracle cure.
They are already in place in the US, in the Netherlands and in other countries.
However, this raises the issue of whether body scanners will really make air travel safer.
This is one of the crucial questions that we must ask ourselves.
There is, in fact, a whole series of questions relating to body scanners.
What type of technology is being used?
What type of radiation do they emit?
Can they cause damage to health?
What do they allow people to see?
Just a few green or red dots or the whole person who is being scanned?
Finally, can we ensure that the data is being protected?
Also, these scanners are expensive.
If we are going to install them, who will be paying?
There are a lot of questions to be answered and we are in the process of doing this.
You also want to do this and present us with a solution.
Whatever happens, we need a solution which covers the whole of Europe.
We also need to take into consideration Tel Aviv and the possibility of using another method.
We need to search for the bombers and not the bombs.
We cannot adopt this method wholesale, because it involves discrimination, but we must investigate all the possibilities while protecting our fundamental rights.
