Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the war against terror is the major challenge of the 21st century.
We are facing up to this challenge on both a technical and a parliamentary level.
In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we have not only implemented regulations concerning the ban on liquids in hand luggage, but we are also looking closely at body scanners.
I would like to say one thing first of all.
We do not currently have complete security, as many of the other speakers have already emphasised, and we will not have it in future.
However, we can develop natural techniques that will allow us to come close to complete security asymptotically.
We need to take some fundamental rules into account, both outside and inside Parliament.
We are already in agreement across all the groups that there should be as little impact as possible on the health of the passengers.
Therefore, it is necessary for us to introduce advanced body scanners which work according to a specific principle.
Of course, it is obvious that personal rights must be protected.
In addition, we must not only refer to the body scanners which scan the naked body when giving examples of the type of screening to be used.
In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we have agreed with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that the Commission will present us with a proposal for legislation on body scanners by the end of March or early April, in any case, before the summer recess.
There are a number of factors to be taken into account in this area.
These include consistent cooperation between the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which is taking the leading role, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the reliability of the equipment, European certification and establishing the same conditions throughout Europe, so that we can ensure that there is security within its continent.
