Mr President, throughout the world 1 200 people died as a result of terrorist attacks in 2000.
Eight years later, in 2008, the figure had reached 16 000 people.
In comparison, 6 000 people die of AIDS every day.
What do these figures tell us?
Firstly, terrorism generates hysteria which results in the rights of citizens being restricted unreasonably, as in the case of body scanners or the current SWIFT agreement.
Secondly, the war on terror has failed.
It has only succeeded in increasing the problem.
On the subject of cooperation between the security services in the European Union, I would like to say that the European Parliament urgently needs democratic rights of control in this area, as is the norm in every democratic Member State.
In addition, I would like to recommend that the Commission supports the introduction of the Common Standardised User Interface (CSUI).
We must push forward with the development of this interface and it must be financed by the Commission.
