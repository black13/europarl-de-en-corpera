Mr President, the one principle that applies to the security of air travel is that European responsibility is constantly increasing.
It is no longer possible for individual Member States to do what they want.
This applies in particular to body scanners.
We have the one-stop security principle, which means that there must either be European regulations for body scanners or no regulations and no body scanners.
The alternative is the principle that everyone does what they want and no one does what they should, but everyone does something.
If a measure of this kind is to be introduced, we must discuss who will pay for it and how it will be financed, because both liquid scanners and body scanners cost huge amounts of money.
I happen to be the rapporteur for this area and I would be pleased to see the Council gradually starting to move on this issue, because it is important to establish in principle that public security is a public matter and must be financed at least in part from public funds.
