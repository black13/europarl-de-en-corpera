Mr President, it is absolutely indisputable that body scanners quite clearly represent an invasion of privacy and a serious invasion at that.
We need to ask ourselves two questions.
The first question concerns the extent to which this response is proportionate and can really help to achieve the objective of combating terrorism.
We do not currently have any clear answers to this question.
This is why I support what Mrs Malmstr√∂m has said concerning the need for an evaluation of all types of scanners.
I would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else.
The second question concerns the risks to health.
Everyone in this room and also those Members who are currently elsewhere will have to pass through body scanners several times each week.
I would have to do so at least twice a week.
This is a long-term measure and I would like to know to what extent it will harm my health.
No real assessments have been carried out in this area.
I would like to make it quite clear that I am not prepared to expose myself to body scanners until these assessments have been made.
Therefore, I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions.
