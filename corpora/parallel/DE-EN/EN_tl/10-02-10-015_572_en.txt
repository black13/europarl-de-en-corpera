Madam President, Commissioner, we are rather disappointed.
I am one of the people who was in the tent city during the Orange Revolution in Kiev and when I look at what has been done over the past five years, I want to say to President Yushchenko that he has not brought stability to his country, he has not created parliamentary opportunities and he has brought the legislative process to a halt.
He is certainly responsible for the failure of the Orange Revolution.
I hope that these elections will bring new stability to Ukraine.
However, despite the elections apparently being conducted in accordance with international standards, I am concerned that this is not a stable, self-confident democracy.
When the legislation is amended three days before the second ballot, right in the middle of the elections, for whatever purpose, this does not demonstrate that the process has been understood.
Instead, it causes us to watch Ukraine with great concern.
I believe that we must become closely involved in the issue of the development of democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine, together with the related subject of stability, which is not a contradiction, but a consequence of this.
Mr FÃ¼le, you have a specific responsibility relating to neighbourhood policy.
However, neighbourhood policy does not simply mean going on as before.
Instead, it means using the tools available to us not only for a bilateral relationship with a country like Ukraine or with other countries in the region, but instead in a multilateral approach to these countries, so that they come closer together and become more stable.
We must give them perspectives.
This does not involve referring every day to the enlargement of the European Union, but instead making visa facilities available to them now, considering the possibility of a free trade zone and perhaps even offering them the prospect of the same status as Norway within a European economic area.
This will not harm anyone, does not represent aggressive behaviour towards anyone and, at the same time, will lead to the introduction of the European perspective and of stability in countries of this kind.
I hope that the new government will prove itself worthy of taking part in this type of project.
