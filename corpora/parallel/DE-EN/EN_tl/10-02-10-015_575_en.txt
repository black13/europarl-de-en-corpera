Madam President, first of all, I would like to pick up on what Mr Brok said.
It is true that it was a very sad result for the hero of 2004, Victor Yushchenko, to be beaten in the first ballot.
In my view, Mr Yushchenko is the only person to pick up the tab for the failings of all the leaders of the Ukrainian parties or blocks.
One important issue that we need to deal with is the fact that the people of Ukraine do not really trust any of the heads of the Ukrainian parties to lead their country on behalf of and for the benefit of all its citizens.
If there is one result that has come out of the presence of the election observers, alongside the fact that the elections were conducted properly, which goes without saying, it is the discovery during the course of many discussions that most people voted for the lesser evil.
None of the citizens whom I met had great expectations of this election.
That is alarming in the case of such a young democracy, which has moved further away from the former Soviet system than any other country in Eastern Europe.
Mr FÃ¼le, I hope that your presence today and the absence of Baroness Ashton does not mean that Ukraine is once again taking second place and will disappear among all the other foreign and security policy priorities.
It must be one of the major priorities, because this has not been the case during the last five years.
The internal failings in Ukraine are mirrored by failings in the European strategy.
We must not take this lightly any longer.
We must give our unconditional support to Ukraine's focus on the West, because we have a lot to lose.
Gas is one subject which always causes a great deal of consternation.
I only need to mention Sevastopol, where we are facing a major conflict.
We cannot simply let things go on as they have before.
You have taken on a significant responsibility in this area.
