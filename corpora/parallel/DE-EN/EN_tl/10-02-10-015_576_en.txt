Madam President, Commissioner, of course, Yulia Tymoshenko is entitled to appeal against the result of the presidential election.
Given the intrigues and scheming which went on in 2004, we cannot blame her, except for the fact that this time, international election observers have confirmed the results.
She can stand up for her supposed rights.
However, this is not a clever move in political terms, because a dispute of this kind will result in the political and economic uncertainty in the country continuing.
The close election result reflects the fact that the country is split into two camps.
However, realistically, it will not be possible for Mr Yanukovich to reinstate the authoritarian regime that was overthrown years ago, even if he wanted to, despite the fact that the oligarchic structure in the political and economic system has undoubtedly been reinforced by the presidential elections.
Given the close result, both camps will have to make compromises.
It is important that the cultural and social East-West split within the country is overcome for the sake of the people.
A lot will depend on whether Mr Yanukovich appoints a prime minister whom both the Eastern and Western Ukrainians can live with and whether Mrs Tymoshenko has the democratic maturity to acknowledge her defeat and join the opposition.
