Madam President, the battle is over and at least for the next parliamentary term, Mr Yanukovich will be president of Ukraine.
It is encouraging that this was the result of a fair election.
This also indicates that the voters did not want the various positions to be set in concrete, such as joining NATO, on the one hand, or the orientation towards Moscow, on the other.
Mr Yanukovich will be well advised to continue the democratic process, not to concentrate solely on looking towards the East and to bring about noticeable improvements in the living conditions of the people of Ukraine.
Otherwise, the results of the next elections will already have been decided.
The EU must provide close support and assistance for this stabilisation process.
It will be clear by the time of the European Football Championships in 2012 at the latest whether Ukraine has developed a common Ukrainian consciousness or whether it will continue to suffer from its linguistic and geographic divide.
