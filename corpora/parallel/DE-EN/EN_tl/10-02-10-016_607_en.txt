The process of integrating the electricity market in the Baltic states should include unrestricted deregulation of the market for private customers and a common energy exchange.
The Baltic States have been hit very hard by the economic crisis.
Therefore, I would like to know how a total deregulation of the energy market can be achieved realistically in this very fragile economic situation.
I am thinking in particular of price volatility.
What is the plan with regard to the infrastructure in the Baltic States and what will happen about the diversification of energy transport routes and energy sources?
