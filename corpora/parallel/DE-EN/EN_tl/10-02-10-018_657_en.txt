Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as commissioner.
We are pleased to see such an astute and successful politician and a well-known Liberal on the Commission.
You will need all your powers of persuasion to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU.
We must fight against any protectionist tendencies.
History clearly shows that countries which have taken part in world trade have enjoyed better growth than those which did not.
We are also facing a new world order.
Some of the players involved, for example, China, have State capitalist systems, but may be using quite different methods in this arena.
Therefore, I call on the Commission to develop a new strategy for world trade.
It is clear that we must move forward with the Doha development round, because a multilateral approach is the right one.
However, we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China.
