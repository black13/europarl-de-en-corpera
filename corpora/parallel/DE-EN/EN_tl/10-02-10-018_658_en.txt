Madam President, I would like to pick up on a subject which two other speakers have mentioned.
Mr De Gucht, fortunately you are also responsible for the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC).
I would be very grateful if you could put the TEC right at the top of your agenda, with the aim of solving all the problems that we have referred to.
It is still the case that Europe and the US are responsible for almost 60% of global economic performance.
If we could manage to remove only a fraction of the trade barriers on the transatlantic market, we could do much more for our citizens and, of course, for employees than has been achieved by many of the other measures that we have put far more effort into over the last five years.
I would be very grateful if you could devote your attention to the TEC.
