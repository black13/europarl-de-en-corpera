Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations on the agreement with South Korea have been completed and the documents have been initialled.
That is a very good thing.
However, if we look at the details of the agreement, it seems as if speed took precedence over thoroughness.
I have the impression that your predecessor wanted the agreement to be signed and sealed at any price, so that she had at least one success during her period of office.
We are familiar with the many expert reports which were drawn up before the start of negotiations and which clearly indicated the many possible benefits for European industry and the European economy.
There is likely to be a positive impact on the mechanical engineering, chemical, pharmaceutical, food and service industries.
All of these sectors and many others hope to gain major benefits from the agreement.
However, the main protests are coming from the car industry.
There are difficulties with the duty drawback system, with the question of the amount of parts from foreign suppliers that can be used in cars from South Korea and with the issue of environmental standards which remain unresolved.
I would like to see us not only addressing but resolving many of these criticisms over the next few months using the safeguard mechanisms and the safeguard regulation.
The Members of this House can only vote in favour of this free trade agreement if we have dealt with the justified concerns of the car industry and can also incorporate genuinely effective solutions into these safeguard mechanisms.
The text of the safeguard mechanisms was published on the Internet today, but unfortunately, I have not yet had a chance to read it.
I would like to offer you the opportunity on behalf of my group to work with us in partnership to develop a suitable regulation at a European level, in order to ensure that the interests of the car industry are addressed in this free trade agreement.
