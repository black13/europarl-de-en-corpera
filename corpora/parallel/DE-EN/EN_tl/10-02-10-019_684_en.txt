Mr President, the EU should only conclude free trade agreements with countries which show full respect for human rights.
It seems fundamental to me that the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation should be implemented and, above all, complied with.
The labour clauses in the contract are good, but they do not go far enough.
There have been cases in Korea, in particular in recent months, in which there have been fundamental breaches of trade union rights, such as the right to collective bargaining and the right to freedom of organisation.
Throughout the negotiating process, the European trade unions and, in particular, the unions in the metal industry, have highlighted these cases, specifically with regard to the problems to be expected in the automotive sector.
The case of Opel in Antwerp has been mentioned several times.
To reiterate, operations have not only been moved because of overcapacity, as the management has repeatedly claimed, but primarily in order to relocate production to South Korea.
Who will benefit from this?
Is it possible that this is an advance effect of the free trade agreement?
Another sector with problems which has not received as much attention is the shipbuilding industry.
In its ten-year plan which forms part of an act of state, Korea has made it an objective to ensure that more than 90% of the companies supplying the Korean shipbuilding industry are based in Korea.
This makes the situation for European competitors and, in particular, for the employees in the industry, very difficult.
