Mr President, Mrs Regner, thank you very much for this opportunity.
You have referred to the situation with Opel in Antwerp.
I would like to ask you whether you agree with me that Opel has been in serious financial difficulty for several months, that the company could produce far more cars than it is currently doing and that Opel's poor economic situation cannot be caused by a free trade agreement that has not yet come into force.
