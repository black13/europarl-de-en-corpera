Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I have three questions for you.
My first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions.
The fact that employees' rights in South Korea are restricted means that there are unfair competitive conditions, which include the question of collective action.
Paragraph 314 of the South Korean Criminal Code refers to the crime of 'disrupting operations'.
This is used to prevent strikes and to limit the rights of trade unions, for example, in the case of Ssangyong.
I would also like to know why we are concluding free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea and Colombia which have the most problems with the standards of the International Labour Organisation.
Therefore, my first question is this: How do you propose to use the free trade agreement to ensure that there are no unfair competition conditions in South Korea caused by restrictions on employees' rights?
My second question relates to the problems in the car industry, which several other speakers have also referred to.
It is very important in this case that there are sensible safeguard clauses.
General safeguard clauses are currently in place for major market disruptions and for the duty drawback system.
I am not able to understand this fully.
Mr De Gucht, perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms.
I would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when.
My third question concerns the new contractual basis for our cooperation introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.
This includes approving safeguard clauses and implementation as part of the codecision process.
Can you guarantee that the free trade agreement will not be put into force until Parliament has approved this procedure and only after Parliament has exercised its rights and adopted the safeguard clauses?
