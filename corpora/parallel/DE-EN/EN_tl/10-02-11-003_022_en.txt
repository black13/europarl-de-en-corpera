Mr President, the objective of our policy should be to create an environment which guarantees the highest possible standard of living for the citizens of the European Union.
One key challenge that we face in times like these, therefore, is maintaining and creating jobs.
However, we should not be able to neglect our duty to ensure that these jobs do not make people ill or put their health at risk.
That is why prevention, healthcare and job security are essential.
I strongly believe that the implementation of this directive, which is actually long overdue, will create the right conditions for making jobs safer in every area of healthcare, where staff are confronted with these risks on a daily basis.
I think that it is in the interests of all European citizens that we make this a reality as soon as possible.
