Mr President, having listened to the two previous speakers, there is not much left for me to say.
I would just like to clearly reiterate that our group fully supports Parliament's motion for a resolution, but that we also wish to question the earlier assertion that the rulings of the European Court of Justice have been ambiguous.
On the contrary, I think that the ECJ rulings have been very clear indeed.
We also very much welcome your saying that you wish to initiate consultations with Member States.
Perhaps I should add that a consultation would be better than an infringement procedure.
Consultation is the right way to solve this problem, taking into account national particularities and for finding a solution for the consumer.
