Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, welcome, Commissioner.
It is nice to see you here and to see you sitting in that particular seat.
What we are de facto dealing with in this area is, amongst other things, the implementation of the social market economy regulatory framework.
We are in a state of tension.
On the one hand, we need to go further down the market road, as we have to implement the principles of the internal market.
On the other hand, we cannot abandon our sense of responsibility.
It is for this reason that we have to set certain limitations on the gambling market.
We must accept our responsibility.
We cannot allow everyone to do whatever they please in the gambling market, any more than we can in the financial market, and then have society picking up the tab.
What we are dealing with are questions of education, money laundering, criminality and freedom in gambling.
We have to look at these things together.
Nor do we have any clear definitions, either.
We are all talking about gambling, but there are many different types of gambling, and there are different definitions.
I, therefore, welcome the announcement of the green paper, because it will enable us to approach the definition issue, the problems and the variety of individual national customs at the same time.
A pure internal market approach will not get us anywhere with these issues.
However, we should not use one approach to the exclusion of the other.
We need a regulatory framework at EU level, so that we do not end up discussing this every year.
The Member States and the various operators are all involved.
Working together, we should not undermine the law of the Member States, but ensure legal certainty in the European market.
