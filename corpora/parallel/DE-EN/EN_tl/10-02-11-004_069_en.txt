Madam President, in the debate on whether online gambling should be the sole preserve of monopolies, whether it should be made subject to licensing or whether it should be banned altogether, I think that we should not forget that the increase in gambling addiction has been very dramatic.
As we all know, croupiers in casinos receive psychological training in order to spot players with addictive behaviour.
If need be, they can be banned from playing.
Since the immense boom in the amount of online gambling on offer, however, the addiction problem has, indeed, been increasingly moving to the Internet.
It jeopardises people's relationships, work and health and, in no time at all, they can accumulate thousands of euros in debt.
Protecting young people is another problem related to this issue.
However, banning young people from gambling will not get us anywhere.
One study has shown that one in ten students in Hamburg between the ages of 14 and 18 illegally plays for money on the Internet, whether in the form of online poker or sports betting.
Nor should we forget that, besides the tragic fates of those affected and of their families, it also results in costs to the public purse.
