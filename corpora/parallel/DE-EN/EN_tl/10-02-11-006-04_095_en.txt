Mr President, I have a supplementary question for the Commission, that is, Mrs Malmström: Am I correct in my understanding, Mrs Malmström, that, in your capacity as Commissioner, you support the postponement of the vote of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)?
May I ask why you did not support these requests during your six-month stint as the Swedish Presidency's Europe Minister?
If you had, we would not have had to discuss the postponement today.
