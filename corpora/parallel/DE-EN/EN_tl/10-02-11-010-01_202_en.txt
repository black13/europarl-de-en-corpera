Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat surprised that, in this House, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) stands accused of forcing this topic, which, although urgent, is probably not to the liking of any member of the Left majority of this House, onto the agenda.
I doubt that they constitute a majority in this House.
I simply had to ask that question.
Like all the other groups, our group is also perfectly entitled to raise this matter.
Even though Mr Chávez, who is currently in power, might be some kind of chum of yours or of the previous Spanish Presidency-in-Office, we still simply have to ask what action is being taken in this regard.
I am quite amazed that somebody like Mr Chávez can possibly say things like 'Twitter is a terrorist system'.
I am sorry, but anyone in this day and age who describes Twitter as a terrorist system is living in another world, back in the stone age.
Let me tell you this, as well: We, the PPE Group, will not be cowed by this accusation.
We denounce violations of human rights everywhere.
I personally denounce human rights violations when it comes to freedom of the press.
On that score, let me just say that Venezuelan journalists are spoon-fed and dictated to and that judges are thrown into jail if they release someone who has been wrongly arrested.
As Europeans, we must have the courage to speak out against such practices.
I will not allow Mrs de Keyser and others in this House to pin this accusation on the PPE Group.
Like anyone else, we are perfectly entitled to designate violations of human rights and freedoms, whether in Europe or anywhere else across the world, as topics worthy of debate.
