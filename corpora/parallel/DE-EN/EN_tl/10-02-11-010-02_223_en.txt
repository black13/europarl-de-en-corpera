Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that all the groups have endorsed this motion for a resolution.
That is as it should be, because this topic is very important.
In contrast to the previous speakers, I would like to say that we must ensure that we do not merely promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press in this country, but that we also actively demand them, now that we are examining ways that we could help things proceed towards a, hopefully, peaceful election.
We have to ensure that we, as Europeans, establish freedom of the press in all areas, with all the financial assistance that is needed to make that possible.
We also have to provide full support and endeavour to act together to provide financial assistance, within the scope of the agreements which we have with this country.
