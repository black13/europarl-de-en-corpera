on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the human rights situation in Burma has deteriorated dramatically: political repression accompanied by military and sexual violence, children systematically being recruited as soldiers, 2 000 political prisoners.
The first, allegedly free, elections in the autumn of this year are a total farce.
The opposition parties are rightly going to boycott them.
What is particularly concerning is the position of the Rohingyas, more than 200 000 of whom live in refugee camps.
Many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh and have been brutally persecuted en route.
I very much welcome Bangladesh's willingness to allow our EP Delegation to South Asia into the country on a fact-finding mission.
We are flying to Dhaka tomorrow, in order to gather first-hand information about the situation in Cox's Bazar and the Bandarban region.
However, it is already clear that, in order to survive, the persecuted Rohingyas need comprehensive international protection.
The European Union must persist in its denouncement of the Burmese government's behaviour, until such time as signs of progress in the direction of democracy finally begin to appear.
