Mr President, Commissioner, the dramatic deterioration in the human rights situation in Burma caused by the military junta is resulting in ever more brutal bloodshed.
The persecution of religious groups, ethnic cleansing and expulsion, the taking of thousands of political prisoners and the torture, abduction and incarceration of political opponents of the regime are the order of the day.
The new constitution, and now the pseudo-elections that are supposed to be taking place, will not, of course, improve the situation in any way.
In fact, EU delegations and Parliament's self-righteous resolutions will also not achieve anything.
What we should be doing, in politically realistic terms, is marshalling all of the Union's powers to exert influence on China, India and Russia to add their political weight to the pressure on the Burmese government to improve the human rights situation in this country.
The EU should also call on the countries neighbouring Burma to bring their influence to bear on improving the human rights situation.
