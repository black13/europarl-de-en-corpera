Mr President, our group had a very intensive debate on the Lehne report this morning.
We did not finish discussing this in the group.
That happens in groups sometimes.
We would like Mr Lehne, as rapporteur, to give us until the March part-session to once more consider the direction we can go with this report and the stance that we as Social Democrats want to take with regard to this issue.
There are different approaches in our group - I freely admit this.
I would be grateful if we could conduct the debate, but if you, Mr Lehne, would allow us to postpone the vote until the first March part-session.
That would give my group at least - although I believe other groups too - a little more time for a thorough debate and to arrive at an opinion.
