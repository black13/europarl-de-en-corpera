Mr President, I would like to reiterate my request.
There is no doubt that we are in favour of debate.
We are merely asking for the vote to be postponed.
However, in the interests of fairness, I must add that, much as I understand Mr Lehne's wishful thinking, our group is governed by democracy.
Mr Lehne, I cannot give you any assurances about the result.
