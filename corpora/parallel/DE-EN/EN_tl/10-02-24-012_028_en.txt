Mr President, I will be brief.
In the last few days, two important nominations have been put forward: the first is the representative of the European Commission to the United States of America in Washington and the second is the Special Representative for Afghanistan.
Both nominations are controversial and there are various discussions going on about both of them.
I do not wish to go into the question of merit just now.
I would simply like to ask, Mr President, that, before they take office, both of them appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs to enable us to have an intensive debate there, and I hope that the President of the Commission and the President of the Council will give this their full support with your help, Mr President.
(Applause)
