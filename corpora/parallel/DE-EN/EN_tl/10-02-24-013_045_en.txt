Mr President, I am very disappointed in you, Mr Buzek.
It is unacceptable for a group chair to call the President of the European Council a 'damp rag' in this Parliament, rather than offering political criticism.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would expect you to respond to that with a call to order.
It is not acceptable for this man to freely trample the dignity of this House underfoot.
To Mr Daul, I would like to say that it is not a question of the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
It would perhaps be better for Mr Farage to relinquish his mandate if he finds the European Union and the European Parliament so objectionable.
(Applause)
