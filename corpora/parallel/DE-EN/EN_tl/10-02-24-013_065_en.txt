Madam President, the EU has now adopted a post-Lisbon Strategy in which it has been careful not to commit itself to any testable goals at all.
Focusing on the green economy will not, in itself, be enough to guarantee the competitiveness of Europe as a centre of production.
In my opinion, in addition to a well-functioning energy supply and infrastructure, this will require well-trained workers and not wave after wave of migrant workers flooding the labour market with cheap labour.
If it is necessary to make the national labour markets more flexible, then it must not lead to the transitional periods for the new Member States being lifted by the back door.
A time of crisis, in which more and more people are becoming unemployed or having to eke out a living from part-time work or 'one-euro jobs', is not the time for the EU to give new impetus to the existing merciless competition on the labour market.
The European Union should not, as a general rule, employ despotism.
It must not immediately withdraw financial aid from structurally weak regions because no reforms have been carried out - not even as a threat.
We certainly do not need a new advisory committee to evaluate the goals, which will probably end up on the shelf once again.
Instead of more centralism, we need to move the subsidies back to national level.
Europe 2020 must not trigger another competition marathon and privatisation exodus.
Instead, it must guarantee the prosperity of the citizens of Europe.
The EU has a chance now to gain status as a bulwark against globalisation and this will probably be its only chance.
