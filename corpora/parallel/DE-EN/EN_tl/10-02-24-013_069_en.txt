Mr van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to thank you for the letter that you sent us.
I can tell you that I fully support the principles, values and the direction to take that you set out in the letter.
I am pleased that you said today that you want to meet almost on a monthly basis, because it is your job to bring the Heads of State or Government and the Member States back to Europe.
The Lisbon Strategy itself was not wrong, but the methods were wrong and the political will was lacking for the objectives to be implemented in the Member States.
It must be your job to coordinate the Member States in areas where the powers of the European Commission and the Union are inadequate.
You said very clearly that the market is not enough.
Yes indeed, we want a social market economy.
The monetary union is not enough.
We need political union.
The first test for all of us will be the 2011 budget, which will already have to be based on the Europe 2020 strategy.
Europe 2020 is not the goal; it is the instrument with which we will do what we need to do in response to the financial and economic crisis.
We need more coordination in budgetary policy, fiscal policy, economic policy, research policy and education policy, because we cannot improve our competitiveness with economic goals alone.
We therefore need the Small Business Act to be implemented in the Member States.
Our motto should be 'small businesses first', because that will create jobs in the regions.
There are three things I would like to see.
Mr Barroso, we need a study of the effects of all of the Commission's measures on the real economy, not just on the banking sector.
We need a review of our finances which also takes account of demographic changes and the social security and pension systems.
We also need a joint package that includes coordination, the excessive deficit procedure, the exit strategy and Europe 2020, so that these do not contradict each other.
