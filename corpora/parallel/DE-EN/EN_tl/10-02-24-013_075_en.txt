Madam President, President of the European Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly address two points.
Firstly, do we already have a Europe 2020 strategy that promises success?
No, as yet, we do not.
I will tell you why.
If, in the Commission and the Member States, you say that we will first carry out a rapid consolidation of the budgets and then deal with the economy and employment, then this is a miscalculation.
If you do not believe us, read the statement issued by the International Monetary Fund yesterday.
Private sector demand is a long way from recovery.
We are concerned about public investment.
If you do not pursue an integrated strategy with specific employment goals at the centre, we will have no chance of dealing with the crisis.
Secondly, do we have an answer to the debt crisis in the countries that are under the most pressure?
No, as yet we do not.
More than one country has made mistakes.
However, if you read the data carefully and listen to the analysts, then you know that at least half of the Greek excesses are the fault of speculators - the speculators that, for five years, the Commission did not want to regulate - the hedge funds.
Now we are finally doing that, but what does it actually mean in practice?
We need a European monetary fund, a fund to help these countries.
We need to be able to offer credit at sensible rates not only outside the euro area, but within it, too, with conditions attached.
However, we need to establish a European policy to solve the crisis - and we need to do so now.
