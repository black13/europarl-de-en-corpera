Mr President, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Commissioner, I believe that a credible investigation into the violations of international humanitarian law is important and that this is what we must focus on.
The conclusion needs to be examined, but this applies equally to both parties involved, including to those waging asymmetrical war by firing on Sderot and other towns from a densely populated area, thereby determining the battlefield.
This is being investigated fairly and no one-sided conclusions will be drawn in this regard.
This also goes to show that, in the Middle East, but also in other comparable regions, only peaceful solutions will bring lasting results.
As long as no peaceful solution and no lasting understanding can be found, we will never solve these problems.
In such cases, full account must also be taken of the security aspects of the State of Israel and these aspects must be taken seriously, including in light of the fact that new rockets are being developed here, which are problematic.
However, I would also like to point out that it is right to call for an international investigation, although not everything can be investigated within the framework of the Goldstone report.
This report is intended to deal solely with the occupied territories.
It has been pointed out that not a single Member State of the European Union voted in favour of the report in the Human Rights Council.
Some abstained, others voted against it and others - such as the United Kingdom and France - refused to take part in the vote at all.
We should also take this into account, as the resolution was carried by such 'representatives of human rights and democracy' as Cuba, Nigeria and China.
We ought to bear this in mind when evaluating this matter.
We need to stand up for human rights, but not on the basis of this report in order to wage political war against one of the sides.
