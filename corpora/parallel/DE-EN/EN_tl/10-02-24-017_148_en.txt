Mr President, I am pleased that the European Parliament has succeeded in producing a resolution on the Goldstone report that has fairly broad support without simply transferring the conflict in the Middle East to Brussels.
If we want to retain the chance of lasting peace, we must appeal to what unifies all parties involved, instead of - as some are doing here - emphasising the sources of division.
The source of unification is the applicability of international law, in particular, with regard to human rights, throughout the world.
However, just as the parties to the conflict must allow and support an independent investigation, the international community must avoid making a one-sided judgment.
Therefore, we also need to make it absolutely clear that the one-sided demonising of Israel is not only inappropriate in this debate, but it is inappropriate in general.
Those powers that are working to call into question the legitimisation of the State of Israel must be clearly repudiated by us in Europe.
Instead, the powers in Israel that are fighting with us for peace, tolerance and human rights in the Middle East must be strengthened.
It therefore needs to be made clear here and now that we find the obstruction of the NGOs in Israel by government representatives like the Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, unacceptable.
This policy is harmful to the people of Israel and therefore to peace in the Middle East.
