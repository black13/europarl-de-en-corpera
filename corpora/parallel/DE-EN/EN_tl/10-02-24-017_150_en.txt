Mr President, Israel's right to existence, the protection of its people and the efforts to promote as close cooperation with Israel as possible are, for me, as a German and a left-wing politician, political givens.
However, I find it unacceptable that, for years now, 1.5 million Palestinians have been placed in the largest open-air prison in the world as hostages of a misconceived policy.
Anyone who is aware that more than 44% of children under the age of 14 live in the Gaza Strip will realise what a dangerous legacy this policy has created for the future.
Clearly, the 2008 war and the inhumane policy towards civilians are intended to be forgotten.
For that reason, we call for an investigation and for atonement.
Taking a relativistic attitude to the violation of humanitarian and international law and granting the perpetrators exemption from punishment will only lead to new suicide attacks and wars, and the spiral of violence will continue.
Europe must not continue to look away.
Thus, the implementation of the Goldstone report, including in the United Nations General Assembly, must remain the job of the EU.
