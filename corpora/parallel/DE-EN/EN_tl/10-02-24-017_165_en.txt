Mr President, the Goldstone report describes human rights violations by both sides.
Over 1 400 victims in the Gaza Strip are obviously too many.
However, I am also certain that, without the rocket attacks on Israel, there would have been no military response.
During a visit to the country by the Delegation to Israel, we discovered that Israel does not take military action lightly.
The main accusation of the Goldstone report, that Israel deliberately and continually attacked civilians, does not hold water.
The question of the extent to which Hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated.
However, the report mentions that the Israeli army provided warnings by means of telephone calls and flyers.
Hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on Israel.
However, we also need to ask whether the UN itself did enough in Gaza, for example, to prevent the Hamas rockets being fired in the vicinity of UN facilities.
I do not believe that the Goldstone report is a basis for further terrorist attacks on Israel - it does not justify that.
It perhaps does not help any further, either.
However, it is clear that, here in the European Parliament, we must demand respect for human rights and call on both sides to return to the peace process.
