On 5 November 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Goldstone report and passed Resolution 64/10.
These documents called on both Israel and the Palestinians to investigate, within three months, possible human rights violations during the Gaza conflict.
Unfortunately, neither Israel nor the Palestinians have as yet complied with this request.
This is a great shame, because the Goldstone report provides a very extensive list of the misdeeds and crimes of both sides.
According to the report, during the three-week-long attacks, Israel committed major violations of international law.
Civilians were attacked indiscriminately and houses were bombed.
The use of phosphorus bombs, condemned by the international community, has also been mentioned.
The Palestinians, in turn, used rockets and mortar shells to deliberately kill civilians, according to the report.
The accusations are so serious that it is imperative that they be investigated, and quickly.
As the UN Security Council has rejected the Goldstone report, it cannot be assumed that the recommendation it contains to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague will be followed.
I therefore call on the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, on behalf of the EU, to apply a great deal of pressure to both parties to the conflict and ask them to review the crimes.
