Mr President, there is a scarlet thread running through the Platform for Action from Beijing, namely non-discrimination.
That is a good thing.
Women should not be given a worse deal than men without good and sound reasons.
However, I do not think that quotas of women - so-called 'positive' discrimination - is a sensible approach to this.
Skills must be the key criterion, not gender.
I therefore strongly reject the quota of women in the appointment of the European Commission.
Instead of concerning ourselves with quotas, we ought really to be focusing on women who are oppressed and discriminated against.
In Europe, we allow Muslim women to continue to live in a kind of parallel society, where violence against women and other forms of oppression are part of everyday life.
We allow Muslim women in Europe to have no freedom to make decisions over many areas of their lives.
It starts with the mode of dress, continues through education to their choice of career, as well as to their choice of husband.
Women's rights campaigners from Islamic countries approach us, hoping that something will be done about it here.
Where is the Europe of human rights when we need it?
I therefore believe that we should stop these artificial discussions about quotas and instead work to combat the massive discrimination that occurs daily in Europe under the guise of the freedom of religion - this truly has no place in our enlightened community of values.
