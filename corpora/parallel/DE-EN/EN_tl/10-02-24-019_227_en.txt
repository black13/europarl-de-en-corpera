Mr President, gender equality is a fundamental principle of the EU.
This principle is stated in the treaties, on websites and is happily cited often and in many places.
It should therefore be justified to ask why we are always talking about it.
The answer is, quite simply, because equality is not implemented in many areas.
I look forward to the day when we no longer need to talk about this and the principle of gender equality has finally been realised in the social sphere.
