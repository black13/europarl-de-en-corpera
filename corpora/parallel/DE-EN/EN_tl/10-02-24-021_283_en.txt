Mr President, this is certainly not a nice reason for this debate.
Madeira has been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster and we extend our condolences to the families affected.
The European Union must provide support in this situation.
The solidarity of the whole of the European Union is required here and I can only reiterate what has already been said.
I urge the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as quickly as possible so that help can be provided.
I would like to ask the Council to ensure that the reform of the Solidarity Fund that Parliament adopted two years ago is finally implemented, because this will make it possible to provide assistance more quickly to the regions affected.
We also need to look to the future.
In recent years, Madeira has received a lot of structural fund resources and will also continue to do so over the next few years.
These resources need to be used to take preventative action so as to be able to reduce the terrible consequences of natural disasters and therefore also the suffering.
This is something that, as the European Union, we need to implement in the regions and therefore also in Madeira.
