Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, disasters are, of course, also a consequence of global warming.
We need to endeavour to deal with these developments, which we are faced with on an increasingly frequent basis.
The question therefore arises as to whether assistance should not be provided from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, particularly to workers in Madeira, because many work places will, of course, have been destroyed, and whether we could not support the small and medium-sized enterprises in the reconstruction work.
We could provide a significant amount of help to craftsmen and the services sector in particular.
I therefore ask the Commission to examine whether resources from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund could not be made available immediately.
