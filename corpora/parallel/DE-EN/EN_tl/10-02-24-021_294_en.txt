Mr President, firstly, allow me to express my heartfelt sympathy for the victims and the families affected.
In Austria, we have a simple saying: he who provides help quickly provides twice as much help.
That should not be an issue.
We need to quickly find the funds from which to make the resources available and get help to those affected without delay.
Analyses will also be necessary.
As someone who lives in a mountainous region, I understand very well what happened here.
Similar mistakes were made here to those made in our country.
We carried out alignment work and hydraulic engineering work without taking nature into account, and out of small streams and channels, great rivers came.
I watched these events, which were also the order of the day in Austria two or three years ago, with horror, in other words, with heartfelt sympathy and understanding.
Immediately after the clean-up, after the damage limitation, we need to work together to rectify these mistakes.
We offer our help in doing this.
We received international help when we suffered our major avalanche disaster in Galt√ºr.
International help was needed to enable us to evacuate a whole village and to rescue the people and fly them out.
This is an appropriate time to send out a positive signal and to show international European solidarity, and I for one am prepared to do what I can to help in this regard.
