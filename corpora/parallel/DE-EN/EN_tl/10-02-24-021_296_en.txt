Member of the Commission.
Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you here in Parliament about the floods in Madeira.
You have made an impressive appeal to the Commission to assist Madeira in its current situation and to show a sign of European solidarity.
The Commission is prepared to do that.
Precisely how it can do that will need to be worked out in the next few days and weeks in close cooperation with the Portuguese authorities.
We must, and will, observe the rules of the Fund.
Where they provide some leeway, the Commission will use that for the benefit of Madeira.
First of all, the damage needs to be assessed and then an application for assistance has to be drawn up and submitted.
That is the order in which things need to be done.
The Directorate-General for Regional Policy and my colleague, Commissioner Hahn, will provide advice and support in this regard.
Mrs Estrela called for the further development of the key directive and the rules of the Fund.
More than four years ago, the Commission presented a proposal in this regard, which Parliament supported.
It is currently still with the Council.
However, by way of qualification, I would like to say that the proposals that we made at that time would not provide any better opportunities for assistance in this particular case.
It is right that prevention must remain an area of focus for our policy.
Cohesion policy is therefore precisely the right instrument to use.
I would like to assure you once again that the Commission will do everything in its power to help the people and the administration in Madeira to cope with this terrible event.
