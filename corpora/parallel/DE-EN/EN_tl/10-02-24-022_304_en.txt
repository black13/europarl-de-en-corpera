Madam President, Mrs VÄƒlean, honourable Members, the gas crisis at the beginning of last year showed us how important it is for Europe to have an energy infrastructure in place that not only promotes the functioning of the internal market, but that also enables solidarity between the Member States and the regions affected in the event of a crisis.
It is therefore important for the Commission to get an overview of what new investment projects are planned or are under construction and which old installations are to be permanently taken out of service.
Thus, our proposal is to develop and rework an information instrument that originated at the time of another crisis, namely, the first oil price crisis.
This proposal aims to extend the area of application of the regulation, in particular, in the areas of renewable energies and CCS.
We welcome the proposals that have come from within Parliament to include areas of application such as district heating networks or gas, coal and oil production capacities.
We also want to take account of existing reporting obligations, provided the information available within the context of the analyses that are to be carried out by the Commission is useable.
