Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, one of the key problems in the energy sector is, of course, the storage of energy.
I believe that, in connection with the security of supply, we need to think more about the subject of storage.
In connection with renewable energies in particular, this is an enormous challenge.
On the other hand, we also need to create intelligent networks.
The more renewable energy we have, the more chances we have of making our environment significantly more energy efficient with intelligent networks and, ultimately, also providing households with incentives to use intelligent metering to reduce consumption as well as costs.
The increase in efficiency will play a very important and key role in future, not only in the production of energy, but also, and in particular, in the consumption of energy.
