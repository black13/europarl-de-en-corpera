Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your valuable suggestions for improvement.
The Commission will take steps to ensure that many of your suggestions are taken into consideration by the Member States in the final version of the regulation.
The Commission is aware of the confidential nature of the information relating to planned projects.
For that reason, we agree with the suggestions of this House to publish only data that has previously been collected at Member State level.
In addition, the data should be aggregated at European level in such a way that no inferences can be made about individual companies and their business policies.
This is important in cases where there is only one company operating at national level in a particular energy sector.
As I have already mentioned, we also welcome the extension of the area of application to cover oil, gas and coal production capacities.
I do not wish to conceal the fact that the Member States are less favourably inclined towards this proposal, but promise to review the inclusion of these capacities within five years.
Irrespective of our different interpretations with regard to the legal basis for the regulation, I can assure you that the Commission's aim is to have a broad debate in the area of infrastructure.
The new infrastructure and solidarity instrument that is to be developed, which is intended to follow on from the Community financial aid to the trans-European energy networks, will provide the opportunity for this, as will the Commission's progress reports on the implementation of the economic recovery programme in respect of benefits to energy projects.
