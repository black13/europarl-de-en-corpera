Coping with the rising demand for energy while at the same time protecting the environment, in particular, in respect of anthropogenic climate change, is one of the major tasks that the EU will have to deal with in the future.
In this connection, it is extremely important for the European Union to be aware of all energy infrastructure projects in the Member States.
This will increase the efficiency of the work to produce a European energy solution.
The present text regarding the exchange of information on investment projects in energy infrastructure will provide a good overview of existing energy infrastructures in Europe.
It goes without saying that this report must not provide an opportunity for data abuse.
I therefore welcome the cross-party compromise, which lays down clear ground rules for the transfer of data.
Central monitoring also enables early establishment of whether Europe is focusing too hard on a single energy source.
Overall, the report represents progress towards a modern energy mix.
