Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the EU as a whole.
It strengthens the involvement of European citizens and it also strengthens the European Parliament.
The increase in the status of the European Parliament also brings with it greater legislative obligations.
These must be met by each individual Member to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.
In this context, I would also like to mention the slogan of legislative excellence.
My 'yes' to the amendment to the Parliamentary budget is conditional.
In view of the ever worsening crisis, we need to manage our finances with greater care.
However, as parliamentarians, we are also obliged to conduct our legislative work in the best way possible.
This dual requirement must be met.
