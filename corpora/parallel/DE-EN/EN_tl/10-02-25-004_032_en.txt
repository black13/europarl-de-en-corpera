Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is only one step on the long road to the reform of the common fisheries policy.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and our coordinator for doing such an efficient job.
I am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy.
However, if we lack the courage to do this, it is important to me that we retain the principle of relative stability.
Furthermore, I would like to mention specifically the major problem represented by the greedy cormorants and the management plan that Parliament has already called for.
The fishing industry is of fundamental economic and cultural importance to our coastal regions.
Therefore, achieving a balance between the economy and the environment is of great significance for me in the context of the forthcoming reform of the common fisheries policy.
