Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to wish the Commissioner, Mrs Damanaki, every success.
We look forward to working with her.
I would also like to thank Mrs Patr√£o Neves, who has done an excellent job of conducting the negotiations.
It is important that the countries with small fishing industries are also represented.
As has already been mentioned, relative stability plays a decisive role for Germany.
Of course, we are all convinced of the importance of protecting fish stocks and ensuring that they remain sustainable so that they stay at a level which will guarantee the existence of our fisheries in future.
However, we must not only discuss the environmental and economic aspects.
We must also consider the excessive protection given to some species, as has already been mentioned, such as cormorants and seals.
Europe's coastline is thousands of kilometres in length and has traditional small-scale fisheries in many areas.
Many families depend on these fisheries for their livelihoods.
Tourism also plays an important role in this respect.
We must take all of this into account.
I believe that the Green Paper is a very good solution which will enable us to take things further with the Commission ...
