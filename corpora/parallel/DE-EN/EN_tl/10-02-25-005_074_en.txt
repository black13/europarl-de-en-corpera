Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the collision between two commuter trains in Brussels, which resulted in this dreadful accident, has deeply shocked all of us.
Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims.
After disasters of this kind, people's first response is often to find someone to blame.
However, the European Union, the Commission and the safety provisions which we introduced in Directive 2004/49 must not be made into the scapegoat in this case.
On the other hand, the important question is, of course, whether we should tighten up the safety provisions.
The investigations into this rail accident have not yet been completed and, therefore, we cannot yet expect any clear results.
The major question that we must ask ourselves is whether it would have been possible to avoid this accident.
We cannot exclude human error or technical failures and therefore both of these things play a role in rail safety.
All rail operators, both state-owned and private, have an obligation to provide the necessary level of safety.
The national rail companies must ensure that they are complying with the appropriate safety standards.
I do not want to give any lectures from a German point of view in this situation.
I simply want to say that in Germany, we have attempted to implement the directive in its entirety.
Wherever there is the possibility of human error, technical systems must be able to intervene.
I remember the dead man's handle which automatically applied the brakes if the handle was not pressed for a minute.
If a train passes a red stop signal, the brakes are also automatically applied.
We must have systems of this kind in place.
The European Train Control System must be implemented so that we have some influence over these things from the outside.
The members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism will work together to carry out the necessary evaluations and also to draw the necessary conclusions with regard to the safety provisions.
