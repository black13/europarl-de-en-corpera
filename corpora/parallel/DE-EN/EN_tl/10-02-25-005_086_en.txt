Mr President, Commissioner, two locomotives were involved in this dreadful accident which were operated by the SNCB, the Belgian National Railways, on a state rail network.
There is no competition on the rail passenger transport market in Belgium.
Therefore, this has nothing to do with competition or with the opening up of the network.
It is all about unsatisfactory safety standards.
Mr Grosch has already pointed out that the technology for stopping a train automatically when it passes a red signal has been in existence for more than 20 years.
The question is: why was it not installed?
This also has nothing to do with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).
I was the rapporteur for the ERTMS.
It represents a vision of the future, but it does not absolve the Member States from the responsibility of putting in place safety measures which are already available on a national level.
That is a task for the individual countries.
Therefore, the question we must ask is why Belgium did not invest in this safety system over the last 20 years.
If they had built a motorway that was shorter by one or two kilometres, they would have had twice or three times the money needed to install these safety systems and avoid accidents like this one.
This was not the first time that a train has passed a red signal.
It was simply the first time that this has led to such a dreadful accident.
