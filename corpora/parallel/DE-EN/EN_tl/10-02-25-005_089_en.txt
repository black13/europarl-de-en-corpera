in writing. - The tragic train accident in Belgium has attracted public attention to safety on the railways.
The safety of the rolling stock must be improved, as well as the safety of the signalling systems.
There are many completely outdated goods wagons, in particular, on the railways in Europe.
The accident in Italy last year demonstrated the possible consequences of this.
Unfortunately the EU has so far done very little to oblige freight operators to bring their rolling stock up to an acceptable safety standard.
It is important to remember that hazardous goods are also transported by rail, which could have devastating consequences in the event of an accident.
Against this background, I am calling for higher safety standards on the railways.
