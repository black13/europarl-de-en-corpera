Mr President, I would also like to request a split vote concerning the deletion of the words 'EU positions' from the last sentence.
The text would then read: 'calls for the recommendations and related observations to be included in EU dialogues with both sides, as well as in multilateral fora'.
The words 'EU positions' would be deleted.
I would like to ask for a split vote in this case.
