Mr President, a functioning infrastructure in the European Union is a decisive factor in the reasonable growth of prosperity.
Alongside food security and a common foreign and security policy, energy policy plays a crucial role.
For this reason alone, it is essential for the European Parliament not only to take part in this discussion, but also to have the right of codecision.
Therefore, I call on the Commission to bring an end to its blockade policy and to grant Parliament the right of codecision.
