The whole plan may well be based on a good idea - namely the ability to react to supply bottlenecks - but the Member States already failed to comply with their reporting obligations under the old regulation.
The proposal before us does not seem capable of effecting any great change in this respect.
In its current form, however, neither market interventions nor excessive administrative costs for business can be ruled out.
For these reasons, and in order not to encourage bureaucracy, I voted against the report.
