The aim of this motion for a resolution is to ensure that Member States provide accurate information on their projects in the area of energy infrastructure.
As soon as a project in the energy sector is started or discontinued, this must be reported to the Commission, so that the Commission acquires the ability to draw up new or amended project proposals, thereby gaining significant influence over the energy diversity of individual Member States.
This represents a further step in the direction of centralisation.
I therefore voted against this motion for a resolution.
