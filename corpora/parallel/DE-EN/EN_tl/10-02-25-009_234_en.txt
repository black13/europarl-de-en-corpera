According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration.
The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions.
The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee.
It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs' assistants are paid.
The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this.
Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants' Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants.
For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow.
For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained.
