I voted for the Maňka report, although I did not agree with the budget increase in the secretarial allowance for MEPs.
In her explanation of our vote, Mrs Trüpel, who is the responsible member on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, put it on record on behalf of the whole group that our vote in favour is conditional on there being an evaluation of the secretarial allowance before the increase is put into effect.
I consider both the other points - namely the increase in posts for committees and groups - to be sensible and necessary as a consequence of Parliament's new legislative powers under the Treaty of Lisbon.
We Members wish to and will take these powers very seriously and thereby do justice to our role as the only elected representatives of European citizens.
