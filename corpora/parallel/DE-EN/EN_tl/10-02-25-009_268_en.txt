A fundamental and comprehensive reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) is to be welcomed, particularly with a view to the sustainable management of fish resources.
This is to be enabled by refining and standardising the framework conditions, better controls on the part of the Member States, and simplifying the decision-making system.
Even though Austria, as an inland country, is not directly concerned, the steadily growing consumption of sea fish is influencing fishing.
We need practical and efficient solutions that offer the sector a basis for sufficient viability through good stock conditions, ensure supply to consumers and, at the same time, guarantee the maintenance of species diversity and safeguard the marine ecosystem as a whole.
