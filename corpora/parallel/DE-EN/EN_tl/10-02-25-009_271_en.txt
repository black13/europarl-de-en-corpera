That fishing has a long tradition in Europe, and, one hopes, also will have in the future, is welcome.
Developments in these last few years certainly indicate that working in this sector of the economy is becoming fundamentally less attractive.
The reason for this is that groups of companies with their masses of fish products are pushing retail prices down so far that small fishing businesses cannot compete.
As a result of these circumstances, this sector is increasingly becoming the province of workers from third countries.
On account of the fact that this motion for a resolution does not sufficiently deal with this issue, I voted against it.
