The German members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted differently from the group as a whole on two points.
The first concerns Amendment 3 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
The FDP members voted against, because a radical devolution of fisheries policy such as proposed in the motion with the transfer of powers and responsibility to Member States and to local decision makers cannot be reconciled with the European common fisheries policy.
The idea here is precisely to find common forward-looking solutions at an EU level.
FDP members supported Amendment 33 because it supports the important principle of relative stability, which is important for Germans.
This concerns the basis for quota allocation.
