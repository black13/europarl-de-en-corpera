Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the Millennium Goals is the halving of world poverty.
The Commission declared 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
Sixteen per cent of Europeans - that is 79 million people - live below the poverty line.
Seventy-nine million Europeans have to make ends meet on only 60% of the average income of their respective countries.
If you are poor, you lose the opportunity to contribute to large parts of civil society.
If you are poor, you suffer.
The strategies for the 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion must have an impact, even during the economic crisis.
