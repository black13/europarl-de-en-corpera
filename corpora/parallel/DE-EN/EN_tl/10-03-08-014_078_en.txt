Mr President, once again, I would like to refer to the discussion in the last debate about one-minute speeches, in which we expressed our unease about the fact that it is obviously unclear when it is your turn and that when you have applied five times, it would be nice to know when your turn will be.
Several colleagues submitted this request.
At the time, it did apparently find a sympathetic ear.
I fail to understand why we clearly are not learning from this and trying to make it easier for MEPs and to announce a clear procedure and keep to it.
I put my name forward at 17:00 and cannot quite comprehend the procedure.
