Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to the European Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to compliment the rapporteur who has done a competent job.
The document covers many areas.
In recent years, we have seen a growth in pets and domestic animals and naturally, also the desire to be able to take these animals with us on trips.
That is right and it should be so, as being able to take your pet gives you an increased sense of well-being.
For that reason, however, in Europe, we must have regulations to prevent the spread of animal epidemics.
We have them.
We have very good regulations in Directive 998/2003 and from 2011 we will have the European Vaccination Card, which will accurately document which vaccinations animals have received.
Moreover, from 2011, electronic tagging will prevent confusion and deception.
In recent years, we have done a lot to curb animal epidemics in Europe, especially rabies, also through the achievements of the European Commission, which first pushed through and financed the vaccination of foxes.
That is a very important matter and we should acknowledge it.
These special regulations that are repeatedly approved for some countries are burdens for citizens.
Here, the expense bears no relation to the benefit.
I have received letters from many citizens complaining of annoying behaviour at borders.
Let me just cite the United Kingdom as an example: arriving two days too early in a half-year stay means a EUR 3 000 fine and the animal is quarantined for six weeks.
We should consider whether this kind of behaviour is right.
Therefore, Commissioner, I think one more year, but then this must end.
We have European regulations that apply to everyone.
The risk of disease spreading - if the animal epidemic situation remains as it is, we must always presume that - no longer exists in this form with pets and domestic animals.
