Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to Parliament.
I would like to join my fellow Member, Mr Schnellhardt, by saying you have a major task in this area, to create genuinely equal conditions in the 27 Member States by 2010 so that household pets can be transported and brought from one country to another without obstacles.
Free movement for dogs and cats was certainly the goal of the 2003 regulation.
Now, for the third time, we are making an exception.
In the EU, some things take a really long time: ten years to tune such regulations.
No country in the EU wants diseases to be introduced and I also wonder why 22 countries accept the idea of dogs and cats being allowed to travel with their owners and five countries do not.
You should examine whether the reality and the obstacles still correspond to these special provisions.
I know that there are thorny debates at national level, but we are now one legal space and it is time, by 2011 at the latest, to introduce free movement, the single market for pets.
The animal expert, Mr Schnellhardt, has already mentioned the conditions, namely that there is a vaccination card and that instruments like electronic tagging will be used, which will then give you access to the five countries when you are on holiday or travelling to work and wish to take your pets with you.
This regulation on pets will go down in history.
It is, in fact, the first legal act since the Treaty of Lisbon and we wanted a level playing field with the Council of Ministers in the empowerment of the Commission for delegated acts.
That was an uphill struggle, but it was worth it.
My congratulations to Mrs De Br√∫n for this report and, of course, for this procedure to begin a new era.
That is why it is so important, because we have perhaps a hundred legal acts in a year, but 6 000 delegated acts, and from this we can gauge how important it is to set the new procedure on the right track from the beginning.
