Mr President, the efforts of the European Union to stem or completely eradicate animal epidemics and diseases like rabies are, of course, extremely laudable and it is certainly very positive that measures are being taken to facilitate cross-border tourism with pets.
The European Vaccination Card, vaccination programmes or even the electronic tagging of pets are indeed sensible measures that may make this easier.
However - and I know this from our experience in Austria - there are phenomena that threaten this.
For example, the illegal smuggling of puppies from cheap Eastern European countries to Central Europe or the European Union repeatedly leads to the introduction of diseases.
The mass transport of animals across the EU, including in Austria, could also allow dangerous diseases to reoccur.
Wild animals are furthermore liable to ignore border controls and may, of course, also repeatedly lead to the spread of animal epidemics like rabies.
It will be necessary to take measures in this area.
