Mr President, it is certainly not only differences in consumer protection, but also language differences which, until now, have made package tours to other Member States difficult.
It is already 15 years since the European Union created fundamental basic protection as well as common procedures.
In my opinion, the revision of these procedures must not get out of hand to the effect that they are subject to blanket standardisation in the name of the freedom to provide services.
Travel needs themselves may vary from country to country.
In general, I also consider it dangerous to measure everything by the same yardstick and campaign for enforced conformity everywhere.
If we want travel agents to assume greater liability as travel intermediaries, we must be aware that this may have serious economic consequences.
If we want to avoid killing off small local travel agents with the simultaneous uncontrolled growth of online travel, then the tour operator should primarily be made liable.
The relatively satisfactory protection on package holidays will hopefully reassure those holidaymakers who are worried by the current negative headlines about Greece.
Further announcements of strikes and protests could intensify the tendency to avoid other Mediterranean countries and the price collapse in relation to Greece.
The state's debt crisis guarantees that this will be a critical year for Greek tourism, this we know.
We can expect further strikes and protests.
Hopefully, we will be spared the experience of discovering how travel protection would function in a case of national bankruptcy.
