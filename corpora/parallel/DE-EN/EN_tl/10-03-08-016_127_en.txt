Mr President, I am from Austria, a country for which tourism and the tourist economy continue to play a very important role.
Almost every one of us is involved in an area of tourism in some way or other.
Therefore, this question is rather important for our country and I am very pleased that the Commission is tackling this issue right at the start of the legislative period - and I would like to extend my thanks to the Commissioner in this regard.
Freedom of travel and travel possibilities mean that purely in quantitative terms, there is a very different level of importance than perhaps twenty or more years ago.
The possibilities offered by the Internet have also led to the emergence of a completely different kind of travel behaviour.
It is, however, all the more important that, if they can afford a proper holiday during the crisis, our citizens can also return from this holiday satisfied.
If they should experience a problem, then they should at least get back some of their hard earned money.
It is, of course, tempting to make bookings over the Internet; we know this and it is also cheaper.
However, no traveller will be persuaded that if he books a hotel through a travel agent, he will be treated completely differently from someone who has booked it on the Internet and that, above all, any compensation claims will be handled completely differently.
Finally, another small problem.
Obviously nobody can see that there are divergences in the guarantee, which treat the tour operator completely differently from the airline.
The latter is only liable if its guilt is proven.
Anyone who has already experienced this problem knows that this is a major problem which you can normally only consider tackling with very good legal cover.
I therefore hope very much that the Commission will put a proposal before us which takes these problems into consideration and, above all, thinks of our citizens, who have a right to a trouble-free holiday and particularly at this time.
