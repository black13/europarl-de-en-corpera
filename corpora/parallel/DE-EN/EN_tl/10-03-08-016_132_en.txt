Mr President, Commissioner, I am the mother of a large family and over many long years, have learnt to study brochures.
It is a great challenge, a challenge that sometimes even those employed in the travel agents are not up to.
That is why I would like this new directive to give me real freedom of choice as a consumer.
I will only have freedom of choice when comparability is possible, when I have the criteria to compare different offers with one another.
For me, one of these criteria is the age of the children.
Whichever tour operator we are talking about, there are fixed prices for children.
Sometimes, this affects six year olds, then ten year olds, next time twelve year olds.
With some operators, the first child is not worth as much as the second, and the third and fourth do not exist at all.
It is important for the protection of consumers - as well as for the protection of travel agents and operators - that as a consumer, I know what I am buying, so that I feel really well informed beforehand and have comparable criteria.
