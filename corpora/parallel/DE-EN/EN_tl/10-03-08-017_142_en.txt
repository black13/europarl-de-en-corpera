Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to chip in with a few questions on what Mr Scicluna has stated on behalf of the Committee.
Commissioner, if there are 70, 80, 90 or 100 times as many financial transactions in the world as gross national product, and if this development is becoming ever more dynamic, would you then say speculative elements are, for the greater part, linked to this explosion of financial products?
If so, how do you then plan to curb them, or what might contribute to curbing them?
If short-term financial transactions increase more and more relative to gross national product in the world, do you then share our view that we must strengthen the long-term approach in the real economy, where people work, earn money and manufacture products that we can consume and that we can use.
If you share this opinion, by what way and means do you believe will we then be able to achieve this?
Commissioner, if the tax on financial transactions can make a contribution to this - that is what we want to look into - what would the timeframe be for negotiating this with international partners?
We have the impression that the financial instruments that were created in the world are being used right now to speculate against the euro area and against the euro and to act against the weakest Member States.
Is it not high time now that we dealt with this and define a European approach?
Commissioner, there is one thing I cannot understand, namely why we are urging Member States to raise value added tax by three or four or more percentage points, when a transaction tax of 0.01 or 0.05 percentage points will supposedly ruin competition and weaken Europe's position.
I cannot believe that.
Take action.
That is what Parliament wishes.
