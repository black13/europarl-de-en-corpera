Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the Austrian Parliament and in the Austrian Federal Government, as well as in my party, the Austrian People's Party, there is broad political will to campaign for a financial transaction tax.
The financial and economic crisis has global repercussions, as well as causes, which cannot be reduced to one continent.
We do not need just global governance mechanisms; we need global supervision mechanisms, global regulatory guidance mechanisms and also sources of funding.
However, the question of sources of funding is not enough.
The effects of guidance are equally important.
First of all, we need a common European will, a European project, so we can also be successful globally.
The question to the Commission and the resolution, which I hope Parliament will pass on Wednesday with a wide majority, are an expression of the joint political will to develop and implement - preferably on a global scale - a model for a financial transaction tax.
I look forward to receiving a very concrete proposal from the Commission that will contribute to this solidarity in Europe, and I expect the Commission to present this proposal as soon as possible, as well as an answer to our questions.
What impact will such a financial transaction tax have on the real economy and on the competitiveness of the economic and financial position of the European Union?
What should it be levied on, how high should the percentage be, who levies it and who receives the money?
Should there be earmarking?
I would say yes, but what for?
We must resolve all these matters.
With today's debate and the vote on Wednesday, we are setting the course.
Please give us an answer quickly.
