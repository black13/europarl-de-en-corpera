Mr President, Commissioner, the Single Euro Payments Area is an important, indeed central, instrument of the European single market.
It is thanks to Mr Gauz√®s that we have got it off the ground.
My group is fully behind it and would like to see it working well.
I personally also have nothing against us setting a deadline for the migration, and here to me it is not so much a question of whether it takes three, four or five months as the fact that it then actually works.
Whether it actually works depends on two things.
Firstly the appeal to industry that it must be end-user friendly.
These days, we cannot afford any rumours, any secret resistance, any hankering after the old system.
Therefore, it must be functioning properly, also in respect of those who ultimately have to use it.
Secondly, it must, of course, also work for the benefit of the economy.
Here I would like to mention one point, which is still a bone of contention, namely the matter of how direct debits will be calculated.
Here, the economy does not yet seem to be in a position to propose a sensible model.
There are still snags, there are still sticking points and if the economy is not in a position to present a common model that works within the European Union, then the Commission - as stipulated in this proposal for a resolution - must present a concrete proposal within a certain period of time, let us say before the end of the year.
It should not be the case that we confront the economy and demand a deadline for the migration, but do not take the initiative to remove the resistance that the payment service providers are obviously not in the position to overcome single-handedly.
We need a community initiative here, so the whole thing can work.
That is our approach to the discussion.
