Mr President, it is good that we have the euro.
Small countries like my native Austria would have otherwise come under immense pressure during the financial crisis of 2007.
The other side of the euro coin is, however, the lack of consistency and the lack of accountability, and here there are, of course, some questions for the Commission.
Firstly, who is responsible for the lack of control in the euro system?
Secondly, who is responsible for the fact that the false budget figures from Greece were not recognised sooner?
Thirdly, is it not the case that while we are talking about Greece today, the real problem is Spain?
Fourthly, can the European Commission guarantee that Spain will not submit false budget figures and what is it doing about this?
I demand clarity and transparency and, above all, that those people who bear responsibility are ultimately brought to account.
Only then, when these people are actually made responsible, can we guarantee that the rules of the game will, in the end, be adhered to consistently.
