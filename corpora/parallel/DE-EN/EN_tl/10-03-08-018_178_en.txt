Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with, it is right that common procedures should go with a common currency.
It is right to consider how these common procedures, which have not yet been implemented everywhere in the Single Euro Payments Area, might be enforced a little better.
On the other hand, I will say quite clearly that we still have to adapt the rulebook in a few places.
I myself come from a country where the direct debit procedure is a very widespread procedure, in order to facilitate the processing of certain regular payments.
The procedure that is currently planned in the rulebook is a very bureaucratic, very complicated procedure and therefore, I would be very pleased, Commissioner, if, with regard to a final date - something we all want - this area in particular is tackled once again.
On the one hand, there should be no vulnerability to fraud - that is a problem in the cross-border area - but on the other hand, it should also be possible for local charges to be debited, and for any magazine subscription, any insurance premium, any mobile phone bill, and so on to continue to be collected in a simple procedure by the companies concerned.
That is my request and there is also a corresponding passage in our motion for a resolution on this subject, so that we can contribute to ensuring that procedures that have proved successful in the Member States can also be guaranteed after the final introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area.
