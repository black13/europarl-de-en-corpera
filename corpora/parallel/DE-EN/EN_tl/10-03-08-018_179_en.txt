Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are probably all united in our approval of the answers given by the Commissioner to the question and are grateful for them.
They are in keeping with the objectives of the European Parliament.
Secondly, I would like to say that the method of self-regulation in the banking area that we have chosen for SEPA is a method in which the organs work well and several hundred banks have joined the SEPA area in a very short space of time.
SEPA is part of the single market, it is larger than the euro area, but it is not complete.
I am very much in favour of a consistent, legally binding final date, because I hope that with such a date, we will increase the pressure to take care of outstanding questions and the legal obligation to get consistent implementation off the ground.
This will allow all participants once again to present everything that still has to be done.
A common date is essential to implement the SEPA area as quickly and efficiently as possible and to ensure maximum suitability for the single market.
