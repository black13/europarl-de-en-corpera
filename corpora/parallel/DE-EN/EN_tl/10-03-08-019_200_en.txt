Mr President, the aim of reducing the administrative burden for micro-entities should, of course, receive our full support, as should the aim of preventing micro-enterprises from being thrown into the same pot as the big players when it comes to financial reporting.
However, can this aim actually be achieved with the Commission's proposal or your report, Mr Lehne, and who are we speaking about when we talk of micro-entities?
Mrs Castex has already referred to this.
I would like to take this point further.
Micro-entities are often not so tiny.
In Austria, for example it is not a question of cash-based accounting, but of limited companies, Ltds and limited commercial partnerships and corporations.
Taken together, they account for 90% of all businesses in Austria which employ fewer than ten workers, just to make the relationship here clear.
The downside of limited liability should therefore be the obligation for financial reporting, although not, as mentioned at the beginning, in the same way as for large companies, but we should not abolish financial reporting obligations.
Instead of removing micro-entities from the fourth directive entirely, a diminished requirement for regulation should be clearly determined and established within the framework of the planned revision of the fourth and seventh directives.
