Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of the chairs of the SME cross-party working group.
Many of us collaborated on the Small Business Act.
Hopefully, we all share the wish to put small business first and therefore, we are in favour of simplifications and less burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises.
What we have heard here today, of course, sounds very attractive.
If it is so attractive, why is there not applause from all sides?
Why are there so many different examples, which, despite this 'simplification', are not meeting with enthusiastic applause?
There are reasons for this.
Is the new regulation compatible with Basel II?
For many years, we have advocated common accounting procedures, and now suddenly, we are abolishing accounting procedures.
We want European solutions and simplifications, not national solutions, not legal fragmentation.
The cross-border activities of micro-entities would be hampered.
Freedom from the obligation to draw up annual accounts would not, in fact, mean relief, because in many Member States, we have to collect the same data any way under a different name.
However, the ability to monitor creditworthiness would be made more difficult.
Standards concerning statements on the quality of businesses should also be adhered to by small businesses.
Otherwise, there is a danger of a loss of transparency.
As businesses grow, they must adhere to regulations that may not be open to them as micro-entities and the Member States' freedom of choice in these circumstances weakens the single market.
For these reasons, I am in favour of the revision of the fourth and seventh directives on company law, because this will lead to consistent regulation and relief.
