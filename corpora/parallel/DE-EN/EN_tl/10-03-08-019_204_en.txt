Mr President, my speech will simply be a summary.
Everything has been said, both for and against this directive in its current form.
I believe that nobody here can be against us wanting to reduce financial reporting provisions in order to make things easier for micro-entities.
However, I have the impression that we have stopped halfway or would like to stop and we do not really have the courage to follow things through.
We all know that we will need financial reporting provisions and that even the smallest business will need records to portray and prove the state of its business.
Now that may be Basel II, that may be fiscal records, that may be many things.
In future, new provisions may appear, which perhaps come to us from other countries - from the US or wherever - and which we have to deal with.
However, it must be possible to go further here and to consider how we will continue to handle financial reporting provisions.
It must be possible in an area of competition like Europe to once and for all produce really concrete directives, and notably - that would be my point - not just for micro-entities, but indeed for larger businesses, too.
The effort - I know this from my work as a lawyer - required in order to provide the necessary records and then analyse them with the help of several colleagues is immense in larger businesses, too.
It involves a lot of work and costs a lot of money.
Micro-entities, moreover, cannot afford this effort at all.
However, if we are focusing on these businesses and really want to deal with financial reporting provisions within the framework of the fourth and seventh directives, I ask you to also consider simplifying the administrative burden in general and creating sensible, sound directives.
