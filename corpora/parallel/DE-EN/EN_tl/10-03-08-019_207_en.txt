Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished by the discussion on the part of fellow Members who, on the one hand, speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but who, when it comes to taking the very first step for micro-entities - and that is all we are talking about today, not about any other scale - are already inclined to say no again.
We cannot always demand something and then subsequently say no.
I have spoken with many micro-entities.
They are hoping and waiting for this regulation.
I have spoken to regional banks, who stressed very clearly to me that it would not be a problem for them at all if financial reporting was changed; they use other data any way.
Furthermore, there will be absolutely no change in terms of transparency, because - as the Commissioner has explained - provisions will remain in force so that transparency is also maintained.
Trade will not be affected, because the micro-entities do not have an impact on the European market in the sense of trading throughout Europe.
I call on fellow Members to take this step with us and thank Mr Lehne and the committee for their excellent work.
