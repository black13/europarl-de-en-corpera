Mr President, to begin with, I would like to thank you and the Commissioner for your presentation and I would firstly like to point out that control of the content of the provisions of European competition law is very much in the interest of consumers.
I am delighted that this time, the Commission has, for the first time, included its own chapter on competition law and its significance for consumers.
That is particularly gratifying after a five-year barren spell in the communication of European competition policy on the part of the European Commission.
The difficult phase of the implementation of European competition law, concerning, in particular, the assistance rights and the assistance regulations of Member States for the banks, has yet to come.
In 2008, that was not a problem.
In this respect, the clear message that this report sends out is that the Commission must monitor this very carefully, so that the single market and also European consumers are not adversely affected by it.
In this context, the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises is especially important.
The report is clearly in favour of medium-sized industry receiving special treatment when it comes to the imposition of fines in cartel cases.
The vertical arrangements in the online market are tough in our view, but an assessment, as now proposed following the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, seems premature in our opinion and therefore, we would like to stand by the report of the Economic Affairs Committee.
