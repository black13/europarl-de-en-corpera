Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this joint debate this morning and the high quality of all three reports indicates the high priority given to internal market and consumer policy in Europe.
I would like to thank all three rapporteurs and the many shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members who have produced this joint work.
I would like to focus on two crucial points.
The first is that we, that is, the Commission and those of us in this House, are assuming that everything runs relatively harmoniously in the internal market and that we have enlightened consumers and fair suppliers.
That is often the case, but not always.
There are irresponsible suppliers who only see their short-term profits and therefore, we need stronger market surveillance and supervision.
However, there are also uninformed consumers.
We need better information.
It is not enough for the package leaflet to be readable.
We need continuous information.
Someone has just said that we need confidence.
However, confidence comes from knowledge.
I have heard that in Germany, only one in two 14 to 15 year olds understands the meaning of inflation.
I do not even want to ask what the results of the questionnaire were when it came to the word 'deflation'.
We need schools to be better networked along with information on the conflict between the interests of suppliers and consumers.
That is mentioned in the reports by my fellow Members ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
