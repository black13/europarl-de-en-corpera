Mr President, I would like to talk about proposals relating to consumer protection and would, of course, like to start by mentioning the positive aspects: the means of informing and empowering consumers by providing more information at all levels, from municipal, local and regional spheres right up to EU cross-border dealings, the promotion of the consumer - like we do in Austria through anti-trust law - and, of course, tougher penalties for careless banks that grant ill-considered credit.
A standardised credit form is also an extremely positive move.
However, I would also like to touch on some problematic issues, namely serious prejudice in the law relating to guarantees and improper contractual clauses, which are punished more severely in places like Austria.
I would like to propose that the favourability principle be applied so that, where national rules provide better protection for consumers, these rules should be used accordingly.
