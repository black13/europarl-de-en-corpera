Consumer protection in the European Union must be designed in such a way that citizens can take advantage, within the internal market, of a wide choice of high-quality products and services, while at the same time having confidence that their rights as consumers are protected and that they can exercise them effectively if the need arises.
It goes without saying that, to do this, it is also necessary for consumers to be duly aware of their rights and obligations under the applicable law.
The initiatives mentioned in the report for providing clarification and information to EU citizens are therefore important and must be implemented quickly.
The increasing complexity of the services sector, in particular, presents a huge problem, making it increasingly difficult for consumers to make an informed choice when purchasing goods or services.
The knowledge, as well as the needs, of consumers, which have also been brought up by the consumer barometer, must be taken into account by the EU institutions in their policies and lawmaking.
We should aim for greater harmonisation of consumer protection regulations - and by that I mean an adjustment upwards - on account of the increasing cross-border use of services.
However, in all our attempts to improve the internal market, we must not forget the numerous imports from third countries.
In this regard, we need greater cooperation between the customs authorities and consumer protection authorities in the Member States in order to protect consumers from unsafe imports.
