Mr President, a few months ago, there was not only a festive atmosphere in this Chamber but also a feeling of joy for most people here because the visa regulations were being eased for many countries in Europe.
So, what is the reality?
With the lifting of the visa obligation for citizens from Montenegro, Macedonia and Serbia in December 2009, there was a wave of people travelling from the Balkans, via Austria, to Central Europe and up as far as Scandinavia.
A real migration of peoples!
In just seven weeks, around 150 000 Macedonians have taken advantage of this new freedom to travel, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
Two thirds of these people are not making the homeward journey.
In many villages, particularly Albanian-Macedonian villages, five buses start out every day towards Central or Western Europe, equipped with a tourist visa, which expressly prohibits gainful employment.
This means, therefore, that, after 90 days, these people go underground and the supposed tourists then find themselves once again on the cheap labour market earning 'dumping' wages.
That is the difference between the reality of the situation and the European Parliament's pipe dream.
The consequences of this will have to be borne by our home countries.
They have to suffer the consequences of what is decided by the majority in this Chamber.
They will have to put up with scarcely controllable illegal immigration and illegality and the associated undeclared employment.
