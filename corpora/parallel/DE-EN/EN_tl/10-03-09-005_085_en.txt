Mr President, the visa system of the Schengen countries is apparently so complicated that the consulate employees no longer know what they are doing and are allowing honest visa travellers to fall into the visa trap.
The fact that consular staff are not aware of the visa categories 'D' and 'C' seems rather strange.
It is downright negligent if someone omits a Schengen Information System check to make the work easier.
It is clear that this will create numerous, unnecessary problems at the external borders and this situation urgently needs to be changed.
In this connection, it makes little sense to discuss national visa alert lists if the EU alert system and the EU alert regulations are not even applied consistently.
The liberalisation of visas for the Balkan countries goes hand in hand with an increase in futile asylum applications from these countries.
It is especially important now, when, since the relaxation of the visa regulations for the Balkans, there is a real threat of a wave of immigration, when, within seven weeks, almost 150 000 people from Macedonia have made use of their new freedom to travel and, according to estimates, almost two thirds of them will probably not make the homeward journey, to whip the enforcement of the visa regulations into shape.
