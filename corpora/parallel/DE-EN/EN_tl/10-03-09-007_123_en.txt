Madam President, on the one hand, I can understand it being in the interests of the individual Member States to insist on an extension of the special arrangements in connection with the import of pets.
On the other, however, we must always be careful to ensure that the expenditure is proportional to the benefits.
In this case, we have not managed to do that to a satisfactory extent.
This is why I have abstained from voting.
What we particularly need is, on the one hand, suitably effective external protection with regard to imports within the European Union, but also, increasingly, on the other hand, harmonisation within the European Union, because that is also in the interests of consumers who, after a certain point, can get rather lost if different conditions apply to importing into country A than to importing into country B.
