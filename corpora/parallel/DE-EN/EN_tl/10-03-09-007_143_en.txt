I am very pleased that the European Parliament has today decided to grant EUR 6.2 million in assistance to workers made redundant from the automotive supplier Karmann.
The European Union is thus contributing 65% of the EUR 9 million available in total.
These funds are to be used to offer around 1 800 people additional re-education and training measures to enable them to find work again as quickly as possible.
This is a tangible contribution by the European Union to assisting people during the crisis.
By doing this, the EU is showing very clearly that it is willing and able to provide support even to individuals in crisis situations.
It is important now that the money is made available smoothly and immediately to enable these people to return to the labour market quickly.
However, in addition to this individual assistance for the workers affected, the European Union also needs to take additional measures to deal with the effects of the financial crisis.
Globalisation in the sense of the division of labour at international level (sharing of prosperity) is appropriate and important.
However, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States must work harder to promote fair competitive conditions in their international economic relations in order to avoid disadvantaging individual countries or sectors.
