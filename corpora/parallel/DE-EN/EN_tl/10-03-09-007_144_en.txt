I voted in favour of the report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
In this instance, Germany requested support in connection with redundancies in the automotive industry - specifically in the Karmann Group.
In this connection, it is important to mention that the money from the fund is used for the reintegration into the labour market of individual workers who have been made redundant and not to compensate for any necessary restructuring measures for companies or sectors.
Out of solidarity with our neighbouring country and with the workers, the money that is, unfortunately, made necessary by continuing globalisation and the economic and financial crisis caused by speculators on both sides of the Atlantic, should, in my opinion, be made available immediately.
