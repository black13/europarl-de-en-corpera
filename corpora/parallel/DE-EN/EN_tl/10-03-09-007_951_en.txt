This report contains some sensible proposals, such as the different treatment, within competition law, of multinational concerns, on the one hand, and small and medium-sized enterprises on the other.
However, I do not believe that it is right to deregulate, or not to regulate, retail prices in the telecoms sector.
In general, I consider the tenor of the report, which assumes the absolute efficiency of the free market, to be misguided.
It is for that reason that I have voted against this report.
