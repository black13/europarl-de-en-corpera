This report aims to make it considerably easier for third-country nationals with a long-stay 'D' visa to move freely throughout the Community.
In doing so, it completely disregards the fact that it ought to be within the competence of the Member States to decide whether and which third-country nationals are permitted to enter the country and who should be refused entry.
It is for that reason that I voted against the report.
