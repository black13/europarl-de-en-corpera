Mr President, Mr Barroso, the euro crisis was triggered by incorrect figures provided by Greece.
I would like to ask you whether you can confirm that neither you nor the Commission departments were at any time already aware of the actual figures before the Greek Government submitted the most recent figures concerning its budgetary deficit.
Secondly, can you confirm that the Director General of Eurostat, Mr Rademacher, expressed serious doubts about the data coming from Athens as long ago as 2004 and 2005?
What have you done to help Eurostat collect the data?
Thirdly, is it true that the Eurostat auditors informed you that they had serious doubts about the data provided by Athens?
