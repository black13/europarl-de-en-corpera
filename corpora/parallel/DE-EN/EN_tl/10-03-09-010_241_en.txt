Firstly, Mr Barroso, I have still not received an answer to the question about the need for these genetically-modified potatoes, which are simply intended to provide industrial starch.
There are alternatives available, so why take the risk?
Secondly, there is the contamination limit.
Why suddenly change it to 0.9%?
Up to now, we have talked about the detection limit in this regard, and for feed and food in particular, and in the case of an antibiotic-resistant potato, I consider that to be a high-risk approach.
You have not said anything about this.
I would also like to know whether, in the foreseeable future, you plan to issue further approvals without the availability of the guidelines and recommendations of the EFSA - for imported rice or maize, for example.
