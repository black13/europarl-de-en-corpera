Mr Barroso, last week you presented your proposal for an economic strategy.
It contains important objectives.
The Council has now imposed an austerity programme on Greece, which, in my opinion, makes the achievement of these goals impossible, with one State having 3% of the gross domestic product of the EU.
However, you continue to persist with the failed Stability and Growth Pact.
At the same time, several Member States are calling for a European monetary fund or even economic governance.
My questions are as follows.
Are you going to review your EU 2020 proposal again in order to integrate the idea of the monetary fund and economic governance so as to initiate a move away from tax and wage dumping and from the prevailing competitive ideology?
Are you going to take measures immediately, together with the Member States, to prohibit speculation against the euro by the very banks that have just been bailed out using taxpayers' money?
