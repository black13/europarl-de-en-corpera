I am not entirely satisfied.
The issue is that taxpayers' money is being used to speculate against the Greek State.
Some of this taxpayers' money comes from German banks and it has also been lent out by German banks.
Yet, while we are repeatedly told that some sort of measures will be taken, nothing actually happens.
I am therefore rather disappointed that so little has been done to simply prohibit certain things in the EU so as to put a stop to such speculation once and for all and allow us to genuinely concentrate on growth and employment.
