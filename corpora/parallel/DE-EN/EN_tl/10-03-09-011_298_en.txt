I would like to congratulate the new Commissioner on her first speech.
The communication that you have presented to us is also very interesting.
However, I would now like to mention a couple of shortcomings.
It would have been appropriate for you to analyse the UN process yourself a little more in this initial communication and also to criticise the areas where it has real weaknesses.
As we know, panel 2, in particular, did not exactly employ scientific meticulousness.
Secondly, the two-degree target that we have set ought to have more scientific evidence to back it up and you should now increase your efforts so that we intensify our research into whether this is still possible or whether - as various people are already saying - we should noticeably distance ourselves from this.
Thirdly - and probably most importantly - we now need, in particular, to tackle the crisis in confidence that we are seeing throughout the world and particularly here in Europe.
As you know, there are surveys which indicate that only 30% of European citizens believe that CO2 affects the climate.
Every project that does not take this into account is doomed to failure.
