A very warm welcome to Parliament, Commissioner.
I wrote a letter to the President of Parliament to inform him that all of the delegations in this House have climate protection on the agenda in our discussions with our partners throughout the world.
We need to find another mechanism to enable this information and these results to be linked in with your travels around the world so that those of us here in Brussels and Strasbourg know exactly where we stand.
I am rather concerned that the climate negotiations could suffer the same fate as the Doha negotiations, which are constantly being postponed year after year.
My question is, therefore, what is your plan B in order, perhaps, to achieve results in parts of some sectors?
I also have a question concerning the Kyoto Protocol.
One strategic error we made in Bangkok was to give the impression that we would abandon it.
What would happen if we do not adopt something until 2011 or 2012?
What is the future for the Kyoto Protocol?
