Commissioner, I have two specific questions for you.
Firstly, in your paper, I see no analysis of the European negotiating position at international level.
Have we really taken note of the fact that Europe's influence in climate policy has diminished?
Have we taken note of the fact that the political and economic weight in this world has shifted sharply in the direction of Asia?
Is it possible that we completely overestimated our influence here?
Secondly, your paper is remarkable.
In the twelve pages that you have completely filled, there is not a single reference to the IPCC Panel.
Is that a subtle attempt to distance yourself from this body?
I would like to remind you that this panel formed the basis for all the political decisions relating to the directives that we have drawn up here in recent years.
Is it not time to call for a broad scientific approach that gives us real scientific statements, not political ones?
