The Roma Summit in CÃ³rdoba is intended to be an opportunity to talk plainly about the parallel societies in Europe and this should be based on efficient integration at all levels.
It should be promoted at national as well as at European level.
However, there is one thing that we should not forget in this regard, and that is that, for effective integration, both sides need to work together.
The Roma people must also do their bit for integration and work from the inside to prevent the creation of parallel societies.
In this regard, I am particularly concerned about the school education of children, in particular, of girls.
In the middle of Europe, it must not be the case that children are barely or not at all integrated into the existing school system and then drop out of school early in large numbers.
Their future position in the labour market is jeopardised considerably as a result and they then take refuge on the edge of society to an even greater extent, thereby isolating themselves.
Problems relating to social security and their living conditions are then predetermined and the vicious circle is complete.
It is therefore crucial to appeal to the Roma in Europe to change their archaic attitude to school education and women's rights, to actively fight to combat their own exclusion, and to work to integrate themselves into society and into the labour market in particular.
