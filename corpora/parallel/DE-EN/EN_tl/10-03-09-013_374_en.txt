Mr President, my home country, Austria, subsidises private pension provision by a maximum of EUR 210 per year, although pension speculation has been shown to have been one of the triggers of the financial crash in the United States.
I believe that the Commission needs to ask itself whether pension provision is not actually the quintessential task of the State and whether we should keep a tight rein on dubious financial speculators in this regard.
There is also the question of whether, in the Commission's opinion, it is not short-sighted or even negligent to provide State subsidies for private pension provision without quality standards if there is a risk that, after these enormous losses, the pension recipients will be in even more need of support from the State.
