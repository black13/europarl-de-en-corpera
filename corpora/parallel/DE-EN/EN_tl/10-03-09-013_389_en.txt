During an economic crisis, the danger of social security fraud is particularly great.
Is the Commission aware that, in Central Europe, there is large-scale social security fraud among States with high social disparities?
For example, compensation payments for minimum pensions were fraudulently claimed by EU citizens from nine Member States, with these compensation payments clearly exceeding the actual pensions.
My question is this: does the Commission intend to provide individual Member States with tools that they can use to prevent such large-scale social security fraud?
