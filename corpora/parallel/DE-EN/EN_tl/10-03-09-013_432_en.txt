Commissioner, that last point relates to precisely what I am concerned about.
I would like to ask once again: are there any instruments for positive discrimination in favour of long-standing national minorities?
We should develop strategies for these people in the same way as we do for others.
Secondly, is the Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna also responsible for this and how do they arrange their contacts with civil society?
That is in progress at the moment, of course, but are the traditional minorities also included in this?
There is nothing so unfair as treating unequal groups equally.
