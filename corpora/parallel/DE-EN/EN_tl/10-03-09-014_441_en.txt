Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the Belgian painter Magritte had painted the first railway package directives, he would have written underneath 'These are not directives'.
In fact, the whole debate that we have been having for some time seems, to me, almost surreal.
In 2003, we decided that the transposition should be completed in 2006 and now, in 2010, we are asking why 21 countries are not doing what they themselves have put their signature to.
Liberalisation was intended to allow new players onto the market.
That was the theory.
In practice, things look rather different in this regard, too.
Today, we are in a position in which - whether we are for or against liberalisation in this area - we have to assess this liberalisation and we are faced with the problem that it has largely not been transposed.
The companies themselves - as we have seen in various countries - have made decisions in the name of liberalisation relating to staffing and technology that were not always pleasant, even though this liberalisation had not been transposed.
In the light of this, we have to conclude that, seen in this way, historical beneficiaries of the railways still hold the keys to the opening of the market in their hands - access to the tracks, technical interoperability, training and certification, to give just a few examples.
With these keys, they can open the door to an open market, but they can also close it.
That has been the case in most countries and it is still the case today.
Therefore, the proposals that you have made here and that we have briefly looked at represent an initial step.
For me, in order to correctly assess liberalisation, it is important that we quickly carry out implementation or enforce it using the means available to the Commission or means that it still needs to grant itself.
