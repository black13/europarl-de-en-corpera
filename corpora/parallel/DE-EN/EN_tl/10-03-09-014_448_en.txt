Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the review of the transposition of the first railway package and the planned recast.
I believe that this review is long overdue.
However, I regret the fact that the Commission is receiving no, or only insufficient, information from the Member States.
That makes an efficient and honest assessment extremely difficult.
However, it is not only necessary to make an assessment.
We also need to urge the Member States to actually implement the necessary steps.
In any assessment, it is essential that importance be attached to the subject of safety.
Have we learned from the recent negative experiences and will these be taken into account?
That is my question.
On this issue, the Commission is far too reticent towards the public, who are extremely concerned.
This applies to quality, too.
I would like to ask the Commission to consider how generally binding quality criteria can be set.
A great deal has been said about inadequate quality, but it is not possible to measure this reliably.
The lack of investment, which you have already mentioned, Commissioner, is also regrettable.
Despite Cohesion Fund cofinancing, in most countries, investment in roads is still significantly higher than in the rail system.
I would like, in this context, to mention ERTMS - this system categorically must be introduced across Europe for the network, but also for the rolling stock, in order to improve route safety.
I would warn against further steps in the direction of the planned liberalisation of national passenger transport.
The initiatives already taken in this connection have shown that there are still many hurdles to be overcome and that the Commission would do well to first of all carry out a complete technical harmonisation and ensure the thorough transposition of the directives adopted.
