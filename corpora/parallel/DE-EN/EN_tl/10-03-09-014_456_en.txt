Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me simply tell you about a personal experience.
I live on an important rail route - the route via the Brenner Pass to Verona.
The Italian national railways have been neglecting both goods and passenger transport here for years.
Austrian railways now travel this route five times a day.
However, no timetables for this are provided at Italian railway stations, nor do they issue tickets.
Now, the reconstruction of this route at a cost of around EUR 20 billion is currently being considered and the European Union has also invested a lot of money in this.
So we can see how absurd things sometimes are in this area.
It is not always the very big things that make the issue complicated; sometimes it is the small things.
For this reason, Commissioner, I urge you to take decisive action here, to impose sanctions and to actively ensure that the Commission's directives are complied with.
