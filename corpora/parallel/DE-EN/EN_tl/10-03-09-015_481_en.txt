Mr President, Mr De Gucht, more than a year ago, the European Parliament asked you, the Commission, very clearly to make the negotiations on the ACTA Agreement transparent in future and to involve the public and the parliaments in these negotiations.
We also urged you to retain the narrow focus on anti-counterfeiting, as indicated in the title of the agreement.
What have you done since then?
Nothing, absolutely nothing.
On the contrary, together with your so-called unholy coalition of the willing, in particular, the rich industrialised nations, you are negotiating an agreement by means of highly undemocratic, even illegal, secret diplomacy, and in many areas, this agreement clearly goes far beyond the current regulations for enforcing intellectual property law in Europe.
Of course, we cannot be certain of this because we have received no information from you.
However, the actual scandal is yet to come.
As of 1 December of last year, in many areas, you will no longer be able to ignore us and conduct your back-room politics with the Council, because the citizens - represented by their Parliament - have, quite rightly, finally put an end to this behaviour through the Treaty of Lisbon.
I therefore ask myself, what are you actually doing in this regard?
As the Commission, you are the guardian of the treaties.
You are therefore responsible for ensuring that the clearly-formulated EU Treaty is actually complied with.
If you are not able to guarantee full compliance with the treaty, then you will once again receive a 'no' from this House.
If you do not believe that you can guarantee compliance with the treaties in these negotiations, then please stop the negotiations until you can do so.
Therefore, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance says: act now.
Act on ACTA!
