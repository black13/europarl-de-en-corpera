Mr President, Commissioner, during the hearings of the new Commissioners, transparency was one of the words that was used the most.
You have said again today that everything is already transparent and open.
I have to tell you honestly that this definition of transparency is, unfortunately, not one I can go along with.
This is clearly the case for a large number of my fellow Members here in this House, too.
Transparency is more than simply throwing out a few bits of information and saying 'Well, unfortunately, we cannot disclose the rest because we have promised someone that it will all remain confidential'.
We have entered a new era.
It is no longer possible to use international treaties to make blind agreements with trade partners that will then affect European legislation down the line.
Now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon in place, that is no longer possible.
That means that blind agreements, as well as the secretiveness and the lack of transparency, must stop at the doors of the European Parliament.
We need credibility for the protection of innovation that you are putting forward here as the main argument.
However, you will not achieve credibility if you negotiate everything behind closed doors and then try to console people by saying that it will not be so bad after all.
That, Commissioner, is the wrong way to go.
