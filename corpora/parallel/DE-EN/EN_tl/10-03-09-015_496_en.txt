The European Commission's negotiations relating to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have raised a few questions.
Although the agreement deals with justified concerns, namely combating the counterfeiting and smuggling of products and brands, it needs to be more firmly based on our European principles.
It must not lead to the harmonisation of copyright law, patent law or trade mark law in the EU - on the contrary, the principle of subsidiarity must remain our most important principle.
Trade agreements must not be misused in order to curtail the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.
Before Parliament can give the approval that is required for the ratification of this agreement, significant improvements still need to be made, and not only in terms of content.
Parliament must be involved to a greater degree in the negotiations and the negotiation documents must be made available to us in full.
