Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), the European Union is currently granting market access by way of reduced import duties to 176 developing countries.
These are benefits that we as the European Union offer without expecting anything in return from our partners.
There is also GSP+ for certain countries facing particular challenges and for those that fulfil special conditions.
What is our starting position?
We will need a new regulation from 1 January 2012 onwards because the old one will have expired.
We need time for a proper procedure that gives us the opportunity to have two readings.
On behalf of my group, I therefore expect the Commission to submit a new proposal as quickly as possible.
As I said, we need sufficient time for a procedure with two readings and it would be unacceptable if we, as the European Parliament, were to have to take dubious decisions under pressure.
We also need an evaluation of the existing system.
I hope that we will very soon receive facts, figures and data that reveal how successful the existing system has been in practice.
Has the existing system really facilitated trade for the States that benefit from it?
Have the export figures also risen?
Are the right countries benefiting from this system?
I will throw this question out to everyone here: is everything in order with the existing system?
For example, if countries like Qatar, whose per capita income is higher than that of 25 Member States of the European Union, are included in the GSP system, I am certain that we need to take a very critical look at this when reviewing the whole system.
There is one thing I would ask of my fellow Members from all of the groups in respect of the vote tomorrow: we should keep the resolution very general, as agreed in the original draft.
I would be very grateful to my fellow Members if we did not mention in the resolution the specific cases that have been discussed.
