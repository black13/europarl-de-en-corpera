Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that GSP is a good system and that GSP+ is a very good system.
We also need to ensure their extension and so we need your proposal so that we can have a proper debate in Parliament.
So, Commissioner, please speed things up.
Even for GSP+, we may be able to introduce a few improvements.
In this regard, there are five points that I would like to make concerning areas where we may be able to make further improvements.
Firstly, who determines how the 27 standards are actually implemented, not only recognised in practice, but formally implemented?
Is that the task of the ILO alone, or do we not need an assessment committee to provide specific support during implementation?
Secondly, how are we involving civil society?
I would like to see the coordination of civil society in the country in question in the assessment of the implementation of GSP+, just as we have now agreed in the agreement with South Korea.
Thirdly, who actually initiates an investigation if any problems are detected?
Parliament needs to be involved here, because I have the feeling that, in the Council, interests other than actually having an investigation carried out come into play.
Parliament should also initiate an investigation in this connection.
We surely also need clear structures for the next steps that we are to take as well as clearer structures for withdrawal, but perhaps we can talk about this in detail another time.
