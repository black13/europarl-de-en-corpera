Mr President, GSP mainly grants trade privileges to developing countries and emerging economies.
This modern kind of development aid from tariff reductions to tariff relief on the markets of the industrialised nations has achieved a great deal.
The GSP+ special arrangement is intended to bring about the implementation of social and environmental standards.
It is also the reason for the increase in the signing of UN and ILO conventions.
However, Commissioner, how does the Commission control the implementation of these criteria?
Is the withdrawal of privileges carried out consistently when goods are exported that have been produced by forced or slave labour, when dishonest trade practices are discovered and when no control of the originating products is guaranteed?
Moreover, should the improvement in human rights that is intended to be achieved through GSP+ not also ultimately include larger States?
I am thinking of China, for example.
All of our resolutions, the demonstrations and the bilateral negotiations between the EU and China have brought no improvement in the human rights situation.
As a result, hundreds of thousands of people will take to the streets tomorrow, the International Tibet Memorial Day, and Tibetan flags will be hoisted in ten thousand cities and communities in the European Union.
We will express solidarity with the people who are fighting for their cultural, linguistic and religious autonomy.
Commissioner, do you share the view that human rights standards, social standards and environmental standards need to be removed from the special arrangements and incorporated in the list of GSP criteria?
Cooperation with our trade partners must not be restricted to purely economic concerns.
