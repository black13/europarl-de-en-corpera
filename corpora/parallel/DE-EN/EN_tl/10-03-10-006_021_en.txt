Mr President, the fact that only very unspecific foreign policy goals were defined in the Treaty of Lisbon is coming back to haunt us now.
There will probably also be a price to pay for the fact that, in Baroness Ashton, we have a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy without any real foreign policy experience who was foisted on the Union as the lowest common denominator that the Member States were able to find.
If we keep silent on all the important foreign policy issues, we, as Europeans, will be able to achieve just as little as a bunch of diplomats, who shake hands all over the world whilst professing different courses of foreign policy.
The disagreements about a European External Action Service, too, are something that we cannot really afford.
This undoubtedly important new service should not and must not be run down, over the heads of the Member States, into a sphere of activity for Eurocrats.
It is probably time that we chopped our way out of the undergrowth in the establishment of this European External Action Service and that the EU was heard again in the outside world.
It is also time that the new High Representative acted in a more sensitive way in respect of these matters, including, for example, in using all three working languages of the Union - thus including German - in the European External Action Service.
We must make the best use of the experience and good relations which individual Member States have with certain regions.
Think, for example, of Austria's historical experience with the Western Balkans.
In so doing, it must be clear that Europe's security is defended not in the Hindu Kush but on the external borders of the EU in the Balkans.
The EU must stop acting as the extended arm and the funder-in-chief of NATO and the United States.
European money is definitely better spent on FRONTEX than in the deserts of Afghanistan.
