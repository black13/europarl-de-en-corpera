Mr President, let me briefly address two issues.
First of all, the duty to provide assistance is clearly not compatible with Austria's neutrality, and for that reason, it would be important to include the following points in this report.
It must be stated, firstly, that the duty to provide assistance is not legally binding, secondly, that the use of military means is not necessarily required and, thirdly, that the individual Member States retain the freedom to decide what the assistance they provide actually comprises.
The committee did not accept this, primarily from a content point of view.
In my opinion, the very way in which this was rejected also demonstrates a serious lack of respect.
I ask for more respect from you, Baroness Ashton, for us Austrians in this very sensitive area.
My second point concerns the minority report.
The quality of democracies and societies, of course, is demonstrated time and again by their treatment of minorities.
For me, it is a very, very good thing that we have this option of a minority report.
I do not agree with all the points in it, but I am very pleased that Mrs LÃ¶sing did make use of this option.
(Applause)
