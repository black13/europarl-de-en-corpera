Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly congratulating my two fellow Members on their reports, which have formed the basis for a very good debate with excellent results.
There are a few guiding principles that I would like to mention.
Firstly, on the common foreign policy: unfortunately, we currently have a many-voiced image of the European Union.
High Representative, I would like to ask and call on you to make sure that we help achieve and indeed ensure that Europe speaks with one voice.
That is highly necessary if we are to achieve a pan-European alignment.
Secondly, it is right that transatlantic relations have been mentioned.
In the diplomatic field, in the economic field, in security policy and in defence policy, we do need a close partnership with our colleagues in the United States, but as equal partners on an equal footing.
It must also be the case that citizens' rights and security issues be dealt with on equal terms, as Parliament ultimately impressively demanded in relation to the SWIFT Agreement.
My third point is that it is right that the Western Balkans are an absolutely crucial factor in the European security and foreign policy of the future.
We need to give these States European perspectives.
That means politically stable relations, personal safety and economic development.
A European External Action Service should and must - and Parliament is on your side in this regard - help to achieve all of this.
We perceive this European External Action Service to be a service for Europe and not for the Member States, for the institutions, European thinking and working, not for other interests.
Parliament will be on your side on this issue.
Of course, I also support the German Foreign Minister, who is demanding that German should be one of the working languages of the European External Action Service.
