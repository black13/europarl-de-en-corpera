Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, yes, we need a common foreign, security and defence policy, but let us use it to obtain a world free of nuclear weapons.
We know that that will not happen overnight; we have been fighting for this for too long to think that.
However, perhaps we can succeed, together with Presidents Obama and Medvedev, in bringing this goal a crucial step closer.
I also welcome the fact that, according to its coalition agreement, Germany's Federal Government intends to ask for the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Germany.
That would represent a clear and unambiguous signal.
We also welcome the fact that the Secretary General of NATO is to hold a comprehensive debate about bringing the overarching goal of a world free of nuclear weapons closer without having to neglect security interests.
That, too, would be a crucial step forward.
Baroness Ashton, I believe that, together with a well-structured External Action Service, there is much that you will be able to achieve.
I am therefore full of hope in this regard and I have to say that, in many commentaries that we have to sit through in this Chamber - in particular from a so-called parliamentary group from the United Kingdom - the quality in this House has really suffered terribly.
