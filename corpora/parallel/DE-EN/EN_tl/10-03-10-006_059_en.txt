Mr President, Madam Vice-President, today you are sitting on the other side.
If you switch round every month, that will be fine by me.
As this debate draws to a close, a number of primary evaluations have become clear.
We want you to be at the head of an External Action Service in which you - as a fellow Member said earlier - wear both hats at the same time.
These two hats should be the only duplication, though - duplication in the structures is not something that we need.
The retention of the Community method must be ensured, not only in relation to the budget and EP supervision.
To be quite clear about this, the new service must not be the exclusive toy of the Foreign Ministers, who feel insulted that they will no longer be included in the European Council.
The same applies to the appointment of the staff and the filling of important positions within the service.
When it comes to the Danjean report, I would like to give my full support to the line taken by the rapporteur.
When it comes to the permanent operations centre, like Mr Van Orden, I have noticed that Baroness Ashton has moved on this issue since her hearing and, I must say, in the right direction, too, as I see it.
You have moved from rejection to a test phase.
I still believe that, if we are to operate civilian and military mission planning in a fully integrated way in the External Action Service, it makes sense to also run that service from its own operational headquarters.
With regard to the proposal from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to establish a Directorate-General for peace-building, I would say that, in contrast to my fellow Members who sit at the left-most edge of this Chamber, I believe the entire EU project, and specifically also our foreign policy, is a unique peace-building project.
On that basis, I am not sure that we should be restricting this to a single department.
