Mr President, comprehensive reports usually require differentiated evaluations, and this is true in this case, too.
Thus, I am in favour of a common foreign and security policy that deals with illegal immigration, visa fraud, criminal tourism and bogus asylum claims.
I am also in favour of a common foreign and security policy that deals with securing the borders of the Schengen area and clearly taking the bit between the teeth in the fight against organised crime.
However, I am critical of, and opposed to, a common foreign and security policy that is designed to give the EU an active role in military issues, where the UN and NATO are already in place.
This duplication should be rejected - and, of course, I speak from the special position of being a representative of a neutral State.
I also reject the lifting of the visa requirement, an ill-considered lifting of the requirement for Balkan States whereby already, after a few months, around 150 000 Macedonians are en route to central Europe, two thirds of whom have already disappeared into illegality.
This is certainly no way to further the security needs of European citizens - it makes no contribution to security and it also, of course, does nothing to increase our citizens' desire for more Europe.
