Mr President, I would like to propose a vote on an amendment to this motion, which I will now read out.
'Calls on the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, the Council and the Member States to overcome the imbalance between civilian and military planning capabilities', and delete the rest, because the rest has already been included in the text.
