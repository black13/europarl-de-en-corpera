Mr President, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) delegation in the European Parliament today voted against the resolution from several groups to implement the recommendations of the Goldstone report.
You cannot vote in favour of a report for which the very mandate was highly controversial - not one single Member State of the European Union had given its backing.
A report that equates democratic Israel with a group officially listed by the EU as a terrorist organisation and a report that fails to give reasonable consideration to the deeper causes of the conflict is not one that we can vote in favour of.
Our voting choice does not mean, however, that we would reject an investigation into the events connected with Operation Cast Lead.
The opposite is the case, in fact.
Israel should indeed thoroughly investigate all aspects of the operation, and if violations of the law did take place, they must be punished.
Our voting choice likewise does not mean that we would endorse the policy of the government of the State of Israel in the peace process.
We have been very pleased to see signs that talks are again taking place between Israel and the Palestinians, albeit indirectly for the time being.
US Vice-President Biden's visit also shows that the Obama administration is serious in its efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the region.
It has our support in those efforts.
That makes it even harder to understand Israel's snubbing of the Vice-President, with the building of further settlements in the West Bank being approved while his visit was still going on - a measure that drew thoroughly just criticism, and not only from the Palestinians.
