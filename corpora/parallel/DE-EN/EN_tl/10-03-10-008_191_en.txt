Today, I voted against the Lehne report, as I believe that the reduction in administrative expenditure for small and medium-sized enterprises must take place as part of a uniform and comprehensive approach for the whole of the European Union.
Were this proposal implemented, more than 70% of European companies - indeed more than 90% in Luxembourg - would be exempted from the requirement to produce standardised annual accounts.
As a result, an important decision-making tool for the responsible management of the affected enterprises would be lost.
If the Member States did not implement this exemption for micro-enterprises in a uniform way - which is highly likely - this would lead to a fragmentation of the common market.
This measure is thus inappropriate.
Those companies that carry out cross-border trade, in particular, would be put at a disadvantage.
The only sensible solution is to simplify the rules for all micro-enterprises in Europe on an EU-wide basis.
