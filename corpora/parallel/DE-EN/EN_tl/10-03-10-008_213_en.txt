In the context of the EU 2020 strategy, agriculture will play an important part in Europe's future success.
Particularly when it comes to sustainable growth and employment, and when it comes to climate change, European agricultural policy is highly significant, as it has an indispensable role to play in retaining jobs in rural and peri-urban areas.
We should not forget, furthermore, that agriculture supplies 500 million Europeans with high quality food, provides 40 million jobs and is responsible for an annual turnover of approximately EUR 1.3 trillion.
The production of renewable energy provides additional jobs and helps to reduce CO2 emissions and the dependence on fossil fuels.
Agriculture is innovative, creates value and is the real source of sustainable regional economic cycles.
European agricultural policy must therefore be given greater consideration in the context of this new strategy.
