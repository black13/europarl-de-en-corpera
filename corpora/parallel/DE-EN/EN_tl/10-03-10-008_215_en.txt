The objective of the European Union's future strategy is to accept current and future challenges and to master them as well as possible.
In the context of the EU 2020 strategy, the agricultural sector, in particular, will play an important role in relation to the new, EU-defined challenges such as protection of the environment and the climate, renewable energy sources, biodiversity and sustainable growth and employment, specifically in rural areas.
Europe must be aware that around 40 million jobs depend on agriculture, directly or indirectly.
The top priority, however, must continue to be the security of the supply of high-quality foods for 500 million Europeans, in particular, against the backdrop of the doubling of food production by 2050.
European agricultural policy must therefore be given greater consideration in the context of this new strategy.
