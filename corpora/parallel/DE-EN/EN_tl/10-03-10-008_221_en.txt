The question of where the EU should be in relation to employment and economic development in 2020 is of key importance.
Especially in times of economic crisis such as these, the EU 2020 strategy should act as the engine driving us out of the uncertainty.
That makes it more important to choose the goals in such a way that they can actually be met.
The policy is not an end in itself but has the purpose of creating realistic programmes that the population and the economy can keep pace with.
The sustainable economy must be a major point in shaping the immediate future.
This is an objective that we must attain step by step, not least because of climate change.
The issue of the security of raw materials, too, will, in future, concern Europe more and more, for which reason we should be paving the way for the sustainable use of resources now, and pointing European policy in this direction.
