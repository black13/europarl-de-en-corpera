Today's joint motion for a resolution on the Goldstone report once again gives expression to the EU's striving for a fair assessment and review of events during the conflict in Gaza.
On 26 February 2010, both sides were once again called on by the UN General Assembly to carry out credible investigations and to submit further reports within five months.
The Palestinian authorities have now instituted an independent investigative panel, which is very good news.
The European Union's actions on the international stage must be focused on strict compliance with the principles and objectives of the UN charter and of international law.
Similarly, compliance with international humanitarian law and the norms of international human rights law by Israel and by the Palestinians is a material prerequisite for the peace process, which is to lead to two States, coexisting in peace and security.
With this resolution, the EU is attempting to prompt the attainment of a settled common position on the measures resulting from the report by the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the conflict in Gaza and southern Israel led by Justice Goldstone.
The report also argues for publicly advocating that the recommendations of the report should be implemented and that responsibility should be assumed for all violations of international law, including imputed war crimes, for which reason I voted in favour.
