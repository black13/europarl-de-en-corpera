This report attempts to position the EU as a stronger global actor.
In so doing, however, it does not give any clear specification of objectives or direction to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).
The demand for a stronger financial footing must therefore be rejected, given this context.
In future, international engagements should, in fact, be assessed for how sensible they are and their benefit to the EU.
Ultimately, a strategy-based approach should be developed in the CFSP.
I feel I must roundly oppose the objective of abolishing the principle of unanimity.
This is particularly the case if, as has been stated several times, the aim is to have a closer partnership with NATO.
The EU must manage to create its own structures, and must, of course, have the necessary resources available for such structures.
When it comes to the numerous operations and missions, many of the current 23 different actions in which the EU is involved should be reconsidered.
In Afghanistan, in particular, the strategy followed there under the leadership of the United States is to be regarded as a failure.
The EU's involvement should therefore be reconsidered without delay.
In the context of the Eastern Partnership, it is worth pointing out, once again, that Russia's interests must be taken account of for historical, cultural and geographical reasons, and that unilateral action by the EU should be avoided.
Since the report does not really take this into consideration, and because it is also deficient in other areas, I voted against it.
