Mr Danjean's report into the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the common security and defence policy is very comprehensive and deals with numerous topics that are important for Europe.
However, there is a lack of a clear focus on the fundamental shaping of EU foreign policy over the next few years and also a lack of a strict policy line.
On the one hand, the report seeks to strengthen the EU's autonomy in respect of other global players, in particular, in respect of the United States, through having a strong foreign, security and defence policy, and this is something that I welcome.
Yet the report again comes out in favour of strong cooperation between the EU and NATO and wants, for example, to create joint institutional structures.
The call for a White Paper to be drawn up on the common security and defence policy (CSDP) which clearly defines the objectives of the policy is thus more than advisable.
Much as I am critical of the increasing centralism of the European Union, I do support the creation of a permanent EU operations centre.
Such a centre would enable us to both plan and execute diverse operations more efficiently.
In addition, avoiding duplication of work would also lead to cost savings.
The solidarity clause in connection with natural disasters that is referred to, like the establishment of a European civil protection force, is undoubtedly worthwhile and something that we should indeed strive for.
Nevertheless, in the light of the unclear position in various areas, I was forced to abstain from the vote.
