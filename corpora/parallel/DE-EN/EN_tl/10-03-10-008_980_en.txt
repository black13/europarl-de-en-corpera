The joint motion for a resolution on the Goldstone report expounds the European Union's wish for an investigation of the events surrounding the conflict in Gaza fairly and in detail.
On 26 February 2010, the UN General Assembly, too, once again called for an investigation within five months into the incidents and the alleged serious human rights violations.
According to the latest information, so far, only the Palestinian side has complied, which is a great shame.
In my opinion, the European Union must actively go in to bat in international organisations and committees for compliance with and the implementation of international law.
That very respect for compliance with international humanitarian law and the norms of international human rights law by both parties in the conflict would be a basic precondition in the Middle Eastern conflict for discernible progress in the peace process, which could now suffer a serious setback, once again, as a result of Israel's planned settlement construction.
The joint resolution calls for the recommendations of the report by the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the conflict in Gaza and southern Israel led by Justice Goldstone to be implemented, for which reason I voted 'yes'.
