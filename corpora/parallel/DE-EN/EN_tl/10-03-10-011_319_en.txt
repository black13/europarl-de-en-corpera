Mr President, Madam Vice-President, many thanks for having opened the debate here on this subject, which I think is an important one.
Those who are participating in this debate here today will share this view, and I think that we will also be able to achieve a very large consensus in the debate.
I am the rapporteur for a report that is still to be drawn up on this subject, and I would very much like to work closely with all those involved.
You mentioned a number of key words.
Protecting the environment is very important.
You mentioned the resident populations, the resources below sea level, and also fisheries.
Another key word is shipping, the shipping routes that climate change is opening up: the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage.
In the vicinity of these passages, alongside our three Arctic Member States, are, of course, at least two global players - the United States and Russia - as well as a major partner in the shape of Canada.
These States are the immediate adjacent territories with whom we must, at all events, build up and improve our contact in the context of this policy, which we are now aiming to develop.
Where raw materials are concerned, specifically, we have the potential for cooperation - but there is also the potential for conflict if we do not approach this in the right way.
The EU will certainly not be planting its flag on the seabed, as the Russians have done.
We should, however, seek dialogue with these affected parties in order, in this way, to be able to achieve, in a consensual manner, those things that are important for the region in terms of environmental protection, the extraction of resources and the rights of local residents.
