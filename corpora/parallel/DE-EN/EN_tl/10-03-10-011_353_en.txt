Madam President, if, in future, methane, with its considerably higher warming potential than CO2, is emitted from the Arctic Ocean in greater quantities as a result of the thawing of the sea bed, we will have a highly dangerous new variable in the sensitive climate system - a variable that urgently requires closer investigation.
The Arctic is not only a concern with regard to the climate, it also involves something of a potential for conflict.
The fact that even China has supposedly now begun building icebreakers highlights the importance of a trade route via the Northwest Passage as the ice sheet melts.
This potential peaceful use, however, is far less problematic than, for example, the intensified desire of the United States to station military early warning systems in the Arctic region.
The conditions for any conceivable economic exploitation of the mineral resources linked to the melting of the ice should also be clarified in advance.
Ultimately, the suspected oil and gas reserves to be found there could guarantee Europe's energy independence.
