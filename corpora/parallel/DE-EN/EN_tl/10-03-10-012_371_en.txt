Madam President, the death of the dissident Orlando Zapata as a result of a hunger strike and the arrest of the blogger Yoani Sánchez, who told the world about day-to-day life in Socialist Cuba, make clear that we must continue with the link established in our Cuba policy in 1996 with progress on democratisation and human rights.
Hopes for progress under Raúl Castro, of course, have long since vanished into thin air.
The situation of political prisoners, for example, has not really improved.
They still do not enjoy anything like the freedoms that the Castro brothers themselves were afforded during their imprisonment during the Batista dictatorship.
With its stubborn adherence to the planned economy, Cuba is no longer even capable of meeting the most basic needs of its own population.
In Cuba, prosperity and self-initiative are clearly regarded as criticism of the regime.
In that regard, even the people of Communist China have things easier in that they can at least improve their lives through their own efforts.
The relaxation of the United States' economic embargo in respect of computers and software services will not be entirely able to meet the expectations that the public has drawn from President Obama's promises, but it will perhaps make it possible for the opposition to be better organised.
Not least, it will also be harder for the Cuban regime, with increasing choice, to suppress the free expression of opinion.
For this reason alone, we should support Europe's initiatives as best we can and push for further relaxations in the Communist system.
