Madam President, we should make a tangible offer to the people of Cuba, and also to the island's regime: in place of the political status quo, we will fund a transition to democracy in Cuba.
The first step must be the release of all political prisoners.
In parallel, the United States should end its sanctions, which have helped to cement the regime in place rather than to overcome it.
The next step should be for a round table composed of representatives of the regime and of the civil rights movement based in Cuba to draw up a schedule for the transition to democracy and for democratic elections.
Incidentally, Central Europe shows that there is still a future for the former State party - even for that party, then, there is life after the death of the old system.
We, as the EU and as Member States, should support this process in a similar way to how we did in Central Europe.
Doing so would help the Cuban people, stabilise the region and would also pave the way for a new kind of relations with the US that would not represent a repeat of the pre-Castro era.
