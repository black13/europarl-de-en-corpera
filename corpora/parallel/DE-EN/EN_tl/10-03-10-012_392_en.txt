Madam President, for us, it is relatively easy to talk, when human rights violations take place elsewhere and people are also dying for their beliefs.
It is important to make this point.
Mr Zapata really has lost his life as a result of his hunger strike, and there are also other prisoners who have now been prompted to go on hunger strike.
We need, therefore, to give specific thought to how we can move forwards in a targeted way.
Some have said that we absolutely should not talk to Cuba because the regime there is unacceptable to us.
Others - and I do not think this position is a good one at all, Mr Ferreira - have expressed the opinion that there is hypocrisy here and that the people of Cuba should be allowed the freedom to make their own political decisions.
I believe that the freedom to make political decisions really stops where human rights are violated and people die.
In those circumstances we, as the European Parliament, must do something.
Against that backdrop, it is absolutely right for the specific proposals that have been laid on the table - not least including a few new suggestions from Mr Gahler - to be discussed in detail and for us to consider what we can do to intervene against human rights violations all over the world and to help the people of the world.
