Madam President, as we are discussing our relations with Cuba here today in the shadow of the tragic death of Orlando Zapata, we must acknowledge that the view that we have had of Cuba does date from a time when our thoughts were defined by a friend-or-foe framework.
We had, on the one hand, the bad Cubans who were vassals of the Soviet Union intent on pursuing international revolution and, on the other hand, the good Cubans, who rescued the country from the grip of the sugar barons, the mafia, the CIA and US imperialism.
On one side were the bad Cubans, the Communist oppressors of the people, and on the other those who provided the population with education, medical care and an end to their hunger.
Today, if the death of Orlando Zapata is to make sense - if death can ever make sense - we should, at all events, take this legacy very seriously.
This death must not be in vain.
The other thing that must happen is that the EU must pursue clear routes, dedicated political routes, and must not allow us to be put under the yoke of the States; we must be free of the old ideological encumbrances and we must be on an equal footing in the political dialogue and push for there to be clear improvements in the human rights situation so that we will soon be able to talk of a free Cuba and the people of the island will be able to live in democracy.
