Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, advocate compliance with human rights in Europe, as well as in other parts of the world.
Mr Zapata's death is a cry for help from a person drawing attention in a very tragic way to what - at least for him - was a completely unbearable situation.
I want to see us, as Europeans, take a clear stand for compliance with the human rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, irrespective of the political situation.
