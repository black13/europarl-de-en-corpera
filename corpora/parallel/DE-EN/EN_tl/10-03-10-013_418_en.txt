Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, you did briefly mention that domestic violence is, of course, not only directed against women, but also against children, and domestic violence is also an issue in relation to the care of the elderly, as a result of excessive demands.
To what extent will these areas of domestic violence, too, be included in the remit of the planned European Observatory of Domestic Violence?
