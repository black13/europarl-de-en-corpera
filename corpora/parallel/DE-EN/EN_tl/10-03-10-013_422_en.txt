Thank you, Minister, for that sound and exhaustive reply.
I just have two brief follow-up questions.
Firstly, to what extent does the Danube Strategy relate to the fields of transport and culture?
I think both of these are particularly important when it comes to cross-border cooperation.
Secondly, is there already a final list of the countries included or is that still to be decided, as Parliament has proposed an expansion?
