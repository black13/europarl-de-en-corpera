The Danube is a river, and with rivers you also have to pay attention to how clean they are.
I would therefore consider it important to find out what purification plants and what wastewater treatment plants are being considered in order to improve the quality of the river water accordingly.
For us, the goal would be for the Danube to be of drinking water quality from its source to its end.
My second question is how can hydropower be better utilised for energy generation, but also, and above all, for the storage of water, so that we obtain greater security of supply in Europe in relation to energy?
