I would like to bring up the two most critical points one more time.
The first concerns democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
These are the biggest deficiencies.
How intensive is the dialogue on these critical points?
We have the feeling that developments in this regard are going backwards rather than forwards.
My second point concerns energy security.
How, specifically, do things stand in the energy negotiations?
