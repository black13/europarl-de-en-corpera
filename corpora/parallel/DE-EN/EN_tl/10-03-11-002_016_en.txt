Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in principle, we all agree that the SET plan is to be welcomed.
We agree about large tranches of the content, but we have two problems.
On the one hand, we will not be able - and I very much address this point to Mr Turmes - to build up pressure together on the Member States and on the Commission if we continue to hold an ideological debate where the subject is always nuclear energy.
That is the sticking point in today's votes.
We have reached a compromise on the SET plan, and that compromise is that we have specified the criteria according to which we want to support this, and those criteria are clearly defined, namely sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply.
We have said that we want to work without limitation to specific technologies and we are again having an ideological debate about nuclear power, which is a discussion that can be held, but which ultimately makes no sense in the context of the SET plan.
I concede to you in respect of the question of what the SET plan can actually achieve.
Has the question of to what extent the Member States are prepared to find a coherent energy policy approach actually been resolved?
What the Council has put in place today is a series of platitudes.
The problems, really, are not so much what we lay down in the SET plan, but how the assorted funds for research, innovation and the money from the SET plan, the issue of demonstration facilities, the issue of the transposal of European directives at national level - how all of this interacts.
We are currently at a point where we have to say really clearly that we can produce another SET plan and that we can adopt another SET plan, but what we need now are tangible measures.
That being the case, we should not always be arguing over the details.
We should increase the pressure on the Commission and the Member States so that something happens in terms of implementation.
