Madam President, I will keep my question short.
In the groups, we had hackneyed debates - but justified ones - about ideological issues in the context of technologies.
Let us for once, however, come up with a question together that the Council and the Commission must answer.
We discussed the SET Plan for a long time.
What are the instruments to implement it?
What are the time frames?
What undertakings are there from the Member States?
