Madam President, I am not going to deal with the issue of ideology at this point - we can do that another time - but I do think that the ideologists, really, are on the other side of this Chamber.
The Commission will have two tangible instruments in its hands over the next few weeks.
The first is the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility, which still has some money in it.
This money could now be used for a renewed push for renewable energies and energy efficiency.
I have been told that the Commission's Directorate-General for Research is blocking the money - it does not want to spend this money on energy but would rather spend it on ICT and other areas.
Perhaps the Commissioner has something to say in this regard?
The second instrument consists of the 15% - at least - of the funds that are apparently still left in the Economic Recovery Plan, and we, as Parliament, have established that this money must be spent on energy efficiency, in particular on Smart Cities.
Can you also tell me anything about this, Commissioner?
