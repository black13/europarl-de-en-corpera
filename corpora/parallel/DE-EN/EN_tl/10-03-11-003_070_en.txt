Mr President, Commissioner, in October last year I had the opportunity, as part of a delegation from the Committee on Regional Development, to see all the wonderful things that are being done with EU funds on Madeira, for which reason I, too, feel personally very affected by this disaster.
I want to express my sympathy to the family members affected, but also to those who, in the space of just a few hours, lost everything that they had spent their lives building up.
At this time in particular, the European Union is under the microscope, and the Solidarity Fund was set up for precisely this kind of difficult situation, as the people of Madeira and France now need not only our sympathy but also, more than anything, our financial assistance.
The disaster in France and on Madeira has also been intensified by the fact that people have perhaps been too ambitious in their attempts to control the natural world and have attempted to lead their lives by overruling the laws of nature.
The fact that that is not possible in the long term has been demonstrated very painfully here again.
What this means is that all funds must be used in such a way that they guarantee security, prevention and sustainability, and there must be special attention paid to this.
