in writing. - The recent storms across Madeira, parts of Spain and France took a heavy toll with over 40 deaths on Madeira, another 60 in France, countless missing persons and extensive property damage.
Managing natural disasters is an opportunity for Europe to prove its added value.
Rapid and uncomplicated cooperation between European partners is required in order to counter the dramatic consequences of the storm Xynthia and the devastating torrential rains.
The Solidarity Fund and other EU financial instruments can at least make it possible to tackle the economic damage of the disaster more quickly.
However, the organisation of disaster prevention must always remain in the hands of the Member States, who are best placed to deal with their national circumstances and thus to react most rapidly in emergencies.
In order to prevent future storm damage, the Commission should support the Member States in their efforts to produce effective emergency plans and tables of risks.
With the march of climate change and the dislocation of water cycles that that promotes, it will not be possible to completely fend off even fiercer storms in the future.
However, the damage that such storms cause can certainly be reduced with better prior planning.
