Mr President, given the devastating consequences of the 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile, you have to concede to the mayor of Concepci√≥n that 24 hours is an eternity for anyone lying buried under rubble.
Even though the authorities and the rescue services in this Latin American country are undoubtedly well set up for possible earthquakes, the help for the more than 2 million people affected did not get to all parts of the affected area early enough because of logistical problems.
Troops who were already late in getting there were swamped by the chaos.
The population was forced to flee to its rooftops and set up roadblocks not only out of fear of aftershocks but also out of fear of criminals.
Chile may be prosperous enough to care for those affected by the earthquake by itself, but, thank goodness, it swallowed its pride and asked for help, including from the EU.
There will be lessons that we, too, must learn from this, however, namely that in emergencies the veneer of civilisation soon peels and that 24 hours can be too long.
In this spirit, emergency plans and the coordination of assistance efforts for emergencies should be made more effective, including within the EU.
