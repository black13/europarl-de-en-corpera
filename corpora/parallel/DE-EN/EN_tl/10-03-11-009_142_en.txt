in writing. - I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on Cuba, as it is important for the EU, too, to clearly express the idea that there is an urgent need for democratisation in the country, which is still under Communist rule.
The incarceration of dissidents and political opponents is a typical feature of Communist States, but it is excessively practised in Cuba.
The fact that the authorities are not even permitting the family of a prisoner who has died as a result of a hunger strike to organise a burial is a particular scandal.
It is to be hoped that a change of political system on the island will be achieved as soon as possible.
Irrespective of that, however, it is important for the EU and also the United States to apply the same standards everywhere.
It is unacceptable for the US to grant Cubans who are embroiled in bomb attacks 'political asylum'.
You can only express effective criticism if you yourself meet the criteria set.
