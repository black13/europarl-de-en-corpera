in writing. - On 20 February, a serious natural disaster with torrential rainfall on an unprecedented scale, in conjunction with a powerful storm and very high waves, hit Madeira, killing at least 42 people, with many people still missing.
In addition, hundreds of people have been left homeless.
A few days later, the devastating storm Xynthia passed along the French Atlantic coast, causing nearly 60 deaths, in particular in the regions of Poitou-Charentes, Pays de la Loire and Brittany.
There, too, there are many people missing.
Thousands of people have also been left homeless.
I therefore supported the measures proposed in the joint motion for a resolution for the EU to come to the aid of these countries and regions financially, for which reason I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution.
In particular, it must be ensured that the Union's Solidarity Fund is mobilised promptly and flexibly.
