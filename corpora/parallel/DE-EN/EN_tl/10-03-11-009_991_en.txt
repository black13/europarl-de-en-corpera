in writing. - I abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution on 'Investing in Low-Carbon Technologies' as, although it contained a number of reasonable approaches, it supports the further development of nuclear energy, which is something that I reject due to the major risks associated with it.
The motion for a resolution rightly points out that research has had too little funding hitherto.
However, so that Europe remains competitive in respect of other global players, the funding of research projects must be massively expanded, especially in the field of the new energy sources.
The development of new, low-carbon technologies in the energy sector will, I hope, not only safeguard the existing jobs in this field but will also create many additional highly qualified jobs.
However, I believe that, in this respect, the investment should be made in the fields of solar energy and carbon capture and storage.
Given the potential for grave consequences, the investments in nuclear energy must be re-thought and redeployed.
This new policy direction in energy issues will also improve the security of energy supplies within the EU and institute a more robust independence from foreign suppliers.
