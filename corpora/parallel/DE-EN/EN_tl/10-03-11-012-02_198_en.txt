Mr President, the images of the brutal use of violence on the open street in the so-called war on drugs in Mexico reach us regularly via the mass media.
The murder of hundreds of women, mostly workers in the north of the country, is making headlines and has spawned the term 'feminicide'.
The European Parliament has produced its own report on this.
Despite knowledge of the major increase in serious violations of human rights, the Mexican Government appears to be unable or unwilling to do anything about it.
Pointing out the necessary relentlessness in the fight against drug dealers is no substitute for consistent government action.
The major expansion of military presence and power, the competence of military courts for crimes committed by soldiers, the almost complete impunity - these are the real causes of the escalating violence in the country.
Even the Mexican national human rights commission has repeatedly documented the increase in violent crime by the military.
The government itself does not want to admit the situation.
It also continually hushes up crime.
Yesterday, for example, there was a story going around in the media that the Ministry of Defence had paid out an awful lot of money to the families of victims of violence in order to buy their silence.
Who were the perpetrators?
They were soldiers.
The EU must address the fight against impunity in all its relations with Mexico.
Given the severity of the human rights violations, it is absolutely necessary for the EU not to update the Global Agreement with Mexico.
It must not do so until there has been a substantial improvement in the human rights situation in that country.
