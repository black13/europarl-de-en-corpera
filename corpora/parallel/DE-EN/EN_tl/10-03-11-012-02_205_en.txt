Mr President, we often discuss dictatorships in this House.
Mexico is not a dictatorship, but a democracy.
We are debating individual cases of serious humans rights violations.
For Mexico, that is not the key subject.
The key subject is the fact that this large democracy, which is a strategic partner of ours, has been suffering from a serious, perhaps even fatal illness for decades.
It therefore requires the right treatment and the right doctor.
President Calder√≥n and his comrades-in-arms are that doctor.
That does not mean that they are capable of using, or allowed to use, every treatment there is, but we must support them.
That is why I believe that paragraph 12 in the resolution, in which we state that we intend to make greater use of our financial instrument to reinforce good governance, the rule of law, the structures of a State under the rule of law against the disintegration of the State, against organised criminality, against that impunity, which has been quite rightly criticised, is so important.
We cannot do that, however, by freezing or abandoning our contacts; rather, we must strengthen them.
