Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of States around the world still, in this day and age, conduct or permit this inhumane kind of punishment for serious criminals.
I believe that nobody has the right to decide about the life or death of another person, be it at the beginning or the end of that life, and certainly not in connection with punishing a criminal act.
This barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world.
The unforgettable, great Pope John Paul II pointed out that, above all, atonement, the chance for reconciliation, must be possible.
With an irreversible act such as the death penalty, that is not possible.
That is why, as parliamentary groups, we are joining forces to call on our colleagues in South Korea to take up this subject in their parliament and to join with us Europeans to campaign for the abolition of the death penalty, as a mark of humanity.
I would like to call on all Members to support this joint motion for a resolution unanimously.
