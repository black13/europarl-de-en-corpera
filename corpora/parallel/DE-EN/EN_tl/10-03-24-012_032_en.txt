Mr President, it is rare for me to agree with the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission.
However, when they both call for solidarity with Greece and warn of renationalisation, then I can only agree with them, because what they say is correct.
Moreover, recently in Strasbourg, we heard Mr Barroso thinking aloud as to whether the worst of the speculation on the financial markets should be banned outright.
The increasing social chasm in the European Union and within the Member States can no longer be overlooked by anyone, yet the pressing issues associated with this are not on the agenda of the Heads of State at their first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
The debate on the EU 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda.
As you are aware, my group is not at all keen on this strategy as it has been drafted by the Commission, because it is based on the failed ideology of competition which led to the crisis.
We want a strategy for Europe that gives social and ecological needs priority over competitive interests.
EU 2020 is miles away from this.
It is quite something, however, when individual members of the Federal German Government turn up and thunder against the few binding goals of the EU 2020 strategy, such as for the employment quota, for research and education and for combating poverty - and that in the European Year for Combating Poverty!
I hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of the Heads of Government.
