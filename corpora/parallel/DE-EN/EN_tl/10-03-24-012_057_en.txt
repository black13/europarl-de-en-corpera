Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek crisis is a current problem, while the growth crisis and the environmental crisis are long-term problems, and both need to be tackled dynamically with decisions taken by the European Council.
The Europe 2020 strategy rightly states that growth should be intelligent, sustainable and inclusive.
When I look at the Council's conclusions, however, I see that they are much more narrowly focused and reduced to the classical growth strategy - a strategy that has failed and that did not get us very far.
Growth cannot be intelligent if it is not sustainable and it is also not intelligent if it is not inclusive.
That is why I would like to ask the Council and the Presidency of the Council to ensure that this triad, these three pillars, are retained.
This is the new development that really should be implemented now.
I am very pleased that growth that saves on resources and on energy is to be a flagship of the European Union.
Of course, we have been talking about this for a long time.
This will actually help us to save costs, reduce dependencies and solve a series of problems.
I expect the Commission to provide us with a roadmap in the course of 2010, as it is a shared responsibility of the EU itself but also of the Member States, and many areas are therefore on very soft ground and very vague.
Above all, we must make the target of 20% energy savings binding.
This efficiency target must thus be made legally binding so that everyone knows where things are headed and industry can also realise the relevant investment.
