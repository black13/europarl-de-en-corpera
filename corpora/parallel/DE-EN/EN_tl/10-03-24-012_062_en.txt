Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, enough has been said about Greece - I want to turn to the future now.
With the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission has brought an important document into the discussion, one that is intended to lay down quite broad guidelines for how the European Union should be led in future.
I believe that, in the end, we will all need to attain the joint targets that we are laying down in the Europe 2020 strategy.
That was one of the major problems with the Lisbon Strategy, on which, ultimately, we all have work to do.
Only if all the Member States truly stick to the targets laid down in the strategy will we be able to achieve these targets together.
It will not succeed if the European Council believes itself to be the administrative body and if things are organised at the last minute.
It will only succeed if those working in this institution truly realise the political leadership role that it has to play.
Furthermore, it will really only succeed if the principle of solidarity is fundamentally laid down in this Europe 2020 strategy.
That means, first of all, individual responsibility on the part of the Member States in all those areas where they, themselves, are responsible.
This includes reform efforts on the labour market, but it also includes national budgetary policy.
Conversely, this also, of course, means an obligation to assist on the part of the other Member States - in other words, Member States that have got into difficulties through no fault of their own will also receive assistance.
What is more, it will only succeed if the Commission takes the lead politically.
In other words, we absolutely must avoid the mistakes of the Lisbon Strategy.
It has often been said in the past that the strategy of cooperation that characterised the Lisbon Strategy failed.
We need clear objectives from the Commission, and I believe that Parliament will support the Commission in this area.
