Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the euro, the debate about Greece, has defined recent days.
I would like to draw your attention, at this point, to what strikes me as a disturbing piece of news, namely that 40% of Germans now believe that the introduction of the euro was a mistake.
We have to be disturbed by that, because the introduction of a Community currency is not a one-way street.
Europe's integration process is not irreversible.
I believe that we must keep the promise that we gave the German people when they gave up their national currency, namely, that the euro would be just as stable as the German mark.
I am also firmly convinced that we in Europe need a discussion about the social market economy, about the regulatory framework.
We should not be talking about how we are making Germany less competitive.
Instead, we should be discussing how we can make the whole of Europe competitive so that we can be successful on global markets.
That is what our aim must be; that is why I am calling for a debate on the social market economy in Europe.
