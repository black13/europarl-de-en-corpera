Madam President, I agree with everyone who feels the need, at this point in time, for stronger European integration, especially in the economic field, and I hope that that will not only be discussed at the euro area summit but also actually at the European Council.
However, the truth is that the population does also - and my fellow Member mentioned this just now - see negative sides to the euro.
There was a birth defect when we launched monetary union in terms of having a single currency whilst, at the same time, failing to shape economic policy more jointly.
We must now acknowledge that that was a major mistake.
The voice of reason tells us that a solidarity fund - for Greece too - must now be set up so that Greece can obtain lower interest rates.
There has, however, been too little mention in this debate of the fact that Greece itself must also do something.
One important element would be for it to cut back on its military budget.
An EU Member State that spends more than 4% of its gross national income on military expenditure, on armaments from countries such as Germany, France and others, is not what we need in the European Union, and so it is right that there should be cuts in this area.
