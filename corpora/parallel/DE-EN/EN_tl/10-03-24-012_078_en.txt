The economic and financial crisis, and Greece, require European action.
An end needs to be brought to the public arguments.
We await a joint answer from the summit.
We say 'yes' to the Greek Government's savings and reform programme - Greece is firmly resolved to do its homework and comply with the European rules.
We also say 'yes' to loaning money where the reform programme would otherwise be threatened.
We do, however, say a definitive 'no' to fines and to expelling a country from the euro area.
All that would do is to institute a domino effect that would lead to a loss of confidence by the markets.
We also say 'yes' to Commissioner Rehn's proposal for prior approval of the draft budgets by the Commission.
Budgetary and economic data must be inspected by Eurostat and the Commission.
I demand a strict review of the books in all the Member States based on a joint list of criteria.
The tax systems and those tax rates relevant to the internal market must be harmonised, the economic, budget and social policies coordinated.
I demand a 'Europe 2020' planning committee involving the Commission, the Member States, the European Investment Bank, the European Central Bank and Eurostat.
I therefore call on the Heads of State or Government to put a joint European willingness to act unambiguously on the record.
Greece is an example that Europe must learn from.
The conclusions must be drawn at the local, the European and the global level.
More European collaboration and less national egoism are the order of the day.
