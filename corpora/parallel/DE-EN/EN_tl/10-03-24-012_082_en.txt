The EU can only succeed if we know what direction we want to take when it comes to the economy and social policy.
For that reason, particular attention must be given to the drawing up of the 2020 strategy.
The Member States must produce clear concepts, visions and ideas.
Producing a strategy for the next 10 years is certainly an ambitious undertaking, but it should be remembered that this is not about the final details.
The EU needs to ask itself where it wants to position itself and what priorities it is going to set for itself.
One objective which, in the long term, would also yield positive social and economic consequences, would be to create a sustainable energy mix for Europe.
A rethink is necessary in this area, and not only because of the ever dwindling supply of fossil fuels and the impact on the climate that non-renewable energy sources have.
Europe must also take on the leading role when it comes to environmentally friendly technologies.
In my view, however, nuclear power is little suited to leading Europe into a sustainable energy future.
