Mr President, in designing this instrument, we have an enormous responsibility to bear, as the hopes of citizens who think European and who want to push and assert European concerns at European level are riding on us.
We must avoid those errors that are currently looming in relation to petitions at all costs.
We need to avoid the European Citizens' Initiative becoming just a wailing wall where there is no follow-up to the complaints made.
Active citizens are awaiting the result; they are waiting to see what form we give to the initiative.
If we set the hurdles too high, we will be frustrating a major potential for Europe.
Think about it.
It will take an enormous effort for interested parties in a particular subject to collect a million signatures.
If these are then thrown straight into the bin without being properly dealt with and without the proper follow-up, then we have probably done democracy in Europe a disservice.
It is therefore of particular importance how the Commission deals with this concern.
For me, this is the key issue.
