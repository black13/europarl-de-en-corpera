Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who has brought one of the first citizens' initiative petitions into being, specifically, on the subject of protecting Sundays.
Today, we have the pleasure of debating - and then deciding upon - a potential way of involving the citizens in the process of Europe's political work.
That means that this is a potential way to bring about more democracy and to counter Europe-fatigue.
That said, I am not here just to give praise.
Rather, I have two requests to make of you, when you now take this Regulation into its final phase.
Firstly, we Europeans are technologically advanced people.
I would like to ask you to make the Internet the definitive medium so that a citizens' initiative with a million signatures is also admissible with electronic signatures, which are also legally binding.
Secondly, I would like to point out that what we are doing here is just a first step.
I would like to go a step further.
We now have a right of initiative for the citizens.
It would be my wish, however, for us to also have referendums, as we have in my home region of Bavaria, at the European level in future.
What happens is that there is a petition for a referendum, then, when enough people have put their name to it, there is the possibility of a referendum.
It would be my wish that we should also have this in Europe.
