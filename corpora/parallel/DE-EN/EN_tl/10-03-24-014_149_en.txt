Madam President, recently, we have heard time and again of serious violations of human rights in Tibet, of torture, of cases of arbitrary arrest and detention without trial.
When the occasion of the 50th anniversary celebrations of Chinese rule in Tibet is used to espouse a view of a liberation of the Himalaya region, it is a little bit rich!
This shows, once again, that history is written by the victors and that there is always great invention in the justification of acts of war.
That is also an art, by the way, that is being exploited in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and one in which the United States has also found some support amongst a few Member States of this Union.
Nonetheless, we must still, in my view, continue our efforts to obtain better living conditions for oppressed minorities such as the Tibetans, the Uighurs and the Mongols.
It is not enough to offer minority rights in the form of purely folkloristic performances for foreign tourists.
I believe the fact that, over recent years, China has spent approximately EUR 15 billion on developing the region and that, in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games, it also stated that it was willing to hold talks, shows that international pressure absolutely can bear fruit.
