Madam President, I will go straight to the Commissioner for clarification.
For me, Tibet is an occupied country, and I believe that many other Members in this House, across all the groups, share this view.
Even you, Commissioner, cannot render international law null and void.
I believe this to be a concern that really pulls on the heart strings of every European citizen.
Everyone knows of the sorrows and the cultural genocide in Tibet, and everyone feels sympathy, and it is only right to ask the important question: where is the EU in all this?
We are very quick to judge small countries that commit transgressions.
We react strongly, and we pass our judgment on small countries very quickly.
Yet, when it comes to judging large countries, economically important countries such as China, we are very careful politically.
We tread on eggshells, both politically and diplomatically.
It is no sign of courage and backbone for us to tear into the minor offenders only to screw our eyes shut when it comes to China.
We are likewise unable to put pressure on China through millions in development aid.
I therefore expect the High Representative...
(The President cut off the speaker)
