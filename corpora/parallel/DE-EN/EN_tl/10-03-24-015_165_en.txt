The next item is the one-minute speeches in accordance with Rule 150.
Rule 150 states that we may spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this item.
We had more than 74 requests to speak under this item.
That will clearly not be possible.
Thirty minutes and 74 speakers for one minute will simply not work.
Therefore, we have, for the first time, selected in advance the Members who will be granted speaking time using clear criteria, namely that those who requested speaking time in another debate with one-minute speeches but did not get chance to speak will now be granted speaking time where possible, whereas those who have already spoken in other debates will not be granted any speaking time.
All of those who have not been granted speaking time were informed of this in advance by e-mail.
Therefore, they do not need to be here to wait in vain for their speaking time.
I hope that you understand that.
This was the only possible way to enable the debate to proceed in an orderly manner.
Therefore, those who have been granted speaking time can now begin straight away.
