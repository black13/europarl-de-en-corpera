Madam President, around ten years ago, the then 14 other EU Member States imposed their so-called 'sanctions' on my country, Austria.
For seven months, there was an 'ice age'.
Austrian ministers were no longer permitted to take part in informal Council meetings, but Austria was still allowed to continue to pay fees as a net contributor.
Apart from sanctions, there was also a result.
The independent report from the Wise Men clearly established that the Freedom Party's involvement in the government did not pose any danger to democracy and human rights.
The conclusion was that the EU sanctions that were disguised as bilateral measures had no valid legal basis.
They were an unwarranted encroachment on Austrian sovereignty.
I do believe, however, that the EU learnt from this to have respect for the political opinion of others and for the national sovereignty of the Member States and their citizens, and that is certainly a good thing.
Moreover, in view of the peace in the east, I also hope that one of the main investigators, the current MEP, Louis Michel, will feel that, after ten years, he can once again go to Austria on holiday.
