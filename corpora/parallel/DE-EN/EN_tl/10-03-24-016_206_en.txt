Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the priorities for the European Union's 2011 budget revolve around the economic and financial crisis.
Associated with this are the positive joint efforts to implement an exit strategy that is as comprehensive and socially just as possible.
I would like to concentrate on two aspects.
Firstly, a central element of the 2011 budget is the focus on young people.
They will certainly play a key role in Europe's future.
Investment in youth means thinking today about the Europe of tomorrow.
Secondly, the current situation demonstrates very clearly how quickly jobs can be destroyed, even in a strong economic area.
The 2020 strategy also focuses on innovation.
The hopes that are legitimately associated with this will create new jobs and alleviate the social difficulties.
