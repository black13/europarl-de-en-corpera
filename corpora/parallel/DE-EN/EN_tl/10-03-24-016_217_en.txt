Mr President, we need a different EU and we also need a different EU budget.
I think we need the courage to make big decisions.
We should certainly not get bogged down in minute technical details.
I would like to say three things about the EU budget.
Firstly, we need transparency where the EU budget is concerned.
How high is administrative expenditure, for example?
The current EU budget does not provide any realistic information on this.
My second point is about savings.
It is very easy to save billions in the EU budget without reducing the quality of the services provided by the EU institutions.
For example, we could shut down a large number of the EU's agencies.
Then there is the second seat in Strasbourg.
We should perhaps discuss the usefulness of the bodies that lack an area of competence, such as the Committee of the Regions or the Economic and Social Committee.
Thirdly, how is the money used?
The money should be given, or given back, to where it comes from, namely the taxpayers.
Of course, we should also use it to support sound projects - I am thinking, for example, of a genuine Erasmus programme for trainees.
I think we need courage.
We would all do well to take note of this.
