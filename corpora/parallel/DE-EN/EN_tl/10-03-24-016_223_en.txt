Mr President, I would like to refer to heading 5 and to the buildings strategy in particular.
A medium and long-term successful buildings strategy is important.
It needs to be environmentally friendly, energy efficient and particularly cost effective.
We also need to have an open discussion about how sensible it is to have three working sites for the European Parliament.
The horrendous expenditure for the different sites can hardly be justified to EU citizens and taxpayers, particularly during the economic crisis.
It is time we had a detailed and thorough cost analysis carried out and made it available to every EU citizen.
The European Parliament should therefore concentrate on one seat, and, personally, I would prefer Strasbourg on account of its historic and socio-cultural bridging role and, in particular, on account of the fact that Brussels is sinking into crime, parts of the city are descending into anarchy and the police have given up.
Even municipal politicians like the Mayor, Freddy Thielemans, admit this.
