Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the production of high quality produce is fundamental to European farmers.
I am in no doubt that there has be to a link between the quality of the product and the origin of the raw materials.
I therefore consider mandatory quality labelling to be an important opportunity for our farmers.
Quality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European food producers.
The production of high quality foods has a long tradition and is often the only employment and sales opportunity in many rural areas with limited production alternatives.
In order to guarantee this high quality standard, controls and objective criteria are certainly needed.
However, the fact is that financial considerations on the part of the consumer also have an effect.
Quality costs, and farmers need a fair income.
Nevertheless, consumers have the freedom to opt for an attractively priced product, although they often decide on a product that is not of such high quality.
One thing must be clear, however, and that is that consumers must have this freedom and they must genuinely be able to make a decision on the basis of objective and transparent criteria.
We also need to raise the general awareness of consumers in this regard.
We need protected geographical indications and designations of origin.
We need the introduction of a regulated and protected designation for products from mountain areas and from GMO-free areas.
However, we also need the 'Traditional Speciality Guaranteed' and 'Organic Farming' indications.
Whatever happens, these must be retained.
