Madam President, many thanks once again to the rapporteur for his excellent report.
High quality agricultural products provide European agriculture with a major location advantage, allowing it to hold its own in the face of international competition.
As a result, they play an important part in the development of rural areas within the European Union.
The European Union's agricultural products already meet high quality standards.
European standards have a global reputation for being very high.
Unfortunately, not all consumers are aware of this.
It is therefore important for the European Union to improve its quality policy and, at the same time, improve its information policy.
This will be an incentive for producers to focus more on quality and food safety.
Consumers have a right to enjoy agricultural products in the EU without concern and without compunction.
Voluntary 'Made in the European Union' labelling and mandatory regional labelling, as well as mandatory proof of origin, are not mutually exclusive.
On the other hand, when it comes to packaging sizes and the geometric shape of agricultural products, we need to take a sensible approach.
The purpose of the European Union is not to be concerned about the curvature of cucumbers.
The same applies to the size of pizzas.
I would seriously warn against overregulation here.
If we want regional economic cycles, we need to focus on quality and not on degrees of curvature.
If the industry wants uniform cucumbers in uniform jars of uniform weight, that is up to the industry and not the European Union or the European Parliament.
Therefore, let us focus on quality and not packaging units.
In this regard, I trust in the common sense and wisdom of the European Parliament and of our new Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Ciolo≈ü.
