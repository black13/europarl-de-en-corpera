Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing quality logos and mandatory designations of origin for food, we must not forget that our political decisions need to be implementable in practice.
I cannot see how Amendments 4 and 5 can be implemented in practice and I will therefore be rejecting them.
Quality logos should, in principle, be viewed as beneficial if they are voluntary.
They give producers and processors of goods the opportunity to be successful in niche markets.
However, we need to take account of the fact that, through the market dominance of a few chain stores, many voluntary private logos are interpreted as quasi standards.
This robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers.
There is a similar situation with regard to the mandatory indication of the place of origin for agricultural products, such as milk.
Implementing this requirement in agriculture and in the processing industry would scarcely be possible from a technical point of view.
We need to be careful that good intentions do not descend into excessive bureaucracy.
