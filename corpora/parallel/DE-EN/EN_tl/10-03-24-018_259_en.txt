Madam President, the control of foodstuffs is a utopian fantasy.
The pressure for control and the consequences are, too, it seems.
We are thus in a right old stew!
In the case of health risks, authorities should put out warnings, but they are not obliged to.
We have seen the result of this recently in the listeria-contaminated cheese scandal.
Food inspectors often have to battle with deficient labelling - and it is not only the inspectors; consumers have the same problem.
They are completely overwhelmed by the labelling jungle.
For example, 'farmer' can be stated on the packaging, even though the product has been industrially processed, or it might say 'of Austrian origin' even though the ingredients come from all over the place.
Quality-conscious customers are prepared to pay more for high quality foods.
The question is for how long, if rogue traders are also operating in this area.
If control systems are geared to small holdings and hardly any attention is paid to what large eco-holdings are doing, then something is wrong with the entire system.
