Madam President, Commissioner, you said today that products with a designation of origin are a spearhead for our industry.
You are right about that.
It is particularly true of products that are produced under difficult circumstances, for example, in mountainous areas, and which require higher margins.
The designation 'mountain produce' is therefore particularly important.
I would like to address two points.
I think that, with regard to these products, we should give farmers the opportunity to organise themselves into inter-professional committees and support consortia where they can also take market decisions.
That would not contravene competition law and, if it did, it would, in any case, be a much smaller contravention than the concentration of chain stores we have seen over the last few years.
With regard to quality standards, about which much has already been said, I am aware of the discussion in the press and also the talk about curved cucumbers.
However, producers want and need these rules.
We should take that into account in our debate and also in the vote tomorrow.
