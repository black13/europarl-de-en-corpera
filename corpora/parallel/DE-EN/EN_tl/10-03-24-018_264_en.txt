Madam President, Mr Scott√†'s successful report is very much in the interests of consumer protection.
The safety, including from the point of view of health, of agricultural products really must be a top priority.
I would like to point out the key importance of improving designations of origin for foods.
Every agricultural product in the EU must be clearly labelled with the origin of the raw materials.
Consumers must not be duped by fraudulent labelling.
Take China, for example.
Imported seeds arrive in Austria and then the so-called 'pressed seed oil' is sold there.
Worse still, fattened animals are transported across Europe under deplorable conditions in order to produce so-called 'Tyrolean bacon', for example.
We therefore need to focus on regional supplies, and, in the interests of our consumers and our farmers, we need to support local farmers and small butchers.
