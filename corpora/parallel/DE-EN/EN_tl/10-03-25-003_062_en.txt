Mr President, Mr Trichet, I would like to thank you very much for the part of the report which warns against excessive cuts in wages with the aim of reducing deficits, because low incomes result in a fall in economic growth.
I want to thank you for this paragraph, because I believe that this not only slows down economic growth and reduces the competitiveness of Europe, but also restricts the opportunities for European citizens to play a full part in society.
It is essential for us to draw up our budgets according to the guidelines, but it is equally important for the Member States to have room for manoeuvre in an economic and social context.
If we have a Europe where there is no longer any investment in education, health and research, we will also have a Europe that is unstable and cannot compete with the rest of the world.
Those groups which are not responsible for the crisis must not now be made to bear the cost.
If we do not invest in people, we will not have a future in Europe.
This is why I am calling for the emphasis to be put on the social aspect in future.
