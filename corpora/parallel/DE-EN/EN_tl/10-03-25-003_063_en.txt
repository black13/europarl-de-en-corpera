Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current economic and financial crisis, which is also a structural crisis, is forcing us to impose long-term controls and to introduce cautious budgets.
Globalisation is compelling the euro area to play an effective role with regard to financial policy.
However, this must not happen at the expense of the ordinary citizens and I would like to remind everyone that caution and responsibility are needed.
