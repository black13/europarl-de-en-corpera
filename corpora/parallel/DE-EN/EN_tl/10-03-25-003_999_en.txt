In the context of the European Central Bank annual report, I would like to highlight the disturbing change in financial policy which has resulted in far too many dollars being printed without it being possible to come anywhere near covering their value.
The accompanying current or forthcoming devaluation of the dollar by the United States as part of its currency reform programme would have a severe negative impact on the European market.
In order to avoid this risk, the European Central Bank and other European institutions should seriously consider moving away from the dollar as a key currency.
The euro is much stronger, and famous economists, such as Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz, have said that the leading role played by the dollar has been the cause of many financial crises.
The European Union should stop exposing itself voluntarily to the problems of US financial policy.
