Mr President, thank you very much.
We have two amendments, one of which is an amendment to the amendment.
I would like to introduce both of them.
We would like the words 'the Council and' to be deleted.
The final result of the amendment which is currently under discussion would then be:
'calls on the Member States to refrain from forced repatriations of minorities if they face homelessness and discrimination in the areas of education, social protection and employment once they have been forcibly returned'.
