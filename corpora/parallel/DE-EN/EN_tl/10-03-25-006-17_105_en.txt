on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, we have also rejected a previous amendment because it was worded rather too strongly.
However, there is a problem with some countries where Roma people are being repatriated and where the conditions are unsuitable for them to be able to live in freedom and safety and with human dignity.
Our wording is more restrained, among other things, because we have seen that in some countries, visa liberalisation is being misused for the purposes of asylum applications without the prerequisites being in place.
Our text would read:
to countries in the Western Balkans 'where they might face homelessness and discrimination in the areas of education, social protection and employment'.
I hope that the Members who initially rejected the other amendment can vote in favour and accept this more restrained wording.
