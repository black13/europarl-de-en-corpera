Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order.
I am very happy about the way that the vote has gone.
However, this was essentially an own-initiative report and a different procedure has been agreed in this case.
Now we have been allowed to have individual votes on an own-initiative report.
We need to resolve this or all own-initiative reports will have individual votes in future.
Could you perhaps ask the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to clarify this issue?
Otherwise, the interpretation made by the House's services will defeat the whole object of the reform.
