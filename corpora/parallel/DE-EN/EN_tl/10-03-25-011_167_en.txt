Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against this report for two reasons.
Firstly, I am disturbed that Europe is increasingly taking a scatter-gun approach to development policy and that more and more resolutions and requests are encouraging this approach.
Secondly, I have voted against the report, because I believe it is a bad thing for us to try to impose family planning policy on developing and emerging countries in the form of a sort of cultural imperialism.
Abortion is not a solution and I regret the fact that some Members of the European Parliament refer euphemistically to 'reproductive medicine' when they mean abortion.
This does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child.
Therefore, I have voted against this report and I hope that in future, we will not use the same euphemistic terms in every resolution and own-initiative report to describe aspects of cultural imperialism.
