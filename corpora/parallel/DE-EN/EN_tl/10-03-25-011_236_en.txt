The report drawn up by the German Member, Mr Lambsdorff, is a very comprehensive and competent presentation of the different areas of responsibility and future objectives of the United Nations from the perspective of the European Union.
There is no doubt that the UN and its role in the international system must be strengthened all over the world by means of appropriate reforms.
Reform of the development cooperation system, which is covered in the report, must also be supported.
This needs to be tackled urgently as the current development aid policy can be seen to have failed.
Therefore, I do not understand why the report calls for the Member States to increase their contributions significantly in the run-up to the reforms.
Development aid must be reviewed, reorganised and restructured together with the developing countries.
The statements on climate policy, which involve a stubborn refusal to enter into discussion with the critics of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and which treat the IPCC's findings as dogma, are also problematic.
For this reason, I abstained during the final vote.
