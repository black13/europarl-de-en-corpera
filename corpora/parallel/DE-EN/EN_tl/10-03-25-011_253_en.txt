Many of the beggars in Western countries come from Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria and the majority of them belong to the Roma minority.
Attempts have been made over a long period to improve the poor social situation of the Roma who live on the fringes of society in shanty towns or tent cities.
Simply pumping money into the Roma settlements will not do any good, as past experience has shown.
The key to success lies in education, because this is the only way of opening up long-term opportunities for living a different type of life.
In principle, the measures for combating poverty in Eastern Europe make sense.
However, those measures that have been put in place in the past have failed and no new, sensible approaches have been suggested.
For this reason, I have voted against the report.
