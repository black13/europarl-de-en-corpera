I strongly support the own-initiative report on agricultural product quality policy for which a vote was held on 25 March 2010.
There is a clear link between product quality and the origin of the raw materials.
The proposal for a 'place of farming' label will indicate where the raw materials come from.
This seems to me to represent an important opportunity for the agriculture industry, which produces high quality agricultural products.
Clear labelling of the origins of products not only guarantees consumers the best product quality but also enables them to make a decision on the basis of objective and transparent criteria.
Quality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European agri-food producers.
The production of high quality foods is often the only employment opportunity in many rural areas with limited production alternatives.
Therefore, I am very much in favour of the Protected Geographical Indication and Protected Designation of Origin, together with the reintroduction of a regulated and protected designation for products from mountain regions and GMO-free areas.
The Traditional Speciality Guaranteed and Organic Farming schemes must also be retained.
