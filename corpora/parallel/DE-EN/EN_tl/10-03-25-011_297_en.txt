Although I am of the opinion that we should take care what we ask the Commission for in own-initiative reports, I am in favour of the report on agricultural product quality policy.
In particular, I support the call for closer monitoring and more coordination between the Commission and the Member States so as to ensure that imported food products meet the EU's quality and food safety standards, as well as its environmental and social standards.
In the case of fresh or processed products that have a single ingredient, the country of origin should be indicated in order to allow consumers to make conscious, well-informed decisions about what they are buying.
I am relieved that my amendment which opposed the standardisation of Protected Designations of Origin and Protected Geographical Indications was accepted in the plenary session.
Combining this information would have made the existing designations superfluous and would have caused significant harm to producers with Protected Designations of Origin.
The subject of quantitative production management has been deliberately swept under the carpet in the Commission's communication.
I am convinced that we still need production control instruments in order to guarantee stable prices for producers and give them the security to plan ahead, so that they can meet the high expectations of the consumers and the legislators.
This applies not only to milk production, but also to wine growing in particular.
