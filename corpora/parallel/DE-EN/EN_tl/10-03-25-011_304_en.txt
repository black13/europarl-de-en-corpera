In the vote on the Scott√† report on agricultural product quality policy, Amendment 5 was accepted, which called for the mandatory labelling of the origin of foods made from only one ingredient.
This requirement involves significantly more work and higher costs for the agriculture industry and food processors, without bringing any real added value for consumers.
For this reason, I have voted against this amendment.
