This motion for a resolution is going in a one-sided direction by proposing subsidies and financial support for Roma people in the European Union.
Of course, we must do everything we can to ensure that marginalised groups, such as the Roma, are better integrated into society and, in particular, into the labour market.
However, the Roma people must show that they have the will and can make the effort themselves in order for this integration process to succeed.
They must start by introducing their children and young people into the European school system.
Too little emphasis is placed on these aspects in the motion for a resolution on the Roma Summit and, therefore, I have voted against it.
