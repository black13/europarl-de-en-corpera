Mr President, Mr Swoboda, you talked of solidarity and about how you should not wait until a crisis breaks out before you inform good friends about a problem.
For me, that gives rise to the question of why you did not inform your socialist friend in Greece of the problem in advance.
Did you actually not know anything about the financial imbalance in Greece?
In addition, for me, the question of responsibility also quite naturally arises in this connection.
Who is responsible for the fact that Greece has delivered inaccurate budget figures?
There is a need here for clarification and, above all, complete transparency.
This is because only then can these people actually be made responsible, only then can it be guaranteed that the existing ground rules, too, will ultimately be stuck to.
However, there is always talk of new ground rules and solutions.
These have been on the table for some time already!
The problem is that, under pressure from the banks and the lobbyists, politicians have left these solutions full of as many holes as a Swiss cheese.
That is why independence is so very important in politics.
