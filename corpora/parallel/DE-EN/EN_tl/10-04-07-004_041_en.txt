Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Van Rompuy, I have two preliminary remarks to make.
First of all, as an Austrian MEP, I would like to offer my truly heartfelt thanks for the fact that you paid a visit to Austria over the last two days and also engaged with the national parliamentarians, who have already had the opportunity to discuss this project.
Secondly, I would like to offer Mr Reul's excuses.
This was his speaking time, but he had to go to committee, as we had several jobs to do at the same time.
When it comes to today's debate, first of all I want to say to the Council, yes, a solution was reached at this Council.
Yet the Heads of State or Government lacked the courage to opt for a purely European solution.
With such a solution, we would not have needed to involve the IMF.
The criteria when it comes to money are clear.
Yet we - Europe - must take action ourselves if we have problems within the European Union.
We need more European solutions.
My second point concerns Europe 2020.
Europe 2020 is not an objective.
It must be an instrument to achieve our objectives, including as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis.
This Europe 2020 lacks the projects, the clear instruments and, at the moment, the political will to have these objectives become reality.
My third point, Mr Van Rompuy, is that the Treaty of Lisbon is not enough, and that more intergovernmental collaboration is needed.
However, we do not want intergovernmental collaboration based around President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel, without the European Parliament and without the citizens.
What we have achieved with the Treaty of Lisbon must not be brushed aside, even when tackling future issues.
