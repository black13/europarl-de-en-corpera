Mr President, the Europe 2020 strategy has ambitious goals and specific figures.
Apart from the fact that we were a long way from achieving these goals even with the Lisbon Strategy - for example in the research and development rate - the question must be raised of whether many of these goals make sense.
The Europe 2020 strategy, for example, aims to increase the number of academics considerably.
Clearly we do need highly qualified human resources, but experts are observing that what is needed is well-trained specialists, not an explosion in numbers of university graduates who then can hardly find a job, or who can only find an inappropriate one.
There is considerable contradiction within the specifications of goals.
On the one hand, the budget is to be consolidated, whilst, on the other hand, there is to be massive investment.
It will be an interesting balancing act to see how this will be resolved.
When it comes to the regions, studies have clearly shown that the Treaty of Lisbon and the Lisbon Strategy were successful where the regions were systematically involved and not where a centralised approach was taken.
This will also be an important point to note when implementing Europe 2020.
