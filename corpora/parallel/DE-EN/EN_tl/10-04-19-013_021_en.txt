Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr President, for the sympathy that you expressed for the victims of the accident that occurred in my region and my country, the autonomous province of Bozen - South Tyrol - last week.
The people in my region are indeed extremely shocked by this accident, which cost the lives of nine, predominantly young, people and left many people injured.
It is all the more shocking because this train was not an old train, but a jewel of our region and it was a new route that was only opened a few years ago.
This accident was not due to a technical fault, either.
It was purely and simply the result of a landslide, which is something that can occur in a mountainous region like the Alps.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I will pass on your words of sympathy to the victims and to the people of my country.
(Applause)
