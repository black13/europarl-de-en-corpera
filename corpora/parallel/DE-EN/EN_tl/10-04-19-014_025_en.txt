Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order for your information.
It is nice for you to congratulate us for being here today.
Although it is difficult, it is our job.
It is nothing special.
I would simply like to recommend for next time that you make this job a little easier for us by providing us with information more quickly and by answering our emails so that we know what is likely to happen.
Those who are not here today may then perhaps also come.
(Applause)
