Mr President, I tried to attract your attention earlier when you were talking about the new rules for the one-minute speeches.
Coming from Poland as you do, you will know what it means to have different classes of people and parliamentarians.
I would, however, ask that the people in the back rows also be taken into account in connection with points of order.
I have some specific questions.
Firstly, can you please clarify for me what you said earlier, namely whether, by the next two part-sessions, you mean the next two Strasbourg part sessions or whether you are also including Brussels in that?
Secondly, what will you do if - as has just happened - Members are not here for whatever reason, even though they have requested the floor?
Will there perhaps be another few minutes of catch-the-eye?
Thirdly, in line with this new efficiency - which is to be welcomed - could you please make a start right away today by reading out the names of the 30 speakers you intend to give the floor to today?
