Mr President, the problem of stray dogs in Romania has become topical once again as a result of the planned lifting of the ban on killing these dogs that has been in place since 15 January 2008.
I am pleased that Romania has again refrained from implementing these plans.
However, the alternative that has now been chosen, namely to place dogs in mass animal shelters, is not the solution either.
The only sensible thing to do is to implement a castration programme.
Romania has refused to do this, however.
When it comes to this matter - like any animal protection matters - the European Union really should do something - and not before time.
Mr President, that was my one-minute speech.
I wanted to use the remaining time to explain once again what it was I wanted to say earlier.
