Madam President, please allow me, in one minute, to make a few comments with regard to Serbia.
Serbia's ambitions to join the EU seem to be putting wind in the country's sails.
In any case, the country formally apologised recently for the genocide in Srebrenica - that is certainly not something that can be said about the controversial candidate country Turkey, where there is the threat of sanctions if a country merely debates the issue of the Armenian genocide.
The interpretation of the Copenhagen criteria is, in my view, arbitrary, if Belgrade is accused of a lack of cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague but the human rights violations by Ankara are considered unimportant.
However, it is nothing new for the European Union to apply double standards.
In Bosnia, several ethnic groups are to be thrust into one multicultural state, whereas in Kosovo, it is suddenly legitimate for one ethnic group to split away from an existing state.
In contrast to Turkey, Serbia is historically, spiritually and culturally part of Europe and a key state for the security of the Balkans.
Of course, we must not repeat the mistakes made in connection with the rushed accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
All accession criteria must definitely be met, but Serbia is a European country and should become part of the Union.
