Madam President, it is not easy these days to be a fervent pro-European.
I would like, today, to mention the problem of Eurostat.
It has turned out that Eurostat was much more aware of the real situation in Greece than it was generally thought to have been.
There are reports of which only parts were published and which uncovered cases of fraud as long ago as 2002, and then, of course, there was the great report of 2008.
However, it is totally unclear where the reports go, what the effects of these reports are, and who can be held responsible for them - in this instance, for not acting on them.
I would therefore like to suggest at this point that we deal constructively with Eurostat and not just with regard to the scandalous practices, which of course also existed in the past.
Thus, my suggestion is that the Commission takes action here to ensure the independence of Eurostat and to provide citizens with the information that we so badly need in order to revolutionise our democracy.
