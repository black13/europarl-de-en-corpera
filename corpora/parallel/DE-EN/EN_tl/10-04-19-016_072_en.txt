Madam President, these often underestimated structural issues with regard to the relationships within the institutional triangle have been summed up very well indeed in Mr Szájer's report.
The cooperation was extremely constructive and I would also like to express my sincere thanks for that.
Through the Treaty of Lisbon, we have created new relationships, and these new relationships must not be undermined again through the back door.
That is actually the key point in this regard.
The purpose behind this was to place the European Parliament on an equal footing with the Council, including with regard to delegated acts, and to ensure, firstly, that this is feasible and, secondly, can be guaranteed during the procedure.
The absolutely key issues for us, therefore, are that the appropriate conditions are created, for example, by us having clear access to the documents in good time in order to take the necessary decisions and, secondly, that no procedures are operated on the basis of a 'common understanding', but that instead we have agreements that are fixed and which cannot be subject to political arbitrariness or the political agenda of the day.
For this, we need firm, sound rules through which we can protect the rights of Parliament in practice rather than just simply taking note of them in theory.
Thank you, Mr Szájer.
It was an excellent collaboration and I hope that we can also use it to achieve what we need to achieve for our fellow Members.
