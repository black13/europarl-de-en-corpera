Madam President, as a fervent pro-European, I was against the Treaty of Lisbon, precisely because it makes possible the kind of arguments that we have just heard, and precisely because it has not created the clarity and explicitness that I would want above all else for future generations.
I am a realist, however, and I would say that now we have to live with it.
It is very important to say once more explicitly that this article, Article 290, can be interpreted as saying that not just the Council, but also Parliament can repeal the relevant delegation single-handedly and in a relatively simple way.
We will need to remind ourselves of this again and again.
Of course, what Mr Leinen has said is also true, namely that we now already have thousands of legislative acts which occupy a grey area in terms of comprehensibility, and which, in turn, continually provides grist to the mill of the anti-Europeans, the opponents of a European project, an EU which should function in those areas where we desperately need it.
Once again, this has a lot to do with transparency.
It therefore seems to me to be very important that in paragraph 10, it is proposed that the arrangements for the transmission of documents, among other things, need to be clarified explicitly.
Quite a few of us know the Freedom of Information Act, and quite a few of us have experience of the way in which things are done in the USA.
Why then do we not simply do a 'copy and paste' and make it possible for citizens, and also for us in Parliament, to obtain the relevant documents independently, and not by act of grace and through massive amounts of intervention by political groups?
Why do we not make this into a right, given that we are already taking the great risk of having thousands of delegated legislative acts?
On that note, I would say keep up the good work.
We will be constructive partners on the road to revolutionising democracy.
