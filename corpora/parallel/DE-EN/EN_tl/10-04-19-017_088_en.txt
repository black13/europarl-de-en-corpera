Madam President, Commissioner, Parliament showed a lot of initiative when it came to drawing up this blacklist.
This was done in a responsible manner too, which means that it provides the highest possible level of safety for consumers.
However - and this is also an issue now - we need to check whether it has really worked well enough in the current situation.
The first question that I would like to ask about this is as follows.
It is possible to access information over the Internet, but it is not always very easy with the different airlines.
I have tried this out for myself.
You cannot always immediately find information, for example, on connecting flights which require you to land in a third country.
So here we have a problem then.
The second open question, and this would be of interest to me: what experiences have people had with wet leasing?
Here, there have been serious concerns that it could become a loophole for enterprises which are not very reputable.
Have there been any positive or negative developments with regard to this?
Third, and this is a very important point: has this way of regulating companies through the blacklist had a preventative effect on airlines, so that they - non-European ones in particular - have followed safety regulations more closely?
How does the selective authorisation of a few aircraft belonging to certain airlines work, where we only allow them to use certain aircraft to come to Europe?
