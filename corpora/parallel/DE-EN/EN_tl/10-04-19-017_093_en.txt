Madam President, I would like to make a general comment and then ask two or three questions, depending on how much time you allow me.
The general comment is as follows.
I find it almost ludicrous that in the present situation, we, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, have received, in three air safety reports, a total of nine minutes of speaking time.
Of course, there is the special session tomorrow, but I believe that it is about time for this House to pay more attention to things that really affect people, and perhaps to cut back somewhat on debates whose value has been artificially inflated.
As for the questions themselves, Commissioner - for me the most important is: what is the situation with regard to code-share flights - these aircraft that are meant to be flown by a European airline, but which can then be operated by some other airline, even one on the blacklist?
What is happening here to inform people who need to fly?
This is a real burning issue for me, and I would expect you to answer it.
I will leave it at that one question.
