Madam President, I would like to speak in accordance with Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure because of an incident which took place here a few minutes ago, and indeed during the item of the agenda for one-minute speeches.
At the point when you called on Hans-Peter Martin, while he was actually here, he wandered past us.
In response to our humorous question of whether he had slept through his own speech, Mr Martin adopted a particular stance here, clicked his heels and gave the Hitler salute.
Madam President, this is unacceptable; this is a serious breach of the customs of the House in accordance with Rule 9, and I therefore implore you to issue the appropriate call to order against this improper and unacceptable behaviour.
I would also ask you to check whether, in connection with this, this behaviour can be documented in the recording.
This is unacceptable.
Even if it was a supposedly humorous provocation, jokes of this kind have no place in this House.
