Madam President, I am sorry that I must burden the plenary session, but in accordance with Rule 151, I feel forced to make a personal remark.
I was targeted a moment ago.
This is typical if you live in Austria.
There is a group there which, by international standards, is classified as far-right.
They have party leaders who make certain gestures in the air and think nothing of it.
These are also people that cannot bear to be beaten in democratic elections, and then refuse any form of handshake or contact.
If you wave at them, they only see one thing: the thing that they have real experience of, the Hitler salute.
Of course, these are problems which simply show that my home country has unfortunately not succeeded in coming to terms with the past, that we will not just be dealing with one far-right party which is represented here, but soon with two.
I would simply like to make it clear once again: we are the democrats.
The far-right wingers sit over there.
I am proud to belong to a political group that has managed to make a decisive contribution to the fact that we no longer have a far-right group in this Parliament and hopefully will never get one.
The answer is thus to have more democracy and not more far-right politics, hostility towards people and cynical contempt for people.
Those are the men who have already said that I should seek psychiatric help because they could not bear to lose elections in a democratic manner.
