Madam President, given that aviation security charges within the EU have been dealt with in very different ways, I think it is important to apply an objective measure here.
It would make a lot of sense to take a combination of the number of passengers and also maximum take-off weight as the basis for assessment.
It is important, however, that there is a clear connection between the security charge levied and the services which are actually provided.
It is important to define aviation security itself, and we must also know exactly what we are paying for.
The exact way in which the security charges will be calculated must be comprehensible.
Information on the size of the charges, and what they consist of, must be provided openly.
Transparency is imperative here.
For this, however, we need independent regulatory authorities in order to be able to counteract any distortion of competition quickly and efficiently.
