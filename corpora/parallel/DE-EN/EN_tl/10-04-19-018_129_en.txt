Madam President, I am somewhat embarrassed after so much praise, and so I will keep it short.
I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs, who have worked hard together: Mr Zasada, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr Kohlíček.
We have worked hard on this matter for nearly a year now.
This is how I see European politics, not as a forum for bickering to provide a spectacle, as perhaps other fellow Members are doing.
Second, I would like to address the Council and make an appeal to them.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism is actually a very amicable committee, a committee which works and argues in a businesslike manner, and in this spirit, we have very much met the Council half way on this law.
From the start, we have been very willing to compromise.
However, I would like to warn the Council to let sleeping dogs lie.
If you are willing to compromise, then you must also be able to expect compromises from your opponents or partners.
If the Council is not at all willing to meet the European Parliament half way now, then the attitude of this committee will also change.
This is not only my opinion.
I have already heard from some colleagues that if the Council is not willing to meet us half way, then we will also discuss body scanners in quite a different light and perhaps also not be willing to meet the Council half way.
This is something which is not in the interests of the matter as a whole and which absolutely must not happen.
This is why I am appealing to the Council and the Member States to move on this.
We now have the Treaty of Lisbon.
Both the Council and the Member States must keep moving on this, otherwise we might once again hear: Come on, let's SWIFT again!
