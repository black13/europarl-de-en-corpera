Madam President, the trans-European networks are a topic which is keeping us busy in this plenary session, and which should keep us even more busy.
We now have a recast, and some people - Mr Silvestris, for example - have been surprised that the Greens have put forward amendments proposing changes to the list of the trans-European networks, or what is considered to form part of this.
They must not forget that what we have suggested involves a special case: namely where the Member State itself has said that this part of the trans-European networks is only a feeder and will therefore no longer be relevant for us; this famous flight path - now I am talking like Mr Stoiber; I think this is contagious, and quite dangerous - is something we do not want to build any more; one would, so to speak, have built a feeder to Munich Airport.
This is the reason for our amendment, therefore.
I also generally think, however, that we should apply ourselves with particular care to revising the trans-European networks, and we should consider a point which is particularly important to me.
There is a study by a Dutch person - I will gladly pass it on to the Commissioner, when he is here - which, for me, is very relevant for the coming debate, and which shows that the costs of a large project - and it very often involves large projects - are, as a rule, underestimated by an average of 45%, and their benefit is always overestimated, since that is needed in order to implement the project.
That means that we must completely rethink the cost estimate for trans-European projects, and I would call on you to do that.
It is our responsibility to give our citizens good, clear information.
