Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Transrapid system should not be included in these guidelines.
It does not fit into the European landscape.
It does not reduce the differences between the systems that we currently have; it increases them.
We have paid out billions to create a uniform system, and here billions are being paid out at national level to counteract that.
That cannot be allowed to happen!
Although the European Parliament had previously come out against the Transrapid system, it suddenly reappeared in 1996 as a project between Berlin and Hamburg.
It then suddenly disappeared again - and no one knows why.
In 2004, the Transrapid link between Munich airport and Munich Central Station appeared just as suddenly.
That was then halted in Germany, with the additional support of the State Government of Bavaria.
There was agreement about scrapping this project - no one wanted it any more.
That is why it must no longer be included in these guidelines.
After leaving office, the former Minister-President of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber, was appointed to campaign for a reduction in bureaucracy here in Europe.
That is his responsibility.
He is also the one who now has to take the decision that this Transrapid system does not belong in these guidelines.
That is something that we should all take note of.
We must get rid of this Transrapid system.
It was a nice model from a scientific perspective, but it has no place in Europe.
It does not belong here and, as such, does not belong in these guidelines.
