Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Simpson, and, at the same time, express my regret that he cannot be with us here today.
We will manage, nevertheless.
I would particularly like to express my congratulations for taking the approach of essentially leaving things as they are in these guidelines, because there is one principle that is very important, namely reliability and calculability on the part of the European legislator.
That is certainly fulfilled with this report.
Secondly, I would like to mention that we also need a proposal for the future when we can once again decide what is really part of the TEN system and what is not.
We could conduct the debate in the way that it is, to a certain extent, already being conducted.
Some people are arguing charismatically in favour of linking a boot with an island and the others say that that absolutely must not be included.
However, that is the wrong way to go about it.
We need to look at what adds value for the European Union and European taxpayers.
Moreover, support should clearly be provided in places where the Member States are already doing something, where something is happening, because then, something really will happen and we will not have a situation where TEN plans are made that are then never implemented.
European citizens and passengers will benefit, as will those Member States that commit themselves ultimately to moving traffic away from the roads and on to the rail system.
