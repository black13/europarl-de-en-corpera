Madam President, as a result of the fall of the Iron Curtain and of Central European integration, the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor is, as we know, currently regaining the importance that it had before the collapse of the Danube Monarchy.
The EU has, of course, already confirmed the importance of the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor by giving priority status to the northern part from Gda≈Ñsk to the Czech Republic.
However, it would be even more important to also give the development of the southern part via the Austrian Southern Railway to Italy the same level of priority.
In this network, in particular, which carries half of all goods and passengers, we need to neutralise a dangerous bottleneck situation.
Only the Koralm Tunnel will be able to permanently eliminate the barrier posed by this bottleneck.
The people living along the transit routes are, as we all know, paying a high, and rising, price for the increasing volume of traffic.
Only the complete development of this southern corridor will lead to the sort of switch from the road to the rail system that could not be expected to be achieved by any other infrastructure measures in Austria.
