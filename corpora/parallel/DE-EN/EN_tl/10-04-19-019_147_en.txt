Madam President, the trans-European networks are indeed utilised for regular traffic in Europe.
We could even say that the traffic is the absolute backbone of the entire European internal market, which is, of course, one of our main aims in Europe.
Therefore, we absolutely must take care to ensure that all corridors are indeed developed and to discover where there is a need for financing and where the EU should concentrate its efforts.
Of course, it is clear that there are always national interests.
We have seen it already today: some people talked about the Danube, others talked, in particular, about southern Europe and others still talked about the Brenner Base Tunnel.
These traffic corridors are found all over Europe.
The aim is for them to be generally continuous throughout Europe so that not only goods, but also people, can be transported from A to B. That is the task facing us.
As I said before, it is natural for each of us to attach importance to our own regional requirements.
We need to make sure that we avoid bottlenecks and, above all, that we have a truly functional network for all means of transport.
That is what it is all about, and that is also what we will debate accordingly.
