Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would once again like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Tr√ºpel for the truly excellent report that we are debating today.
I believe that it is a splendid project that will be making Europe's diverse cultural heritage available to the people of Europe and throughout the world in a digital online library.
However, it still requires further joint efforts on our part to actually make this project a success.
A significant prerequisite for this is, in the view of my group, the free - and that means also, as far as possible, cost-free - access to our cultural heritage via Europeana.
In the joint discussions, we have reached a good compromise, which protects the interests of authors of protected works on the one hand while, at the same time, providing the necessary free accessibility, and I would very much like the Commission to also take account of and adopt these proposals in future.
Another prerequisite is that the Member States become increasingly aware of their responsibility.
For my own country, this means that it is not acceptable for Goethe to be available in Polish and French, but not in the original German.
In this regard, we must all jointly call on the Member States more strongly to once again provide the appropriate financial resources to make Europeana a real success on this level as well.
