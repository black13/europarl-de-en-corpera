Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for his report.
Agriculture is the economic sector that is already doing, and can still do, the most to protect the environment.
Thus, we have already succeeded in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in agriculture by 20%.
In addition, agricultural soils and plants draw large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere.
Agriculture is therefore part of the solution to the problem of climate change.
On the other hand, food production for 500 million EU citizens must take priority while, at the same time, using resources as efficiently as possible and providing the highest possible level of protection for the environment and biodiversity.
Farmers cannot manage this alone.
They need a strong European agriculture policy to support them.
Only in this way can we succeed in producing sufficient food for a growing world population and, at the same time, protect the environment in order to combat climate change.
