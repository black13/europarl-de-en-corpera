Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Le Foll most sincerely for his report.
It contains very important points that we will need to take heed of in future.
Climate protection must also be part of the new agricultural reform; it needs to be incorporated into this reform.
In future, we will need sustainable and ecologically sound procedures which ensure that the environment is protected.
Agriculture is not only a victim in relation to climate protection; it is also a significant part of the cause.
Ten per cent of greenhouse gases still originate from agriculture.
There needs to be a reduction here, too.
We also need to take note of a subject that is mentioned in the Le Foll report, namely, the fact that we import a great deal of soya from Brazil, for example.
European agriculture is also partly responsible for the fact that areas of primary forest in other countries are being turned into very intensively farmed agricultural land, which then ultimately has an impact back here, too.
That it something that we need to consider in future.
In future, we will also need to endeavour to re-establish our own protein supply in Europe.
That is also part of the solution to the environmental problems relating to climate protection.
