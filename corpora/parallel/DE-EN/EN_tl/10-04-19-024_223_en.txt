Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report.
Subsidising disadvantaged areas is a core element of the common agricultural policy, with the aim of maintaining the universal spread of agriculture throughout Europe.
The Commission's approach to develop a system that can be used EU-wide for delimiting these areas is therefore to be welcomed.
The crucial point, however, is whether the eight criteria that have been developed to do this will actually be sufficient.
I am not convinced that these are really the right criteria to use.
I cannot understand - and I think the same can be said of the rapporteur and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - why the Commission has not made the simulation results for the effects of these eight criteria available to us.
I therefore appeal to the Commission: this really should not happen as often as it does.
When we want and need to evaluate something, we naturally also need to know the results.
I view this to a certain extent as a lack of trust in Parliament.
That means that, for this particular proposed regulation, there is still much to be done.
I hope that the Commission will look closely at the Dorfmann report that we have made into our own report.
Personally, I hope that Mr Dorfmann will be able to continue to have political input on this matter.
