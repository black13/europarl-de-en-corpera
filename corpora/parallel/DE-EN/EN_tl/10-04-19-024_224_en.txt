Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Dorfmann for his report.
What he has presented clearly shows that there are still a few things that need to be clarified with regard to this matter.
Like the speakers before me, I, too, think that the current framework for delimiting these areas is too rough and ready.
Many parts of it do not meet the needs of disadvantaged regions.
I question whether we will be able to manage with these natural criteria alone.
We also need to look closely at the social situation, which plays a major role in disadvantaged regions.
As the payments for disadvantaged regions are vital for the survival of many holdings, the Commission needs to think once again about refining the current framework in order to give many regions a chance of survival.
I fear that implementation of the current system would lead to very large shifts which are not always comprehensible and will lead to a large amount of disquiet and uncertainty within agriculture.
We ought to look at this again.
