Mr President, thank you, Mr Ashworth, for this excellent report.
The common agricultural policy is a successful policy, but we sometimes cloud this success in excessive bureaucracy.
That is just as true of the first pillar of the agricultural policy as it is of the second.
However, it is particularly the case for small holdings, where the input of bureaucracy is sometimes quite simply disproportionate to the output represented by the money received.
In the course of reforming our agricultural policy, we need to consider having a regulation for small producers and how we can find a much simpler method for such holdings which, from various budget chapters, we often give a total of just a few hundred to a few thousand euro in premiums, without losing sight of our objectives and producing a lack of clarity in the granting of subsidies.
That must be possible and we must endeavour to achieve it.
