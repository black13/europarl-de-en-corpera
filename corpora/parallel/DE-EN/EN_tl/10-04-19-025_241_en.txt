Mr President, European agricultural policy must be made simpler, more transparent and easier to understand.
That is the message conveyed by the rapporteur, Mr Ashworth, and it is a good message and the right one.
Our report is intended to encourage the Commission to intensify its efforts to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP) in a tangible way.
Doing so would save our farmers a lot of time and money and would increase social acceptance of the CAP.
Our farmers would also be able to concentrate on their real job again, namely producing food.
I would therefore like to see the simplification of the common agricultural policy made a long-term task here in Parliament and in the Commission.
