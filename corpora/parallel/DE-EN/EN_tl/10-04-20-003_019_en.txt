Mr President, the decision made by the aviation safety authorities not to put passenger safety at risk was absolutely right, even if this meant closing European airspace for several days and involved financial losses for the airlines.
In my opinion, it is irresponsible for airlines to ask their pilots to fly at their own risk.
What does 'at their own risk' actually mean in this case?
I welcome the fact that the Commission is considering authorising special State aid for the airlines, which would otherwise be in serious financial difficulties as a result of the current situation.
We will be talking later about employment in the European Union.
If the EU and the Member States can at least help to prevent things from getting even worse, this is the right thing to do.
However, in return for the provision of State aid, the airlines must give a binding undertaking not to make staff cuts or salary cuts.
They must also guarantee that they will not reduce holiday allowances or deduct pay for the days on which employees were not able to get to work because of the transport situation.
It is high time that the Commission put in place a permanent common European monitoring system for aviation safety.
This monitoring system should be specifically designed to prevent social dumping.
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks, which profited from the aid, but did not take a corresponding social approach.
Competition and the pursuit of profit must not be allowed to take priority over the safety of human lives.
