Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, safety has priority over all other considerations.
We cannot take the risk of a plane full of passengers suffering engine failure and perhaps, as a result, crashing in a built-up area.
I would like to remind everyone of the British Airways plane which flew through an ash cloud on its way to New Zealand in 1982 and, in particular, of the serious incident involving a KLM Boeing 747 in 1989 which flew through a thick cloud of volcanic ash.
Both planes narrowly escaped disaster.
Human life is priceless.
I welcome the decision to close the airspace during this crisis and therefore to ensure that pilots do not have to take responsibility for the passengers entrusted to their care.
Test and measurement flights have taken place, but only up to a certain height and under visual flight rules.
These flights were not able to carry out any real analyses or produce any significant results.
One other comment I have on flights under visual flight rules is that in the case of the KLM plane, the ash cloud was not visible.
Nature teaches us respect and, at the same time, makes clear to us the limits of globalisation.
We are all highly aware of the serious financial consequences.
However, a human life is worth much more than goods.
Therefore, taking into account the cases I have mentioned, I would like to call for the greatest possible responsibility and caution, including with regard to the division of the airspace into three zones.
