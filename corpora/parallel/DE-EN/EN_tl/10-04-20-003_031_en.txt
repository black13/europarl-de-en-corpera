Mr President, in the last few days, I have seen and experienced the alternatives to air travel in Europe, on the one hand, during a car journey from Belgrade to Vienna and then on a train journey from Vienna to Strasbourg.
Although there are problems on the roads, the road infrastructure is relatively well developed, even in Europe's neighbouring regions.
However, the situation on the railways remains appalling.
This is not acceptable.
Where would we be today if we had implemented the provisions of the so-called Delors Plan?
We would already have the trans-European networks and we would have more high-speed rail lines and high-speed trains.
After only a few hours, the toilets on the train were unusable, although it was a modern carriage, because a lot of people had to stand or sit on the floor for several hours and therefore the trains were overcrowded and the facilities overstretched.
Therefore, I would like to call on Mr Kallas to give a new impetus to the modernisation of the railways in the form of more high-speed trains and the provision of capacity reserves.
We need a certain amount of reserves.
Not only during the disastrous volcanic explosion, but also in winter, we have discovered that we have too few reserves and that focusing on profitability alone is not enough.
We must also put more emphasis on accommodation.
