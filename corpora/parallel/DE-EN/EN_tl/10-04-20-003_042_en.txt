Mr President, as if we had been able to predict what was going to happen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is also responsible for civil protection, has an own-initiative report on the community approach to the prevention of natural disasters in the pipeline.
The rapporteur is Mr Ferreira.
We will be voting on this report in the next session and we will discuss our experience of the volcanic ash cloud then.
Plenary will very soon be able to formulate Parliament's position on these subjects.
I agree with the Members who have said that we are poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Fortunately, Europe has few natural disasters.
However, we also have little experience in this area and it is clear that our crisis management is poor.
In my opinion, it all took too long.
Five days before a test flight took place and real data was collected is simply too long.
We must learn from this.
I do not want to make any accusations, but experience shows that we must do things better the next time around.
If this volcanic ash has made one thing clear, it is the need for more Europe.
Mr Kallas, you have said that the national authorities have responsibilities.
However, this does not help the people who have suffered as a result.
We need more Europe in civil protection and in a common transport policy.
The Treaty of Lisbon opens up more opportunities for us.
In the same way as Mrs HÃ¼bner, I would like to ask you how you will make use of the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon in crisis management and civil protection.
This situation must improve.
