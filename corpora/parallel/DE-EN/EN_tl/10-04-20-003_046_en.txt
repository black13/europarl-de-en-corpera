Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the response of the European Union and the Member States to this crisis has been entirely satisfactory and that everything possible has been done.
They have acted according to the principle that safety is paramount.
We can discuss whether the ash cloud should have been investigated more quickly.
I believe that this would have been possible, but in principle, what was done was acceptable.
We now need to discuss and think carefully about what should be done for the people, the European citizens, who are stranded.
I was called yesterday by three people who are in this situation.
One case concerns members of a family who are waiting in an airport in Thailand and have been told that they will probably be able to fly out on 29 April.
They have already spent a whole week at the airport.
The second case involves young people in New York who have been told not to leave their hotel for at least a week, because they could be picked up at any moment.
The third case is a family of pensioners on an island in the Norwegian Sea, who can no longer afford to pay for their accommodation, but are unable to leave.
These are issues which we in the European Parliament need to think about and discuss.
We must offer these people solutions, give them support and make useful proposals.
We cannot abandon the European citizens who are in this situation; we must help them.
