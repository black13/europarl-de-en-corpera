Mr President, it has become clear that the focus of this whole issue is on the passengers.
We want passengers from Europe to be transported safely.
We want safety, but we also want transport options.
I believe that we need all the means of transport currently available.
We need aircraft, as we cannot replace flying with another solution.
A lot has been said about high-speed trains.
Of course, it would be good to have more of them, but what use is the best high-speed train if it has to stop at the border?
For this reason, I think we should take one step at a time.
Firstly, we need continuity across the European rail systems, in just the same way that we need the single European sky.
As all the parties have spoken out in favour of more coordination between the Member States, I would like to call on everyone once again to take action, because it is the parties in the Member States who are responsible for blocking progress in this area.
Please make sure that the parties at home in the Member States are genuinely in favour of opening up transport in Europe.
If we are all able to convince our parties, the situation will improve in future.
