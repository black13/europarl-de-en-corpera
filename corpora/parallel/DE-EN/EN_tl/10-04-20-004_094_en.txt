The Commission work programme for 2010 has established the right priorities.
As well as modernising ways of working, which will be a decisive factor in stimulating the economy, and increasing the involvement of European citizens, the Commission is focusing primarily on combating the financial crisis.
It is important that, in particular, those EU citizens who have lost their jobs during the current crisis are given new prospects for the future as quickly as possible.
As the spokesperson on the environment for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I am concerned that we should create as many sustainable jobs as possible and provide added value on the labour market as a result of the leading role played by Europe in protecting the environment.
In order to make the changeover to a new and sustainable industrial age, we should no longer regard job creation and comprehensive protection for the environment as mutually contradictory.
In my view, the Commission has been somewhat cautious in taking up this approach.
We need to be laying the foundations for this now.
We will be able to achieve a great deal if we can improve the way in which existing regulations are applied.
