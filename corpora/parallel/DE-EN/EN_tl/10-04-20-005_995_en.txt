It is now time for us to carry out an interim review of the aid effort in Haiti.
The main questions that we need to ask ourselves are as follows: How quickly and effectively was and is the aid being provided?
Does the aid support sustainable development in Haiti?
How was the entire aid effort coordinated?
How was the EU represented in foreign policy terms?
I am particularly interested in the last two questions, because the devastating earthquake was the first test faced by the High Representative Baroness Ashton.
The purpose of the office of High Representative is to strengthen the EU's role as a global player.
However, Baroness Ashton did not think it was worth travelling to Haiti shortly after the earthquake to provide symbolic support, nor was she able to ensure that the aid provided to Haiti was coordinated effectively.
Some Member States launched individual aid campaigns and others acted jointly.
Baroness Ashton should have been responsible for ensuring better coordination.
In addition, the government of Haiti has not been sufficiently involved.
The High Representative should now at last be realising what her job is all about.
She should be making constructive proposals for structuring humanitarian and financial aid following major disasters.
There is a great deal of development work to be done over the next few months and this also applies to Baroness Ashton.
