Mr Rehn proposed a package in Madrid which has not yet been adopted, but which involved a discussion of sanctions right at the beginning of the debate.
In my opinion, we should not start our discussions with sanctions on the Member States, because that would be putting the cart before the horse.
Instead we should establish the common objectives, common projects and common instruments that we need in addition to what is already in place and only then should we consider sanctions for behaviour that shows a lack of solidarity.
What is your view on this approach?
