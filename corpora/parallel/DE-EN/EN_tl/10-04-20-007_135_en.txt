Mr Barroso, I understand that you are attempting to avoid answering my question, because it is an unpleasant one.
Therefore, I will repeat it.
There is at least a possibility that Member States which can borrow money on better terms than those on which they are lending it will be able to profit from the debts of another country.
As the no bail out clause states that Member States cannot take on the debts of others, they should not be allowed to profit from those debts either.
Are you prepared to say openly to Mrs Merkel or Mr Sarkozy, for example, or to anyone else that you are opposed to this course of action?
