Mr Barroso, you have spoken about your work programme and it has been discussed in Parliament.
You have said that you want to follow up on the critical remarks.
I have one question.
Recently, we have spoken a great deal about the crisis and how to overcome it.
However, I have the impression that very little has changed in the way the banks do business.
I would also be interested to hear the answer to another question.
Do you think that we and the Commission have done enough?
If not, what do you believe it is still necessary to do in order to combat the causes of the financial crisis in the longer term, so that the banks cannot go on doing business in the way they currently are?
