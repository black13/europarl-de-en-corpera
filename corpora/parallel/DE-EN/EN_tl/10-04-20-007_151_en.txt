Mr Barroso, I have another brief question.
The chair of Deutsche Bank, Dr Ackermann, is a difficult man to make an impression on.
He has recently said outright that he wants to make returns of 25%.
Do you not think that this flies in the face of the measures taken by the Commission and the individual governments?
He is not changing anything.
He has said that he wants to make returns of 25% once again.
This is what Dr Ackermann, the chair of Deutsche Bank, which is an extremely important bank, is saying.
