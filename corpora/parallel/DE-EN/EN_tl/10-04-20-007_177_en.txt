My question refers to the volcanic eruption which will, of course, have an impact on particulate matter and CO2 emissions.
Do you believe that it is possible to evaluate what levels of particulate matter should be taken into account in future in order to prevent jobs being put at risk?
Our air quality directives provide for significant restrictions in this respect.
