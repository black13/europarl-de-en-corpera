Yesterday, the media told us that the Opel plant in Antwerp will close.
This is just one of many examples of jobs being lost in Europe.
Next Thursday, the European industrial trade unions will be holding a day of demonstrations throughout Europe.
They are calling for jobs and the future of Europe as an industrial base to be safeguarded.
The trade union members want full employment, but they also want effective European policies and definitive answers today, not in five years' time.
Your work programme does not provide very definitive information in this respect.
You have just referred to the guidelines and the Europe 2020 position paper.
In my view, this is not specific enough.
You should provide examples.
What do you plan to do to re-establish our strategically important industrial sectors in Europe and what role is the Commission playing in making the automotive industry future-proof and in safeguarding jobs?
