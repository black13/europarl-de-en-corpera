Mr Barroso, I have to disagree with you.
You said that Europe 2020 included measures to exploit the potential for the creation of green jobs in the European Union.
That is not true.
You have simply failed to include this in the strategy and I am wondering why.
It is obvious that if you want to generate employment, the greening of the economy is a significant opportunity for job creation.
Why does this not form part of Europe 2020?
What is the Commission planning to do to exploit the job creation potential of a sustainable economy in Europe to the full, in particular, given that the European Council President has included this as an important point in his concept, because he believes that it offers a major opportunity?
What is the Commission intending to do?
