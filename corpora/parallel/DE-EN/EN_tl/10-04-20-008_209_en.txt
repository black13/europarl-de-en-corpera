Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Salafranca, as a member of the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, I am very pleased about your report, because it is really important for us to continue to strengthen the relationship between the European Union and Latin America.
We have made a great deal of progress since 1999.
Latin America has a population of 600 million and almost 600 million people also live here in the European Union.
We have similar values and human rights and we are also linked by the desire for democracy and peace.
However, the actual conditions in the two continents are very different.
In a partnership, it is important to ensure wherever possible that both partners are equally powerful and that is not yet the case.
There are many problems in Latin America, including illiteracy, but also a lack of infrastructure, a general lack of education, democratic deficits and violations of human rights.
Fortunately, we do not have as many problems.
Many people there make a living from the drugs trade and this, of course, is something that must change.
As a major trading partner with an active involvement in development aid, it is our job to ensure that Latin America receives further help with its democratisation processes.
I would like to see the partnership leading to people in Latin America living in peace in the same way that we do in the European Union and allowing them to also learn and benefit from one another as we do.
This is why I very much like the idea of a Euro-Latin American Charter for Peace and Security and a Europe-Latin America Foundation.
I believe that this would deepen the partnership even further and really help us to make more progress.
