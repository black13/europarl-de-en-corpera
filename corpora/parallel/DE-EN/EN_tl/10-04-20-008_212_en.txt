Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a biregional strategic partnership has been in place between the European Union and Latin America since 1999.
The basic principles of this partnership include respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, together with the right to education.
However, it is a fact that these principles are often violated.
In addition, around 42 million people in Latin America are illiterate.
The European Union is both the main investor in Latin America and an important trading partner.
Finally, I would like to say that the fact that women are socially disadvantaged and that discrimination against the indigenous peoples continues, to highlight just two of the problem areas, is in violation of universal human rights.
There is still work to be done in this area and improvements still need to be made.
