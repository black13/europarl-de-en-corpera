Mr President, after more than 300 years of colonial rule and after the continent became an arena for the cold war, Latin America has now become one of the world's emerging regions.
The fact that the Russian president Mr Medvedev has visited Central and South America is a clear indication of the fact that he is attempting to strengthen Russia's economic relationship with South America.
It also shows that the EU is on the right track in improving its relationships with this continent, which has a larger population than the EU-27.
However, this is not just about starting negotiations with the Mercosur trading bloc.
It also involves all the smaller countries which do not belong to this economic region or to the Andean Community.
The EU is not only the main investor or the most important or second most important trading partner; it is also the biggest donor of development aid.
From a financial perspective, we already play a major role and, in my opinion, we must make use of this pole position to develop the relationship between Europe and Latin America.
