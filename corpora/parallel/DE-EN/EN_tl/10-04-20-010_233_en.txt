Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very much for your assessment of the situation.
I believe your assessment to be correct that we should first try to restore law and order and safeguard human lives and then begin to build on this foundation.
On the other hand, and you explained this in your last remark, the extent to which economic and social development is needed is clear, because this is also an important yardstick for political stability.
Of course, this also includes equality, which often suffers as a result of corruption and other similar factors.
Whether justifiably or not, this was obviously one of the causes of the clashes.
We must be aware that these countries are sufficiently unstable that our efforts to bring about stability by contributing to improved state-building, democracy and the rule of law are of crucial importance.
The whole region is of major strategic significance to us, not just the individual countries.
This relates not only to the available energy sources, but to the area as a whole, in particular, if we consider the religious orientation of the majority of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
If this were to take the form of fundamentalism, the results could be catastrophic for us.
For this reason, providing aid to these countries is of extreme importance, not only from the perspective of the aid itself, but also in relation to our interests.
We should remember that the neighbouring countries in the region, some of which are very large, are responsible for ensuring that these weaknesses are not exploited with the aim of rebuilding old power relationships that would not allow for modern development.
