Mr President, Baroness Ashton, we know how much people hoped in 2005 at the time of the Tulip Revolution that everything would change when a new president came into office who genuinely took seriously the needs and interests of the people with regard to democracy and codetermination.
Unfortunately, that was not the case and now he has suffered the same fate as his predecessor.
The European Union must exert significance influence in this case.
Baroness Ashton, I welcomed the fact that you said that you have sent the Special Representative, Mr Morel, to the region.
I think that was both sensible and useful.
However, it is equally necessary for the EU now to revise its strategy for Central Asia to make it really effective.
I hope the Council will begin work on this next Monday.
My question is: How do you intend to tackle this?
How do you plan to ensure that a genuinely comprehensive process is put in place for developing a constitution which involves everyone, as you have proposed?
We need to help this region and Kyrgyzstan to move towards cooperation and away from confrontation.
I believe that this is important for the future of the entire region and beyond.
