Mr President, when the Soviet Union broke up at the beginning of the 1990s, many people believed that the young democracies would develop almost of their own accord.
Now we know that these new states have inherited huge problems from the Soviet Union.
During the Soviet era, differences between the ethnic groups were largely suppressed, which is why there is so much religious and cultural conflict in these countries today.
Democracy does not just develop overnight and it will not emerge at all while corrupt clans are growing rich at the expense of the country and its citizens.
Rumour has it that the snipers who shot into the crowd in Bishkek were Uzbek and Tajik mercenaries.
It seems that this was an attempt to provoke an international conflict which could put the whole of Central Asia at risk.
European foreign policy should help to defuse the situation.
However, military intervention is the wrong approach, as is clearly shown by the German presence in Afghanistan.
It is essential to provide intelligent, targeted economic and development aid.
We must give priority to combating corruption and to depriving the local clans of their power.
It is really only then that democracy will have a genuine chance in Central Asia.
