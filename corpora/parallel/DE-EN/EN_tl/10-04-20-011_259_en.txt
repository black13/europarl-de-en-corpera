Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Canada is a good friend and an important partner of the EU.
It is also an important international player and has long been a mature democracy which we can learn a lot from.
However, because it is a long time since we have adopted a resolution on Canada in this House, we should take the opportunity to look more seriously at the relationship between Europe and Canada than this resolution does.
I find it rather embarrassing that the resolution refers to the many common challenges, but does not include the policy on the Arctic among them.
There is no mention of protecting the Arctic using targets and standards.
The Arctic is only referred to in passing and the fact that in March, Canada prevented Sweden, Finland, Iceland and the indigenous peoples from taking part in an international meeting on the Arctic in a rather unfriendly way is completely overlooked.
I am embarrassed that the problem of the tar sands, the bluefin tuna and the ban on seal culling are not addressed.
This is not all about provoking Canada.
However, if we hold a serious discussion with a friend, it is foolish and shameful not to mention the problems that we have.
No mention is made of the fact that Canada did not play a particularly positive role in Copenhagen.
The problem of the visa policy, specifically with regard to the Czech Republic and its Roma people, should be highlighted more clearly.
We must work together in friendship, but we must not sweep the problems under the carpet, because that does not help anyone.
Therefore, my group will seek to ensure when we vote that the problem of the tar sands and of the import of seal products is included in the resolution.
