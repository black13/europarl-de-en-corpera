Mr President, I am wondering why I always feel that I should suspect the Commission of not wanting to put things before the European Parliament.
That is the case with the free trade agreement which is being negotiated with Canada.
I would like to join in the criticism voiced by fellow Members who have said that some of the facts are suspicious, in particular, the one mentioned by Mr Higgins, and I fully agree with him.
In my opinion, trade agreements are a good thing if they promote general prosperity on both sides, but not when they serve the interests of a few large multinational companies almost exclusively.
When you find out that health, education or public security have suddenly become the subject of trade agreements and that they are to be deregulated and privatised, then you begin to suspect that the agreement is for the benefit of the few and will cause harm to many others.
I would like to send out a warning to the people who are attempting to bypass the European Parliament in introducing agreements of this kind.
The second point that I would like to make is as follows.
If you meet and negotiate with a long-term partner, such as Canada, you have to cover some unpleasant subjects.
I believe that a discussion and an agreement of this kind should include the issue of the seal cull.
This is not intended to annoy anyone, but to clarify the European position and to find a solution which would put an end to the appalling profit making at the expense of small animals.
