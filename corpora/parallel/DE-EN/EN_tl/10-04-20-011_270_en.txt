Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the EU delegation for relations with Canada, I would like to emphasise the fact that Canada and the EU share common values.
Our common values form the basis for the structure of our society and are of fundamental importance in this respect.
We should make increasing use of this common foundation to take joint responsibility for restructuring basic global conditions.
Our close historic and cultural links and our respect for multilateralism, including our support for the Charter of the United Nations, form the foundation of our partnership.
We must improve and strengthen our relationship on a variety of levels, in particular, of course, on the political level.
The agreement that we are discussing today will be the first based on the new treaty and the Commission should be aware of this.
The main requirements for a successful decision-making process for this agreement are transparency, cooperation and the inclusion of Parliament.
Two important subjects have been raised in this discussion.
The one-sided visa rules for Czech citizens are unacceptable and should be abolished.
Canada's criticism of the strict regulations on the sale of seal products is an indication not that we need to change, but that Canada must change.
However, one of the objectives of the EU-Canada agreement is that we should work together to create a stronger trade area than the North American free trade agreement (NAFTA) area.
This is not just about economic cooperation, but also about sending out a clear signal that protectionism is not acceptable.
It is a lucky coincidence that Joe Biden is speaking in the European Parliament in Brussels on the same day as the EU-Canada Summit is taking place, because effective, professional cooperation with both parts of the North American continent is important to us and because together, we want to take more responsibility in the world.
