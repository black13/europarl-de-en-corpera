Mr President, I would like to highlight a very serious problem in enforcing intellectual property rights in these negotiations.
Critical comments from Canadian professors of law and also from Harvard indicate that the planned agreement could amount to a complete revision of Canadian copyright, patent and trademark law.
On the one hand, the Canadians feel that their sovereignty and their right to make use of their own intellectual property are being restricted.
However, on the other hand, strict and precise rules governing copy protection and the extension of this protection to cover films are very, very important.
It seems to me particularly crucial to include the Internet in any discussions on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, because it is impossible to protect intellectual property on the Internet without cross-border agreements.
I am in favour of a specific ban on recording with video cameras in cinemas.
This should be enforced in Canada.
However, it is important for us to find a middle way.
We should support the protection of intellectual property, but oppose blanket surveillance and persecution on the Internet.
Of course, it is also important to take into account that Canada has a different legal tradition and a different legal system.
This is a very difficult problem to solve, but I hope that we can find an effective solution.
