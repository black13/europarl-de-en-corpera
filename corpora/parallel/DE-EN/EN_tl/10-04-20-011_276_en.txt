Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, our most important concern should be to provide support for small and medium-sized businesses, particularly during an economic crisis.
These companies employ two-thirds of all workers and generate 80% of tax income.
For this reason, it is essential for public tenders to focus on giving small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to be awarded public contracts.
Of course, the technical regulations, in other words, the trade facilitation measures, must also be adequately taken into consideration in this agreement.
What I would like to know is whether there is an agreement with the World Trade Organisation to incorporate the basic principles of the Doha negotiations into this free trade agreement.
