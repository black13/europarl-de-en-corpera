Mr President, thank you for the excellent report.
It makes me feel quite optimistic that establishing the European credit rating authority will finally make us independent of private US agencies.
However, what interests me in this context is not only the location, but also the functional and structural composition of this European credit rating authority.
Ultimately, it is important for an organisation of this kind to have teeth.
I am, of course, also interested in the expected consequences of the proceedings and in the consequences of a member of the euro area having a bad creditworthiness rating.
