Mr Barnier, in the first Roaming Regulation for data exchange and telephony, we established a must-carry obligation, which means that every operator in Europe must be able to reach every customer.
Conflicts are now suddenly arising from the fact that operators are removing these services from the networks and are not prepared to provide the necessary support.
Do you think it is necessary for the national regulatory bodies to take action in this case?
