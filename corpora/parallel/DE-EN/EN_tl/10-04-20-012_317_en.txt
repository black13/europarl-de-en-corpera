Mr De Gucht, I just have two supplementary points to make.
Firstly, will the Commission attempt to encourage Sweden to fulfil its obligations?
Sweden has an obligation under the treaties and this cannot just be interpreted arbitrarily.
Secondly, what is happening about Estonia?
Do you think that Estonia will become a member in the foreseeable future, perhaps even this year?
