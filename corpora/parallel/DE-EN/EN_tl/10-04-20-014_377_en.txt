Mr President, Mr Hahn, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Hahn has summed up the purpose of our debate this evening, which is to provide rapid and targeted help.
We urgently need to speed up the implementation of these programmes.
I believe that the third amendment to the general structural funds regulation is a response to the financial crisis and should, as has already been said, allow for rapid and, in particular, easy access to these funds.
We know from past experience that money from the Structural Funds has made a significant contribution to improving quality of life, creating jobs and giving people a future in the regions.
I believe that in times such as these, the solidarity of the European Union is needed in order to provide emergency funding.
As we have said, both flexibility and solidarity are required.
Measures to combat the crisis are indications of this solidarity and we need the flexible advance payments so that these projects, which improve quality of life and create jobs, can be implemented.
As the rapporteur - or in this case, this evening Mrs Krehl - has already mentioned, there was an almost unpardonable delay in adopting this regulation.
From this perspective in particular, future cohesion policy should be designed in such a way that it does not put procedural and technical obstacles in the way of quick and efficient implementation of regional policy.
Therefore, I support the rapporteur's call for this amendment to the structural fund regulation to enter into force quickly.
We must provide rapid and targeted help.
