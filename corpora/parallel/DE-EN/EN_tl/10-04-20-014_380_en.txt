Mr President, I will be happy to answer the question.
Investment in large projects is being simplified.
This applies to investments of up to EUR 50 million which, until now, have been evaluated by the EU, because we are responsible for taxpayers' money.
I am of the opinion that the situation should remain unchanged for large projects because, in our experience, these projects often start with excessive investment and end up with the burden being borne by the citizens.
