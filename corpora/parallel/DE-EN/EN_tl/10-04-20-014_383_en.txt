Mr President, the only question is why your group, Mrs Ernst, has not tabled an amendment in plenary?
There was an opportunity to table amendments so that the Commission's original draft could be reused.
It may also have been possible to renegotiate the 100% financing of the European Structural Funds with the Council.
