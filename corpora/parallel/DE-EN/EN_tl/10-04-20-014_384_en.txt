Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, I think we believed that we had only a limited chance and therefore decided against it.
I assume that my colleague thought the same thing.
When I looked at the Commission's overall initiative, I was thrilled.
However, after long discussions on these subjects in the last few days, I have learnt a few things.
I would have liked to see more.
It is true that we could have submitted an amendment, you are right.
However, if we are honest with one another, we know what will happen and this is why my group decided against an amendment.
I must take note of that myself.
