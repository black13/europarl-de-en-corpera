Mr President, Mr Hahn, cohesion policy is an important political tool.
It gives us the opportunity to help to combat the crisis, to stimulate demand in the short term and, at the same time, to invest in long-term growth and competitiveness.
It is important to make it very clear that cohesion policy and, in particular, the advance payments and more rapid local implementation in 2009 made a very significant contribution to boosting purchasing power which benefited the economy and helped to limit the fall in private consumption.
Cohesion policy also forms a very important part of the Europe 2020 strategy.
Therefore, I do not understand why your fellow Commissioner, Mr Rehn, has linked sanction mechanisms for a failure to comply with the regulations of the single financial market to restrictions on regional policy.
