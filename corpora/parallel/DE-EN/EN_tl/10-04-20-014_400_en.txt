Mr President, I will be happy to pass on all the praise and the positive assessments from today's discussion to Mr Kirilov.
I would like to highlight two points once again.
We only have European taxpayers' money to spend and therefore we must make the access to the funds as simple and as transparent as possible.
That is the aim of this report.
However, I also believe - and this request is directed at Mrs Schroedter - that we should not imply that the individual Member States are not doing everything possible to comply with European law.
This is what I understand from reading between the lines today and I do not think we should imply this about anyone.
I work on the assumption that all the Member States and all the institutions do everything they can to ensure that European funds are used efficiently and correctly.
I would like to make a second remark to Mrs Swinburne, but not just to her.
This is not about handing out charity to poor regions.
We are subsidising regions to increase purchasing power and create jobs, because the purchasing power in these regions forms part of the overall contribution to ensuring that Europe can begin manufacturing and selling products again.
This will strengthen the internal market.
In other words, it is not simply an act of general solidarity.
Anyone who knows something about the economy and the world of business will understand, not only from a social perspective, but also from a business and economic point of view, why we need regional policy and why we can use it as a rapid and efficient measure, in particular, in times of crisis, for stimulating the European economy in all of Europe's regions.
