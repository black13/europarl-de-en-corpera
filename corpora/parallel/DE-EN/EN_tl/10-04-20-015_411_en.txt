Mr President, Mr Ciolo≈ü, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental reorientation of agricultural policy to focus more on the market economy is the right approach to take.
The decision to increase the links between European agriculture and the world market is also correct.
The initial success of this policy was very obvious until 2007 or early 2008.
European agricultural policy offered better value for money.
There were hardly any market interventions and farmers had stable, rising incomes.
However, we are currently seeing the downside of this reorientation which includes large price fluctuations and falling farm incomes.
Both farmers and agricultural policy makers must be able to accommodate major producer price fluctuations in all areas in future, not just in the dairy sector.
In order to manage serious falls in the market more effectively, agricultural policy needs tools which allow it to react rapidly, consistently and without a lot of red tape.
Therefore, I am calling for measures such as interventions or export subsidies not to be abolished altogether but to be included in the budget with a figure of zero.
These instruments should only be used in exceptional circumstances and not for constant market interventions.
However, when we need the instruments, they must be ready for use.
We also need to identify measures for the farming profession which will create equality on the market.
These include, in particular, strengthening the legal position of producer groups.
I hope that the Commission will keep its promise to consider better basic legal conditions and then take measures quickly when they are needed in order to prevent farmers and consumers from suffering serious harm.
