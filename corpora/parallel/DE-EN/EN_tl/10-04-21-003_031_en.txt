Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to address one point, a point that really is a scandal.
I am talking about the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC in Stockholm.
Since May 2005, highly qualified people there have had to work in an absolutely hostile environment.
Until now, the Swedish Government has been unable to conclude an accord de siege with the ECDC, although they desperately wanted this agency, like all Member States always badly want an agency.
To this day, none of the employees have a personal identity number, the so-called Folkbokf√∂ring number.
However, this number is used by public administrations, institutions and private companies to identify their customers.
Consequently, children born in Sweden cannot be registered, for example, providers of electricity, gas, telecommunications and television withhold their services, landlords refuse long-term tenancy agreements and there are problems accessing doctors and hospitals.
For spouses, it means it is impossible to become self-employed in Sweden.
There are also enormous difficulties in getting a job.
The list could go on.
One thing is clear: certain fundamental rights anchored in European law are simply being denied to the staff at the ECDC in Sweden.
As a result, all of this has landed before our Committee on Petitions.
In any case, the situation is untenable ....
