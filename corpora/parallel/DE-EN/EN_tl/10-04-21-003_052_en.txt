Thank you Minister.
Thank you very much for so kindly complying with our request.
That gives me cause to say that the Commission never receives a formal invitation to this sitting either.
I have been a Member of this House for a while and I have noticed that in cases like yours, when the Council is represented here - even when it is not really necessary - it contributes greatly to the success of a Presidency.
In this respect, I should like to thank you again very much.
