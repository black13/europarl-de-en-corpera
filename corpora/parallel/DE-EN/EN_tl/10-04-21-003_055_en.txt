Thank you very much, Mrs Weiler.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just checked again in the rules of procedure: we are not supposed to sing songs in plenary, without first asking the Conference of Presidents.
However, we are allowed to congratulate a colleague.
Mr Chatzimarkakis, whose birthday it is today, has the floor for two and a half minutes.
Many happy returns!
