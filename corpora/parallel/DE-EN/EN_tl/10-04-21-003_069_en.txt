Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to say I was happy that I only had to travel to Strasbourg this week and not to Brussels, because Strasbourg is much closer for me and therefore it was a great advantage to be able to travel unhindered despite the interruption in flight connections.
My second request regards budgetary control.
We still have the same old pack of paper that shows what is going through plenary this week.
I would be pleased if we could receive a computer here in our workstations, particularly since we can view everything electronically, so that when voting, we then have the amendments in our own languages in front of us and the vote can be carried out in a targeted manner.
We have hundreds of votes, always at midday, and it would be good if we did not have to haul the paper around with us, but had the texts provided in electronic form.
After all, the European Parliament should be at the leading edge of technology.
Thirdly, when we travel somewhere, we then have all the accounting to do, which has recently become very bureaucratic.
It is a large additional burden for us as MEPs, but also for the administration of the House.
The additional audit imposes additional conditions.
We should establish a working party here that reverts to what is essential - correct and precise accounting - in order to reduce the bureaucratic burden by 25%, and not raise it by 50%, as has happened in recent months.
As far as structure is concerned, I would ask the Commission to check whether, since many countries are currently in crisis in terms of the financial situation, we should focus more on investments in the Cohesion Fund and the Regional Fund and not so much on the consumption of European funding.
Even an increase of funds to 1.27% of Gross National Income (GNI) would be sensible in order to achieve more in investment activities.
