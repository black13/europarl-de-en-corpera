Mr President, if we want a European Union that is accepted by its citizens, then it is crucial that citizens also know what is being done with the money they pay in taxes.
Therefore, Mrs Schaldemose's demand for more transparency is perfectly justified and I believe this is where the European project stands or falls.
However, it is not just about transparency, it is also about readability.
We are, as it were, paid to deal with such matters full-time.
I think that when they occasionally look at such a document, citizens should also be able to do something concrete with it.
Thus, we must call on the Commission to work on the readability of its documents, in particular, those concerning the budgetary framework.
Then citizens would know very quickly how large or small the EU budget is and how much is always demanded of the EU.
The fact that Member States expect the EU to do something but, on the other hand, are not so ready to provide any money, is a political problem that we all have, and this is a field that the Commission should tackle in the coming years.
