Mr President, a few words on the particularly critical discussion concerning the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance for Turkey.
This has increased steadily since 2002, although Turkey is taking more steps backward than forward.
The latest special report by the Court of Auditors reveals major problems.
Funds were not spent effectively and were not sufficiently evaluated.
I therefore call on the Commission to go out and explain to EU citizens before discharge what exactly has happened to the EUR 800 million a year for Turkey.
Now to the different agencies in general.
The uncontrolled growth, the establishment, reestablishment and expansion of EU agencies, which has almost tripled since 2000, clearly contradicts the demands of the Lisbon Strategy for less bureaucracy.
This also includes the new European Asylum Support Office.
Although we are talking about 2008, a word on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
I would really like to know whether it was asleep when, at the beginning of the year, hard drugs were legalised in the Czech Republic and now, thanks to open borders, we have fabulous drug tourism.
So we are tough as nails with smokers, but are caught napping when it comes to hard drugs.
