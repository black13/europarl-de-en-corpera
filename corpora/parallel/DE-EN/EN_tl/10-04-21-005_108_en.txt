Mr President, thank you, Commissioner Malmstr√∂m.
The negotiating mandate before us shows, above all, that the Commission and Parliament are again taking the same line and that cooperation has at least got off to a good start.
The fact that the European Parliament rejected the agreement in February - and I address this to all those who have described it as muscle flexing - has nothing to do with muscle flexing; it is about assuming responsibility.
Assuming responsibility for the rights of those that we represent, namely the citizens of Europe.
The negotiations on the new agreement on the transfer of bank data now under way will, above all, answer the crucial question as to where Parliament and the European Union stand on respect.
Respect among partners, respect for citizens and respect for European legislation.
We were able to slip a lot of things that are important to us into this negotiating mandate.
The resolution that we will adopt in May very much reflects those things that specifically concern the protection of our citizens, both their data and their judicial remedies, including extraterritorial protection, particularly when their rights could be violated extraterritorially.
We have talked a lot about the transfer of aggregated data, so-called bulk data transfers.
What we must clarify is the fact that in the mandate concluded, we must set out how and when this problem will be resolved.
Otherwise, it will be very difficult to represent the whole thing in light of what we have formulated so far.
The European Parliament's resolution highlights this in two paragraphs, the negotiating mandate in one.
I am confident that the Commission will resolve this in a sensible manner.
