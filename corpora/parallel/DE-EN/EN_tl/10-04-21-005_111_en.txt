Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the previous speaker, I would expressly like to thank both Commissioner Malmstr√∂m and Commissioner Reding for their intensive efforts to take up the issues that have been raised by Parliament, as well as the problems that we see and have seen in the area of data security and confidentiality, in order to negotiate with the United States.
I am also grateful that key issues - as mentioned by my fellow Members - have already been analysed or considered in the mandate and that, in particular, this also includes issues in the area of inspection as well as the area of reciprocity.
On the matter of the erasure of data, I also consider it very important to be able to renegotiate the five-year period, since it is really not acceptable to hold data for such a long time.
I also feel it is important to ultimately discuss the matter of penalties in cases of deliberate extraction to the wrong ends in sensitive circumstances, since that prevents certain things being extracted that we do not want to see extracted.
The focus should only be on terrorism.
To me, what is also important is the idea that we have to tackle our own TFTP and that in the longer term, we cannot transfer bulk data, that is to say, large amounts of data to the United States.
That has nothing to do with mistrust, but the fact that in the long term, we ultimately want to take our own responsibility within Europe on an equal footing, and then exchange specific extracted data for the sole purpose of combating terrorism and finally maintain real reciprocity.
In this context, I would again like to ask the Commission to indicate how the topic of our own TFTP is viewed within the Commission and in the joint discussion with the Council.
