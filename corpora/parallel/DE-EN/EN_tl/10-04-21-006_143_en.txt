Madam President, freedom over the clouds, as the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey once sang, will come to an abrupt end with the agreement with the USA on the retrieval of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data.
In August, a member of our group staff experienced first hand the effects the restriction of this freedom is already having.
Since the US authorities had put his name on their terror watch lists, the aircraft in which he was flying was not allowed to cross US air space.
As we all know in this House, this had considerable disadvantages and it was later revealed that there had been a misunderstanding.
Today, US authorities are already receiving a wide variety of data - credit card numbers, booking data, seating preferences, special food preferences, IP addresses and passenger information - without clear data protection regulations.
I would like to say quite clearly that we reject that, as well as the bulk transfer of data relating to flying, referred to as PNR, as it now is to be developed.
We cannot support it as it is currently formulated, because it is not for a specific purpose, and it is not proportionate or useful.
Finally, I would like to say that we must not allow the emergence of proactive risk analyses of patterns of travel and behaviour.
We need disclosure regulations like the USA's privacy act.
These must be opened to European citizens.
The way to legal action must likewise stand open to them.
