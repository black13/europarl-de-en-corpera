Madam President, today we have before us the second dossier of an agreement with the USA that is beset with huge problems in matters of data protection.
That actually brings me to the confirmation of the proposal by our European Data Protection Supervisor, Mr Hustinx, who said that it would make sense to once and for all negotiate and conclude a comprehensive transatlantic framework agreement on data protection.
That would be a rewarding task for both sides and would help us in many ways.
In general it is clear that we have completely different concepts of security here and on the other side of the Atlantic.
As the European Parliament, we must also ensure that our Commission does not merely accept what the USA proposes, but brings our standards into these negotiations with a sense of proportion and on an equal footing.
Therefore, a definition of the term 'serious crime' is vital.
Clear correction of data must be possible.
For us, data protection must be activated, otherwise this agreement is a non-starter.
