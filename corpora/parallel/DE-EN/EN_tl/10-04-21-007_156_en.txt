Madam President, I am pleased that Commissioner Malmström is here, but in this case, I would rather have seen her colleague Mr Potočnik, the responsible Commissioner, because this problem is for him to solve.
I would like to say first of all that Europe produces 0.73% of the world's gold and that gold is currently being mined in Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Sweden.
Not all use these dangerous cyanide technologies.
I would also like to point out that the task force that was set up to investigate the accident in Baia Mare has established that the plant design was unsuitable for the storage and disposal of mine waste, that the authorisation of this design was not checked by the supervisory authorities and that there was insufficient monitoring of the damming and plant operation, so there were many mistakes on the part of the plant operator.
As the Commissioner has correctly established, we have learned from this accident.
However, I believe the Commission should draw further conclusions in view of this very dangerous technology.
Since, to my knowledge, the alternative technologies that are on the market do not yet offer the results that we actually want, we should also consider what we can do in the area of research and development, to secure the future of gold production, but also to guarantee plant safety.
On many occasions, Europe has committed itself to adhering to high environmental protection standards.
I would remind you of the Water Framework Directive that clearly aims to prevent these hazards, but also commitments in the area of biodiversity.
Therefore, I ask you, Mrs Malmström, to pass on to Commissioner Potočnik our clear demand that progress be made in the area of gold production on the part of the Commission, the European legislator.
