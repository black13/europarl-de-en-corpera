Mr President, the speeches by Mrs Roithová, Mr Březina and Mr Mészáros really convinced me, since they described how there was similarly indiscriminate exploitation in the country in which they lived previously, namely Communist Czechoslovakia, how there has been a change in attitude and how today, they are the ones who are advocating environmental protection and common European standards.
I believe we need this change in attitude throughout Europe.
We must be aware of the fact that we are in the process of developing new technologies.
Why not stretch out the mining of a reserve that is running out anyway and first of all develop these new technologies?
I would like to make one point quite clear: if we are not careful, something irretrievable will be destroyed and future generations will damn us for it.
I therefore really must ask for a long-term approach here.
It is crucial that we have uniform European standards, since rivers cross borders and cyanide is, of course, also an environmental hazard that crosses borders.
