Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Takkula has just said, cyanide technology is a common method in mining.
However, as we have heard, it is highly dangerous.
The disaster that Mrs BÄƒsescu just mentioned contaminated the Danube at the time and shocked us all, and you know that I campaign strongly for the Danube region.
For that reason, as a trade politician, I wonder what can we do about it?
In the European Union, we only have limited gold mining capacities.
The goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovations.
Here, there is high technology, I know.
In Germany environmental technologies were developed that will help to avoid cyanide in the future.
We must make these European high technologies commercially viable and we must make them affordable.
I see great potential for trade in this.
We should not confine ourselves to the European Union, but ensure that here, we also achieve a breakthrough in international trade, in the interests of the environment and our economy.
