Mr President, I would briefly like to clarify as my fellow Member perhaps misunderstood as a result of the translation.
I know Baia Mare very well and know that it is not in the former Czechoslovakia, but in the north of Transylvania.
I know it really well.
That was a translation error.
I merely alluded to the speeches by Mr Březina, Mrs Roithová and Mr Mészáros that referred to experiences in Kašperské Hory or Bergreichenstein, etc.
I am familiar with the geography of Central Europe.
