The costs of a task that is to be undertaken by the state, namely the maintenance of public safety, cannot simply be passed on like this.
We need to decide what costs passengers can reasonably be expected to pay in respect of the ever more restrictive anti-terror security regulations.
Only if countries themselves have to take financial responsibility for the strict security measures which have been prescribed, and are also able to make their own decisions with regard to these measures, can we prevent the possibility of an unrestrained increase in body scanners and other similar measures.
The only people to profit from the hysteria surrounding terrorism and the uncontrolled competition to become better equipped will be innovative US companies.
For these reasons, this proposal is to be welcomed.
