The EU has confirmed the importance of the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor by giving priority status to the northern arm from Gda≈Ñsk to the Czech Republic and declaring its commitment to the Brenner Base Tunnel project.
It is even more important to develop the southern part of the corridor via the Austrian Southern Railway to Italy.
In this network in particular, which carries approximately half of all goods and passengers, we need to neutralise a dangerous eye-of-the-needle situation.
Support from the EU for the Koralm project is essential on account of the existing bottlenecks in this region on the rail routes for freight transport; which, after all, the EU is always championing.
With the Koralm Tunnel, the EU has a unique opportunity to shift traffic to the railways on a scale that we have been striving for for decades.
As the development of the trans-European network may be crucial for Europe's competitiveness and the amendments tabled are merely technical adjustments, I have voted in favour of the report.
