In times of crisis, the EU is once again showing its true colours.
When the eastern EU Member States had to freeze during the Russian gas dispute there was little sign of solidarity.
Now, when it concerns the economic chestnut of the euro - the flagship of the EU - suddenly something is possible.
EU subsidies have even been adjusted accordingly.
Although the possible 100% reimbursement for 2009 and 2010 for financing labour market policy measures did not promote further education and high-quality apprenticeships to the extent that we would have liked, it is certainly essential in the current situation.
All Member States would benefit from the decommitment of the budget commitment and those countries with the most problems would receive additional advance payments.
Putting money into a bottomless pit at will without accompanying measures can be dangerous.
I have therefore rejected the proposal.
