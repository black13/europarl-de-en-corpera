Around a million books, maps and photographs from the EU Member States can be accessed in the Europeana digital library.
The fact that commercial operators register considerably more hits with Google Books and have progressed further in their development is logical and is associated with the greater level of awareness of Google Books.
In order to achieve more rapid progress with Europeana and to make the digital library more familiar, we first need to get more universities and institutions involved in the project.
Only then can we talk about more financial resources.
Even if Europeana is important for European cultural heritage and knowledge, understanding for an increase in funds - and to be provided from economic-development funds, too - is limited, particularly at a time of financial crisis and in view of the billions going to help Greece.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
