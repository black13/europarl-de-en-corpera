For years the EU has been trying to attain standardised directives on matters relating to animal husbandry.
Progress has been made in the area of intensive livestock farming in particular, but there is still work to be done.
In any case, it makes sense to continue with the Action Plan; particularly in connection with the enforcement of existing laws and directives.
In this regard, mention clearly needs to be made once again of the problem of dogs being imported from the East, in respect of which not all of the loopholes in the existing regulations have yet been closed.
Sick and neglected animals, most taken far too early from their mothers, are transported to the West in the most deplorable conditions to be sold here for a lot of money.
This report should be seen as a positive step in the right direction and that is why I have voted in favour of it.
