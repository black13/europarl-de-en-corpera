There is no doubt that farms in the outermost regions are in particular need of financial support.
Small mountain farms often have to fight to survive, as it is scarcely possible for them to react quickly to new market requirements.
Smallholders in particular lack the staff to be able to remain competitive.
Consequently, from a business point of view alone, their situation is much more difficult than that of large agricultural undertakings in exposed locations.
The high rate of farms going under in the past few years and the increase in part-time farmers clearly show that the EU subsidy policy focuses far too heavily on intensive livestock farming and the like.
In order for the EU Member States to remain even remotely self-sufficient, it is high time we renationalised our farming subsidies.
With a view to a fairer distribution of compensation payments, I have voted in favour of this report.
