The comprehensive report on Latin America takes a sensible approach in providing for the development of relations between the EU and the South American States by means of a strategic partnership.
This creation of a Euro-Latin American area has the potential not only to bring positive economic results but also, above all, to strengthen the role of the EU as a foreign-policy player, particularly in respect of the United States.
Unfortunately, the report also contains some paragraphs and certain wordings which hint at the almost missionary zeal of some Members of this House and which could be construed as too much interference in the internal affairs of the South American States.
It is neither necessary nor meaningful to prescribe in detail how these countries should organise their economy or their education and science policies, or the details of how they regulate their foreign policy.
It is absurd to call on the Latin American countries to introduce sex education, for example.
I therefore abstained during the final vote.
