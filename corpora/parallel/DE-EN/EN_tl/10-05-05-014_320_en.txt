I have voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the EU-Canada Summit, held today, as I think that it is important not only to maintain relations at a high level, but also to deepen and improve them further.
In particular, the planned joint action for the introduction of a bank levy or financial transaction tax at a global level should also be emphasised in this context.
