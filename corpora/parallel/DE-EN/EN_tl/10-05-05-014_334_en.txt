The motion for a resolution on the negotiations for a new SWIFT agreement contains numerous detailed proposals for how data protection can be improved in future in connection with making financial messaging data available to the United States.
That is very much to be welcomed.
However, in so doing, it conceals the question of the fundamental necessity of such a massive invasion of privacy.
This is clearly simply assumed.
However, it is unclear whether we can counter the phenomenon of terrorism effectively in this way.
It is also unclear how the calls for more data protection are to be implemented in practice.
We know from past experience and common practice that data are used as extensively as possible and often also for profit.
I therefore reject the transfer of highly personal data on principle and thus also voted against the motion for a resolution.
