For the reasons already mentioned in connection with the SWIFT agreement, I oppose the transfer of data, in particular if the constructive use of these data cannot really be demonstrated or if the misuse of the data cannot be ruled out.
The motion for a resolution refers to the possible dangers in detail and recommends postponement of the vote on the request for consent on the agreements with the US and Australia on passenger name record data.
For this reason, I voted in favour of the motion.
