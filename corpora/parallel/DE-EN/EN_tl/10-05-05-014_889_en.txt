According to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the legislator can delegate a certain amount of power to the Commission, in which connection the Commission may only supplement or amend a legislative act.
The 'delegated acts' adopted accordingly by the Commission are non-legislative acts of general application.
The rapporteur is advocating the stricter monitoring of the Commission in its exercising of its delegated legislative powers.
For this reason, I voted in favour of the adoption of the report.
