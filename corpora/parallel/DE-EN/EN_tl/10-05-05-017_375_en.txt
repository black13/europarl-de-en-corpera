Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo.
I see no need to convene a convention.
It is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified.
Since 1979, the European Parliament has been elected in a direct and secret ballot and that is the way it should continue to be done in future, too.
We and the Council would be well advised to deal with this problem as quickly as possible at an intergovernmental conference, because out of the 18 Members, 16 are in a state of suspense, which is rather intolerable.
The ball is therefore back in the Council's court.
I would ask the Council not to give in on this point because one Member State has failed to find clear rules on account of it expecting the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force sooner.
I am pleased that we now have this Treaty in place, but we now have our homework to do.
The Méndez de Vigo report is a good basis for strengthening this process.
However, the Council would be well advised not to succumb to the temptation to accept Members being sent here from a national parliament.
That would set a precedent and I am not happy to accept that.
Therefore, the rapporteur has my full support, with the proviso that no Members be sent here from national parliaments.
