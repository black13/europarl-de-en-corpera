Madam President, I too should like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, and also to all of the shadow rapporteurs.
As Parliament, we should send out a clear signal today that we are very much looking forward to having the new Members here in Parliament and that the Council is indeed remiss.
It should once again be highlighted here that we have the very clear task of finding a solution as quickly as possible so that freely elected Members - 18 of them in fact - can start their work as soon as possible.
As Parliament, we have not only the very general task of representing the people in the best way possible but also the job of working as efficiently and effectively as possible in the committees, and to do this we also expect to draw on the expertise and knowledge of those fellow Members who have largely already been freely and properly elected.
As an Austrian, I very much look forward to seeing Joe Weidenholzer here and I hope that we shall be able to welcome him here as a Member of Parliament as soon as possible.
