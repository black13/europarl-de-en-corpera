Madam President, the ink is barely dry on the abortive Treaty of Lisbon and already the next amendments have been tabled, and the chaos surrounding our new Members - people are talking about phantom Members - is truly perfect.
This has of course been caused, among other things, by our different election systems, which give rise to democracy-related problems.
In France, for example, where candidates stand at a regional level and no lists are available, it is not very difficult to allow Members to move up.
We should speak out clearly in favour of an election and not selection by a parliament.
Secondly, it would also make perfect sense - and this is what the citizens expect - for us to provide specific information on the activities and earnings of Members during the observation period.
This 'phantom' situation will certainly not do much for citizens' confidence in the EU.
We also need to provide clarification as quickly as possible as to when the new Members should come and what status they should have.
Moreover, it is still not clear whether the Treaty of Lisbon will be re-examined - which would be desirable - and what the situation is with regard to Croatia's accession.
Citizens expect a quick resolution of this matter by the Council.
