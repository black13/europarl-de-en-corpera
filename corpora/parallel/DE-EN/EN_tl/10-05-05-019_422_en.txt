Madam President, if I compare the debate on the last agenda item with the current debate, then we are clearly talking about two parallel worlds.
On the one side we have a European Union in which States like Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal find themselves in a deep crisis and other States like Germany and France are taking blocking action, while on the other side we have a European Union for which a strategy has been developed that does not in any way meet these challenges.
With this strategy, we have neither defined a new direction for the development of the European Union nor have we provided answers to the questions relating to instruments that do not work.
Similarly, we have not made any attempt to clarify the distribution of competences between Member States and the European Union or the relationship between the euro area and the countries in the European Union that are not part of the euro area.
We have not included any of the issues that came up over the last few years in connection with the Lisbon Strategy and we have not given any forward-looking answers.
We have provided no clarification with regard to the future development of the European Union.
This has, of course, given rise to much of the discord that we can now sense.
With regard to the discussion on European economic governance and the European monetary fund, too, we cannot simply act as if it is possible to continue with this strategy in this way.
Before we talk about the implementation of Europe 2020, we urgently need to put the strategy on hold and give ourselves more time for the decision-making process and we need to carry out an analysis of the actual challenges we face.
In so doing, we need to involve civil society and, above all, Parliament to a significantly greater extent than has been the case in the past.
Otherwise, we will be heading for disaster with our eyes wide open!
