Madam President, smart, sustainable growth, actionism, reforms, economic governance - many fine words and lofty goals.
However, I have a couple of questions in this regard that give me cause for concern.
Will the proclaimed new strategy suffer a similar fate to its predecessor?
How can we involve the regions and local authorities so that this strategy will actually succeed and, in particular, how can we better encourage and monitor the reorganisation of national budgets?
However, with our model solutions we must be very careful to ensure that a centralistic form of European economic governance does not slip in through the back door and erode the last remnants of national sovereignty.
Sovereignty also means taking responsibility, and consequently taking responsibility for the wrong finance policy.
It is unacceptable for some Member States to live beyond their means at the cost of the other Member States.
We must show solidarity, of course, but it must not be a one-way street.
Centralistic economic governance from Brussels dictating the European standard would surely be the wrong way to go.
