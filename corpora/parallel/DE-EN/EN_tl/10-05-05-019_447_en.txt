Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the community of Europe, a credible political union, sustainable growth, sustainable employment and innovation, social cohesion and sustainable competitiveness are our goals.
Europe 2020 is not our goal.
Europe 2020 must be an instrument to enable us to achieve our goals.
It must become our Robert Schuman declaration of 2010 and be as tangible as that was on 9 May 1950.
Europe 2020 must not degenerate into a collection of unattainable desires for the future or a dustbin full of all of our unresolved issues, problems and frustrations.
It must be a tangible, financeable, sustainable instrument that provides an answer to the crisis and it must be a motivating, testable project of the European Union that we are able to sanction.
Europe 2020 must set in motion specific projects for growth, employment, research, innovation and sustainable competitiveness.
We need to review our finances in all Member States and in the European Union in order to have an honest starting point for our future plans and also so that we know what we need to finance and what we need the money for.
We also need a Europe 2020 suitability check for our national policies on the budget, tax, research, energy, innovation and social affairs.
We should give our full support to Mr Rehn's measures.
Europe 2020 must be an expression of the new, common political will and our response to the, sadly, increasing nationalism, egoism and protectionism.
Let us complete the internal market and, alongside the monetary union, create a strong economic union that is part of a credible political union.
That is what we need, no more and no less.
