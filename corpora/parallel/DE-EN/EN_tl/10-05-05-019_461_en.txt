Thank you very much Mr President.
Mr Barroso talked about measures that we need to take in connection with Europe 2020, but then he left the Chamber.
He will now miss one of the most important measures.
I am therefore going to address the Spanish Presidency and thank the President-in-Office of the Council for remaining here and following the debate to its conclusion.
One of the most important measures that needs to be taken in the context of Europe 2020 is the employment of sustainable development in order to exploit the potential for green jobs.
This requires a comprehensive initiative for these potential green jobs.
In this connection, it must be ensured that transformations and workers' rights are also taken into account and that there is an initiative in place for training and further training.
I know that the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies are working on this and I would like to expressly encourage you to continue to do so and to present a Council initiative before the end of the year.
