Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 6 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that the EU shall accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which represents a strengthening of the system of fundamental rights within the EU.
The European Convention on Human Rights is extremely important for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.
Our affiliation to this legal system would strengthen the fundamental rights of EU citizens, as they would gain an additional means of legal remedy in the event that they considered their fundamental rights violated.
I view the accession of the EU to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as a very positive step, as it will also raise awareness of the importance of fundamental rights in the EU and ideally increase the credibility of the EU with regard to its external relations.
