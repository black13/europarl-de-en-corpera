Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, traffic in Europe is responsible for around 30% of CO2 emissions, with road transport accounting for the greatest part of that.
Avoiding, switching and improving are therefore the order of the day.
We need to find the most environmentally friendly propulsion technology for vehicles.
Electric vehicles include trains, trams, buses, cars and bicycles.
The prerequisite for this, however, is that there must be no revival of the hazardous nuclear energy, which is why the production of renewable energy is the conditio sine qua non.
In addition, the result of the whole cycle from production via use through to waste and recycling must be a positive one.
Only then shall we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance be able to support electromobility.
Replacing the current car fleet with electric cars will neither resolve the problem of congestion nor protect the climate.
There are five disadvantages of car transport: the noise, the pollutants, the accident figures, the costs and the land use.
At most, electric cars solve the emissions problem.
The area of land used alone is immense.
For this reason, Germany, for example, has undertaken to limit the amount of land sealed under concrete and asphalt each day to 30 hectares from 2020.
It is currently 117 hectares a day.
Therefore, the number of cars must be reduced.
For the remaining cars and also for trains, buses, trams and electric bikes we need the most environmentally friendly technology.
If that turns out to be electromobility, we shall need European and international standardisation.
The Greens will vote in favour of this resolution.
