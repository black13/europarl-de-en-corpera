Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank the Spanish Presidency and also the Commission for bringing the subject of electromobility to the fore.
I also believe that we can use electromobility to revitalise the mobility economy in Europe, and we need to do that in order to create value and to safeguard jobs.
However - to use another metaphor - we need to step on the accelerator, because the issue of electromobility affects many policy areas.
There is, of course, the issue of standardisation, technology, but also the question of the integration of electromobility into the whole transport system, because we may need new forms of mobility, particularly in urban areas.
Energy must be renewable and we need raw materials, so trade is also affected.
Therefore, I would ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps integrate electromobility further in the follow-on from Cars 21.
