Mr President, I would like to talk today about the subject of air safety.
This topic has occupied us a great deal in the last few weeks and it has affected us all.
Human life is more important than any economic gain.
This is precisely why I am in favour of a flight ban if there is an external risk, an ash cloud for example, to the safety of passengers, as it would be irresponsible to put lives at risk.
I would remind you of the two near-disasters in 1982 and 1989 and the fighter jet in which glass fragments caused by the ash cloud were found.
Test flights have been undertaken, but the evaluation is taking time.
Experts have been consulted, but their responses do not point conclusively in any particular direction.
The fact remains that lives are precious and should not be put at risk, and efficient and affordable alternatives to aviation ought to be implemented.
