Mr President, the European Parliament has today granted discharge to the Commission for 2008, and that is a good thing.
The irregularity rate for the EU funds paid out has never been as low as in this year.
In the last three years it has been possible to halve the areas in which the irregularity rate was above 5% and therefore above the tolerance limit.
The area of cohesion alone leaves a great deal to be desired.
More effort needs to be made particularly in this area in the future.
The area of agriculture and natural resources needs to be highlighted in particular.
The irregularity rate in this area was below 2% and was therefore very clearly in the green zone.
The monitoring and control systems are effective.
In this context, however, I would also like to mention the pre-accession aid for Turkey referred to in the discharge report.
An increase in the funds for Turkey is highly questionable in view of the lack of measureable criteria.
It is unacceptable to give EU funds to third countries without any established indicators.
Direct control of the payments and how the funds are used is essential.
Only then can the aid actually have the desired effect.
