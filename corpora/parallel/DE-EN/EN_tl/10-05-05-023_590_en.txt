Mr President, Commissioner, you have now listened to us and you could almost think of it as the difference between theory and practice.
I can only repeat the plea that I made to the President of the Commission back in spring 2009.
We have unresolved issues for vehicle dealers, for the small and medium-sized enterprises, a financial and economic crisis and an uncertain growth and employment market.
The best thing to do would be to extend the existing regulation rather than creating a new one that will just compound all of these problems.
We have the problem of different national regulations if only single branding remains.
We are opposed to a non-mandatory code of conduct and in favour of an efficient enforcement mechanism.
We want the 30% limit for the purchase of replacement parts to be left as it is, because it allows authorised car dealers greater freedom of choice.
The guidelines are not clear enough to ensure that there is access to technical information as there was before.
There are important contractual clauses that you have simply left out, namely those concerning the notice provisions and notice periods, multi-branding, the transfer of businesses and the settlement of disputes.
Please stand up for small and medium-sized enterprises, too.
Multi-branding is part of competition and helps to protect consumers.
We want more competition.
Restricting the options of small and medium-sized enterprises and car dealers will reduce competition.
Please give serious consideration to the market, the enterprises and Parliament's resolution and use the 21 days that remain available to you.
