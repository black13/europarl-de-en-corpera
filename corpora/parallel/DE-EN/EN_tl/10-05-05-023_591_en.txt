Mr President, Commissioner, all of the speakers in Parliament have actually now spoken out in favour of an SME-friendly regulation.
We need a strong distribution system.
Small distributors employ a lot of people.
It is important for them that competition within the system remains, just as it is for the dealers - regardless of whether they are large or small.
Competition must work.
I believe that, in the car sector in particular, consumers also have a right to competition that works, so that they are not faced with very one-sided systems in which there is no longer freedom of choice.
It is precisely this freedom of choice that will be important in the future, particularly for rural areas, and we need to ensure that rural areas are comprehensively provided for.
I therefore believe that Mr Karas was absolutely right when he said that we have very little time left and we should therefore use it efficiently.
