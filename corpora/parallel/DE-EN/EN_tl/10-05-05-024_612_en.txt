Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, health is a precious thing that it is important to preserve.
Cancer is a global problem that continues to persist, despite medical advances.
According to estimates by the World Health Organisation, in 2004 13% of all deaths were caused by cancer.
In the EU, around 3.2 million people develop cancer each year.
The main types of cancer are lung, bowel and breast cancer.
Screening, particularly as we get older, also plays an important part in maintaining health.
The principle that prevention is better than cure has proven to be true here.
The most cost-effective strategy with the best prospects of success is screening.
