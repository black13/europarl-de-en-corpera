in writing. - The report on the fight against fraud indicates a fundamentally positive development.
From 2007 to 2008 there was a reduction in the negative financial effects of irregularities in all sectors.
However, this was not the case with regard to pre-accession aid.
Here the negative effects have increased by 90.6%.
In this regard, I would point out that since 2002 the EU has been providing financial support for Turkey's 'efforts' towards EU accession, with successively higher amounts being paid out each year.
For the period 2007 to 2013, Turkey will receive the sum of EUR 4.84 billion.
This is the case even though the Commission is aware that Turkey is making nowhere near the required amount of progress in respect of the accession criteria.
The money is continuing to flow nevertheless and in ever higher amounts.
The most recent special report by the European Court of Auditors states, in addition, that with regard to the accession aid for Turkey in particular the money is being invested without sufficiently explicit objectives and benchmarks.
Without a clear strategy, money is being used with no specific plan and in an unconstructive way.
We must put an end to this madness.
