Mr President, Mr Rehn, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I would first of all like to express my gratitude for the report and I would also like to thank the rapporteur.
The committee welcomes the high capital adequacy ratio of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
We are pleased that economic and social cohesion and convergence and the convergence pillar of the EU's cohesion policy in particular represent a core target for the EIB.
We also appreciate very much the contribution which the EIB made to achieving the convergence objectives by lending EUR 21 billion, 41% of total EIB lending in the EU, for convergence projects.
Furthermore, I would like to emphasise the added value of undertaking actions in cooperation with the Commission and the EIB's strategy of providing additional support and leverage to structural fund interventions.
