Mr President, it is pleasing to read in the annual report that the European Investment Bank (EIB) has responded rapidly to the crisis by making a significant increase in the funds available.
Lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular must remain one of its central priorities and, where possible, must be extended.
However, it is important to ensure that the businesspeople in question actually receive the loans.
With regard to the monitoring and supervisory system, I support the proposal for the establishment of a European Banking Authority.
However, in order to be able to function efficiently, this authority must be given far-reaching powers and must also have the mandate to monitor banks which operate across national borders.
As far as the objectives of the European Investment Bank are concerned, I would like to see a greater focus on its activities within Europe.
This is urgently needed in the light of the ongoing financial and economic crisis and it would also allow duplication of effort and conflicts of interest with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be avoided.
