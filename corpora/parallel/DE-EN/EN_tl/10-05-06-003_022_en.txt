Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Mr Rehn, I would first like to thank Mr Deutsch for his work.
However, I would also like to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for Europe and for the citizens of Europe and to highlight the fact that we must make greater use of this unique institution, in particular in times of economic crisis.
From the perspective of budgetary control, which in modern terms also covers the actual output and performance of European programmes and institutions, the EIB has definitely earned its high rating, in particular with regard to political reliability.
It creates real added value for the people of Europe by means of the investments made in its six main programmes, ranging from the Trans-European Networks to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and its special programmes, such as the project to combat climate change.
I am sure that this will receive broad support in the European Parliament.
However, this also means that Parliament must in future extend its own supervisory procedures.
I am referring here, for example, to the investment facility.
Finally, I would like to make one further point which is particularly important to my group and which is aimed directly at the EIB.
We welcome the fact that the EIB has revised its policy on offshore financial centres.
However, we also need the assurance that income produced from EIB funds will not make its way into tax havens of this kind, otherwise the EIB would risk damaging the reputation and the rating that it has built up.
