Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement under Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, following the serious accusations made against me by Mr Martin in his speech.
I must point out that I want nothing to do with this Member of Parliament.
His political approach is to denounce his colleagues, to denounce the entire Parliament in the media and to claim that the officials in Parliament are lazy, idle and incapable.
I will not talk to a man who uses secret service methods, such as keyhole cameras, miniature cameras and other secret equipment, to spy on people.
I have not spoken to him today and I will not do so in future.
I do not want anything to do with a person of this kind.
I reject Mr Martin's assertion and, in my opinion, he should withdraw it.
