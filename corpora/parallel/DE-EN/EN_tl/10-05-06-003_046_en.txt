Mr President, it is sad that I have to bring this up in plenary.
I have to tell you that what Mr Mölzer has said is untrue.
On the way in here he did indeed call me a psychopath.
In recent years he has often told me that I should see a psychiatrist.
That is the way in which radical right-wingers work.
Last year the leader of the social democratic group said, 'I believe Hein-Christian Strache is a Nazi'.
This is the man whose party Mr Mölzer belongs to and whom he works closely with.
I really believe that, on the basis of what we have repeatedly experienced here, we should not only be discussing the economic crisis, the financial crisis and what can now be referred to as a money war.
We should also be dealing with the dangerous rise of right-wing radicalism.
If you were to sit here at the back, Mr President, with your political past, you would recognise the dangerous trends emerging once again in Hungary, in Austria and elsewhere.
This must be stopped before it gets out of hand.
