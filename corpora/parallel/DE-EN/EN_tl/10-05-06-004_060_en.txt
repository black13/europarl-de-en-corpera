Mr President, after the forthcoming Football World Cup in South Africa the spotlight of our African policy will once again fall on Nigeria.
It is a large, wealthy country with huge social inequalities.
Of course, it also finds itself caught up in the conflict between the Chinese route and the European route towards globalisation.
I am firmly convinced that we must stay on the European route, which means opposing abuses and violations of human rights and making those people who have been imprisoned into our partners, rather than the corrupt leaders of certain cliques and groups in government which offer us short-term benefits.
In this case we must support the resolution and also what Mrs Vergiat has said.
It does go far enough, but it is important that the EU stands for human rights.
We must not tolerate what China is intending to do in Nigeria and its disregard for human rights.
