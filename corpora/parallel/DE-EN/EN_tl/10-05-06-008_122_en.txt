Mr President, I would like to make three brief remarks about the report.
Firstly, agriculture is not the problem in the case of climate change, it is the solution.
Secondly, we are in the early stages of our research into climate change, despite the fact that the media sometimes give the opposite impression.
In the course of our climate research we should also take into consideration and follow up theories and results which are not part of mainstream thinking.
Thirdly, we should take all the necessary and appropriate measures that do not involve additional red tape and we should make sure that these measures are effective in economic terms.
For example, against this background a European framework directive on the protection of soil is counterproductive and will not bring the desired results.
