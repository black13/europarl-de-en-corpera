Mr President, I support the motion which Mr Prodi has tabled today.
However, the amendment to this report tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and, in particular, by Mr Seeber, which has unfortunately been adopted by plenary, seems to me to be more questionable.
I am concerned that the conservatives are using this method to reintroduce nuclear power by the back door.
Promoting low-carbon energy sources is a well-known argument used by the nuclear lobby.
I would like to emphasise the fact that the Prodi report is definitely going in a different direction.
As an Austrian, I do not regard nuclear power as renewable energy.
It is very important for me to make it clear that I have not voted in favour of this paragraph today.
