in writing. - In Nigeria there have been repeated outbreaks of violence between Christians and Muslims and each of these two groups represent around half of the population.
These disturbances are now taking place even more frequently.
Trivial matters are causing violent clashes.
Even the curfew which has been in force since January and the stationing of troops in the area did not prevent new massacres from occurring.
The fact that the long absence of President Yar'Adua plunged western Nigeria into a political crisis, that there were serious clashes between Christians and Muslims in the central Nigerian town of Jos and that the ceasefire in the oil-rich Niger delta has come to an end does not bode well for the future, following the death of the president.
When Muslim nomads attacked Christian villages at the beginning of the year and at least 500 people were murdered, it is said that the army only responded hours after receiving the first report.
What was lacking was an outcry from the EU.
When the Swiss people voted against the building of minarets in a referendum, Muslim states threatened Switzerland with economic sanctions and jihad.
However, when Christians are murdered because of their religion, the EU takes months to react.
The European Union must act as an honest broker in this respect and respond more quickly.
This is made clear in the motion for a resolution, which is why I have voted in favour of it.
