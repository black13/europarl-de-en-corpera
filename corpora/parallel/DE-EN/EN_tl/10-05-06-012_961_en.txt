in writing. - The Commission's proposed changes are contrary to the interests in particular of small and medium-sized businesses in the motor vehicle sector.
In addition, this sector is governed by a large number of complex regulations (relating to safety and the environment, for example) and therefore competition law must be based on the specific features of this market.
For this reason, I have voted against the Commission proposal.
