Mr President, this morning the Council answered the outstanding questions via the Spanish Presidency.
One of the main conditions for a vote on the report is thereby met.
Moreover, through the Spanish Presidency, it has raised the prospect of joint discussion and elaboration of a proper discharge procedure, thereby meeting the second main condition.
In so doing, the Council is subjecting itself to the scrutiny of Parliament - and that is a milestone that we should recognise.
I am therefore recommending to all groups that they vote in favour of including the decision on discharge on the agenda.
However, the resolution itself will be dealt with during the June part-session.
