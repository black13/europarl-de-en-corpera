Mr President, I will be brief.
We are able to support this motion for the reasons stated.
An official letter is on its way to Parliament.
I, too, see this as a good sign that the Council - or at least, so I hope - is prepared to demonstrate the transparency and willingness for consensus that it has demonstrated here, including in respect of the External Action Service.
To this extent, I agree with Mrs Gräßle.
