Mr President, at present, practically every political debate on the economic and financial crisis is concerned only with how many billions of euro are required to plug the next black hole.
In general, these debates are still being conducted clinging onto the skirts of Mr Ackermann and co.
What we really need, however, is a fundamental debate on the current monetary system.
We should at long last be debating matters such as how to rid our system of its growth imperative.
What can we do to check the banks' urge to provide credit?
Should we abolish interest?
How can we arrive at a distinction between value and monetary value?
We should use money to create value for our society, not to create monetary value!
Before we are overtaken by events, we should use such a debate to attempt to reform the monetary system from inside.
This will only be possible, however, if we have strong and, above all, independent policies.
