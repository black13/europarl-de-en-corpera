Madam President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak on this subject.
Around 30% of all those in self-employment in the EU are women.
They are particularly highly represented in small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the service sector, and, in this capacity, make a significant economic contribution to our society.
These women should be given the same opportunities as their male colleagues without having to resort to quotas and the like.
Self-employed women often have to grapple with the problem that becoming a mother could endanger their livelihood.
In view of the increasingly ageing population, it is now more important than ever to ensure effective maternity provision and to give priority to families.
Family firms where the women assist in the business also play an important part - whether in the professions, in the trades, in retail or particularly in farming.
In all these areas, it is necessary to ensure appropriate social and legal protection.
Nonetheless, the Member States should always retain competence in respect of social legislation and this should never be transferred to the EU.
It is a matter of using compromises and options to take into account divergent social policy traditions, such as whether to make insurance for assisting spouses mandatory or voluntary.
