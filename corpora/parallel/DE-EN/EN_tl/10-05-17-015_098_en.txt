Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in congratulating Mrs Lulling.
I welcome the fact that this report takes a further step towards realising the principle of equal treatment of men and women, including in the area of self-employment.
One important cornerstone - and quite rightly so - is that it covers not just spouses, but also life partners.
At long last, assisting partners can enjoy an equal level of social protection, and this also applies to maternity provision.
