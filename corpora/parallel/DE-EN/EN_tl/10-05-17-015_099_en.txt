Madam President, I, too, should very much like to congratulate Mrs Lulling.
It gives women in particular completely new opportunities in the area of self-employment in small and medium-sized enterprises.
In a time of crisis such as this, we should bear in mind that self-employment is fit for the future, that new jobs can be created here, and that it also allows us to develop completely new sectors.
We have developed Girls' Day, for example, to encourage young women to take up technical occupations, because it is in these technical occupations that brand new opportunities are arising and in our present society, people are not really aware of the full spectrum of occupations available to women.
Finally, it is also women who, time and again, ensure stability in the area of finances.
I believe that in times of crisis, it is particularly important to ensure that the equity and venture capital in enterprises can be exploited equally by women.
