Madam President, I would first like to thank Mr Oettinger for representing his colleague, Mrs Reding, in such excellent English.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied.
I am grateful to all the Members who took the floor because they support the position held by the overwhelming majority of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, which will enable this text to be adopted tomorrow.
I should like to reassure Mr Romeva i Rueda.
This text is not perfect.
It still falls short of my requirements.
We have not yet won the war, but we have won an important battle.
This is a step in the right direction.
I should also like to say to Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Figueiredo that they should not worry about maternity protection; what they want is provided for in Recital 17a.
Read it; I do not have the time to read it out.
There is just one amendment.
Were we to vote for it, it would not be possible to adopt the directive under the Spanish Presidency, and we would risk losing months, if not years, and all for nothing, because - I should like to reassure the authors - what they are proposing in their amendment is proposed, in different terms, in Amendment 4, which was adopted at first reading and taken up in its entirety by the Council.
I therefore believe that these Members could, in good conscience, vote for the other amendments.
