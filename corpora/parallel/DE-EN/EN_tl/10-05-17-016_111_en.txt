Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ţicău, I would like to congratulate you on this report.
I believe it to be a great step in the right direction.
There are more than 160 million buildings in Europe, and these buildings need to be renovated in respect of their thermal efficiency in order to minimise energy consumption, thereby bringing about a corresponding reduction in overall energy consumption.
Forty per cent of energy is used for heating and cooling buildings.
We hope that renovation measures will allow us to achieve our goal of a 5% reduction in total energy consumption by 2020.
However, we are also concerned with creating new jobs.
There is no doubt that we need new training schemes for the tradesmen who will not only be renovating these existing buildings, but also building new ones.
We need small and medium-sized enterprises that specialise in this segment and we must make it possible for them to make a profit in this area and to pay higher net wages.
I believe that is the best way out of the crisis, because not only will it, of course, raise new tax revenue but, moreover, energy from fossil fuels will be replaced by renewable energy - thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption.
I believe that substituting fossil fuels in consumption and production is the way ahead and naturally will also result in a noticeable reduction in household expenses.
I also believe that these investments will pay off and that we should not continue with the levels of consumption that we have seen in recent decades.
We should take this opportunity to start investing again.
Investment is particularly essential in times of crisis, to enable us to overcome the crisis - and overcome it with as little bureaucracy as possible.
