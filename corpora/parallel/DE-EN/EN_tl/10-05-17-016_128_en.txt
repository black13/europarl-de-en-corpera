Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2008, the EU committed to a 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020.
Improving the energy efficiency of buildings - with the goal of achieving near-zero energy houses - will not only reduce energy consumption.
This directive will also help us to overcome the crisis.
Its realisation requires experts and specialists, thereby creating jobs.
Moreover, in the long term, it will reduce the household expenses of European citizens.
Finally, I would like to mention the energy situation in the existing stock of houses and other buildings and the necessity of bringing about a corresponding improvement in their energy situation.
