Mr President, I would particularly like to agree with the words of the previous speaker.
We, too, are pleased that the Committee on International Trade is working in this area.
I should also like to add my thanks to the rapporteur.
Nonetheless, ultimately, I do not share his position and we will not be able to support him tomorrow on certain points.
Allow me to reemphasise what the issue is here.
We would all like to see clear country-of-origin marking.
We all share the view that pressure must be brought to bear on the Council and we all find it regrettable that the Council has now been blocking clear country-of-origin marking for some years.
However, this directive is a directive, not a symbolic resolution in which something like that can be stated.
I myself, for example, have lent my support to a written declaration which expressly calls once again for action and I consider it important that we continue to work in this area.
This directive has a different aim and purpose, however, and that is to ensure transparency and offer consumers certainty in the naming of novel fibres and novel materials.
We now fear that if the scope of this directive is expanded, the directive will suffer exactly the same fate as the last attempt at introducing 'Made in' origin marking - in other words, that it will once again be blocked by the Council.
We would find that regrettable, because we genuinely believe that action needs to be taken relatively quickly here.
We support all the other actions in the area of 'Made in' origin marking - that is beyond question, we will always be allies in this - but we consider it wrong to misuse the present regulation to achieve this end.
