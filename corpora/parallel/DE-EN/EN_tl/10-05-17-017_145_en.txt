Mr President, in the thousands of debates on globalisation that we have had in recent decades, we keep coming back to the point where those following the debate ask what they can do.
This always results in mention of the power of consumers.
However, in the area where they can exercise this power - namely when buying products - unnecessary obstacles are placed in their path.
There is a certain amount of standardisation in the area of textiles, but I feel that courage is lacking.
Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised that I am the first to mention this.
Why have we not been much more ambitious as regards social labelling?
Why do we still not have it?
Why are we not using this ideal instrument to create transparency concerning where, how and under what conditions such products are actually being produced?
Why are we constantly bemoaning the loss of jobs, yet not doing what is of most interest to consumers - namely allowing them to find out what they are actually buying by providing the evidence?
