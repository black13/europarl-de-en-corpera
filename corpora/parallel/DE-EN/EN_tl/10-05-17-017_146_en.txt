Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Manders, thank you very much for the good work that you have put into this regulation.
I would also like to give particular thanks to my shadow rapporteur, since although this is indeed a technical report - as has been mentioned a number of times - it has many wide-ranging consequences for our citizens.
After all, what we are concerned with here is allowing novel fibres to be placed on the market in the European Union.
That is something we want to make possible.
The European Commission is right in that.
Not just anyhow, however; the fibres must be tested if citizens are genuinely to enjoy the consumer protection that we are always talking about.
It is important, for example, to test whether the fibres are allergenic.
They must also be clearly labelled, so that our citizens - who are always being described as responsible citizens - can also act accordingly.
In this context, I must contradict the Members who have said that we should leave out country-of-origin marking.
It is very important and absolutely right.
Many citizens want to know where the fibres and textiles come from.
What is their background?
Their background includes the way in which they were manufactured.
It is deplorable, but in many states, child labour or even slave labour are still used.
There are citizens who want to know this information so that they can make a responsible choice when buying products.
It may not be the job of this regulation, but it is the job of us Members to remind the Council of this and exert pressure to ensure that the text on origin marking that has been on the table since 2005 is at last put to good use.
It is an opportunity to turn up this pressure and we should really seize it to achieve a good regulation about which our citizens say: yes, we can certainly live with that - that is the sort of thing we expect of our representatives in Parliament.
