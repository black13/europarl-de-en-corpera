Once again, ecological labelling promises something quite different to what it actually delivers - one only has to think of the 'Organic Cotton' scandal or the recent bio-chemicals pantomime.
Firstly, yet another confusion of labels and marks is emerging in this organic market - which the EU could sensibly simplify once and for all, something which it usually loves doing; and secondly, it is time that the EU accepted genetically modified cotton.
If we are still awaiting studies of the possible effects of harmful substances, then in the meantime, genetically modified cotton should at least be stated on the label.
It is also high time that the EU did something about 'radio-frequency identification'.
We cannot have electronic labels being applied to textiles without the knowledge of those concerned whilst we are still waiting for the requisite labelling regulations.
If pedestrians are to be made visible by means of RFID clothing, it will be possible to monitor people's every step.
In view of the pressure to conform to political correctness, people would soon have to be extremely careful as to the institutions they visited when wearing RFID clothing.
Perhaps in future, however, people will simply need to delete their RFID number from Google Street View.
Alternatively, the chips might set off security alerts at airports.
George Orwell could not have imagined it; we have long overtaken his vision of a surveillance society.
