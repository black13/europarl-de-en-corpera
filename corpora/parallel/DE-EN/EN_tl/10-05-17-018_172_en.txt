Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group would actually have liked to support Mrs Rühle's report, because it contains a great many very positive elements.
Unfortunately, there are three points that we consider lacking or that we are unable to accept as they stand in the report.
Firstly, Mrs Rühle was unable to accept that we genuinely have need of a legal framework for services in the general economic interest, and secondly, she also failed to state clearly that it is a matter of greater legal certainty in the area of social services in particular.
This is a shortcoming of the report that we naturally find very regrettable.
One point that we are absolutely unable to accept is the rejection of service concessions.
We cannot simply say that it is something we do not want.
The Court of Justice has already ruled on all this.
It is highly unpolitical.
It is very important that we say quite clearly what we want if we know that the European Commission is preparing a legal text.
It is important that we call upon the European Commission actually to go along with the very positive position taken by the Court of Justice on this matter, thereby also ensuring legal certainty.
That is our demand and consequently, we have submitted an alternative resolution.
We ask our fellow Members to support this alternative resolution.
