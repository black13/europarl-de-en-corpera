Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this sterling report.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is happy with a great deal of what is contained in this report.
We have also agreed to compromise on one or two points, because you can never have everything in a House such as this.
Overall, the report provides a good basis for further discussion with the European Commission on a number of topics.
Mrs Rühle has already addressed the question of how one can enable the contracting bodies, institutions and authorities to take social criteria into consideration in procurement without compromising the principles of the internal market.
Secondly - and this has been addressed by Mr Engel - how can we design the service concessions so as to comply with the internal market in the long term?
I completely agree with Mr Engel and Mrs Rühle that we can only accept new legislation on the proviso that it offers a clear and recognisable advantage for the internal market.
In view of this, we have achieved a good compromise and naturally, I would be pleased if, ultimately, the Social Democrats were also able to support it.
