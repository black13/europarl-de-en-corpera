Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon brought with it changes, including, and indeed specifically relating to, the importance of the European Parliament.
I have already pointed out once that my 'Yes' to the amendment of the parliamentary budget is a conditional one.
Of course, the European Parliament should strive for legislative excellence.
Of course, strengthening Parliament's role means that it has more obligations, more responsibility and more work.
That said, in times of crisis like those we are in at present - the worst economic crisis in 60 years - I would point out that, as MEPs, we, too, and indeed we, specifically, should exercise particular care with the money entrusted to us.
The Council and the European Parliament are supposed to and must work together to a greater extent, and this cooperation requires a willingness to act as partners.
