Madam President, in times of crisis, in particular, politicians must be able to separate their rational and emotional sides, especially when it comes to budgetary matters and money.
I have the feeling that the Treaty of Lisbon and the associated budgetary issues are a little bit like the weather forecast - you never know exactly how things will look in the morning.
The forecast says rain, so you take the umbrella, and in the end it maybe spits a little, but there is definitely no real rain.
It is the same with the Treaty of Lisbon: we do not know how Parliament's workload will be changed by the Treaty.
I have to wonder how it was possible for Members to have worked in the committees and the presidiums in the past in such a way that there will be no change as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon.
The discussion about the EUR 1 500 increase in the secretarial allowance is symbolic for the issue of whether we are able to slim down our structures, save funds and make our working processes more efficient.
Taking these three points into account would be of greater benefit to us than ever increasingly talking about the area of funding.
Above all, it is only over the next year that we will see what impact the Treaty of Lisbon has really had on our work.
