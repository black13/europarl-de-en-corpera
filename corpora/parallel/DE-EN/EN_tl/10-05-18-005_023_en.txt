Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr van der Stoep: I am worth my money, and I am standing by that position.
If you are not worth yours, then you have my sympathy.
All I can say is that we are doing ourselves no favours if we create working conditions for ourselves in this House that effectively make it impossible for us to work.
I support the increase in the secretarial allowance - indeed for both levels - and I believe that this is highly justifiable.
Anyone who works in this House needs staff.
Those who do not want to work should not prevent those who want and have to work from doing so.
No one will be forced to use the increase in the secretarial allowance - you can use it, you do not have to do so.
If MEPs do not use the allowance, then all the better for the taxpayers, who will then get the money back.
I, in turn, can only speak for myself when I say that I am worth the money and that the same applies to my staff.
However, we must put under the microscope activities that were undertaken in the past on the basis of a surplus in this budget.
We must examine whether we thus want to and are able to continue these activities.
I am also thinking, in this regard, above all, about the web TV service.
I think that we have to take action, that we cannot leave everything as it is.
Apart from that, we have undertaken many reforms with the Bureau and we should also allow these reforms to bite.
The Committee on Budgetary Control will do everything in its power to point out where things are not working.
