Madam President, SIS II is a tale of attempts, failures and new attempts that has gone on for years.
These attempts, failures and new attempts have thus far gobbled up a total of EUR 90 million - 90 million which, in many people's eyes, has been completely wasted.
From a budgetary point of view, I can endorse Mr Coelho's every sentence, every word and every effort.
We are working very closely and very well together on this.
We all have a common interest in SIS II working.
Sometimes, however, you have to admit - as with many things in life - when things are not working, and you have to consider alternatives.
We, as the European Parliament, are not prepared to give up this project already and we will support Commissioner Malmstr√∂m, who has accepted this difficult inheritance, in any way we can.
It must be clear, however - and we have established this in the Committee on Budgets and are also recommending it to the plenary - that contributions for SIS II be placed in the reserve, so that we can have more control over the use of these funds.
Personally, I expect that there is a plan B for the case where we admit, one day, that we are not able to achieve what we wanted to achieve.
