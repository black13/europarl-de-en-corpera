Madam President, first of all, let me say that I believe - and I am referring to the Schengen Information System here - that the EU should not be operating a wish-based policy, but a policy based on the reality.
When it comes to the Schengen Information System, that means that we must take account of the fact that the tests - what have been called the 'first milestone' - have failed.
After eight years of tinkering, we know that the aim of the measure proposed by the Commission - the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II - is unachievable by the Member States, both on technical and legal grounds.
That is not my evaluation - it is the evaluation of the Federal Republic of Germany.
That is the position back in my home country, and it is a position, by the way, that I fully share.
EUR 90 million has so far been squandered on this scheme, and the Commission would like to spend more.
We do not want an extension of the deadline to 2013; we want to make that very plain.
Instead, we want to abandon this system and start the search for an alternative.
Secondly, the German Left Party is fundamentally critical of SIS II - I want to point that out, too, at this juncture - as access to the system is being dramatically extended, for example, to the secret services.
In Germany, there is a requirement that the secret services and the police are separated.
Thus, any mixing of the secret services' and the police's data will mean that the whole system will be brought before the German Federal Constitutional Court.
That is something that I needed to mention, at least from the German point of view.
We also oppose SIS II because it involves the collection of vast quantities of data and the gathering and recording of biometric data.
That is neither purposive nor proportionate.
