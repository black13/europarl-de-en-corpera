Madam President, in many Member States, including my home state of Austria, people no longer know where new asylum seekers can go, and the population quite rightly resists the idea of new reception centres.
How can it be that, despite this, the resettlement of refugees in the EU is being promoted?
The plan to allow into the EU asylum seekers who have already fled to a bordering third country such as Ukraine because the standard of living here is higher is thus completely incomprehensible.
Especially in such times of economic crisis, it is all you can do to shake your head when it comes to proposals like this.
The entire EU asylum concept is a disaster, as far as I am concerned.
According to the concept, an asylum seeker who is first picked up in Romania can then be sent back there for appraisal and for an asylum process.
The idea of granting basic welfare provision to asylum seekers at the same high social security level as to nationals of the Member State in question is unrealistic and unaffordable.
The EU should grant the protection of asylum to everyone who really needs it, to those who really are in need, but it should not open the floodgates to economic migrants.
What we need is greater protection of the external borders, quick, unbureaucratic procedures and, of course, a consistent repatriation strategy.
