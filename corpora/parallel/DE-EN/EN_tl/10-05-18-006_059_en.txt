Madam President, at present, the European Union does seem to have access to unbelievable financial resources.
After the EUR 750 billion support package we are now, once again, to spend enormous sums on the migration issue, but not, for example, on repatriation measures or even on securing borders - the supposedly secure Schengen borders, in any case, are as holey as a Swiss cheese.
No, EUR 6 000 per person is to be provided for the voluntary acceptance of refugees from third countries.
If the EU really has the necessary loose change lying around, it should, I beg, support European families - then, perhaps, we would have a rising birth rate.
The argument that we need immigration to counter the lack of children would then finally be superfluous.
Instead of just opening up the floodgates to immigration, the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees should finally be accurately applied and it, of course, does not apply to the army of economic migrants.
If we do want to spend many millions, then they could be spent on the border protection agency FRONTEX, rather than the money pit that is the Schengen Information System.
