Madam President, I would actually just like to get a couple of comments about the Ma≈àka report off my chest.
I agreed this earlier on with your colleague.
I want to express very clearly my opposition to the increase in the secretarial allowance, especially to the envisaged amount of EUR 1 500.
Furthermore, I also oppose any increase in the staffing of this House and, should it be decided after a further evaluation that an additional EUR 1 500 per month for the secretarial allowance is to be made available, that would simply be to mock the taxpayers.
(The President cut off the speaker)
