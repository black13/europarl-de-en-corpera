We have changed the name on the screen, as you have seen.
Unfortunately, the Commissioner in question was not able to be with us on time, which I find regrettable, as there is no ash cloud at the moment and as it is already 11.00.
Maybe at some point, the Commission could discuss the fact that the competent Commissioners should be here.
That, too, is a subject for the framework agreement.
I am sure that Mrs Malmstr√∂m will be a wonderful representative.
