Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that the report on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been so amicably discussed in the House.
In the last electoral term, I was the shadow rapporteur for reform of the sugar market.
At that time, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development visited the island of RÃ©union where I visited a small agricultural holding that grows sugar cane.
Without our support, this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence.
As someone from the continental mainland, I also observed that these farmers in the outermost regions of the Union do face a special set of circumstances.
It is necessary for us to ensure, through certain rules on exceptions, that we offer these farmers in all these regions that are in the European Union future prospects and ensure that they are able to guarantee food security - at least for the most part - in these areas.
It is up to us all to help ensure that agriculture - including through these rules on exceptions - has future prospects and that the security of supply for the local population is safeguarded.
The way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals.
My heartfelt thanks go to all those who have been involved.
