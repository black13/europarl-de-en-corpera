Mr President, for years, we have been observing a phenomenon that seems to leave the European Union powerless, namely an enormous rate of farms going under which undermines EU states' self-sufficiency.
Clearly, those worst hit by this are those in disadvantaged areas, such as the outermost regions, but also farmers in mountainous regions like we have in Austria.
Unfortunately, that is a consequence of the common agricultural policy, a policy that has been subject to many years of criticism, is constantly being reformed and yet still does not function properly.
We have reached a turning point, however.
In crisis situations - be they brought about by the depreciating euro or simply by the fact that a volcano in Iceland has paralysed air traffic and with it the supply of easily perishable goods - the Member States have to rely on themselves.
We saw that most recently from the last time that Russia turned off the gas.
When things get difficult, everything depends on a country's self-sufficiency, and that needs to be maintained within the EU, in those countries and regions with disadvantaged areas, and in the outermost regions.
I believe that can only be done if agriculture is, to a certain extent, re-nationalised.
