Madam President, the common agricultural policy needs to be constantly checked for its practicability, as unnecessary red tape costs us and, above all, our farmers, a great deal of time and money.
Elements that are not meaningful and appropriate must be dismantled and simplified.
This is the case, in particular, for the often very complicated and disputed cross-compliance regulations.
Our stated goal is to make agricultural policy simpler and more transparent.
The European Union's farmers should be able to spend more time in the field again, rather than behind a desk.
I really hope that the Commission takes note of this important message from our report and takes action to realise it.
