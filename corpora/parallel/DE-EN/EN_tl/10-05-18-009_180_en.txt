The Asylum Support Office could represent a very useful body, specifically if it took on a coordinating role in relation to repatriation and thus accelerated repatriation measures.
As a result, the support would also be helpful for resettlement.
The present report treats this element, which I find very important, only as a subordinate issue.
Instead, it contains numerous bureaucratic proposals that will result in a bloated apparatus and a sluggish implementation of the measures.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
