The eligible measures for support under the European Refugee Fund (ERF) include the resettlement of refugees from third countries.
'Resettlement' means the process whereby, on a request from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) based on a person's need for international protection, third country nationals or stateless persons are transferred from a third country to a Member State whereby they are permitted to a) reside as a refugee or b) be given a status which offers them the same rights and benefits under national and Community law as refugee status.
The measures proposed in the report will result in the EU - which already has to face the problem of mass immigration - becoming even more attractive to migrants.
The UNHCR's figures confirm this.
While, in 2008, approximately 5 000 people were resettled throughout the EU, at present, there are 750 000 people around the world with this need.
It is for that reason that I voted against this report.
