We have a Schengen Information System that works and is capable of expansion, and we have a prestige project costing millions that seems to be flopping.
It is time to stop pouring money into the money pit and to rescue what can still be rescued.
If the EU really wants to spend further millions, they should be spent on border protection or on benefiting indigenous families.
Instead of simply paying out 'bounties' for taking in refugees, the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees should finally be accurately applied and it, of course, does not apply to the army of economic migrants.
Finally, we do not need a new asylum support office to further expand the asylum jungle and the morass of EU agencies that gobble up millions.
Until we have a functioning Schengen Information System, the Schengen Area must not be expanded.
The new proposals are not only badly thought-out, they are quite simply counter-productive, and that is why I abstained from the vote.
