I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on deontological questions related to companies' management as, above all, I support the European Parliament's call for encouraging higher numbers of women to be assigned to management posts and the request for the European Commission to put forward a proposal to introduce a system for the filling of posts on company decision-making bodies, posts in other bodies and posts in general.
At the same time, however, I regret the fact that my amendment, which would have made this an obligation, was not included in the final resolution.
I would have liked to have seen the European Parliament make more ambitious demands.
In connection with pay policy, I would also like to point out the serious differences that do prevail in reality and to emphasise that the principles laid down in the European directives of equal pay and equal treatment for men and women must be observed and nurtured.
I advocate these fundamental principles being made mandatory in every Member State and believe that a system of sanctions should be introduced for non-compliance.
