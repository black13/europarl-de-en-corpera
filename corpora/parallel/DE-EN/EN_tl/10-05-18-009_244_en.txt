Young people, in particular, are especially hard hit by the current crisis.
In the face of rising youth unemployment, it is important to improve educational opportunities.
While we at EU level are still talking about promotion, the Member States are already making cuts in the funding for universities.
If we really want to help the youth, we need to rein in the phenomenon of 'eternal trainees'.
These measures are, at best, a declaration of intent but, given the conditions in these times of crisis, they are scarcely enough to actually achieve anything.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
