Once again, the organic label promises something quite different to what it actually delivers - one only has to think of the 'Organic Cotton' scandal or the recent bio-chemicals fiascos.
Firstly, it gives rise to yet another confusion of labels and marks in this organic market - which the EU could sensibly standardise once and for all, something which it usually loves doing - and, secondly, it is high time that the EU accepted genetically modified cotton.
If we are waiting for studies into the possible effects of harmful substances, then, in the meantime, labels should at least state that products contain genetically modified cotton.
Moreover, it is high time for the EU to also take care of radio frequency identification (RFID).
We cannot apply electronic labels to textiles without the knowledge of those concerned; we still do not have appropriate labelling rules.
If pedestrians are to be made visible by means of RFID clothing, it will be possible to monitor people's every step.
As the report also notes this, it received my support in the vote.
