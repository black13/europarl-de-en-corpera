Ukraine, a major and important partner of the EU amongst its eastern neighbours, has been hard hit by the global economic crisis.
For this reason, the provision of macro-financial aid of up to EUR 500 million in the form of a loan under the Commission proposal should be approved.
This funding was to cover the country's general balance of payments requirement and its external financing gap, as determined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Ukraine is to be supported in strengthening its long-term macro-economic stability, as it is also an important trading partner for the EU.
For me, however, it was also important that the aid granted from the EU budget not only conforms to the IMF programme but also to the most important principals and objectives of EU policy towards Ukraine.
Thanks to the EU's help, further necessary structural reforms have been set in train in Ukraine on the basis of a positive conditionality.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
