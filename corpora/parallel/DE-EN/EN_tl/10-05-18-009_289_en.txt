I voted against Mrs Tr√ºpel's report.
In so doing, I am coming out very clearly against the increase in the secretarial allowance and any increase in the number of officials here in the European Parliament.
The argument that the Treaty of Lisbon will bring more work for MEPs must be proven first.
Should this be the case, the solution in these times of exploding state debts, however, can only be more efficiency, not more bureaucracy.
There is an enormous potential for greater efficiency in this House, and it would be easy to also increase performance with a smaller staff and less funding.
