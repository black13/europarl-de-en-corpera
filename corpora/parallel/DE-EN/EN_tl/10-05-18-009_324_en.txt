I voted in favour of this report as it is a particular concern of mine that international free trade agreements should include legally binding social and environmental standards.
I think it is particularly important for the European Union not only to apply the principle of the social market economy within the EU, but also to take it outside its borders.
Our partners in free trade agreements should maintain certain standards, and I also believe that we should bring an end to negotiations with states that do not comply with such standards.
