Statistics show that heavy duty vehicles in particular are involved in a high proportion of traffic accidents.
It is therefore that much more important the vehicle be in faultless condition.
Drivers' attentiveness falls almost as much as a result of tiredness as it does under the influence of alcohol.
Consequently, in the name of general safety, we need to ensure compliance with these regulations.
It is important, in this regard, that the same conditions apply to employees and the self-employed so as not to push ever more people into fake self-employment, who are then utilised up to or above the limits of their tolerance.
Fines, however, are often an unsuitable way of guaranteeing compliance with rest periods, which can only be possible when a vehicle is immobilised.
As no expansion of these road safety measures is planned, I voted 'no'.
