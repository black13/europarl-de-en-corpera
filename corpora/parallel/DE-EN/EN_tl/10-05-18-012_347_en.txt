Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yes, it is true, this is a question of life and death.
That is precisely the reason why this debate is quite so emotionally charged.
There are completely different systems for organ transplantation in the different countries of Europe and for how people give their consent or non-consent, whether people's own organs may be used or whether family members can consent to a transplant.
In future, under this report, those countries with very restrictive systems ought to take a very close look at the examples of other countries in order also to observe the positive effects.
Since, when so many people are waiting for transplants, that must be a signal to us, not only to create more opportunities and greater accessibility, but also to guarantee quality, safety and accessibility.
That would also provide an important tool to combat the trading of organs - a truly ignoble activity - and make possible the better regulation of living transplants, which really must take place without payment.
