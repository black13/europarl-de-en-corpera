Madam President, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to agree with the preceding speakers and open with the words 'life is beautiful'.
This is a sentence I hear again and again from a former colleague of mine, Vice-Governor Ernst Höger, who suffered a serious heart condition as a result of a tick bite but had the good fortune, in December 2004, to benefit from a matching heart donation.
Ernst Höger is still alive and kicking, he walks among us, full of life and full of energy and he tells us that 'life is beautiful'.
We have heard the figures today: 55-60 000 Europeans are waiting for the opportunity to be able to tell us in future, like Ernst Höger, that 'life is beautiful'.
Twelve of them are lost to us every day because our systems have simply not progressed to the stage where we can get the organs to the people who need them from another location where they become available in time.
That is why it is our task to put that into practice.
I believe that this action plan is something really important, that we must ensure the security of organ donations and transplants, that we must also give the living donors, who we also need just as much - I say that thinking purely of the many dialysis patients - the certainty of the best medical standard, and that we must be absolutely vehement in our fight against any trade in organs - in other words, voluntary and unpaid donation is the absolutely essential thing.
We must guarantee the consent of donors.
We must develop Europe's systems so that we can close the major gap between the one donation per million citizens in many Member States and the nearly 40 donations per million in Spain, our European champions.
We should aim, together with our national health care systems, to implement these action plans as soon as possible and to guarantee the highest standard so that the 55 000 who are currently waiting can say that 'life is beautiful'.
