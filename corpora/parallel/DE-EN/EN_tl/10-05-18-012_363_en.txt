Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, myself, have a staff member who was reliant on an organ transplant.
I have seen how pleased he was that he was able to benefit from this.
However, I also saw how he waited and how his quality of life was restricted.
It is therefore important that we adopt this proposal now.
A thousand patients still die in Germany every year - and this is a fact - because no organ is available, and it is therefore important to rectify this shortcoming and to guarantee quality.
There is a high social relevance to this.
In Europe, we have the best conditions to be able to achieve a significant improvement, thanks to the existence of the internal market and the European institutions.
Let us make use of those conditions.
I am very pleased that we have stipulated in the directive that donations must be voluntary and unpaid, thus ensuring that human dignity is maintained.
As far as the fall in donors is concerned, I would like to ask the Commission - it has already proven this several times - to generate a culture of discussion and information in Europe so that acceptance amongst citizens is reinforced.
I really do not believe that we need to harmonise the differing systems.
What we need to do is coordinate them and I think that the appointment of a transplant coordinator in hospitals is an important step.
(The President cut off the speaker)
