Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, more than 55 000 patients are on waiting lists for an organ transplant.
Nearly 10 people a day die whilst waiting.
Organ transplantation - yes, of course, but truly only voluntarily, with a declaration of consent and without payment, in order to be able to counter the illegal trade in organs and, of course, based on the highest possible quality and safety for those involved.
