Madam President, I have followed this debate very closely.
Words draw pictures in people's minds.
Today, we have repeatedly heard about the illegal trade in organs - about an illegal activity and about trade.
I believe that this directive quite clearly states that the trade in organs is itself an illegal activity.
We must not send out the signal that trade in organs could be legal in some circumstances.
I would ask Members to emphasise, including when dealing with the media, that we want organ donation, in other words, an activity where one party has a will to help someone to live longer but there is no payback except for gratitude.
Thus, there cannot be any illegal trade in organs because no trade in organs is allowed.
There is only organ donation.
