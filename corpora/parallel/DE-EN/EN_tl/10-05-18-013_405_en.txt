Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are working towards here today is the extension of law at the supranational level.
The importance of this can be seen from a glance at the terrible history of my own country, along with a glance at the human rights infringements currently taking place.
In reality, Germans did not carry out the most horrific crimes in history because they broke laws, but because they drafted laws that made the unethical legal and that, for example, made the murder of Jews, Communists, Christians, homosexuals and others a legal obligation.
If such people and, above all, those who ordered these actions later say that they only did what the law stated at the time and it was not possible to prosecute them later on, that would demonstrate an unbelievable weakness in the law and in humanity.
For that reason, what we have done here with the International Criminal Court represents a major step forwards in that all such people will know, in future, that there is a judge beyond national law and that, for the rest of their lives, they will have to live with the fact that they will be held to account.
That is a major step forward, just like the European Union's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, something which we, and I personally, championed for quite some time.
I am pleased that we will be able to implement this together here today and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr JÃ¡uregui Atondo, for his outstanding report.
