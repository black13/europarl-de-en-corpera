I just wanted to ask what the situation is with regard to supporting police training and reinforcing the justice and interior authorities in Ukraine.
Does this take place as a focal area in the context of the Eastern Partnership, and are the Commission and also the European Police College involved?
Or does this only take place at the Member State level?
