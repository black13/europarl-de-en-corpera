Madam President, I would like to make reference to a press release that the Commission itself issued on 19 December last year in connection with the State aid decision on the Dutch social housing system.
I will now quote from the statement.
'The Commission's decision confirms its long-standing policy line that national authorities have a wide margin in defining the criteria and conditions for social housing and other Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI).'
That is the quotation.
My question is as follows.
How does this statement by the Commission fit in with the fact that, through this decision, the Commission laid down fixed income limits for social housing in the Netherlands?
Does that actually fall within the Commission's competence, and how does it relate to subsidiarity and proportionality?
Furthermore, I would also like to ask the Commission how the decision to formally recognise the necessity of a social mix whilst speaking out against social segregation can be compatible with the fact that, at the same time, a fixed proportion of no more than 10% above the EUR 30 000 threshold has been laid down whilst the Commission also states that if, at any point, more than 10% above this EUR 30 000 social housing threshold obtain housing, this will have to be made up for in other areas in the Netherlands?
That, it seems to me, is a very fixed and rigid arrangement when it comes to the issue of social mixing.
How does that fit in with subsidiarity and - as you yourselves stated in your press release - with the 'wide margin in defining the criteria and conditions for social housing and other Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI)'?
