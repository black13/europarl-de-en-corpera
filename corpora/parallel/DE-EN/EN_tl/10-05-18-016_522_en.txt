Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I follow this debate, I note that there is actually a great deal of uncertainty in relation to how the law is to be applied in these areas.
Mr Andor, you just said that there is no European regulation laying down EUR 33 000 as a fixed limit.
Dutch legislators, however, have laid down this limit of their own free will, probably because they were afraid that otherwise, the Commission would, at some point, require clear criteria to be put in place.
This uncertainty leads to a great many difficulties in the Member States in relation to taking decisions themselves, specifically in terms of shaping those decisions so that they truly match up to what we need for these people and, in particular, for social housing, as these are people who do not have enough money to be able to move about freely.
It is therefore very important for us to create a legal framework and legal certainty that also properly clarifies what is possible.
Services of general economic interest, of course, really do need to be protected.
They are provided at the local level in the Member States and they are universal and we need to ensure that they really are offered to everyone.
We therefore have to consider - and I know this is being considered in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - demanding from the Commission a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest, especially in the social field, and I think that such a framework, were it to be provided, would be a good thing.
