Madam President, Commissioner, as a neighbour of the 'Swabian Sea', I would like to call on you to take the accident, the disaster, in the Gulf of Mexico as seriously as if it had happened in our own Lake Constance.
You would then no longer have any drinking water and in my home town, there would be no more festival, with all the dramatic consequences that would involve, and much else besides.
What does that mean?
Are you sure that the oil rigs far away from us - in other words, in the North Sea and the Baltic - will really stand up to the different storm conditions that we will have to face as a result of climate change?
Are you sure that your European Maritime Safety Agency really is equipped to deal with something like this?
You spoke about good coordination.
We have already often experienced failures in radio contact between the different countries.
Has that been checked, before an emergency incident occurs?
When something actually does happen, what is the legal situation in relation to lawsuits against the oil companies?
Would a risk fund perhaps be useful in this connection?
Finally, is it clear to you that the monitoring authorities in the US were much too closely interdependent with the oil industry?
Can you rule out us having the same problems at European level?
The stipulation should not be 'You can do everything, except ...'.
