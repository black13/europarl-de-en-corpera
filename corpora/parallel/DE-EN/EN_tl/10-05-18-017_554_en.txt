Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is a timely one.
We have not yet solved the problems in the Gulf of Mexico, nor do we know where the next problems will occur.
That is the reason for my first question, Commissioner, which is as follows: where, at this present time, can Europe help with specialist expertise, the Joint Research Centre or with the various other bodies that we have so that we can attempt, together, to obtain a solution for the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico as quickly and as effectively as possible?
In reducing CO2 emissions by 20% and making up the difference through renewable energy sources, the European Union has chosen the right route, and we can achieve a very great deal through greater efficiency.
Do you believe that we could, for example, launch new initiatives together with Norway within the European Economic Area?
