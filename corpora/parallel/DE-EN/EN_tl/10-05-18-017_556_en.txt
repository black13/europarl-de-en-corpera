Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and as shadow rapporteur for biodiversity, this disaster obviously has a personal impact for me.
There is a lot of destruction of life that should be conserved.
Someone has said it already today, but the truth is that, despite every precaution, accidents do happen, as there are limits to prevention.
However, accidents are not confined to oil platforms - nuclear power stations, too, are not immune to incidents and accidents.
In Austria, we have a saying, and it goes as follows: 'Does something always have to happen before something happens?'
In other words, does there always have to be an accident before we learn anything?
This oil disaster should make us all consider whether leaving behind nuclear power would not be a way forward for Europe.
We should also concentrate all our mental energies and our financial resources on investing in renewable energy.
