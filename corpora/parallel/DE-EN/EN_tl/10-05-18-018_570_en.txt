Madam President, the closing of European airspace was doubtless a necessary preventive measure in the interests of safety.
Subsequently, and before the airspace had to be closed again, a more suitable technique to handle the problem should have been found.
Unfortunately, I have to say that this clearly did not succeed at all, either in coordinating the measurements, in the analyses or in respect of passengers.
The second time, too, the treatment of passengers who were held up due to flights that were downgraded was extremely inadequate, and it must be a priority to improve this.
I find myself wondering when there really will be plans in place.
Commissioner, you have, furthermore, not provided a very detailed answer to the question relating to funding and potential compensation for the airlines.
That is a key issue, as this subject continues to be constantly under discussion.
Quite how, then, is this to be solved?
Who, exactly, is to be compensated?
The airlines?
Do they then pass the money on to the passengers?
For example, will business people who missed important appointments receive compensation?
Will a dealer, a company, that had to wait for replacement parts receive compensation?
Why should it only be the airlines that receive compensation?
I do not regard that as justified if you compare it with the economic consequences of this crisis.
Moreover, we really need to take account of the fact that, ultimately, the airlines have been receiving a long-term subsidy from European citizens through the abolition of the kerosene tax, meaning, of course, a priori that they already have a subsidy.
Commissioner, this question is pending and I await an answer from you.
