Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your steadfastness when it comes to passenger safety issues.
In recent days, we have seen that it is clearly not only in the financial sector that major speculation takes place but that a few of the airlines, too, are prepared to gamble with the safety of passengers, at least in words - though luckily not yet in actions.
After all, we are not merely talking about the passengers in the air, but also the people on the ground.
I must ask you to continue working to this end.
I must also ask you to continue working for passenger information and passenger rights.
Over recent days, we have seen that not everyone and not every age group has unrestricted access to the Internet.
Telephone lines were broken, the Internet was not available, and people who are not routine business class fliers like we here in the plenary are, tourists and older age groups, had hardly any information.
I must ask you to continue working to this end.
