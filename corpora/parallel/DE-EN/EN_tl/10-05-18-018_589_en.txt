Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are 2 000 volcanoes around the world, 50 of which are active.
Thus, it is not just a European problem, but a problem for international aviation.
We need to clarify in the research where exactly there are risks and where there is also a certain scope of responsibility.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner, together with Eurocontrol, to perhaps entrust the European Research Council with the task of carrying out research in order to properly judge this risk.
Ultimately, the final responsibility always lies with the aircraft captain and consumers are also called on to consider whether or not this poses a risk for each of them.
Everyone can remove the risk by simply not flying.
An objectification of the entire issue must be at the heart of things, however.
