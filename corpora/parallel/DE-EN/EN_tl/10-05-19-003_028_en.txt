Mr President, I am opposed to the Council's unacceptable anti-European approach.
You are complaining about the crisis and you are now introducing an economic protectorate, while you bear the central responsibility for many of the causes of the crisis.
You have not allowed regulations to be imposed when they were needed.
Just one example of this is Eurostat.
The officials, who have been the subject of so much condemnation and whom I have repeatedly criticised in other areas, highlighted the problems in Greece and also in Spain and Portugal at an early stage.
The Commission called for Eurostat to be given appropriate powers to conduct investigations.
Who blocked this move?
The Spanish, the British - Mr Martin is not here - the Germans, Mr Daul and his people from France and the Austrians, because you did not want your books to be looked at, because you knew how much they concealed.
This applies also to Mr Grasser, the former finance minister, who is now appearing all over the place on German television, instead of facing criminal charges in Austria.
What we really need is, of course, not an emergency government.
You will not do what the Americans sensibly did in a similar crisis, which is to pass a Glass-Steagall Act, to increase the banks' capital, put a check on the conduit banks and reduce the systemic risks.
What we need instead is democratic legitimacy, a two-chamber system which will finally put an end to the nonsense of the Council, which is outwardly so pro-European, but internally makes decisions without democratic legitimacy, so that we can bring about true democracy in Europe.
