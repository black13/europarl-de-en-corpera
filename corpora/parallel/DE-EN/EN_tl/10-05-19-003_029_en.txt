Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the crisis highlights very clearly the limitations of the treaties, our own weaknesses, the double standards in dealings with the European Union, the deficits, the errors and the lack of seriousness.
Secondly, it also indicates that anyone who does not do their homework is harming themselves and putting the EU at risk.
This applies to the Member States, but also to the Commission and to us.
Thirdly, when the European Union establishes objectives and rules for itself and agrees on procedures and sanctions, the Commission must not be dependent on the agreement of the Member States in order to be able to meet its obligations.
The deficit and sanction procedure needs to be automated.
Fourthly, I would like to call on the Council to end the Eurostat blockade.
It must be possible for Eurostat to carry out investigations in the Member States when it wants to and its employees must be able to speak to the necessary people while being aware that this is the right thing to do.
We need information, but without advance authorisation.
Fifthly, you have mentioned hedge funds and we have not yet come to a decision on this subject.
I am calling on the Council to enter into negotiations with Parliament very quickly so that we can hold the first reading of the hedge fund regulation before the summer.
Sixthly, on the subject of the transaction tax, we must not just keep calling for it; we must put it into practice.
The Commission should quickly submit a proposal for the European transaction tax.
My eighth point is directed at the Council.
We are committing ourselves to holding an impact assessment of all national legislation which is relevant to the EU.
My ninth point is that we need to study the effects of all the measures on the real economy and we need more Europe and less intergovernmentalism.
(The President cut off the speaker)
