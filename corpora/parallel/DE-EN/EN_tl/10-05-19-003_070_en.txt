Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current debate on a functioning system of European economic governance, the long-term perspective is being neglected, in my opinion.
Now is the right time to incorporate the short-term stabilisation measures into a long-term strategy.
We need a vision of a market economy.
The fundamental principle of the social market economy is already laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
We must now bring it to life.
The social market economy was the successful model behind Germany's economic miracle.
Walter Eugen, the guiding light of the economic miracle, remarked as early as 1950 that the economic activity of the state should focus on designing the regulatory systems for the economy and not on managing the economic processes.
Therefore, I am calling for a regulatory approach, in other words, measures taken by the state to influence the basic conditions of economic activity by means of general legislation.
It is not the state which creates jobs, but it must create a regulatory framework for job creation and this is what we need to focus on.
Competitiveness is not the start but the result of economic activity.
