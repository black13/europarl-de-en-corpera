Mr President, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy presents us with a specific challenge.
Overall, we must focus on the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
We should make sure that by 2020, small and medium-sized companies have an average minimum capital quota of 20%.
We need strong SMEs in Europe, because they employ two thirds of the workforce, produce 50% of the gross national product and pay 80% of the taxes.
The Commission has simply forgotten to include objectives to strengthen small and medium-sized companies in this programme.
Mr Rehn, I am calling on you specifically to take action on behalf of SMEs and to draw up objectives to strengthen the position of these companies and their employees.
