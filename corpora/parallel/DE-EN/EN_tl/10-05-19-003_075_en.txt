Mr President, Mr Rehn, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, we are talking today about common European economic governance.
I believe it is time for us to realise that the market does not have an independent value and that the citizens of Europe do not have to serve the market, but instead, that the market is there to serve the people, the 500 million Europeans.
I am convinced that we need consolidation and growth, but both terms are always connected with another aspect, in other words, socially responsible consolidation on the one hand and sustainable growth on the other.
We need confidence to achieve this and the people of Europe need perspectives.
However, we will only be able to offer them these perspectives if we can promise them that they will live in a Europe where they can share in the prosperity or put measures in place to ensure that this is the case.
In the Europe of the future, growth should not only benefit the few.
