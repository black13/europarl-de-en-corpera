Mr President, I am sorry, but it is not as simple as that.
You have quoted Article 229 completely correctly, but it is not in conflict with our amendment.
Article 229 refers to a specific day, which is the second Tuesday in March.
Our amendment refers to the Strasbourg week as a whole, which consists of four days.
Therefore, it must be admissible to move this plenary week in Strasbourg from week 10 to week 11.
That does not prevent anyone from holding a plenary session in Brussels on the second Tuesday in March.
As you say yourself, those are the terms of the treaty.
