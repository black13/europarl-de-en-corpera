Mr President, we do not need to take a detour with regard to this vote.
We can decide directly.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has recommended that plenary bans the sticking together of separate pieces of meat and therefore does not allow thrombin to be used as an additive.
A steak must be a steak and a ham must be a ham.
I am sure that this is what the constituents of all the Members of this House want.
Therefore, please vote in favour of our amendment not to include thrombin as an additive in our food regulation.
