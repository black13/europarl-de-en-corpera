Mr President, I have a high opinion of you and your chairmanship, but today I must make a protest.
You have given the floor to many Members, including twice to Mr Lehne and to Mr Gollnisch and Mr Fox.
I also raised a point of order concerning the calendar and it is an important point.
I would like to ask you to check whether Amendment 4 was unlawful.
I know that we rejected the amendment, but this is a question of principle.
The treaty does not refer to 12 plenary sessions per year, but to 12 monthly plenary sessions per year.
The amendment tabled by Mr Fox attempted to combine the August and the September plenary sessions in one week.
This is not about a September I and September II plenary session, but about an August and a September plenary session.
I would really like to clarify that this is unlawful.
