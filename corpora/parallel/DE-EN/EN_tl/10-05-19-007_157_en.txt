Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Mikolášik on the excellent work he has done.
I believe that today is an important day, because we have ensured that donors and recipients of organs will have consistent standards and greater safety.
I hope that this will also help to simplify the cooperation between countries and, therefore, I am very pleased that we have voted in favour of this report with a large majority.
