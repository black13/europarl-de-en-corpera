Mr President, I can only agree with the previous speaker.
I am also very grateful that this report was adopted today with a large majority.
When we hear that 56 000 Europeans are currently waiting for a matching organ in order to be able to have a reasonable or a high quality of life, or even simply to survive, it is clear that we urgently need to harmonise and improve the standards and to make it possible for recipients to access organs from throughout Europe.
