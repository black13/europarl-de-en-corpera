Mr President, adopting the resolution banning thrombin in foodstuffs today simply means giving in to public opinion.
It is pure populism.
We are not fulfilling our responsibilities if we do not follow the scientific evidence.
What is the evidence?
What is thrombin?
Thrombin is a natural enzyme.
It forms part of the blood and therefore of meat.
All of us have a lot of thrombin in our bodies.
If we ban it as a food additive, can we continue to exist or do we have to gradually dispose of ourselves as hazardous waste?
Of course, we must prevent consumers from being misled by products which look like and are designed to look like other products.
We can do this by using labelling in line with the new Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs.
We will be voting on the first reading of this regulation in June.
We have a number of rules that prevent misleading advertising and we also have additional labelling for special products.
The Commission has proposed exactly the same solution for labelling products in which thrombin is used as a glue.
I would like to point out that there is a large number of similar enzymes which are not banned and are still used.
