Mr President, consumer protection is a very, very important matter for me and therefore I am against consumers being misled or deceived in any way.
This is why I am fighting for better labelling of food imitations in the Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs, for example.
I am calling on the Council to follow this approach, which is also supported by the Commission.
Today, we had to vote on glued meat.
Glued meat is meat which is glued together and sold as a high-quality product.
In my opinion, this should not be happening, in particular, when consumers are not aware of what is going on.
The decision today was not an easy one for me.
The Commission has proposed comprehensive labelling rules, but consumers may still be misled, because it is difficult to prove that a product contains thrombin.
This means that it may be used but not indicated on the label.
Therefore, I think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case.
I have now voted in favour of the resolution and of a ban on thrombin.
