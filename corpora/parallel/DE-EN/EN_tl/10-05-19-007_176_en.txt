Mr President, the citizens of Europe are right.
They like honest foods and they like honest politicians.
I respect public opinion of this kind.
We cannot simply ignore public opinion and we cannot simply dismiss it as populism.
That is not the case.
We must take notice of what our citizens are saying to us.
If our constituents and our citizens are of the opinion that real meat must be real meat and that it must not be made of pieces of meat glued together, then we must make sure that it is not possible for meat to be processed in this way.
This is why I have voted against allowing thrombin to be used as a food glue.
