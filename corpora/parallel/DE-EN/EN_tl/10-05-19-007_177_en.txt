Mr President, I have also voted in favour of the resolution banning the use of thrombin as a food additive, because the Commissioner's arguments did not convince me.
We do not want glued meat in Europe.
Even if thrombin is an enzyme which is not harmful to health, by using it to glue together scraps of meat to make one large compressed piece of meat, the risk of bacterial infections must be significantly increased.
On the other hand, the decision made today was clearly for the benefit of the consumers of Europe and in opposition to the purely financial interests of the industry.
Consumers who want a steak must be given a steak and not a piece of meat that has been glued together.
This means that we must call on the Commission not to authorise the use of thrombin.
