Mr President, the current debate about so-called glued ham shows that some manufacturers do not deal honestly with consumers.
I would like all food to be labelled in such a way that it is not possible to mislead consumers.
If this enzyme is used, consumers must be able to identify its presence.
This is the basis for effective and fair consumer protection.
Our job is to ensure that mature consumers have sufficient information to make decisions in their own interests.
One final remark about glued ham.
The discussion with consumers about whether or not they want it has not yet taken place.
However, it is important that consumers at least know what they are actually eating.
