If the energy consumption label is introduced, then provided that it can be easily understood, it will soon become clear whether or not it will really be accepted by consumers.
Public awareness has changed in this area and consumers are paying greater attention to energy efficiency classes, in particular, in the case of electrical appliances.
Of course, the public procurement process should set a good example in this respect.
However, the Member States must not be told that they can only buy products with the highest performance levels which belong to the highest energy efficiency class.
Particularly at a time when everyone will have to make savings, the purchase price will increasingly be the deciding factor.
The choices available in the public procurement process are not specified clearly enough, which is why I have abstained.
