Organ transplants can save lives, but only when a healthy organ from a matching donor is transplanted.
Unfortunately, errors have occurred repeatedly in the past and this makes it even more important to impose quality and safety standards in this area.
It is also worth discussing the fact that Muslims are often happy to accept organ donations, but are not generally prepared to donate organs because of their religion.
I hope that the report will contribute to improving quality and safety standards, which is why I have voted in favour of it.
