We cannot allow the consumer to be misled by the food additive thrombin.
Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 regulates the conditions for food additives throughout the EU and we are now looking to include new substances in it.
The key thing here is the safety of substances.
In order to meet consumer demand for food which looks attractive, the food industry has created substances which are added just for the sake of better appearance.
One such substance is thrombin, which is obtained from edible parts of animals and which is not harmful to health.
Its role is to combine individual pieces of meat together into a single meat product.
Although not in itself a health hazard, parading individual pieces of glued together meat as a single piece of ham does constitute consumer fraud.
Although such products cannot therefore be banned on health grounds, they must be labelled very clearly and unambiguously by indicating not just the name of the product but also its effect and a clear designation of the processed product.
A piece of meat glued together with thrombin should never be allowed to go on sale as ham.
Instead, it must be clearly labelled as 'combined meat parts treated with thrombin'.
I will vote in favour of the approval of this substance only if we impose a clear labelling requirement.
