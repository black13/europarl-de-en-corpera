When we consider, in particular, the increasing levels of allergy and food intolerance and the fact that knowledge is constantly being developed in this area, it is imperative that we regulate additives.
Precisely because of past scandals, it is very important that we prevent any possibility of the consumer being misled.
More research into the safety and tolerability of some additives, such as aspartame, would be desirable, but that was not the subject of this resolution.
I voted in favour of it, nonetheless.
