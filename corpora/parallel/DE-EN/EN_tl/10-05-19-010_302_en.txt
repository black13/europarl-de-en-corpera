Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see Mr Hahn, Commissioner for Regional Policy, and Mr Barnier, Commissioner for the Internal Market, sitting side by side because it is essential that we do not play off regional policy against the internal market.
Instead, we should ensure that the one complements the other and that both of them are strong so that we can achieve the objectives of Europe 2020.
Europe 2020 must begin here and now and should not be just a catalogue of objectives.
Europe 2020 is a project for growth and employment and we need concrete projects, we need the instruments, we need the procedure, we need mechanisms for sanctions, so that this can be successfully implemented.
I am convinced that we will only be able to implement Europe 2020 if we are ready, if Europe is ready to think of the EU in terms of the United States of Europe!
To think in those terms and with each of us making a contribution to the whole.
Europe 2020 means the willingness to bring about a political union.
That presupposes reinforcing and expanding the monetary union, reinforcing and expanding the internal market, unfettering it and calling on people to use the opportunity that is Europe, to use Europe and break through borders.
We have to create an economic union which is part of a political union, as well as a social union.
None of these things are ready and there is a great deal that has not even been addressed.
Europe 2020 is a community Union, not a nationalist or obstructive Europe.
We therefore need a financial review, an EU impact assessment, implementation of the Small Business Act and, obviously, very specific European projects for growth and employment and the expansion of the freedoms of education, science, research and innovation in Europe.
