Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the financial markets need to be packaged in a new regulatory framework so that in future, we can avoid the excesses that have led to the crisis.
However, if we highlight the underlying causes of the indebtedness of governments, then it becomes clear that, here in Parliament, we talk too much about public debt and too little about how we can achieve prosperity and growth.
What determines our growth?
Our growth and prosperity depend on people in the European Union developing products and generating new ideas that can also be sold on the global market.
It is therefore right that one chapter in the EU 2020 strategy is Innovation Union.
We need to focus on inventions and on how we can reinforce research and development.
With that, it is important that we enhance the synergies of research funding and regional development policy.
A great deal more could be done in those areas.
Together with the Liberals and the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), I would argue that we focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.
We should see to it that we, as the EU, spend our funding so that SMEs really get access to that funding and so that there is a technology transfer between universities and colleges and SMEs.
We should encourage people to take their destinies into their own hands through personal responsibility and self-initiative.
Governments cannot create jobs; they need to be created in the economy itself.
