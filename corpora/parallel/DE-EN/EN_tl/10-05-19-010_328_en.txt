Mr President, in the year of the World Cup, the ladies and gentlemen of the Council could learn a lesson from football and that is that it is not possible to have a good game of football if you have got a referee overseeing each player.
However, conducting a game without rules, without a referee and without penalising fouls, now that would end in chaos.
That is precisely the state of affairs right now!
It is high time that the Europe 2020 strategy put a stop to hedge fund speculators.
Those who have made a nice living from speculation and exorbitant interest rates for years should now make a contribution.
Not small savers, but companies with their high speculative profits should be asked to foot the bill.
Nor should the Cohesion policy ignore the euro crisis.
Apart from the current rescue package, Greece has benefited disproportionately in the past from agricultural and regional funding.
Without the necessary structural changes, this money has clearly seeped away and, despite years of funding, the country has been brought to the brink of ruin.
I do not see why we should leave the money tap on in such a situation.
Why do we not listen to Commissioner Rehn who has made the rather reasonable proposal that we cut funding?
Finally, we cannot allow the EU to degenerate into a union of transfers.
A centrally planned economy, which is what some of you would like to see, has not proved its worth yet, even if it comes from Brussels.
What is needed then?
A self-responsible budgetary policy, and if it does not work, courageous and effective sanction mechanisms.
All of that should be included in the Europe 2020 strategy.
