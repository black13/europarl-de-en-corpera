Mr President, the current Cohesion policy started life with the title of the Lisbon Strategy.
However, I firmly believe that the Cohesion policy can, and will, make an enormous contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy, not just because we command a considerable budget in comparison with other European policies but, above all, because the Cohesion policy allows us to have sustainable development in our regions and ensures good monitoring of the restructuring processes and challenges in our regions.
However, there is one core issue here that I would like to clarify once again, and that goes for our group as well: our Cohesion policy can only work if economic development is considered to be equally as important as social development and providing training for workers.
In principle, we need to take joint responsibility for the funds that are available to us.
It is a bit like hardware and software - one cannot work without the other.
