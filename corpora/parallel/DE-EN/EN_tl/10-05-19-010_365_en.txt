Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy did not have any sustainable success.
Why not?
Member States, social partners and large parts of civil society were too little involved and so they had no sense of shared responsibility.
The EU 2020 strategy can be different.
It could be a success, Commissioner, if it also deals with those who are excluded, who are losing out and who often do not have a lobby.
In the EU, not even two thirds of those who are capable of work are in work.
Only just under a half of all older workers have a job.
Eighty million Europeans are insufficiently qualified and have increasingly fewer opportunities in the labour market.
This is a situation we cannot accept.
However, a genuine future strategy needs a social orientation.
Qualitative growth in the economy and employment on the one hand must be reconciled with social equality and with sustainability.
Commissioner Andor, we are both working on that.
What does this mean in concrete terms?
The social security systems of Member States must be adapted to democratic change.
Through exchange of best practice throughout Europe, we could make our contribution to that and we could learn from and with each other.
The European Social Fund - one of your hobby horses - must be adapted to the new challenges, so that we can be even more efficient on the ground.
The European Globalisation Fund is so constructed that those at risk of unemployment are able to find their feet.
Our society must be integrative and integrate young people, for example, through appropriate education and training, so that they can develop professionally and personally.
Despite all the necessary consolidation of national budgets - which is exactly what we are going through and debated this morning - there is one thing we must not seek to save money on: investment in our citizens - in economic, sustainable and social terms.
The EU 2020 strategy will rise and fall with these three pillars.
