Mr President, Mr Mann, I hope you are in regular contact with your Chancellor, if you see things in the same way that I do.
The EU 2020 strategy is a real opportunity to make Europe more social and we need that opportunity at this very moment when many hostile words are directed at Europe and when it has distanced itself from the people.
We absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation.
When it comes to growth and employment, we should stop putting people's interests behind those of business.
Indeed, that must be the key objective of the EU 2020 strategy because Europe needs social progress.
I already pointed that out last Monday at the committee debate on employment policy guidelines: we must not lose sight of the goal of full employment, but we cannot have full employment at all costs because we need good jobs.
We always say we need jobs, but what matters to me is that these jobs are good, that there is social security, that people do not have to receive subsidies and that they can actually make a living from these jobs.
The ever more precarious nature of working life, the increasing income inequality and also growing poverty - which many speakers have talked about today - must finally be brought to an end with the EU 2020 strategy.
We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas.
Finally, people expect more specific answers, very specific answers, in fact, and not an umpteenth strategy!
