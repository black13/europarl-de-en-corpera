Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy - to be honest, I do not feel like discussing the Europe 2020 strategy at all.
Ten years ago, we adopted a strategy, the Lisbon Strategy.
When you now look back at this past decade, the results are limited, if I may put it in those modest terms.
I think that we should currently be focusing on what really matters to people at home in our Member States, rather than making the same mistake again.
They are wondering whether we will be able to ensure the stability of our currency.
Will there be inflation?
What lessons do we need to learn from the developments over the last two years, from the financial and economic crisis, and now from the currency crisis?
Are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis?
I would emphatically call on the Commission, first and foremost, to take steps to ensure rapid financial market regulation and progress in Europe in order to prevent, as has been the case in recent years, money being sent around the globe five times in the same day and many people making a profit on this while losses are being nationalised.
I would ask the Commission to demand that Member States exercise strict budgetary discipline and implement appropriate rules.
I would also ask for the earliest possible tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is where we should be focusing our efforts.
I urge the Commission to take requisite measures, but not as before, off its own bat or by discussing them thoroughly with Member States.
Instead, it should finally take Parliament seriously as an equal legislator alongside the 27 Members States.
