Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Niebler has already said a great deal that very much concerns me too.
I am greatly concerned about our future together in the EU.
I cannot just move on to the agenda without mentioning the crisis.
One of our major objectives, the euro and its high monetary stability, is at risk of total collapse.
Prosperity and jobs are not feasible without a secure monetary value.
We are talking about Europe 2020, but we do not even know what Europe will look like in 2011.
We are debating meat glued together with thrombin and we are debating driving times for self-employed drivers, as if the major problems of the Union will solve themselves.
We need to send out strong and rapid signals about regulating, organising and improving the deficits in both state budgets and in the banking sector.
Let me give you a couple of examples: we need clear definitions and harsh penalties for deficit offenders, such as withdrawing funding.
We need clear rules for banks, such as banning credit default swaps or requirements for insurance and depositing these against corresponding nominal values.
Let me also add a sentence from a famous German mayor who was chair of the German Association of Cities and Towns for many years: He who does not spend money he does not have is a long way from being a saver!
