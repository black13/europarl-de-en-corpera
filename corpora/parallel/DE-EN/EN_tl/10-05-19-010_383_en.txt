Mr President, I would like to come back to the report by Mr Cort√©s Lastra, which I think is a very good report.
Indeed, the Cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment.
However, I would like to highlight again the importance of towns and cities here, because they will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy.
Four out of five Europeans live in urban areas.
Towns and cities are the driving force of economic growth in Europe.
At the same time, they are experiencing many problems particularly acutely.
Key words here are social integration, the environment and transport, for example, but also demographic change.
Therefore, towns and cities have a particular role when it comes to actually improving the living conditions of citizens.
In addition, Europe's towns and cities are key players in the fields of innovation, research and education, and therefore play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy.
All of this should be taken into account during the implementation of these strategies and during the shaping of the future course of the Cohesion policy.
