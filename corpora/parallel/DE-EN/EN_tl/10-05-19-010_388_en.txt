Mr President, when we talk about Europe 2020, then we are, first and foremost, talking about the future of our continent: Where do we want to go?
What sort of life will our citizens be able to live here?
What we need to do first, in my view, is to analyse the actual situation so that we can find the right tools to achieve these objectives.
It is also important to make a distinction between cause and effect.
What really are the major issues we face today?
I think one of them is certainly the ageing of our European societies.
So far, we have unfortunately failed to make Europe attractive enough for people to even start families and have children.
That means that we will face a major pressure on public budgets in future, because our pension systems are at risk of being underfunded.
Secondly, we already have high government deficits.
According to Keynes's classical teaching, we have spent a lot of money in this crisis.
Now it is time to save.
However, that also means of course that our currency will come under pressure.
We can see signs of that in the current Greek crisis and, here, we are all facing the problem of actually having failed to make our economy competitive enough to generate economic growth so that we are able to address these high government deficits.
Here in Europe, we have rules governing these areas, like the Stability and Growth Pact, but unfortunately, no one is sticking to them.
This is one of the main problems.
We are creating new rules, but I think that it would sometimes be much better to apply our existing rules so they can really achieve their full effect.
I therefore urge the Commission, in particular, to create a climate of stringency, so that we can achieve these agreed objectives.
