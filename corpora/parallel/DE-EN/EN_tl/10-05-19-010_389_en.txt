Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up on what Mr Seeber has already said.
If we really want to successfully carry off the objectives of the 2020 agenda, we first need to attend to the job in hand.
We need strong financial market regulation, regulation that really will be better at supervising and regulating future conduct in these areas.
However, we must also put our own houses in order, and that means ensuring that we have better controls in place for how effectively money from relevant structural funds is spent and in what ways we should support further development.
We also need to involve local and regional authorities more in our structures and planning because, ultimately, they are the ones who have to implement tasks on the ground, and make it clear which tasks need to be fulfilled if we are to achieve the objectives we have quite rightly set for ourselves.
However, setting objectives without robustly and consistently addressing the status quo and the tasks to be completed and without analysing what needs to be done now makes little sense in my view.
As Mr Ulmer said earlier on, we have moved on to the agenda and we are debating the day-to-day business of this House, food safety and so on, without really being aware of what priority issues we need to resolve.
That has to be our starting point.
We first need to focus on bringing our financial situation under control and ensuring that everyone adheres to these rules.
We must also ensure that Parliament and, in particular, the Commission apply the control mechanisms that have been available to them in the past more stringently in the future and we must have a greater say in what is happening in some Member States.
