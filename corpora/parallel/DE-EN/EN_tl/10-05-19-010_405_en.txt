Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the Europe 2020 strategy and its key priorities.
There is a lesson to be learned from the Greek crisis: we need to act instead of reacting.
A coordinated and monitored budgetary policy and supervision and regulation of the financial market are indispensable.
For the sake of our citizens, we need to pay attention to investment in growth and employment, in order to reduce unemployment and to create and secure jobs.
That also means strengthening the education sector and investing in education, research and innovation as cornerstones of a sustainable social market economy, and of a sustainable and more environmentally conscious economy.
