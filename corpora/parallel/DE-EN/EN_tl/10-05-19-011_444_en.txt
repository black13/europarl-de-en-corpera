Madam President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly.
It would appear that my fellow Member does not know the difference between training and education.
In times when technology is taking away most of our work, it is increasingly important that universities educate citizens into mature and analytical people.
That is just what we need.
We therefore need people who are capable of asking searching questions about social processes.
After all, business does not set itself such an objective.
Business wants to train people and is entitled to do that, that is all well and good.
However, that is only a requirement from one subsystem of our society and it does not represent what we need in a society as a whole.
Let me make another brief comment: we need scientific creativity and scientific curiosity.
I do not accept the view, and I certainly do not believe, that business is able to buy the curiosity and the creativity that we so desperately need through their financial input.
No!
