Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for a lively debate and for your many proposals and ideas.
I believe that there is broad agreement in this House that the dialogue between universities and the working world and business can be beneficial for everyone involved, for the universities themselves, researchers, lecturers, students, businesses and for society as a whole.
In my opinion, this is not a case of 'whether' but 'how', that is, how we can develop dialogue and cooperation.
This is about knowledge transfer, about dialogue and information exchange during education and lifelong learning, it is about cooperation in basic research and about fostering a more practical approach alongside the theoretical one in education through insight into business value creation and manufacturing.
Business does not have a supplanting role here, but a complementary one, and the crucial point is that research will remain free just as teaching will.
It will make its own decision in this regard; it will not be forced into this by politicians.
We need a win-win situation, that is, one in which science and teaching institutions, on the one hand, and research and business, on the other, will say 'yes' to this partnership.
Freedom of research and teaching does not mean floating in a vacuum, but being involved in society and the world of employment.
For that reason, I believe that this report is a good stock-take and it makes it clear what route we need to take in order to reinforce our universities and strengthen the competitiveness of European business and technology.
With our forum, we want to make a small contribution, offer a platform and consider how our forum's activities can be supplemented.
The report provides a good basis for that and is a good source of reference, and for that I am very grateful.
