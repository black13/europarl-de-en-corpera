Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for the open debate on this sensitive subject.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the Commission very much welcomes the overall positive approach of the report and the fact that Parliament agrees with the Commission that Bulgaria should receive further support amounting to EUR 300 million up until 2013.
The Commission is also pleased that we can continue to focus on providing support for safe dismantling measures and that Parliament believes that projects in the energy sector deserve our support.
We can confirm, as we have done in the past, that the funds will be used for the intended purpose and we plan to put reliable controls in place.
We take note of your proposals and amendments.
I am sure that the Council will take into account Parliament's opinions wherever they can help to improve the clarity of the regulation's objectives.
Your agreement on further financing for the dismantling work is a sign of the European Union's solidarity with Bulgaria.
Safety is the highest priority during the process of dismantling nuclear power stations and this is emphasised in the statement.
I would like to thank you once again for your work and also Mrs Harms for this report.
