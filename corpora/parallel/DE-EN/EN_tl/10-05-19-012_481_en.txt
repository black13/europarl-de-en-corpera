Mr President, at the end of this debate, I would once again like to say that the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria has been based on international expertise.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspected these reactors, which have the same design as those in Chernobyl, and saw no possibility of converting them to meet the safety standards which applied in the old European Union.
It was an intelligent decision which justifies the fact that we have shown our solidarity with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria and, following tomorrow's decision, have treated them equally with regard to the costs of decommissioning.
Secondly, I would like to point out once again that none of these countries and no other countries in Western Europe or elsewhere in the world have yet found a reliable solution to the problem of the final storage of highly radioactive waste.
This is a task which still faces us, although many countries have now invested billions in this area and have been looking for a reliable solution for 30 years.
This is a debate with which those people in particular who are in favour of the high-risk technology of nuclear power need to concern themselves, because, as things stand today, the storage of nuclear waste, in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority of Europe's citizens, represents such a large and unresolved risk that it is a strong argument against continuing to make use of nuclear power.
We will be discussing this with Mr Oettinger in future.
Thank you for your attention.
