During the accession negotiations in 2005, Bulgaria agreed to shut down reactor units 1-4 at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant and then to decommission them.
Originally, the EU intended to provide financial support for the decommissioning process until 2009.
Now the financial aid has been extended until the end of 2013 and a total of EUR 300 million will be made available.
Of course, it is necessary to give Bulgaria support during the decommissioning of Kozloduy and to help with the accompanying financial and environmental problems, such as safely disposing of radioactive waste, promoting renewable energy resources and retraining employees.
However, the financial aid must involve a detailed breakdown of the different plans, strict financial controls and regular monitoring of the use of the funding.
The money must not be used through the back door to provide financial support for the second Bulgarian nuclear power plant in Belene.
Bulgaria is currently looking for European investors for Belene and the option of using the decommissioning money for this purpose is a very timely one.
We must prevent this from happening.
Careful reporting and thorough on-site investigations by the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Auditors are therefore essential.
