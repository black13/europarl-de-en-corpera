Mr President, when the Union for the Mediterranean was founded almost two years ago, the intention, as we know, was that it should be linked to the Barcelona Process in order to create a closer relationship between the Mediterranean countries and the EU.
However, this process has obviously come to a standstill because of the conflict between the Arab states and Israel.
The EU has concluded an association agreement with Israel and provided financial aid, including EUR 440 million as reconstruction aid for the Gaza Strip.
The citizens of the EU are rightly asking why their taxes are being pumped into the Gaza Strip when everything there is regularly bombed flat again and are calling for conclusions to be drawn from this.
It is also possible that Hamas is profiting from this aid.
Throughout all the years, the EU has not succeeded in acting as an impartial mediator in the Gaza Strip.
Now, the summit of the Union for the Mediterranean in Barcelona, which is planned for the beginning of June, is also likely to break down because of the conflict between Israel and the Arab states.
Particularly in times of crisis, it is important, in my opinion, to evaluate plans more carefully and, if necessary, to shelve them.
During this crisis, we will not be able to afford projects which are just about prestige or those which are simply money pits.
