Mr President, I would like to ask you to call in the trialogue for the Council always to be represented here on Thursday morning.
In the case of some Council presidencies, and I will not name them for reasons of modesty, the representative was even here on a Thursday afternoon.
I think that the Council should be present for the majority of the plenary part-session.
