Mr President, the Mediterranean has been the cradle of European culture and the driving force behind it for millennia and, therefore, I very much welcome this joint approach.
However, the Mediterranean region is also a bridge for almost unrestricted immigration into the EU.
In our opinion, one of the most important problems in the Mediterranean area, in other words, illegal immigration, forms part of the six main strategic projects and, therefore, urgently needs to be included.
Only a joint approach in the Mediterranean countries, including those in North Africa, can help to slow down the flood of illegal immigration.
This is the only way in which we can stem the tide of refugees at its starting point.
As well as combating organised people smuggling, the EU must also focus increasingly on fighting poverty, raising awareness and providing information in the countries where the immigrants come from.
It must be clearly explained to those people who want to migrate that the streets of Europe are not paved with gold, that Europe cannot provide jobs, prosperity and asylum for everyone and that many of these traumatic journeys end in detention and deportation.
