The Union for the Mediterranean, which was founded almost two years ago on the basis of the Barcelona Process and under the leadership of France, still faces many challenges.
The political dialogue between the EU and its southern neighbours is not restricted simply to the subjects of migration and economic agreements.
It also includes areas such as disaster control, energy and the environment.
The Mediterranean regions are hard hit by water shortages and drought.
In 2007, one third of Europeans lived in regions where water was in short supply.
This problem is even more acute in the Maghreb countries, which do not have the necessary technical and financial resources to use water more efficiently.
In the case of sudden, heavy rainfall, floods can cause even more damage, because of the infrastructure problems in these regions.
Water is fundamental to all life and, therefore, it is necessary for us to increase our financial and economic cooperation.
Projects which improve environmental protection can only be implemented on the basis of improved collaboration between the countries in the Mediterranean region.
