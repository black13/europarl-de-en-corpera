Mr President, on 9 May, President Buzek and 20 000 people celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Robert Schuman declaration here in Strasbourg.
Against this background, I would like to say that the South Caucasus is faced with two alternatives.
One is to become something like the Balkans before the First World War, but on a global scale, and the other is to become something like the European Coal and Steel Community after the Second World War.
In the Kirilov report, we are choosing the second of these two options.
I agree with Mr Swoboda that if the three states in the South Caucasus were to work more closely together, the impact of external influences, such as the Russian influence, could be reduced.
Therefore, it is in the interests of all three countries to come together.
I support Armenia in its efforts to gain recognition of the genocide carried out by the Ottoman Empire.
However, Armenia would be much more credible if it finally withdrew its troops from Azerbaijan.
We urgently need a peaceful solution in Nagorno-Karabakh and in the occupied Azerbaijani areas.
Just as importantly, we need more stability in Georgia, because if Georgia is broken up, as many people in Moscow want, then the whole region will be destabilised.
For this reason, the main issues are peace negotiations, a solution for the nationality conflicts and, above all, the return of displaced people to their homes.
In the 21st century, displacement must not continue to be used as a political tool.
People should not be attempting to maintain the process of displacement.
We need a great deal more sensitivity and much more action in this area.
