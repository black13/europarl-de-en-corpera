Mr President, in order to reduce Europe's dependence on Russia for its supplies of energy, we should take natural gas from the Caspian basin through the South Caucasus to the EU.
This will give the Caucasus a key role.
This region is not only the world's largest transit point for the trade in gas and oil.
It is also the place where the interests of Russia and the West collide and where even Turkey wants to become involved.
In addition to the oil and gas contracts, Turkey is attempting to conclude a stability and cooperation pact.
Stability in the Caucasus is undoubtedly also in the EU's interests, but we must not leave the responsibility for this plan to Turkey, otherwise new dependencies and even pressures will arise in the accession process.
As the example of Cyprus shows, Ankara does not pull its punches.
The ongoing power struggles over the European supply of natural gas have already delayed the construction of the large-scale Nabucco pipeline project, which has been in the planning stage for a long time.
I hope that the competing South Stream project will have more success, so that the resources from the Caspian area are not lost to China.
