Madam President, we must take a critical but also a very objective and discerning approach to Pakistan, which is an important ally.
Pakistan is an Islamic country and we must respect that.
It was founded by the Muslims from British India because of their religious affiliation, in the same way that India was founded by Hindus.
Both countries have had minorities from the beginning and both have developed a great tradition of tolerance.
This respect for all religious minorities and, in particular, for Christians, must be reinforced.
I believe that we can put the emphasis on this.
Who will support the cause of Christians, if Europe, a continent which is almost completely Christian in nature, does not?
We are under a very special obligation but, at the same time, we must make it clear that we respect the leading and often constructive role which Pakistan has played and can continue to play in the Islamic world.
