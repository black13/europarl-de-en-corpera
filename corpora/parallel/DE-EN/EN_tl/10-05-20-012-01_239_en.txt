Madam President, around 75% to 80% of all those suffering religious persecution worldwide are Christians.
We in the European Parliament are fighting specifically for human rights throughout the world.
For me, religious freedom is a central concept of our human rights policy.
Therefore, I regret that those on the left and the liberal left in the European Parliament often join together to keep silent about the fate of Christians.
At the same time, I am pleased that we are jointly tabling a resolution today about the dreadful situation in Pakistan.
Of the 156 million people in Pakistan, 95% are Muslims, around 3% Christians and around 2% Hindus.
As a Christian, I would like to focus once again on the situation of the Pakistani Christians, who are subjected to severe persecution.
Anyone who allows violent attacks on Christians to take place must receive a response from the civilised world.
Therefore, the EU should introduce a criterion in its development policy and economic cooperation which covers this issue and allows sanctions to be applied if necessary.
