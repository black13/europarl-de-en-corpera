Madam President, in the case of any country, it is important to consider its origins and whether the developments in the area of human and minority rights are moving in the right direction.
As head of the European Union monitoring mission during the last elections two years ago, I made several recommendations and I am pleased to see that the country has begun implementing some of them.
These include ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - this has not only been signed, but has evidently also now been ratified - and also the UN Convention against Torture.
It is good that there is now a minister in place who is responsible ex officio for minority issues and who will gradually attempt to overcome discrimination.
Among other questions, that of the Ahmadis has also been raised.
One of my recommendations was that next time, they should be taken off their separate electoral register and incorporated into the main electoral register.
I believe that this would be a specific measure which would help to bring an end to discrimination against this minority.
