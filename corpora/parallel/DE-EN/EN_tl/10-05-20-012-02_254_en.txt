Madam President, the images of the anger, violence and destruction in Bangkok are still fresh in our minds.
Although attention has now, to a certain extent, moved away from the highly charged situation in the Thai capital, the risk of further violent clashes is by no means over.
The violent conflict between the so-called red shirts and the government, backed by the army, has already resulted in more than 70 people being killed and almost 2 000 injured.
The government has announced that it will investigate these deaths and those which occurred in the last few days must also be included in this investigation.
It is important to consider the fundamental causes of these recurring protests and clashes in order to find a viable political solution.
Part of the Thai population is severely disadvantaged and socially excluded.
These people are very critical of their unfair treatment and lack of rights.
They are fighting against their comparatively low standard of living.
Other factors include conspicuous and widespread corruption within the political leadership, but also among the people in positions of responsibility within civil society.
These structural problems must be exposed and resolved, if a lasting solution is to be found, rather than just bringing an end to hostilities.
We call on all the parties in the conflict to play a serious and constructive role in finding a solution to this major crisis.
However, both sides must use only peaceful and democratic means to bring this about and, for this, they need the support of the EU.
