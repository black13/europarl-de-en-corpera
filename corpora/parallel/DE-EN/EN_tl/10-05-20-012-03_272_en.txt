Madam President, in 1990, the Burmese human rights activist, Aung San Suu Kyi, was awarded the Sakharov prize by the European Parliament.
In the years before and after this date, the critical human rights situation in Burma was the subject of numerous parliamentary resolutions.
Similarly, other international human rights organisations have been involved with the situation there.
Although improvements have been made in individual cases, the human rights situation in Burma remains extremely poor.
Against the background of a very good and comprehensive report, the UN Special Rapporteur on Burma has now called for an international investigation commission to be established which will have the mandate to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, should take up and support this call, for example, in the next General Assembly of the United Nations.
Elections are due to take place in Burma at the end of 2010 and the government has now implemented measures which deny many citizens the right to vote and stand for election.
This applies, in particular, to political prisoners and Buddhist monks, who make up a total of 400 000 people.
We are protesting against this and calling on the High Representative to express this criticism clearly in her bilateral and multilateral talks.
Finally, in the light of the complex human rights problems in Burma, it is incomprehensible that the European Union has cut its financial support for refugees on the Thai-Burmese border.
That is not acceptable and we are calling on the Commission to reverse these cuts and to begin providing cross-border aid for Burmese refugees once again.
