Madam President, you are undoubtedly a competent vice-president and you are also highly influential.
I very much welcome that fact.
You have not given some Members the opportunity to take the floor as part of the 'catch-the-eye' procedure, not because you did not want to, but because we have such a tight schedule.
The European Parliament is the voice of human rights and we are making do with just one hour.
So many of us have something to say and want to put pressure on the Commission in order to achieve results.
Are you personally in favour of holding the vote not at 16.00 or 16.30, but instead at 17.00 or 17.30, for example, so that we could have an extra hour and finally change this rule of procedure?
We need the opportunity to speak out.
We must be able to exert pressure on the Commission, but preferably not under such strict time pressure.
I know that it is not your responsibility, but I hope that you will intervene on our side so that we can finally change this rule of procedure.
