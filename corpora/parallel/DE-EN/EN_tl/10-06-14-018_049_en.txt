Mr President, I would like to make a couple of comments with regard to the 2011 budget.
As regards immigration: instead of stemming the flow of migrants into Europe and securing our external borders, Frontex's budget for 2011 is to be cut.
On the other hand, more money is to be put into the European Refugee Fund, the aim of which is the resettlement of refugees in the EU.
Such a budgetary policy defies logic and will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system.
Outside the EU, financial aid for Palestine is to be cut.
Instead, a significant increase in resources is being provided for enlargement, for example for the candidate country Turkey.
I demand an explanation as to why Turkey, which has moved backwards rather than forwards, is now to be rewarded with more money.
Eight million a year is still a significant amount.
In the area of administration, Parliament must finally put a stop to the establishment of umpteen new agencies.
It is unacceptable during times of economic crisis for the EU to indulge itself with an agency for every problem.
In addition, the added value, in specific terms, provided by every existing agency needs to be examined and monitored.
