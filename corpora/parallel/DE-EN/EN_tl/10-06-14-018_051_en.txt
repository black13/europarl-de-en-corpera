Mr President, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur.
I would like to endorse what Mr FÃ¤rm said about youth policy and the promotion of young people.
We have made employment and growth our watchwords and this constitutes the major goal for the next few years.
I believe that it is very important for us also to make a greater effort in this regard to ensure that, on the one hand, this growth is sustainable growth and, particularly in connection with the consolidation of the budgets of the European Union, but also with regard to the individual budgets of the Member States, that this consolidation is carried out in a socially attuned way and, above all, that this consolidation does not forget the justified interests and demands of young people, namely their right to the best education and training and their right to jobs.
I believe that there is nothing more important for young Europeans than the ability to use their skills.
We will need them if Europe is to remain competitive in future.
