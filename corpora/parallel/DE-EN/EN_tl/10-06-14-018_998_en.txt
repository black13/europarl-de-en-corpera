The planning process for the 2011 budget is the first one since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and it is taking place against the background of the financial and economic crises.
This is reflected in the very, very tight margins in the EU 2011 budget, which could have a negative impact on the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
On the positive side, I would like to highlight the fact that youth is one of the key priorities in the draft budget.
Unfortunately, the actual financial support proposed does not meet the expectations of the European Parliament.
A great deal can be achieved with relatively little funding in the areas relating to youth policy in particular.
Finally, I would like to remind the House that the EUR 60 billion which is being guaranteed by the EU budget following the Council decision of 9 May 2010 could very well have an impact on the budget.
Thank you.
