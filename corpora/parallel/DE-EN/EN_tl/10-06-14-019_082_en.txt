Madam President, the Millennium Development Goals are without doubt important if we are to ensure the poorest of the poor are able to live a dignified life in their own country.
Anyone with a reasonable basis for survival in his home country will not need to place himself in the hands of people-smugglers.
I would also like to give special emphasis to the fight against serious diseases, particularly those affecting mothers and children.
However, in this regard we should also remind the pharmaceuticals industry of its obligation and ensure that an increasing supply of generic medicines can be provided.
On the other hand, if we provide development aid we should also expect cooperation.
In this connection, I expect cooperation from the recipients in respect of the repatriation of illegal migrants to their relevant countries of origin.
Finally, we also need to take particular care to ensure that the funds are used in a sustainable and comprehensible way.
Taxpayers' hard-earned money must not disappear into mysterious channels.
One thing is perfectly clear: the output capacity of our Member States is severely strained, and the quicker we recover - that is, the quicker the EU recovers - the sooner we will have the ability to provide long-term sustainable aid.
