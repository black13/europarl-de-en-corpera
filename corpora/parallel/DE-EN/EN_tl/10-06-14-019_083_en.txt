Madam President, I would particularly like to thank Mr Cashman.
Development aid and the fight against poverty must not be a form of charity policy - by applying the carrot and stick principle, for example.
On the contrary, we need reliable, predictable, sustainable framework conditions which enable people to live and work in decent conditions and to make a living.
We should not merely look at faceless numbers; we need to consider the people affected and their fate.
We should not waste our energy coming up with excuses as to why we cannot, or do not want to, fulfil our obligations.
We should instead use our energy to hold a serious debate on the proposals for financing development aid that have been put forward here - for example the financial transaction tax.
