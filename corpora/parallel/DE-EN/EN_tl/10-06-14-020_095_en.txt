Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance do not want to prioritise freight transport.
We want the greatest possible degree of flexibility in order to use the available capacity efficiently for all types of transport by rail.
We do, however, want a one-stop shop as a point of contact for customers.
The intention now, however, is for this one-stop shop also to decide on the train paths.
For countries with heavily used rail networks and mixed modes of transport, that will be a disaster.
I still find the current wording incomprehensible.
I therefore consulted qualified lawyers and economists.
However, even they could not help me, and, in any case, we will not support a contradictory linguistic monstrosity.
Although the amount of funding has been reduced by almost a third, from EUR 20 billion to EUR 8 billion, the number of corridors has been increased from six to nine.
That is simply a refusal to face reality!
There are four problems, for example, with corridor 3 - Stockholm-Malm√∂-Copenhagen-Hamburg-Innsbruck-Verona-Naples-Palermo.
In Hamburg there is a bottleneck, the fixed-link Fehmarn Belt crossing has been cemented, the two Alpine tunnels that have just been completed in Switzerland are being ignored and the bridge across the Messina road is intended to be a European project.
The more cost-effective, shorter and faster alternative is the connection from Copenhagen via Rostock to Nuremburg through the newly built Alpine tunnel to Naples.
We want to stop climate change with an alternative transport policy.
Pointless large-scale projects, coupled with a refusal to face reality, will only gobble up money.
That is why we reject this report.
