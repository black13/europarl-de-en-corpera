Madam President, Commissioner, we are in complete agreement about the need for an internal market in rail freight transport as well.
This is very important.
We have had this on paper for a long time, but unfortunately we do not yet have it in practice.
If we still have a few differences of opinion, that is due to the fact that we have different experiences in the various Member States in terms of the functioning or non-functioning of the rail network.
I come from Germany, where it would be terrible if freight transport took priority over passenger transport.
That would have a very negative effect on local public passenger transport.
At the same time, we are very well aware that we need a continuous system in Europe.
This is something that we want as well as need.
There is just the question of how it will be implemented, how many corridors it will have and then, of course, also who will now lay down the one-stop shop rules, who will allocate the train paths.
There are completely different opinions on this.
Some people think that we would create a parallel system if we had a one-stop shop per corridor and not functional national one-stop shops, which should perhaps be included.
That is the only source of dissent that we have.
Otherwise, we all agree that we need this freight transport in Europe.
