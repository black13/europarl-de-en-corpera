Madam President, this regulation for creating a European rail network for competitive freight will, in my opinion, have a negative impact on rail operations throughout Europe.
Using a sledgehammer to smooth the way for European network management will not solve the existing problems.
On the contrary, centralising and fragmenting the responsibilities will generate new problems.
If freight trains have priority in future, it will put passenger transport, which we want to promote for environmental reasons, at an even greater competitive disadvantage.
The EU cannot call for environmentally sound behaviour, make motoring more expensive by means of biodiesel regulations and then, by means of privatisation regulations, separate off secondary lines from rail transport and dictate that there should be freight corridors on the large interconnections at the expense of passenger transport.
Particularly during peak traffic times, we need to proceed in a sensitive way here, so that we do not penalise commuters.
Shifting competences from the national infrastructure operators to the one-stop shops will result in a fragmentation of responsibilities and thus in an inflation of the bureaucratic apparatus.
By weakening the national entities, the intention is clearly to successively set up Europe's own infrastructure operators, which is neither sensible nor appropriate.
The rules contained in the regulations will, in addition to the loss of competence, result in a loss of capacity as a consequence of the early train path applications.
Therefore, the proposed compromise that is on the table should, in my opinion, be rejected.
