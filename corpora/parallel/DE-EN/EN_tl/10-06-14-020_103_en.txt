Madam President, I would like to emphasise that in principle it is, of course, nice that we operate in an internal market and that we include rail transport and freight transport in this and promote cooperation.
I would simply like to point out that we have different systems and rail networks in the Member States.
Thus, this will naturally always be very difficult in the densely populated regions.
We do not have separate systems; in other words, a one-stop shop will de facto result in some sort of priority being given to freight transport, and even when new train paths are established, this sort of central entity will also have a corresponding influence on passenger transport.
Here, too, we will be able to see some sort of priority being given to freight transport, even if it is not explicitly stated.
However, we need to ensure that passenger transport also remains an attractive option in the densely populated regions.
