Madam President, rail rather than road should be the guiding principle of European policy for freight transport in the 21st century, and instead of extending the EU Directive to provide for the approval of 'gigaliners', our goal needs to be to move freight transport onto the railways.
The railways should ultimately be quicker and more cost-effective for hauliers and therefore also attractive enough for them to leave the roads.
What surprises me about this draft is the fact that it makes no mention of the Brenner Base Tunnel.
This tunnel is, after all, a central element of the 2 200 km-long rail connection from Berlin to Palermo and an important project in the context of the trans-European network.
As we all know, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the funding to be provided by Italy, and the EU is refusing to make any further legally binding financial promises for the period after 2013.
The Brenner Base Tunnel must not become a black hole for billions of euro.
I expect clear information about this construction project.
We owe that to taxpayers and to those living north and south of the Brenner Base Tunnel in Italy and Austria.
