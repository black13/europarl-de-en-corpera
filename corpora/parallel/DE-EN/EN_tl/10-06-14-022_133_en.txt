Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to offer my sincere thanks for the way you have spoken out so passionately in favour of the procedural rights and standards that will bring us ever closer towards an internal market for justice.
I am very pleased that we have finally managed, thanks also to Mrs Antonescu, to eradicate the summary procedures from this area.
It would have been very nice to lay down even more requirements for the translators, because what good is a translation if you cannot guarantee the quality of the translator?
The implementation time of three years is, in my opinion, painful, but I do not think it will disadvantage those affected in any way, because they have the European Convention on Human Rights and the entire judicial service will also have to be changed.
That is important for jurisprudence, too.
I therefore thank you that it has gone so well.
Thank you very much.
