Madam President, this report represents progress for Europe.
It is a good step towards creating a Europe of lawfulness.
However, a great deal will depend on whether the framework decision will now actually be applied uniformly, as the uniform application of this framework decision is absolutely crucial.
If there are differences in the minimum legal standard, it will not be possible to create trust in the relevant legal systems.
We need to create trust.
Personally, I would like to say that I would have liked the administrative penalty procedure to have also been included, as it now means that a very important legal area is not covered.
However, I am, of course, aware that this is an especially important and broad field.
I hope that this aspect will also be satisfied soon during the implementation of the Stockholm Programme.
