Madam President, the importance of the Internet - and this links seamlessly with the previous topic - has increased considerably over the last 20 years.
Entire sectors have come into being, business models depend on the uninterrupted use of the Internet and now we are linking education to it.
The Internet provides a substitute for social encounters.
However, we also have a very different form of private communication, and it now has an infrastructure that resembles that of general public services.
We therefore also need some sort of voice when it comes to decisions regarding the further development of the Internet.
However, we always have to say that, firstly, the freedom of the Internet will naturally be abused and, secondly, it also has a value in itself that we must retain and we cannot allow something online that is prohibited offline.
However, this self-regulation is not working in the way that we would like it to.
Therefore, freedom on the one hand and data protection and privacy on the other are not opposing aims, but belong together in a single concept.
I would therefore like to urge the Commission to also be involved in this consultation and further development of the Internet.
