Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to thank Mrs Bauer for her report and for her excellent work in recent months.
The fundamental issue is whether or not the working hours of self-employed workers in the transport sector should be regulated for the first time.
The Commission says not, nearly all the Member States say not, and the majority of my group also says not.
If we were to include self-employed drivers in the directive, it would only serve the interests of big business.
We need to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, however.
We need to tell those who cite shortcomings in road safety as justification for including self-employed workers that the rules on driving hours and rest times have long since been tightened up.
All drivers - whether self-employed or employees - must take a minimum of 11 hours rest over a 24-hour period.
That is why we have digital tachographs that automatically record driving hours, and the authorities monitor compliance with this.
I was the European Parliament's rapporteur on tachographs at the time.
I am grateful to Mrs Bauer for preventing the regulation being extended to vehicles weighing less than 3.5 tonnes.
Digital EU control devices in all commercial vehicles would have resulted in time-consuming and expensive documentation obligations.
We want to reduce bureaucracy, not increase it.
I therefore recommend that this House support the compromise that the rapporteur has reached with other groups.
