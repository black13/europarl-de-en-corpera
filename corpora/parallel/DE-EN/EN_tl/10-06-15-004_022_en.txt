Madam President, we have heard a great deal already.
It is true, as Mrs Figueiredo said, that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees.
That is correct.
However, there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees.
It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work - whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker.
That is only right.
Naturally, the self-employed also have to play by certain rules.
Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here.
If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive, it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice.
That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs.
We consider Mrs Bauer's proposal, and the proposal from the Commission, to be right.
That should be taken into account.
We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and in this case, we can do so by adopting the proposal.
