Madam President, the previous speaker described an ideal world in which drivers themselves decide whether they want to be self-employed or employees.
Unfortunately, in reality, drivers no longer have this choice; instead, they are generally being pushed into being self-employed - or at least, ostensibly self-employed.
That is the big problem that we face here - and if what we have here is a private compromise between a Member of Parliament and the Council which is being presented as a general compromise and which does not give consideration to this issue, then we are playing into the hands of social dumping in Europe.
Go and have a look at what is happening on the roads by visiting a checkpoint.
Take a look at what is really going on in this sector.
Go and have a look at the accidents - then you will realise that, as Members of the European Parliament, we cannot allow ourselves to advocate social dumping.
