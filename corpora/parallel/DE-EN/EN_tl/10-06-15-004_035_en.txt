Madam President, Commissioner, the directive represents an important step in improving the health and safety of workers in this sector, but also in improving road safety and ensuring fair competition.
These are the words of the Commission itself when the directive was introduced on 23 March 2005.
Since then, the Commission has done a U-turn and submitted a proposal that excludes self-employed workers.
That sets a precedent and I cannot defend such a policy.
There are various reasons not to support the proposal which, in my eyes, represents a step backward socially, a reduction in road safety and an incentive for unfair competition.
Neither has the proposal been designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
To me, this U-turn demonstrates an inability to implement European policy.
Despite being twice rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and once in plenary, contrary to a European Economic Area report as well as a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the directive - European law - is simply being amended and steered towards a point where economic interests are the only thing that count.
