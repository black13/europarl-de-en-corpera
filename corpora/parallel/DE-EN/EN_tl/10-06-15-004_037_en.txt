Madam President, I would like to agree with Mrs Morin-Chartier.
We must not forget that we are dealing with the European Court of Justice in this matter, which has made it quite clear that priority must be given to road safety and that this concerns an existing directive on working hours and rest times.
Do we want to suddenly call into question a common European regulation on road safety?
Why would we do that?
It would be absurd and incomprehensible.
If self-employed workers were to be excluded from this directive again, then, in addition to their 56 hours of driving time, they would also be able to spend 28 hours loading and unloading.
As a result, they would become a menace on the roads.
I certainly would not like to encounter such drivers on the roads of Europe.
How can we suddenly start promoting the distortion of competition at the expense of our common health?
How could we explain that to our citizens?
That is why I urge you to reject the Commission proposal.
