Madam President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, demonstrates a failure to understand democracy in that she continued to negotiate - with no mandate - against the decision of the Committee.
If the European Parliament is serious about creating growth and wealth, then we Members must reject the Commission proposal.
Self-employed drivers must not be excluded from the Working Time Directive.
This would be a backwards step, since the same rules must apply to self-employed bus drivers and long-distance lorry drivers as to the employees of enterprises.
It cannot be our aim to have fewer and fewer people working more and more - and generally for less and less money.
It cannot be our objective to have bus drivers and long-distance lorry drivers jeopardise their own health as well as the safety of other road users.
