Madam President, I believe that Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important at this time, because the truth is that we will only find a way out of the debt crisis if we work more.
It is entirely unnecessary to burden the self-employed with yet more bureaucracy and paperwork.
Quite simply, if we are to be able to ensure social security in Europe, then it is very important that we increase productivity and competitiveness.
Consequently, the driving times and rest times currently guaranteed by tachographs are entirely sufficient.
I would ask those Members who advocate that the directive should apply to all to apply it to themselves and to have a tachograph installed in their own cars - and then not to use their cars on Thursday evening when they go home after working here for 15 hours.
Ensuring safety is important but, on the other hand, we must also protect the self-employed.
