Mr President, Commissioner, the task of politics and the task of the European Parliament should be to further improve the quality of life enjoyed by Europeans.
That includes a healthy environment, and it also includes wholesome food.
If I am to eat healthily, then I, as a consumer, need this information.
We urgently need feasible, mandatory country of origin labelling so that consumers can make an informed decision as to which foods they buy from which region.
On the other hand, however, we also still need nutritional profiles, because only these can ensure that consumers are not misled as to whether a food is healthy and whether the ingredients really promote health and a good diet.
In addition to this, however, we definitely need clarification and education in the area of nutrition.
That includes wholesome food from a healthy environment as well as the requisite amount of exercise.
