Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur.
Effective food labelling is indeed very important.
Consumers need to know what they are eating, and they need to find that out in the brief time that they are in the supermarket doing their shopping.
However, the information must be provided in such a way that you do not need a degree in food science to understand it.
Our target group for this information is quite different, after all - it is not those who already have an excellent knowledge of how healthy different foods are.
I consider one area to be particularly important, and that is the area of traditionally produced products, particularly products processed and marketed directly by the farmer.
The contents of these products are often not standardised - I am thinking, for example, of jams and juices - and it is simply not possible to state information such as the precise sugar content or precise calorific values.
In recent years, we have done a lot of work to reduce the distance travelled between farmer and consumer, and today, factors such as life on the farm, farmers' markets, and so on are very important overall for the image of farmers and agriculture.
We have also spent European money on promoting such things as part of our rural development programme.
Moreover, in such sales, there is often a direct relationship between the farmer and the purchaser, and that is often more important than information on labels.
Consequently, I urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support those amendments that are aimed at finding a sensible solution for this category of sales.
