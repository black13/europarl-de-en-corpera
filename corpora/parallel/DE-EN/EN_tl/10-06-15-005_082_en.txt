Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that there are health problems in the European Union, nor is there any doubt that the interests of consumers must have priority or that food is unlike other commodities, in that it is something that we consume and put into our bodies.
It is therefore obvious that we must take particular care when talking about foodstuffs and their labelling, and that the precautionary principle - as rooted in the treaty - must also apply here.
However, it is na√Øve to think that we can solve these problems through food labelling.
Take a look at the US: there are many overweight people in the US, and yet the Americans have the most stringent food labelling.
Consequently, we need to give particular consideration to how to deal with this problem here in Europe.
I therefore believe firstly that a traffic light system, as proposed, will not achieve our objectives - since the confusion it creates is greater than the information it provides.
Secondly, however, it is also my belief that a GDA system, as has also been proposed, is very likely to provide the information that knowledge-seeking consumers will find useful for making the right choices.
Thirdly, I believe that country of origin labelling is important, particularly for foods.
Most consumers want to know where their food comes from and where it was manufactured.
Fourthly, I believe that health information must be scientifically based if it is to influence consumers' decisions.
I have one final request to the Commissioner: we are still awaiting a Commission proposal on the financing of the EFSA.
This is the only authority that charges no fees for its activities.
Please would you tell us something about when we can expect this.
