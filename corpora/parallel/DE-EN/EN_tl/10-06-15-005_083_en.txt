Mr President, today's good news is that the new legislation will provide uniform, mandatory nutritional labelling that relates to 100 grams, thereby providing greater comparability.
Statements of nutritional value provide consumers with information that allows them to make an informed purchasing decision.
The model I have in my mind is that of the responsible consumer who knows what he is buying.
Imitation products that are not clearly marked as such deliberately mislead consumers.
Imitation cheese, pressed ham products, vanilla yoghurt that contains no vanilla whatsoever - these are just a few examples.
All these imitation products must be labelled as such.
I am pleased that we will send a clear signal to the Council tomorrow and that all of us here are agreed that we need better labelling.
As far as I am concerned, the task is to provide information; we should leave consumers to make up their own minds, however.
That is why I am against traffic light labelling.
There are no unhealthy foods - only unhealthy, unbalanced diets.
The traffic lights are misleading.
I am in favour of food labelling according to the GDA model and am pleased that we are likely to vote to move towards this tomorrow.
