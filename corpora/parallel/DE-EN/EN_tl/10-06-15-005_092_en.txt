Mr President, three million European schoolchildren are overweight and the number is increasing by a further 85 000 each year.
Naturally, being overweight causes a range of chronic illnesses and that is why what we eat as food is important.
In other words, we are what we eat.
It is in the interests of consumers that we have clear, understandable food labelling that makes reference to certain ingredients.
I therefore welcome the idea of providing all consumers with a quick idea of the fat, sugar and salt content of a product.
What really does not belong in this regulation, however, is responsibility for the origin of the ingredients of a product.
It is therefore important that someone assumes responsibility for where the ingredients used in a ready-made product come from.
In this connection - in this sensitive segment of the market - it is also very important that we have sanctions in place: sanctions for those who deliberately deceive consumers and make false statements concerning the products and their ingredients.
