Mr President, we are talking today about information, and information can be distributed all over the world at the press of a button.
There is no shortage of information; rather, what is lacking is clear, brief and appropriate information.
One thing is certain: a food label cannot be a manual for healthy eating.
Knowledge of diet is something that must be communicated in the family, in schools and in communities.
Everyone needs to have some basic knowledge if they are to be able to use the information on food labels to put together their own healthy diet.
GDAs, nutritional profiles and health claims are not necessary on labels.
Traffic lights that can be red and green at the same time - since high sugar and low fat are not mutually exclusive - are of no help to consumers.
Region of origin labelling is no longer appropriate in today's world.
Our dairy in the Eifel takes in milk from Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg.
So what is the country of origin of the cheese produced?
Obviously, we must take action to prevent consumers being deceived.
The label must state what is in the product, without any possibility of misunderstanding.
A cheese substitute must be clearly recognisable as such and designated accordingly.
A food additive, a piece of meat that has been stuck together, must not be sold as ham on the deli counter.
I urge you to support the rapporteur's proposals.
