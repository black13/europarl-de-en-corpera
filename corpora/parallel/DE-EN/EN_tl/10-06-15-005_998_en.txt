We have spent around EUR 90 million on the EU campaign to promote a healthy diet for European school children.
The aim is to encourage children to eat healthily by offering them free fruit.
So we are spending millions on drumming it into the heads of children that they should eat apples and other fruit.
Then we plan to introduce a food labelling system in which foods with a low sugar, fat and salt content would have a green traffic light on the label and those with a high content a red traffic light.
All of a sudden, those apples which we have supplied at a cost of millions of euros would have a red label because of their sugar content and would therefore be seen as being unhealthy.
The kids would probably not find anything very complimentary to say about the EU if this were the case.
Even those people who do not think about what they eat have finally got the message that consuming excessive amounts of convenience foods, biscuits, sweets and alcohol is unhealthy.
For all the people who want to take their health into consideration when buying food, or who are forced to do so because of an illness, a complete list of ingredients is much more important.
This will make it easier for diabetics, for example, to calculate the number of bread units, instead of having to guess how much insulin to inject.
For the 10% or so of consumers who apparently read the nutrition labelling, the calorific value and calorie content are the ideal solution.
In contrast, a confusing colour-coded system does not really serve a useful purpose.
