Mr President, the debate on enhanced powers for Eurostat does not really address the problem.
We must never again find ourselves in a situation in which a Member State plays tricks with its budget data and lives beyond its means for years at the expense of others; where there are reasons to doubt data, the data must be verified.
However, the EU must not use Greece and the current euro crisis as an excuse to completely remove powers of budgetary sovereignty from the Member States.
Rather, the problem must be rooted out.
The socio-economic structures of the Member States vary greatly in some instances.
Even Eurostat, which juggles the figures for the EU, must realise this.
An unemployed person in London is not the same as an unemployed person in Paris, because different criteria apply.
The differences in socio-economic realities between the traditional hard currency and soft currency countries are even more striking.
Eurostat must not maintain this myth of comparability at any price; rather, the comparability of the euro area countries must be fundamentally rethought.
