Mr President, we are all aware that the amendment of the regulation as regards the quality of statistical data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure is a particularly important and urgent measure in view of the present problems in most of the national budgets of the Member States.
Without precise, clear data, it is difficult to decide on and establish further measures.
To this extent, a control mechanism needs to be put in place that allows the data submitted by the national authorities to be verified in good time.
In any event, we must never again find ourselves in a situation - such as we did with Greece - in which it is only in retrospect that it becomes apparent that decisions with wide-ranging implications were taken on the basis of incorrect or falsified data.
We must also consider penalties for those states that deliberately communicate incorrect data or statistics.
The enhancement of Eurostat and its expansion into an independent authority should therefore be considered in any event.
This is not interfering with the budgetary sovereignty of the Member States at all, but rather is about having effective checks on data.
