Mr President, in all modesty, I would like to ask you a question.
You have a large number of highly paid colleagues up there who I am sure will be able to give you some assistance in answering the following question.
On my screen, I have the name Tőkés.
My machine then has three buttons that are to be pressed for roll-call votes.
The first button is for 'Yes', the middle button is for 'Abstention' and the third button is for 'No'.
Is that correct?
(Heckling in agreement)
Does that mean that those who want to vote for Mr Tőkés press the 'Yes' button, those that do not want to vote for him press the 'No' button and those who wish to abstain - such as my group - press the 'Abstention' button?
Is that right?
(Applause)
