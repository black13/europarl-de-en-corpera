Mr President, let us approach this whole process rather more calmly.
Usually, the Vice-Presidents of Parliament are elected in a block at the start of the legislative period or in the course of the legislative period.
When we do that, fellow Members, we only ever find out the number of 'Yes' votes cast for a candidate - which also decides the order in which Members are elected to the Bureau.
Now, because a Member has left, we are voting in one more Vice-President today - so the only important thing is whether he has received the number of 'Yes' votes required for election.
Anything else makes no difference.
It is different to other votes.
(Applause)
The President of Parliament has given a perfect description of the secret ballot, and it worked beautifully for me without my having to press various buttons.
I pressed the button that I wanted to press and the blue light appeared.
Perhaps we could simply all try it together once more, Mr President.
(Applause)
