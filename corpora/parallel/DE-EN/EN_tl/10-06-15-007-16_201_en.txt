Mr President, it was not possible for me to vote 'No' in the vote because the voting machine only displayed something once I had pressed the 'Yes' button followed by the 'Abstention' button.
Please would you check once again how the machine is collecting and counting the votes, because in my opinion, it was not conclusive.
I was not the only one who found this; a number of other Members had the same experience.
They were unable to press the 'Abstention' button or the 'No' button, but instead had to vote 'Yes' first.
It makes this voting process rather hazardous.
Please would you therefore check again how the votes were counted.
