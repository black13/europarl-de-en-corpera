Mr President, Mr Vice-President, our plenary sessions are public and this gives a very poor impression.
I would like to add my voice to what has been said.
I am not asking for an email; instead I would actually like it to be officially presented and explained on Parliament's website, because one statement at least must be incorrect.
168 cannot have been the threshold.
If 621 votes were cast, then the threshold must have been 310 - if I have understood things correctly.
I would therefore ask for a written explanation on the website so that every citizen can also understand it.
In view of the large number of people who were watching, we have really given an extremely poor public impression.
