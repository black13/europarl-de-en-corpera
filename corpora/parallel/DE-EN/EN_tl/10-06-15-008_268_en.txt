in writing. - The European Transparency Initiative was started years ago, but has made limited progress.
The publication of recipients of agricultural subsidies, for example, has brought to light the fact that often, these funds go to big business, royal houses, and so on.
If the EU is serious about transparency, then it must also be implemented consistently in decision making.
As ever, the transparency initiative is largely empty words, which is why I abstained from voting.
