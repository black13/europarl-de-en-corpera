in writing. - I voted against the compromise proposals for the regulation concerning a European rail network for competitive freight.
It will take away power from the national infrastructure authorities which have worked very efficiently and effectively to date, including in the international sphere.
The proposed measures will also result in more bureaucracy, which cannot be our aim.
This inflation will reduce efficiency.
Capacity will be left unused.
In my opinion, all this will have a negative impact on rail operations throughout Europe.
If the EU really wants to encourage more freight onto the rail network, then it should set priorities in the realisation of the trans-European transport networks.
Complete expansion of the southern corridor by means of the so-called Koralm Tunnel, for example, would bring about an unprecedented shift onto the rail network.
We should be promoting rail freight, not more centralisation.
