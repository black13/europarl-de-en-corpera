I absolutely reject this report, albeit that unfortunately, no final vote is possible in the second reading.
For Deutsche Bahn, the one-stop shop strategy will mean that, as the only player facing competition in a liberalised German network, it will be a measure equivalent to expropriation and will result in a competitive disadvantage that cannot be made up, since Germany has mixed passenger and freight traffic and no separate high-speed networks.
I would urgently advise Deutsche Bahn to look into taking legal action against this decision.
