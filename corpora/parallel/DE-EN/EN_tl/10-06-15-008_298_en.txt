The present adaptation of the Rules of Procedure is necessitated partly by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
To this extent, it is a formal act.
However, in the course of these amendments, the two large groups - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament - are attempting to curtail the rights of Members who do not belong to one of the large groups.
This is particularly wrong and unfair, since it would be lost in the mire of the debate on the major adaptations to the Treaty of Lisbon.
For example, it is proposed that non-attached Members could no longer decide themselves who is to represent them, as is the case at present.
This is a unique occurrence in democratic politics that is unacceptable.
In any democratic parliament worthy of the name, a political group is allowed to decide its own representative on certain committees.
However, here it is proposed that the President - who is a member of one of the two large political parties - should decide which of the non-attached Members should represent them at the Conference of Presidents.
In other words, their political opponents will be able to choose a representative whose policy is nearest to their own.
This is scandalous.
In my opinion, the representative of the non-attached Members can only be chosen by a vote among the full assembly of non-attached Members.
I therefore voted against the proposed amendment.
