One and a half billion people are already online and use the Internet.
The Internet represents the onslaught of a new kind of networking technology that aims to bring about some sort of communication between people and objects, as well as between objects and objects.
Information on products is to be stored, received and sent.
It is to be feared, however, that all the advantages of the new technology will be outweighed by the disadvantages.
It must be ensured that the private sphere remains protected and that personal data cannot be misused.
However, it appears that future network users will be even more vulnerable than they already are.
I voted in favour of the report because the measures proposed by the author on the protection of the private sphere and of personal data are clearly needed.
