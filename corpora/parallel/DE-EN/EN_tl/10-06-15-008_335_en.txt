Where the Internet is concerned, we must, on the one hand, uphold the principle of freedom of expression, while fighting cybercrime and its abuses, on the other.
However, we must not end up storing data in the name of fighting crime and terrorism where there is no basis for suspicion.
The Internet has specifically given rise to new problems, such as that of data protection on social networking sites or in connection with projects such as Google Street View.
The problems of the latest developments on the Internet were scarcely considered, which is why I abstained from voting.
