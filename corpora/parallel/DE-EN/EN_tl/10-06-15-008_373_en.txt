Reducing poverty has been one of the main aims of development policy since time immemorial.
Little has been achieved in recent decades, however; rather, development policy initiatives have often moved in the opposite direction.
It is particularly concerning that in many states, funds from industrial nations have been used to keep dictators or ruling classes in power and to suppress the poor masses.
Even programmes to combat famine have apparently merely allowed explosive growth in population numbers.
In any event, if we are to combat poverty, it is necessary to prevent food speculation and to revise development policy.
Micro-loans are clearly a good approach for providing self-help.
We should also be able to expect, however, that states which receive development aid take back migrants who have entered our countries illegally.
We are unlikely to achieve the aims set until development aid is comprehensively revised.
I therefore rejected the report.
