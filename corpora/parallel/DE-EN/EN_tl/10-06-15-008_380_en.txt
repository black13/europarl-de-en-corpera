CARIFORUM-EU, which represents a partnership between the countries of Europe and certain Caribbean states, is obviously something that we should support.
Development, combating poverty, democracy, human rights, stopping the global threats to peace, security and stability are basic pillars upon which to bring about a strengthening of the Caribbean region.
However, I do not consider it helpful to have a Delegation to the Parliamentary Committee established specifically for this purpose, especially if it is to include no non-attached Members.
I therefore voted against this proposal.
