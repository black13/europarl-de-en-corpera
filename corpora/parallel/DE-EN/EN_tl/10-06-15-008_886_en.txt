This report does not take into account the fact that the EU can only provide aid to others if it has reasonably solid economic foundations itself.
The sooner the EU overcomes the consequences of the crisis, the quicker it will be able to put in place long-term and sustainable development aid.
The report on the Millennium Development Goals fails to give this sufficient consideration, which is why I have voted against it.
