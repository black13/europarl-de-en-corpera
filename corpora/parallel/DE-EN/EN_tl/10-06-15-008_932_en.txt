Ladies and gentlemen, the mandate for the trialogue is of great importance for the European Parliament, because it defines Parliament's negotiating position.
The budget for 2011 is heavily influenced by the crisis and the recession and this is clear, among other things, from the very tight margins.
However, there are also positive signs.
One of these is the priority given to youth programmes.
If the European Union wants to find a sustainable route out of the crisis, it is essential for it to invest in young people, because they represent our future.
In addition, given the economic situation in Europe, we must support a mandate for a socially balanced EU budget which also takes competitiveness into account.
Thank you.
