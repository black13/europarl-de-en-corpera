The 2011 budget contains numerous points which are open to serious criticism.
For example, the budget for the European Refugee Fund which, among other things, is promoting the resettlement of asylum seekers in the EU, is being increased, while the funding for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) is being cut.
Financial aid for Palestine is also being reduced, but the budget for the EU accession candidates, including Turkey, for example, is being increased significantly.
Therefore, I have voted against the report on the 2011 budget.
