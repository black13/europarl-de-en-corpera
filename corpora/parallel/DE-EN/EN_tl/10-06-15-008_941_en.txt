Natural disasters which result in people losing their livelihoods and all their possessions are becoming increasingly common.
People whose houses are flooded are particularly hard hit because the entire contents of the house are often damaged or destroyed.
In addition, serious damage is caused to agricultural land, which costs huge amounts of money to put right.
The people affected often have difficulty affording this or simply cannot pay for it at all.
I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important to provide help for people who have been hit by disaster.
