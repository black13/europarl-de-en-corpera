I have just voted against the amendment in the Marinescu report which aims to establish a central coordination body that will act as a one-stop shop for managing freight traffic.
Another 162 of my fellow Members have voted in the same way, following a petition which I helped to launch.
We are in favour of quality and competitiveness in the field of rail freight.
We want to see flexible and efficient solutions and we also believe in promoting rail transport for environmental reasons.
However, local and long-distance passenger transport must not be affected in any way.
The highly complex text of the report does not include a clear statement of this kind.
Unfortunately, the European Parliament voted in favour of the recommendation by the Commission and the majority of the Council to have the allocation of train paths managed by an additional central coordinating body in future.
This will result in a fragmentation of authority, which will have a serious impact on timetabling.
In Germany, which is a traditional transit country, the rail network is already operating almost at full capacity.
All of the three planned corridors pass through important population centres.
In the Federal State of Hesse, these are the towns of Fulda and Frankfurt, which are on the path from Stockholm to Palermo.
The European Parliament's good reputation as the main body providing protection for consumers in Europe has been damaged today.
The Member States will lose the authority to make decisions about their own rail networks and all the citizens of Europe will be affected by the resulting train delays.
