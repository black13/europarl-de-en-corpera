Mr President, I just have a brief supplementary question.
It concerns the content of the agreement that you have presented.
I would like to repeat my previous question.
What are the implications of this agreement for transatlantic relations?
How important is it for the other topics that we need to discuss with the US?
If you could give us an idea of this, I would be very grateful.
