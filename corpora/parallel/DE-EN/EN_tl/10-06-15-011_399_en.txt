Mr President, Mr Barroso, to change the subject: the Gulf of Mexico.
Deepwater Horizon, I believe, is a name that is currently making people around the world confront the idea of the limits of growth, the limits of the wasteful use of oil and the limits of man and technology.
In this connection, I would like to know, Mr Barroso, how the Commission intends to ban - on a precautionary basis - the planned oil and gas production in the northern North Sea and the Arctic in the areas where the European Union has responsibility.
That is something that can still be decided.
Secondly, I would like to know whether you actually believe that the rules that we have in the European Union on oil and gas production will protect us from any repeat of such catastrophes in areas where we have responsibility.
