Mr President, I would like to ask you to say once again whether you believe that the directive on environmental liability for sub sea oil and gas production is sufficient.
I would like to know whether you believe that the non-uniform, relatively low upper limits on liability are really what we need in the light of the catastrophe in the Gulf.
I would also like to know whether you are debating urgent improvements to technical inspections on platforms.
Do you really believe that the environmental and climatic conditions in the Arctic are friendly enough to humans and technology for us to enter into the risks of sub sea oil production there too?
It may not be quite as deep as in the Gulf of Mexico, but the conditions are tough.
