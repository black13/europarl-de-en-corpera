Mr President, today, the European Parliament adopted Mr Cashman's report on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.
One of our main messages to the Commission, to you, is that naturally we want to do everything we can to combine all the EU's resources in order to implement the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.
So far, however, the EU and its Member States have not met their obligations.
There is currently a deficit of EUR 20 billion in the commitments made for achieving the Millennium Development Goals alone.
I would therefore like to know what you are going to do - and specifically as regards the forthcoming Council meeting - to remind the Member States in particular of their commitments and to exert pressure on the EU to provide a clear, final picture at the UN conference in September and not to allow the individual Member States to repeatedly shirk their responsibilities in view of the growing crisis, when 1 billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger.
