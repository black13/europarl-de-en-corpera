Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr van Rompuy - the President of the Council - wants to use the task force to rapidly create new rules on the euro in order to manoeuvre the EU out of the current euro crisis.
Commission President, you have already cited Article 121 several times.
You speak quite rightly of mutual dependence and of the fact that economic policy naturally does not only concern the individual Member State.
My specific question to you, Mr Barroso, is as follows: to what extent is the task force preparing possible sanctions against states that repeatedly infringe budgetary rules?
Can the Commission imagine withdrawing EU subsidies or withdrawing structural funds?
What does the Commission think of the idea of the temporary withdrawal of voting rights as a possible sanction?
Finally, what is the Commission's position on demands for a uniform insolvency rule for insolvent Member States?
