Madam President, clear regulation of the liability issue is obviously part and parcel of a transparent securities market.
In this respect, we must first and foremost pay attention to protecting the small investor.
When it comes to the resale of securities, the investor needs to know who to hold accountable for the accuracy and currency of information.
If we regard the investor as a consumer who is worth protecting, then it is vital that he or she is given access to the essential information needed in order to price the product, in this case, securities.
Only then will he or she be able to make informed decisions.
Equally, in the EU's common capital market, it is important that we draw up a comparative list of differences between liability regulations of national civil law.
In these times of crisis and uncertainty in particular, what this means is re-establishing for the investor a real sense of confidence through corresponding transparency in the securities market.
