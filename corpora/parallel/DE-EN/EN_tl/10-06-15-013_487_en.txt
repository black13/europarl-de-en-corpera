Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prospectus regulates the public offering of securities and their emission into a regulated market in the Community.
It is a sort of passport which allows access to all EU markets.
In the interests of scrutiny and transparency, I welcome the protection afforded to the small investor and, in particular, the notification requirement.
I see improvement of access to securities for small and medium-sized enterprises through the elimination of administrative hurdles as an investment in the future.
