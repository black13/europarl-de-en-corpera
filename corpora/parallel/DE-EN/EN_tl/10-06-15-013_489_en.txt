Madam President, I will make just a few brief comments.
First of all, I wish to thank the Commissioner and all the Members for their friendly comments.
I am pleased that you share my views.
Our cooperation has actually enabled us to balance out various objectives, namely easier access to capital for SMEs and the removal of administrative hurdles, on the one hand, and improvement and securing of investor protection and making progress in terms of creating a genuine European internal market, on the other.
I hope that, when this new version of the Prospectus Directive comes up for review in a few years' time, we will be able to establish a link between the Prospectus Directive and the Market Abuse and Transparency Directives, and that we might perhaps go so far as to choose, in terms of non-equity securities, not the home market, but another Member State of the European Union as a starting point for emission.
