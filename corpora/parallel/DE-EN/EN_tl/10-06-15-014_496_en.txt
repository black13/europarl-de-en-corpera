Madam President, I realise this might be inappropriate of me, but I am afraid I have to raise a point of order.
For me, photography is basically a nice leisure pursuit.
However, I do wonder whether this new practice in the House of Members taking photographs of others, especially secretly and from behind, is appropriate.
I know that, for the Hans-Peter Martin List, the use of hidden cameras has been common practice.
Madam President, can you please explain this situation?
Anyone who would like to have a photo of me is welcome to have it.
I will be happy to send them a photo by PDF or e-mail.
However, when I am sitting here alongside a member of the Martin List, I do find it immature when photos are secretly being taken from behind to document that fact.
Madam President, I ask that you rectify this in future as it is unbecoming for this House and I ask that you pass on this concern of mine.
