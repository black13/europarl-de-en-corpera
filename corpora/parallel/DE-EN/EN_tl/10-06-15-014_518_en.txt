Madam President, I do apologise, but since we have a couple of minutes before the next item, I would just like to make two concluding comments.
I understand the difficult plight of the Member States from some of the arguments put forward by the Presidency-in-Office.
However, the Council's replies still do not fully reflect the necessities and budgetary challenges facing the European Union as a whole, nor its future direction.
That is why we have to work together.
From the Commissioner's replies, I take it that he has opened the door an inch for further talks and we will now be trying to get a foot in that door.
The Committee on Budgets will, therefore, present an interim report on the procedure for approval of the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework on the basis of Article 81 of the Rules of Procedure, so that plenary is given the negotiating mandate for further talks in September.
The debate is closed (Rule 149).
