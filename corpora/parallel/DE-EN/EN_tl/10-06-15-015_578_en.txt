Mr President, I have participated in every question time since 1994, but I have never seen a scandal of this magnitude.
The proper procedure is that, if you reduce speaking time, you do so for each Commissioner.
I put the first question to Commissioner Dalli, so I was sure that I would get my turn.
As we speak, President Jos√© Barroso is speaking to my group and, since leaving that discussion three quarters of an hour ago, I have been sitting here for 45 minutes waiting for my turn.
Might I point out that you should have informed me that that would be the case.
I really have to say that I disagree with this procedure and demand that you do not reduce question time even more.
It is the most important thing in a parliament.
We are not a voting machine for the establishment!
Each individual Member of Parliament is entitled to participate in question time, it is a fundamental right that we have borrowed from the British parliamentary system, in particular.
