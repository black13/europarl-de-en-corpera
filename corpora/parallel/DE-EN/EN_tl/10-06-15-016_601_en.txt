Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will focus on two issues that are of great interest to me: the economic and financial crisis and the ensuing recession.
They should not, under any circumstances, be used as arguments for dismantling the progress we have achieved so far with regard to gender equality.
In the medium term, this might further harm economic growth.
The pay gap between men and women remains and, I am afraid, this is still the case throughout the whole of Europe.
Taking the European average, the income gap sets men and women 17.8% apart.
In this regard however, there are, unfortunately, also some negative anomalies, like Austria, my home country.
The current Report on Women by the Austrian Federal Government shows that women earn a mere 58.4% of the gross wage of men.
Only in two countries is this income gap even wider.
It has to be our general aim to break this glass ceiling and it should finally become a thing of the past.
