Mr President, in recent years and decades, the European Union has been at the vanguard of equal treatment of women and men.
We need to expand Europe's vanguard role.
In the Women's Charter presented by the Commission, I see an indispensable contribution towards equality between women and men in the European Union.
However, the efforts made towards strengthening a woman's role in the economy, equal pay and increasing the appointment of women to decision-making posts must not just remain empty words.
We must back them up with action.
Above all, we need to make greater efforts to convince male decision makers of our concerns.
Women's issues are society's issues and concern everyone.
However, we must put a stop to the discrimination of women, both within and outside our society, and we must take decisive action on this front.
