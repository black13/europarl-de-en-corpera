Mr President, we all see eye to eye on this issue and I believe that that is beyond doubt in every respect.
However, I would like to make a proposal as to how we might perhaps speed things up a little and make progress.
We should make sure that we always include and take into account the equality issue in all reports that we discuss here in Parliament.
I am sure there are many dossiers, perhaps not all but certainly quite a few, with the scope to include equality concerns.
This may enable us to achieve more rapid progress from the inside.
This would also be model behaviour emanating from the European Parliament.
