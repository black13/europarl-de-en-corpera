Mr President, I do not know how we can fit this in at this point, but right now there are terrible floods in France.
We should at least add a sentence to the effect that we deeply regret these floods and the victims that these floods have created.
It would be terrible if we adopted a resolution today without any reference to the floods in France.
(Applause)
