Mr President, perhaps you would allow me to ask Mr Callanan a question.
Mr Callanan, please could you tell us why it is easier for Members if we discuss Zimbabwe first and which Members would find it easier.
This is an important decision-making criterion for us.
I will repeat my question.
What is the specific reason for bringing the debate on Zimbabwe forward which would make it easier for you to discuss the subject?
