Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, this report represents a logical conclusion.
Now that Parliament has worked with the Council and the Commission to improve the rights of passengers travelling by air and rail, we should ensure that passengers travelling by sea and on inland waterways also have better rights.
However, it is, of course, important that we do not compare cruise liners with traditional fishing trawlers.
Therefore, Mrs Ayala Sender and Mr Cancian, I am very pleased that we have been able to come to a compromise, so that derogations can be granted which enable claims for compensation to be made in the case of passenger ships carrying 12 people or more, but not when the crew consists of fewer than three people.
Tourism is a major economic sector and we must always ensure that its interests are taken into consideration.
Both ferries that cover a distance of more than 500 metres - the provisions will no longer apply to ferries covering shorter distances - and sight-seeing tours and excursions play an important role in the tourist industry, together, especially, with historic vessels.
Additional investment should not be needed in these types of boats.
Instead, the crew must be able to provide assistance to disabled people.
I would like to thank everyone involved for enabling us to come to a good compromise.
