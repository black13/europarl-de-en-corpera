Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is this all about?
Among other things, it is about establishing rights for people with restricted mobility who wish to travel by boat or by bus and about using this initiative to improve their travel opportunities at last.
We have an obligation to do this.
We have made a great fanfare about finally strengthening the Convention on the Rights of Disabled People within Europe and we should now be under an obligation to implement it.
On the subject of the two dossiers, I would like to say with regard to the dossier on bus and coach passengers that I am really sad and very disappointed by the Council's attitude.
It is important to make one thing clear.
The fact that what has been proposed here will protect the interests of small and medium-sized companies is just one small aspect of the whole thing.
What concerns me is the unwillingness to tackle difficult issues.
Therefore, in my opinion, what we urgently need is not transition periods of 15 to 20 years but a clear signal to people that they have the right to use the transport system.
The second dossier, which will be adopted with a large majority, concerns the rights of passengers on ships and boats.
This contains a large loophole, which I would like to highlight once again.
The regulation covers ships, but not ports.
This means that a person in a wheelchair will have, as it were, to beam himself on board ship from his car or from the car belonging to the people who have brought him to the port.
Once he is on the ship, he will have rights again, but the port itself is not governed by the regulation.
I think that this is a problem that we should not be prepared to tolerate.
Let us make sure that we do the job properly for people with restricted mobility.
