Mr President, if you would allow me to, I would like to overrun a little, because two of my colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have not taken the floor.
However, this depends on you.
Moving on to the subject itself, the discussions between Parliament and the Council on passengers' rights have never been easy.
This case has once again demonstrated that we can make progress in one area, but in another area, relating to buses and coaches, the situation is relatively difficult.
We understand that this subject has also possibly become more complicated because the concept of regional transport is interpreted differently in different countries, for example.
I live in a border area where four countries meet and these ideas actually differ so much from one country to another that it is not always easy to implement passenger rights on the same basis.
However, everyone should have the same objective, which is for passengers in all areas of transport who buy a ticket and want to travel to be able to rely on protection of their rights wherever they plan a journey.
In Parliament, we have always focused in detail on the needs of people with disabilities as regards other sectors and we have recently acquired experience in this area to which the Council, too, should pay closer attention.
This is not just about restricted mobility, but also about other forms of disability, which we should have taken into consideration in the past and must do so now.
There are really no additional costs involved.
Some problems can be solved simply by providing information in different forms and taking other similar measures.
