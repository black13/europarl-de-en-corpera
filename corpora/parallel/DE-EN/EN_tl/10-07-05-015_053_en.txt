Mr President, I would like to point out once again that everyone is in favour of giving passengers with restricted mobility their rights as well.
However, when it is a question of who receives preferential treatment and of a possible reduction in operators' profits, then the answer is a definite no.
In this case, it is made quite clear that the focus is not on disabled people.
This situation must change.
Mrs Wortmann-Kool says that the problem lies with the small operators, but this is not true.
The large companies have lobbied on this issue and were opposed to the solution.
They are using the small operators as a pretext to protect their interests.
We could come to a compromise for the small operators, but from an overall perspective, we must tackle the large organisations.
They are not prepared to show any consideration for passengers with restricted mobility.
This is unacceptable.
These passengers must have the same rights as everyone else.
We should be grateful that we do not have restricted mobility ourselves and, therefore, we should show our solidarity with those people who do.
