Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, the directive for the deployment of intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport, which we will finally be voting on tomorrow, is of huge importance for other modes of transport because of its impact on the interfaces with them that I regard it as the emergence of a new era of transport.
The directive is responsible for the coordinated, concentrated and targeted implementation of the comprehensive action plan and will guarantee that intelligent transport systems become an integral component of new types of vehicles and infrastructures.
The decisive issue for consumers is firstly that intelligent transport systems will have to be introduced, but no one can definitely say when.
Personally, I should very much have preferred a detailed timetable.
Secondly, they will play a major role in making transport cleaner, safer and more efficient and they will offer completely new opportunities for comodality, in other words, for integrating different modes of transport.
Thirdly, they will guarantee a high level of data protection and, fourthly, they can be used to optimise infrastructure capacity.
My fifth point is that they will offer a wide range of additional services for private individuals and business people.
Intelligent transport systems blend harmoniously into the next report on the future of transport and also into the Europe 2020 strategy, because they will give rise to extensive research and development projects.
The call for compatibility between new systems and with existing systems is in line with Parliament's demands.
On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I urge the Commission to put in place the standards and specifications for the eCall emergency system and for all the travel, transport information and reservation systems as quickly as possible, so that the process of introducing these systems throughout Europe can begin very soon.
