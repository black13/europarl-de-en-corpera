Mr President, I believe that Mr Koch is right when he says that intelligent transport systems will take us into a new era.
In the last year, I have come across lorries that can talk to one another.
It sounds crazy, but this really is the intelligent transport management system of the future.
Special devices enable lorries to identify for safety reasons whether there is an obstacle or a pedestrian crossing the road in front of them.
They can then pass the information to the lorry travelling behind, so that it can brake in good time and prevent an accident from occurring.
Of course, this is not yet on the agenda.
In this case, the major benefit of Mrs Jensen's report is that it gives us an overview of the current situation and an insight into what we will need in future in order to improve safety, prevent congestion, reduce accidents and take more effective action on the environment.
My final point concerns something which I have experienced myself near Hanover in Germany.
On the motorway, there is an intelligent transport system consisting of variable speed limits.
These tell drivers what speed they should travel at in order to prevent traffic jams.
This is good for drivers and for the environment and also reduces the number of accidents.
We need systems of this kind and much more.
