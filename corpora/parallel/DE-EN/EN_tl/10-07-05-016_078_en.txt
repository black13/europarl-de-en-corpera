Mr President, road safety and security applications represent a major component of the four important areas and I would like to comment on them briefly here.
Firstly, the Commission proposals to allow the introduction of huge lorries, referred to as gigaliners, should be rejected.
Gigaliners would increase the risks on the EU's roads.
The European road network is not designed for vehicles of this size.
They would reduce visibility for car drivers and result in longer overtaking distances and disastrous accidents.
My second point is that the often catastrophic results of tunnel fires indicate that vehicle fire prevention systems need to be improved.
I am calling for all cars in Europe to be fitted with a mandatory fire extinguishing system in the engine compartment.
These systems are already used in motor racing and the mass-produced versions cost between EUR 50 and EUR 100.
They are relatively cost-effective and would result in a significant increase in safety.
