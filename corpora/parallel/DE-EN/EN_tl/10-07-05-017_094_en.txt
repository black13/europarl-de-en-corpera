Mr President, Mr Kallas referred to a European maritime transport space without barriers.
I believe that this is something that we all want.
We also need it urgently and this report is another step in the right direction.
It is a fact that 95% of our exports and 40% of intra-European goods are transported by sea and therefore pass through ports.
For this reason, it is clearly absolutely essential for administrative procedures to be simplified and harmonised within this growth area.
This report will meet both these objectives, which is why it cannot be praised highly enough.
I regret the fact that Mr Sterckx was not able to achieve everything.
Two points which were very close to his heart and which many other Members supported, as we have heard, are the simplification of the pilot licensing system, because this would be a really sensible, practical solution, and the lack of a common language.
I believe that English really is the right language.
It is unacceptable for accidents to happen in which people can even lose their lives simply because many seafarers speak different languages.
It would be much better to introduce a common language in this very environmentally friendly area of transport, in just the same way as in the air transport industry.
