Mr President, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and also to all of the shadow rapporteurs.
I believe that we have succeeded in resolving what seemed almost to be a contradiction, because we are all calling for the development of our transport systems, but also for a sustainable future.
This report establishes the requirements for a genuinely sustainable future.
I only hope that we can work together to implement these requirements in such a way that they can be experienced on the ground.
I should like to give just one example of what we are currently attempting to achieve in Austria.
We have recently established the Nieder√∂sterreich mobil platform in Lower Austria.
This aims to bring together all the interest groups and all the bodies that are affected to develop sustainable local mobility systems for the future.
I believe that we need examples like this on a small scale, but we also need large models on a European level.
We must extend our transport networks, in particular, the rail and water networks.
I would like to emphasise with regard to the Danube strategy that, while we need to develop the Danube, we must also and most importantly take into consideration the fact that it is a particularly sensitive ecosystem.
