Mr President, this has really been an afternoon devoted to transport and this is the report which basically summarises everything.
Many people say that the greatest achievement made on behalf of the citizens of Europe is the internal market.
As Mr Kallas has said, the transport routes are the arteries of the internal market.
Therefore, it is, of course, important to ensure that these transport routes are safe, that they are developed in an environmentally friendly way, and that we take a general look at what can be improved in future using intelligent transport systems, for example.
We must think about how we can structure the more environmentally friendly areas, such as rail and sea transport, in a more effective way, how we can move more transport away from the roads and into these areas, and how we can reduce the environmental impact of the emissions from sea transport.
At the same time, we must also consider how to meet the specific needs of urban transport, which are very different from those of international transport.
The future of urban transport may lie with managers who travel on e-bikes that also provide them with exercise.
Of course, we need quite different options over longer distances, which would also fulfil a cross-border function.
This is a good and very forward-looking report.
