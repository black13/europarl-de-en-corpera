Mr President, against the background of this comprehensive discussion, I should like to make a suggestion in advance which would reduce some of our transport problems.
Millions of EU citizens are currently making their way to holiday destinations on the roads of Europe.
With the aim of making transport more sustainable, would it not be sensible to stagger the holiday periods of Member States at a European level and coordinate them with one another?
National holidays often have a serious impact on holiday travel within Europe.
The European transport network comes under extreme pressure, people sit for hours in traffic jams on their way to their holiday destinations and the negative consequences of these seasonal peaks for the environment and for citizens and consumers are obvious.
Staggered holiday periods, which would, of course, have to take into account the educational requirements of the individual states, could help to resolve some of these problems.
This would also bring economic benefits, as extending the holiday season would result in cheaper prices and the creation of more jobs.
I hope that the Commission will take up this suggestion.
