Mr President, this own-initiative report allows the European Parliament to set clear goals for the development of the transport sector.
This is important because transport will enable us to achieve and maintain a well functioning economy and a competitive Europe.
All of us, including Mr Kallas, know that the important feature of such ambitious and capital intensive plans is, naturally, the funding and we are looking forward to seeing new funding models, which will certainly be needed.
A transport fund will and could play a particularly important role in this respect, not by taking money away from other areas, but by coordinating the huge flows of finance more effectively.
