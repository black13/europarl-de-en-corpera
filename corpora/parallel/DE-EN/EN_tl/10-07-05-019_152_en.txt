Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the right of petition is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon as an important component of citizenship of the union.
German and Spanish citizens submit by far the largest number of petitions.
My home country, Austria, is well behind the leaders.
I am certain that broad public awareness can have a positive impact on the increasing integration of the European Union.
The decisions made by the European Union have a direct influence on the daily lives of citizens.
Petitions allow citizens to have direct contact with European institutions and these institutions are often seen as being very abstract and bureaucratic.
However, the institutions also benefit from these petitions, because petitions often highlight the way in which European Union law is implemented.
One example of this is the mutual recognition of educational and professional qualifications and of professional experience.
The EU supports a range of different mobility programmes.
Mutual recognition is important in order to ensure that these programmes function successfully.
The citizens of the European Union are represented in the European Parliament.
For this reason alone, it is important for them to be able to approach us directly by means of petitions.
As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I am also working actively towards achieving greater public awareness of the committee and improving its efficiency.
If the citizens of Europe knew more about the powers of the EU, it would be possible to resolve the problem of the large number of invalid petitions.
Last but not least, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for the report.
