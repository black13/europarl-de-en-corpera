Mr President, the right of petition is one of the most important rights of citizens of the European Union.
It allows them to highlight possible violations of their rights or abuses within the European Union.
Therefore, the petitions that are submitted are a good indicator of the way in which the European legal system is working.
For this reason, I am pleased that a total of 1 900 petitions were submitted, which represents an increase over 2008.
However, the citizens of Europe also have the right to receive appropriate, adequate and rapid responses.
This means that we must together improve the way in which we work and our internal procedures.
First of all, the so-called non-petitions must be filtered out more quickly.
They should not form part of the comprehensive official business process.
Secondly, we must reject or pass on more rapidly the petitions that we are not responsible for.
Thirdly, the members of the Committee on Petitions should establish a dialogue with the petitioners more quickly.
There is a significant opportunity for the Committee on Petitions to bring the European Union to life for its citizens.
I think that we, and by 'we' I mean the Committee on Petitions, the Commission and the relevant administrative body, should make extensive and appropriate use of this opportunity in the near future.
Many thanks once again to the rapporteur for his excellent report.
