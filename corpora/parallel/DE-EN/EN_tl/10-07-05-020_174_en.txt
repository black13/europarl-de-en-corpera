Mr President, the discovery of immunisation is one of the greatest advances made in the field of medicine.
The vaccination programmes for children are a European success story.
Diseases which, during the last century, damaged the health of thousands of children and sometimes even cost them their lives, have been almost eradicated.
Today, we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the eradication of smallpox.
Public awareness of diseases that can be prevented by vaccination is decreasing, together with people's motivation to have themselves or their children vaccinated.
This reduction in the motivation for taking part in vaccination programmes is leading to falling immunisation rates.
As a result, diseases such as measles and German measles, which were close to eradication, are beginning to become more widespread.
Vaccinating a child against an infectious disease brings a personal benefit for that child in the form of its own personal health.
However, there is also a personal benefit for everyone else.
Vaccinations not only protect individuals but also society as a whole.
One of the main tasks of European health policy should be to convey the importance of vaccination programmes for children and the importance of immunisation in general and to increase the rate of participation in vaccination programmes, particularly in the context of the growing demands being placed on our health budget.
