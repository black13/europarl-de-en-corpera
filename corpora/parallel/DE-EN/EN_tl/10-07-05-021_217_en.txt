Mr President, it has become clear who has been really hard hit by the ongoing economic situation in the EU: young people under the age of 25, who have an unemployment rate of 21.4%.
This is twice as high as the overall unemployment rate in the EU.
Young unemployed people will also suffer the consequences of their unemployment later in life.
In addition, youth unemployment has significant, negative social and economic effects on our society, in particular, on economic growth.
Young people represent our future.
We must give them a fair chance, for example, by investing in better education and training in order to provide them with a solid foundation for their future lives.
