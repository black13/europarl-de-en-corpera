Mr President, the young people of Europe need clear prospects.
This report is the first step in the right direction.
They need the prospect of a secure future that will end their financial dependency on other people and allow them to be self-sufficient.
The entry into the world of work plays an important role in this respect and internships can often make this step easier.
However, internships are all too frequently abused.
Therefore, we need a legal framework that protects committed young men and women and also ensures that the internships they complete are of good quality.
An internship must be seen as part of a young person's training process and not as an opportunity for employers to find cheap labour.
Motivated and committed young men and women must not be exploited and discriminated against in this way or in other ways.
We must take decisive measures to counteract age discrimination, because the young people of Europe represent our future.
We must protect and support them.
