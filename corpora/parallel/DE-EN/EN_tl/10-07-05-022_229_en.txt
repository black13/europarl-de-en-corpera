Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report, which clearly addresses a current problem on the European labour market: flexicurity.
Statistics show that in recent years, there has been a definite move from full-time to part-time employment.
This is not the only change that has taken place; atypical forms of employment have also increased.
We must discuss and evaluate these changes, in particular, in the context of protecting employees' rights, given the fact that many jobs are currently at risk.
In addition, these atypical employment relationships are often abused.
This report gives us the clear direction that we need in order to be able to react appropriately to these changes.
It covers important issues, including creating sustainable jobs, promoting education and training and supporting equal opportunities for men and women.
We must highlight the benefits of flexicurity and continue to bring about change in this area.
