Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to take the floor so late in the evening.
I believe that cohesion policy has seldom been as important as it is now, in the midst of this crisis.
One clear sign of a crisis is the fact that jobs and investment become concentrated in the population centres of the individual Member States.
Now, in particular, we need cohesion policy to play an active role and to invest in the regions.
We need a driving force or an impetus of this kind in the regions.
We need every euro that we can lay our hands on.
With regard to Lower Austria, which is also an Objective 2 region, I can only say that we have managed in the past to generate three euros in our region for every one euro from the EU.
We must have clear guidelines in this respect.
In other words, we need greater reliability and we need to be able to plan ahead.
However, particularly in situations like the one in which we currently find ourselves, there must also be the option of taking a flexible approach.
This is why I believe that this report is so important, because it calls for flexibility of this kind and because opportunities are needed in the regions.
