Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today sees an important debate on George Lyon's report and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Lyon sincerely for the willingness to compromise that he showed in this document.
We have managed to reach a good compromise that can be supported by many groups and I am hopeful that this compromise will be supported by a broad majority in the vote to take place at noon today.
The common agricultural policy in Europe was and is one of the most important pillars of the European unification process.
In this report we describe the effects of the common agricultural policy post 2013.
The European agricultural sector produces high-quality food, protects vital rural areas and many jobs, maintains and promotes our cultural landscape and biodiversity and can make a contribution to conserving fossil fuels through the production of renewable raw materials and energy.
To ensure that European agriculture can continue to perform these functions into the future, we must find a concept for the period post 2013 that will enable it to fulfil these many tasks.
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Cioloş has clearly indicated that he wishes to see a continuation of a two-pillar system.
My group will support this.
The first pillar acts as a balance to the constraints under which European agriculture operates in relation to other agricultural regions in the world, while the second pillar involves the creation of a catalogue of measures to enable the 27 Member States to ensure that agriculture receives additional aid to enable it to fulfil its functions.
The vast majority of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will vote in favour.
