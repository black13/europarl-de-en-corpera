Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteur for his constructive cooperation and for the important aspects highlighted by his report on the future of the CAP after 2013.
This report calls for further development of the existing common agricultural policy rather than the development of a new policy.
This is a good thing.
The primary function of agriculture is and remains the production of food for our citizens.
The ever-increasing need for public goods, the growth in population numbers and the simultaneous shortage of natural resources make this more difficult to achieve.
Farmers are required to produce more and more with less and less.
This is impossible without increasing efficiency.
The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are responsible for securing the necessary framework conditions for this.
If we in Europe want to maintain a healthy and diverse agricultural sector in the future, we will also need to take account of the needs of farmers, namely by imposing as little bureaucracy as necessary and by allowing as much entrepreneurial freedom as possible to enable them to earn a reasonable income for themselves.
