Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, agricultural policy needs a coherent framework.
This must strengthen the EU as a whole, while also taking regional differences into account.
The second factor is particularly important for my home country, Austria, when one considers specific environmental and investment programmes.
There are some enormous challenges facing agricultural policy.
Estimates indicate that the world's population will grow to 9 billion people, while at the same time we find ourselves confronted with the effects of climate change, such as water shortages and drought.
In order to resolve these problems, it is essential not only that the EU should cooperate more effectively internally, but also that it should operate in a coherent manner worldwide.
