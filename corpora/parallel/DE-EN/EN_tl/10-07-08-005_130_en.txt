Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, European fisheries policy is facing enormous challenges.
Our fishermen have to cope with diminishing stocks and at the same time have to deal with competition on the global market that is not always fair.
We urgently need to introduce radical reforms in order to put an end to overfishing in European waters and to ensure the survival of European fisheries.
I agree with Commissioner Damanaki that we should not ask too much of our fishermen by on the one hand demanding that they make radical reforms while on the other liberalising trade.
Doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen.
The best way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stocks to recover.
Another way to enable European fisheries to survive would be through better marketing.
Under certain circumstances, European consumers are prepared to pay more for European fish if they are better informed about its origin.
