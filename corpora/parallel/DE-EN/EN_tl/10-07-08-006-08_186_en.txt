Mr President, I have not asked for the floor to raise a point of order, but I would like to ask you, Mr President, and my fellow Members to be aware of the following: there is a problem with the translation here.
I have tabled an amendment to the Lyon report, recital Ae: 'whereas the CAP must be geared to the maintenance and development of multifunctional, sustainable agriculture throughout Europe.'
Unfortunately, the word 'extensive' has been used in the translations.
However, the word 'flächendeckend' in the German translation has a completely different meaning.
It means 'in all of the regions of Europe'.
There should be agriculture ('flächendeckend' agriculture) even throughout mountainous regions.
'Extensive' means something entirely different.
