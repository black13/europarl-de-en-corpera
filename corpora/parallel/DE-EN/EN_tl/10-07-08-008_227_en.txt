Mr President, as rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) I would like to thank Mrs Lunacek for her excellent cooperation.
The text that we have adopted today is much better than the one that came from the committee, because we have made it clear in the text that the division of Kosovo is not an option.
That is a crucial point.
We have demanded - as was already the case in the draft produced by the committee - that the remaining five Member States recognise Kosovo.
That is the logical thing to do, because as long ago as 2005 and 2007, the European Parliament called for Kosovo to be recognised with a three-quarters majority.
Most Member States have now done this.
We therefore need to bring clarity to the situation, because we need to make it clear that there will be no new negotiations on the status of Kosovo.
Mr Panzeri, for whom I have high regard, was quoted in the media today as saying that he is in favour of renewed status negotiations.
That would be highly dangerous, and it is therefore essential that clarity is established here and that this report reinforces the indivisibility and recognition of Kosovo as well as the involvement of Kosovo in the screening process, in other words in the pre-accession strategy.
