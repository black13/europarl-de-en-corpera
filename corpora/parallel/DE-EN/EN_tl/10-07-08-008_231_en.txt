Mr President, the ex-Communist Socialists in Albania are trying to destabilise the successful government there.
This is something we reject, but, unfortunately, exactly the same thing is being attempted right now in Macedonia.
Two days ago, the Socialist opposition leader of the country, Mr Crvenkovski, was here in this House.
He held confidential talks with Commissioner Füle, and afterwards - which is against all of the EU rules - a press release was issued from these internal talks, claiming that the Commissioner had agreed that he was right to pursue his internal political polemics.
This was not the case, and I also said this to Mr Füle yesterday.
An EU Commissioner must not be abused for the purpose of socialist propaganda and for internal political ends.
The Macedonian Government has democratic legitimacy.
It does first-class work and it is putting the country on the path towards European Union membership.
The opposition has the right to oppose, but it does not have the right to abuse the European Union for that purpose.
