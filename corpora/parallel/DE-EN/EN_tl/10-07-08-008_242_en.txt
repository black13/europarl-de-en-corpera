Mr President, with the Lyon report on the future of the European agricultural policy we have enabled a clear opinion to be formed and given the Commission clear and implementable standards.
I voted in favour of the report and I am pleased that it has broad support here in this House.
With growing demands for a healthy environment, healthy food and foresight and sustainability in agricultural production, the European Union must also be prepared to subsidise and support these essential areas.
Europe has a duty to guarantee food security for its citizens.
As an area with a naturally favourable climate, Europe also has a responsibility to ensure that people world-wide are supplied with food.
However, in so doing the European Union needs to work better and in a more coherent way with the rest of the world.
Europe must guarantee a suitable livelihood for rural communities.
There is one thing we need to bear in mind: if necessary, we could also import food, but not in a way that meets our conditions.
We must produce and maintain a healthy environment here.
Our farmers need a fair wage.
