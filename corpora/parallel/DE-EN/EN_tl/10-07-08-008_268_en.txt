in writing. - The fight against terrorism requires international cooperation governed by agreements.
However, these must not erode the fundamental rights of citizens laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In modern times in particular, these rights also include the protection of data, which is not adequately guaranteed by the SWIFT agreement negotiated with the United States.
Combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate data protection.
Other serious shortcomings in this agreement include, for example, the inspection of bank data without judicial approval, the long retention period for data, something that is impermissible under German constitutional law, as well as an inadequate opportunity for people to defend themselves in court against the unfair use of data.
These are serious infringements of fundamental rights.
However, the European Union is not permitted to unduly curtail existing fundamental rights.
I therefore still reject this SWIFT agreement.
