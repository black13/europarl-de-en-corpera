in writing. - The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness.
In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly.
After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department - including the facility to stop the extraction of data.
For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data.
SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all.
The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this.
In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for.
Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU.
Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny.
