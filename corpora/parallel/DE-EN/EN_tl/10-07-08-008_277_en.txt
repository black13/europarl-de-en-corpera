in writing. - Under the guise of combating terrorism, the account data of honest European citizens are being transferred in bulk to the United States.
The re-hashed SWIFT agreement does very little to change this situation.
We cannot promise our citizens adequate data protection, because: - Sensitive data is stored wholesale, instead of only in individual cases where there are grounds for suspicion. - The data will be arbitrarily stored for a whole five years. - Compliance with data protection is intended to be guaranteed by Europol, even though this agency has an interest in the data itself.
The executive is therefore monitoring itself - is this seriously supposed to be an independent control body? - EU citizens whose rights have been violated have de facto no chance of taking successful legal action.
Citizens would first have to cope with the cost of instituting legal proceedings in the United States!
What was first celebrated as a success for the European Parliament in February has now become a washout.
Even the rapporteur admits that he is not totally satisfied.
It does not provide any real, effective data protection and should therefore be rejected.
