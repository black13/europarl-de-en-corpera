in writing. - I do not want my vote against the new agreement to be seen in any way as a 'No' to the fight against terrorism.
Terrorist acts must be prevented and every terrorist act must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.
On the other hand, there is the protection of citizens' rights.
Citizens' rights are not a foregone conclusion - we have fought for them.
I am convinced that if there had been a longer discussion phase for this agreement it would have resulted in both sides - the US and Europe - being able to achieve a fully satisfactory outcome.
