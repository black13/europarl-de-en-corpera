in writing. - As the Committee on Legal Affairs' rapporteur for the European External Action Service, I would like to point out that, including as a result of its amendments to Article 6 of the High Representative's proposal, the report that has been agreed on today has absolutely no binding effect for me as rapporteur or for the European Parliament as a whole in the discussions on the adaptation of the Staff Regulations.
This includes, in particular, the footnotes that were adopted in the text today.
A report on a legislative proposal on which the European Parliament was only consulted cannot have any binding effect for the areas in which the European Parliament, by virtue of a different legal basis, has the power of codecision.
