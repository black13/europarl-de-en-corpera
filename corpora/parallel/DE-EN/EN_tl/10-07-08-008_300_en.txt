in writing. - As always, it is difficult to accommodate and balance the various different interests and positions.
However, in the current tug-of-war, we should not and must not lose sight of the overarching goal of achieving an efficient and coherent EU external policy.
The following factors have yet to be clarified: • Staff - who and how many? • Equality - the staff should be selected on the basis of gender equality principles. • What powers will the EEAS have? • Budgetary supervision should lie with the European Parliament. • Something that is very important for taxpayers: how high are the costs?
In any case, these costs should be within sensible and comprehensible limits.
In this regard, we must utilise synergies in order to achieve maximum quality and cost savings.
