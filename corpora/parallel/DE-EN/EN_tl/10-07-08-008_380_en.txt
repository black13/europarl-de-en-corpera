in writing. - The sustainable development of European aquaculture, fish farming and natural fish ponds, as well as the establishment of better basic conditions are essential for the competitiveness of the European fisheries industry.
The quality of imported fishery products is extremely important in this context.
In view of the continual increase in imports from third countries, we must ensure that these imports also meet European standards.
The European fisheries industry has high quality standards and a great deal of specialist knowledge, and these are hallmarks that we must continue to protect.
In this context, I welcome the IUU Directive for combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing that entered into force in January.
It is an important step towards preventing global distortions of competition and supporting honest, law-abiding fishermen.
I support Mr Cadec's report, which highlights a far-reaching and important aspect of the European fisheries industry.
