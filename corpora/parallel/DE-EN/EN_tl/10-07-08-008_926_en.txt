in writing. - For its survival, every state needs to maintain food self-sufficiency.
Fishing is important for food, and also ensures a variety of jobs.
As in agriculture, we are prescribing high environmental, animal protection and quality standards for our domestic fishermen, which are naturally reflected in the price.
With imports, however, adherence to our own rules can hardly be monitored.
Therefore it is all the more important that there are clear rules here for importing, but also for food labelling and quality, and that we do not encourage competition with the domestic economy.
We also need to be concerned that we do not score an own goal with aquaculture by adding extra burdens to the ecosystems or making domestic fishermen unemployed instead of providing more environmental protection.
The measures proposed are a step in the right direction, and I have voted for the report.
