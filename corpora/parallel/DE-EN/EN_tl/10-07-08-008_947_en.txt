in writing. - Cluster munitions are one of the most insidious weapons, since they mainly kill innocent people when they are used.
Above all, children are in danger of setting off unexploded devices by accident, and they can receive serious injuries from doing so.
The CCM (Convention on Cluster Munitions), which has been signed by 20 Member States, prohibits the use of these weapons and requires countries which have them in their arsenal to destroy them.
I agreed with the resolution, because the CCM is the first step in the right direction of prohibiting these deadly weapons for good.
I voted against the resolution because I do not believe that the agreement can force countries to prohibit cluster munitions.
