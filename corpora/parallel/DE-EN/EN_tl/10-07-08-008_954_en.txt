in writing. - Up to the present day, HIV/AIDS continues to be a worldwide plague which it has barely been possible to deal with.
Developing countries in particular continue to have a high rate of new infections, and, as a result, a high death rate.
However, within the European Union too, more and more newly-infected people are being registered, and the number of unreported cases might be much higher.
The fear of knowing one has the disease and of having to live with a stigma is still very prevalent.
In order to stop the disease, much research is being carried out, also within the EU.
Since research in the area of HIV/Aids is essential, I voted for the resolution.
