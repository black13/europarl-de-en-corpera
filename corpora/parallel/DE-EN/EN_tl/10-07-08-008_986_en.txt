in writing. - Data protection with the SWIFT agreement is simply a sham.
Storing up limitless data packets over so long a period of time in the absence of any judicial intervention runs counter to our understanding of a modern state founded on the rule of law.
That it should be the European police authority Europol - which has its own interest in data for combating terror - that will monitor compliance with data protection rules and the actual existence of suspicion of terror, is putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.
Furthermore, the idea that the Data Protection Commissioners, which have often shown themselves to be toothless, can obtain a block or a deletion in the USA is downright laughable.
An increase in data protection is thus nowhere near being in prospect, and as a result the SWIFT agreement received a clear 'No' from me.
