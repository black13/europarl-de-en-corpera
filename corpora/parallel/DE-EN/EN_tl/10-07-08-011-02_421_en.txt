('Blue card' question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure put to Mr Romeva i Rueda) Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Romeva whether he knows that the Rules of Procedure not only mention human rights, but that democracy and the rule of law are also the subject of this debate.
Moreover, does he know that Mr Ch√°vez poses a danger to democracy and the rule of law?
