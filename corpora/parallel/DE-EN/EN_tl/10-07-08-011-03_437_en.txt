author. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good that we have taken the opportunity today to discuss the situation in North Korea, a country that has shut itself off so comprehensively from the scrutiny of the rest of the world that only a few people know what is happening there and the people in this country essentially do not know what is happening in the rest of the world.
I would like to focus on two things.
The first is the human rights situation in North Korea, where people disappear off the streets and spend the rest of their lives in camps; where sometimes even a second generation of people spend their whole lives imprisoned in camps because their parents had allegedly committed crimes; where people are publicly executed and other people are obliged to watch these executions, and much more besides.
We believe it is high time that the human rights situation in North Korea was investigated by an independent commission, as we have proposed in this joint report.
There is a second point I would like to mention.
It is ridiculously difficult to get out of this country, to escape.
It ought to be one of the most fundamental human rights that should go without saying for people to be able to choose where to live and to move around freely.
However, we currently have a situation where those who manage to leave North Korea are often not admitted into another country and many are sent back.
Therefore, I would, in particular, like to urgently call on the EU embassies to take in people who manage to flee to these embassies and help them to get to safer countries and to find sufficient support there to start a new life.
That is important when we consider the situation that these people are in.
What is currently happening here is appalling.
