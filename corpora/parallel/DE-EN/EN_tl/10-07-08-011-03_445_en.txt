Madam President, we football fans are currently experiencing what is good about sport: team spirit, the joy of winning and, as yesterday evening, respect for the opposing team.
However, there has also been the experience of footballers being made personally responsible for defeats.
There is a persistent rumour that, following their early exit from the World Cup, the North Korean national players had to do forced labour - this is hopefully incorrect information.
I call on the North Korean Government to explain the whereabouts of the footballers.
The fact that we are concerned about them is hardly surprising given that this is a country where the state leadership punishes criticism, where ten thousand people are tortured and ill-treated and where innumerable people are malnourished.
The EU must continue unabated the serious dialogue with the so-called Dear Leader of the People's Republic of Korea.
It is time to put an end to forced labour and torture and abolish the death sentence and public executions.
Even potential victories in football cannot mask the reality of the situation.
North Korea is still lacking in all areas: human rights, chances of survival and respect for the individual.
