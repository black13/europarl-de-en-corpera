Madam President, if we have learned one thing from the oil crisis, it is that in times of high oil prices, it becomes profitable to develop poorly accessible oilfields and to extract under the most adverse conditions, such as from deeper and deeper depths.
Assuming that the experts are correct in forecasting huge increases in the price of oil, we must assume that even more risky exploration for oil will take place in the foreseeable future.
Although, under international agreements, it would have been appropriate to heighten the security precautions for the extraction of oil from depths greater than 200 metres following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, as we know, the countries neighbouring the north-east Atlantic were unable to reach agreement.
The depths being worked in the area concerned and the risks are entirely comparable with those in the Gulf of Mexico.
Improving security standards and securing financial liability are matters which must be tackled - all the more so since the Commission is evidently planning a CO2 pipeline network and wants to sell emissions from Europe's power stations to the oil industry in the North Sea.
We have not yet got to grips with how to dispose of nuclear waste - even though this technology has been in use for decades - and now, all of a sudden, hazardous greenhouse gas is to be disposed of in the North Sea.
In my opinion, it is therefore high time that we thought about security provisions.
