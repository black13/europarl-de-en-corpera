Madam President, unfortunately, none of us can undo the Deepwater Horizon accident.
We must therefore take every necessary step to ensure that such an environmental disaster never occurs in EU waters.
I feel that to do this, three things are absolutely essential.
Firstly, we must make as much provision as possible; in other words, we must cost in all the risks of offshore extraction.
Secondly, we must ensure the highest level of security and create binding EU minimum security provisions.
Thirdly, we must guarantee the highest standards of environmental protection.
I believe it to be of the utmost importance that we investigate our capacity to react to accidents and that we create a common European and, I hope, worldwide system to avoid such environmental disasters.
