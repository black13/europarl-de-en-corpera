Madam President, 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity.
At European level, we already have excellent instruments for protecting biological diversity; I am thinking here of the Natura 2000 networking programme or the Habitats Directive.
However, any idea is only as good as its execution, and I regret to say that in many Member States, this leaves much to be desired.
As members of the Committee on Petitions, our attention is constantly being drawn to serious problems in designated Natura 2000 sites.
The Member States and the Commission must together take a leading role at the forthcoming conference in Japan.
However, somewhere along the line, people will stop buying into this unless our words are followed up by visible action.
