Biodiversity is, and will remain, an important issue for the European Union, because biodiversity goes hand in hand with securing the food supply in Europe and therefore represents the prospects for a positive future for the next generations.
European agriculture is aware of its important role as promoter and preserver of biodiversity.
Through CO2 storage in soils or near-natural land management, our European farmers are actively contributing to the preservation of biodiversity.
However, all of this effort will be of no benefit if there is little or no public awareness.
We need to make European citizens aware of the fundamental importance of biodiversity for our countryside, our economy, our lives and our children's future, and to spur them into action.
The European Union will not be spared from the extinction of a diverse range of species.
Already today, numerous ways of life are under serious threat.
Let us take action now and set the course for a species-rich future.
