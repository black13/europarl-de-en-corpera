Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon did not give the European Union any fundamentally new powers in the area of social policy.
Article 9 - the representative of the Council has already referred to this - expands the existing powers within the context of the basic principle of the social market economy, which is very important to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and which we introduced into the European Convention, which essentially prepared the way for the Treaty of Lisbon.
Our second point is that with the report by former commissioner, Mario Monti, entitled 'Putting citizens at the heart of the Union', the European Commission made an interesting and valuable contribution to how we can succeed in combining the great positive impulses of the internal market with social elements of the common consumer market.
For this reason, Commissioner Andor, we are expectantly looking forward to the so-called Single Market Act that Commissioner Barnier is currently working on.
We believe that this can really get to grips with the Monti-Kroes package in a constructive way.
However, we are sceptical as to whether the opening up of the public procurement directives and the creation of a concession directive will, in the end, really result in us putting the internal European market on the right track, since obviously, we are clearly against any inflation of the public sector.
The representative of the Council has already made reference to this, but it is all the more important, as great and significant as social consolidation may be - and I say that as a member of the younger generation in this Parliament - that we include all the shadow budgets - the Freiburg-based professor Bernd Raffelh√ºschen has spoken of the fact that we have a series of hidden budgets as regards pension debts - when we consider social consolidation, and that we make a policy that also gives the younger generation a fair chance in the coming decade.
I therefore believe that together - and the representative of the Council has already made reference to this - we face great challenges; that the European Parliament and the EPP Group have a shared view of this challenge and that we should all do everything we can to support the efforts by the European Commission in respect of both this package of measures for the internal market and, on the other hand, the social measures that must supplement this internal market, against the background of the social market economy.
I am therefore looking forward to further debate and am grateful for your attention.
