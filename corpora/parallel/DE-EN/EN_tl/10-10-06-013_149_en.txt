Mr President, we are witnessing within the European Union what I believe to be a worrying development whereby more and more people are being pushed into temporary agency work, false self-employment and McJobs, and whereby the social rights of employees seem to be being pushed into the background.
Not only does the European Court of Human Rights seem to be paring back worker protection standards in its jurisprudence, but it also rules out giving preferential treatment to socially engaged entrepreneurs when awarding public contracts.
The Treaty of Lisbon was going to make everything better, we were told, but, personally, I have not seen much of any social turnaround.
Attempts are being made, for instance, to reduce economic and social differences between the Member States using the European Social Fund.
Yet, if the bringing to account and execution of projects leads to problems in many regions, the fund is failing in its mission.
The freedoms of the internal market, I might point out in passing, all too often only involve the freedoms of the multinational conglomerates, which are squeezing out the local employers, which is to say the small and medium-sized enterprises.
I believe that this needs to change as soon as possible.
