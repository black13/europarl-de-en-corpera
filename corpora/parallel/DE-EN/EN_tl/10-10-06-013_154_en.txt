Mr President, the political goals are clear.
We want a Europe with a sustainable social market economy, fundamental rights, no discrimination, full employment, an integrated social clause, social cohesion and services of general interest, which are to be defined through subsidiarity.
That is our goal.
However, we have too few instruments at the European level to achieve this goal.
Most of the instruments are to be found at the Member State level.
We need a balance between the economic, the competition policy and the social instruments if we are to be able to realise these goals across Europe.
We should therefore broaden out monetary union into an economic and social union.
We also need to clearly come out and say that we need more acts of solidarity and that training, getting people qualified, growth and employment are not elements to be played off against the social side of Europe; they are, in fact, a prerequisite if we are to combat poverty and exclusion and end the plight of the working poor.
