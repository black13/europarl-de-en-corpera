Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my thanks to Mrs Fajon for her excellent report, which has really moved us forward on this issue.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is very clear in its support for visa liberalisation throughout the Western Balkans, and in this case we are, of course, also in favour of the removal of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, specifically so that the opening up of these countries actually gets under way and because it will provide better opportunities for their overall development.
We hope that such opportunities will really be exploited.
Personally, I would also like to see this kind of arrangement in place for Kosovo very soon - or at least for initial talks to take place.
There is an urgent need for this, as Kosovo is otherwise a small island in the Western Balkans that is actually cut off.
What worries me, however - and I want to make this point - is that we are compelling the introduction, at the same time, of biometric data.
I want to be very clear on this: the use of biometric data is as controversial as ever and, above all, the use of such data is not secure.
I say this on the back of news in Germany a few days ago that the PIN codes can be, and have been, cracked.
There needs to be an acknowledgement that this kind of thing can happen.
Let us do everything we can to ensure not only that these countries have their visa requirement lifted, but that social and economic development is set in train there.
There is an urgent need for this in both countries, and the people have earned it.
We in the EU should also work towards this goal.
