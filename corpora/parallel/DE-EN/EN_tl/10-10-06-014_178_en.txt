Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Fajon, on behalf of my group, for her excellent work, and also to offer thanks to Commissioner Malmström, as I believe that they both played valuable roles and have taken the right steps.
The vote in Parliament tomorrow will make the promise of a European future more tangible for the citizens of Albania and of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It will be possible to finally secure for them what the people of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia have had since last year.
This broad consensus in the European Parliament tomorrow will also set a clear challenge to the Council to make clear at its next meeting in November that it, too, will give the green light for this to go ahead, just as the Commission has already done and Parliament will be doing tomorrow.
As has already been said, we cannot allow a few Member States to now start wavering and advancing new arguments, such as the need for new security guarantees, when we know perfectly well that the only reason for this is their internal political debates - there is no basis in the reality of the criteria, which Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have already met.
In other words, tomorrow, we will be challenging the Council to give the green light, as the Commission and Parliament will already have done.
As the rapporteur for Kosovo, I also have to say, however - and this point is partly addressed to Mrs Flašíková Beňová, who, I think, is unfortunately no longer in the Chamber - that Kosovo is an independent State.
This is true despite the five EU Member States that have not yet recognised it, that do not want to see the reality.
It is a fact; it is the reality.
As rapporteur for Kosovo, I also call on the Commission to finally give the government in Kosovo a road map so that a start can be made on the work, and so that freedom from visas, freedom to travel, can finally be on the horizon for the citizens of Kosovo as well.
