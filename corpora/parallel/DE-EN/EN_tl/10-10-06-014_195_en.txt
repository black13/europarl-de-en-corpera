We have already seen from last year's visa liberalisation that many people equated visa-free travel with being given carte blanche.
Countless people have used the more liberal visa conditions to travel into the European Union.
How many of those people actually went back to their home countries once the period of time granted for their stay had expired, nobody knows.
For us, it is obvious that visa liberalisation has nothing to do with jobs and the right of abode, but this does not seem to be clear to the people in question.
Kosovo, in particular, represents a major problem for us in this regard.
The EU has never been able to decide what it thinks more important or what it thinks is correct and proper - territorial integrity or the right of self-determination for peoples - and because we have ignored the problem of multinational states for too long, what we have now is a divided Balkan state.
The maths of stemming illegal entry into the EU through a readmission agreement cannot stack up while visa liberalisation continues to be abused.
This idea needs to be put paid to.
The importance of visa rules is also shown by the fact that Ankara seems ready to finally sign the readmission agreement in return for visa liberalisation for Turkish businesspeople.
Such agreements are required for EU candidate countries.
Together with the unfulfilled customs union agreement, this shows just how unready for accession Turkey is and is another slap in the face of the European Union.
A stop must be put to the negotiations at long last.
The aim should instead be to establish a privileged partnership.
