Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if banks have to hold more capital for loans and financial instruments, that increases their ability to bear losses.
The most recent proposals from the Basel Committee take this stability-based approach as their basis.
Unfortunately, the Basel Committee has not, as yet, satisfactorily addressed the problem of system-relevant banks.
I therefore welcome Mr Karas's call for the requirements for the liquidity standards to be made independent of system-relevance.
In other words, appropriately tougher requirements need to apply to banks that, due to their size or interconnectedness with the global financial system, need to be bailed out using taxpayers' money in crisis situations.
We should take a more differentiated approach to the factor of debt leverage.
Only when it is empirically proven that this instrument does not lead to arbitrage and distortions of competition and actually counters the overheated granting of loans should we consider permanently incorporating it into the first pillar.
There is a need, in any case, for these proposals to be implemented at the global level.
We cannot allow the US authorities to have a decisive influence on the Basel proposals only to not then implement them.
The G20 summit in Seoul next month will show whether, and to what extent, we can achieve this objective.
