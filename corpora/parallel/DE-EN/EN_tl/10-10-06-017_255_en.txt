Madam President, I would like to draw attention to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF)'s action week, which will be manifesting itself in Istanbul this weekend.
The reason for the international day of solidarity is the aggressive behaviour of a global package delivery company against its own employees, who want to form a trade union.
Unfortunately, Turkish labour law is not yet up to European standards, and this fact is often exploited to the full by employers.
Under Turkey's Labour Act, a trade union can only be active in a company once it has achieved a rate of unionisation of over 50%.
Let me say that again: over 50%.
UPS, the US-based package delivery company, has acted in a crude manner to put a stop to the campaign to unionise.
The company fired 157 employees without notice after they had organised themselves into the competent transport workers' union TÃœMTIS and were working towards recognition as a union by UPS.
Thousands of UPS employees have now been battling since May to have their colleagues re-instated and for better working conditions.
This pro-company labour law and its brutal methods mean that Turkey is a trade union-free zone.
