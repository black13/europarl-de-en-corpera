Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a fundamental conflict which is already becoming apparent in relation to the European Social Fund (ESF).
The Treaty of Lisbon recommends that the ESF should focus primarily on active labour market policy.
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left believe that it is necessary for the ESF to be applied more broadly in future to general social policy and, most importantly, to be used much more effectively to combat poverty and social exclusion.
In future, the European Social Fund should also play an effective role throughout the entire European Union and should not concentrate solely on specific regions.
However, we think that there should be a greater focus on special problems in the regions, which could be accommodated more effectively via the cofinancing rates.
Financing for the European Social Fund should at least stay at its current level.
It should be a minimum of 1% of the gross budget of the European Union.
We believe that to be absolutely essential.
I would like to highlight one other problem.
The proposed increased focus on the results naturally gives rise to the question with regard to the ESF of which indicators and benchmarks will form the basis for evaluating the results and what that ultimately means in terms of preparation for the project promoters in each case.
These promoters do not have reserves which would allow them to make additional payments or repayments.
If the ESF is to remain in existence and play an effective role, we need to have a clear overview of this issue in advance.
