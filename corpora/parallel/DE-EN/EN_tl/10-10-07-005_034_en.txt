Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are financing instruments of EU regional policy which aim to bridge the development divide between the regions and promote regional cohesion.
The future challenges faced by our cohesion policy, such as globalisation, demographic change, climate change and energy supply, interact with one another in a very complex way.
On account of our limited resources, we should focus on our key priorities and make an increased effort to identify synergies between the different policies.
I support the call for a simple, fair and transparent transition system for cohesion policy after 2013.
The restructuring of the policy depends on whether all the parties involved - the regions, the Member States and the EU - are in a position to respond quickly to these new challenges.
