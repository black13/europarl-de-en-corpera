Mr President, we are not talking about peanuts here.
For the period from 2007 to 2013, EUR 75 billion is available for the European Social Fund (ESF) and this amounts to almost 8% of the EU budget.
As Brussels will only provide the money for the ESF when the Member States take responsibility for cofinancing, this means that there will be around EUR 150 billion on the table for creating more and better jobs.
Fortunately, ESF money is not used to fund unnecessary studies, but instead goes directly to the people who need it.
This is what makes it so valuable and what allows people to experience it at first hand, including the long-term unemployed, migrants, young people who have the opportunity to obtain the school leaving qualifications that they missed out on first time around, tens of thousands of trainees and retrainees, employees who want further training and budding entrepreneurs.
It has a wide range of target groups.
What will happen after 2013?
The Member States must make more effective use of the funding and we also need to take the special features of individual regions into account.
I would like to see a tailor-made, bottom-up approach and effective coordination with programmes such as Daphne and PROGRESS.
I am in favour of more flexibility, simpler controls and more transparent allocation of funding.
However, I am opposed to a separate legal framework for the ESF.
I believe it should remain within the Structural Fund regulation, which will ensure that the eligibility of expenditure is regulated at the level of the Member States.
This is why I have tabled Amendment 1, together with 45 of my fellow Members, and I would ask you to support it in the forthcoming vote.
