Mr President, as we know, 27 EU Member States with a large number of regions, cities and communities and a population of 500 million have, of course, a huge variety of different needs and problems.
In addition, every EU initiative on a Brussels level has regional and local effects.
Since the 1970s, structural aid has been available for disadvantaged regions in order to ensure that the growth of the economy and of prosperity is geographically balanced.
However, looking at the current situation, we seem not to have come any closer to achieving these goals.
For example, the billions paid in subsidies to the regions of Ireland and Greece have not protected them from feeling the full force of the financial and economic crisis.
Those regions which lost their status as Objective 1 zones during the enlargement in 2004 are not much better off.
Their situation has only improved in statistical terms, in other words, on paper, but it is a well-known fact that you cannot eat paper.
Large regions may be showing strong growth, but they can, at the same time, contain small regions which are fighting for survival.
Therefore, we need to make cohesion policy more efficient and the individual projects more sustainable.
