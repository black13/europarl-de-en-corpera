Mr President, this has been a very lively and committed debate.
I would like to thank everyone involved.
I would also like to remind everyone and to repeat and reinforce the fact that regional policy is an investment policy which covers all the regions.
It should be regarded as an integrated policy, which is why it definitely focuses on cities.
However, this is also because different policy areas are concentrated in the cities, including energy wastage, reducing energy consumption, energy use, transport and social problems.
These are all factors which we need to look at in an overall context.
We very much support the calls for a simplification of the rules.
However, I would like to ask for your understanding in this area, because we also have to take into consideration taxpayers' requirements.
Several speakers have referred today to the need to make the situation simpler, but we must do this by putting in place standardised rules for the different funds, as far as this is feasible and possible.
I would like to thank you for the discussion and for the backing of Parliament.
However, I would also like to call on you to make your voices heard at a national level, in order to enlist support for the causes you have spoken about today, so that regional policy remains at the heart of European policy in future.
