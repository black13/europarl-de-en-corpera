European regional policy after 2013 must cover all the regions, while being sufficiently flexible to take into account regional and territorial differences.
In order to exploit fully the potential for growth of the regions and to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion in the European Union, it is essential for us to focus on the goal of competitiveness, as well as on cohesion.
In particular, we must take into consideration small-scale problems in wealthy Member States.
We must also pay particular attention to the needs of mountain areas, as we plan and implement structural measures.
The specific geographic features of these areas give rise to particular problems which must be reflected in coordinated strategies and measures.
Alongside the urban dimension, the development of rural areas under the umbrella of regional policy is particularly important.
By coordinating sectoral and territorial measures, we can maximise synergies and avoid possible conflicts.
