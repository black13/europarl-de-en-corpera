I condemn the mass rapes and serious violations of human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the strongest possible terms.
I very much welcome the inclusion and adoption of this condemnation in the joint motion for a resolution.
I voted against the joint motion for a resolution, however, because, to a large extent, Congolese military and police units trained by the EU's EUPOL and EUSEC missions since 2005 were, and are, also involved in these crimes.
The joint motion for a resolution expressly supports and welcomes these training missions.
I am in favour of the immediate cessation of these missions, as they have contributed in a negative way to the escalation of violence and to the situation in the country by training security forces that have been repeatedly involved in the serious violations of the human rights of the Congolese people.
In addition, the army and police trained by the EU support the repressive apparatus of the corrupt Kabila regime.
