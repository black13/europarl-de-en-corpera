The cohesion policy system within the EU provides support to enable poorer regions to be brought to the same level as richer regions.
It is intended to be used to balance out the consequences of uneven economic development.
However, we must ensure that financial resources are allocated to the individual regions in a fair and transparent way.
The criteria used in connection with the paying out of subsidies should also be clearly defined.
We need to pay more attention to peripheral rural regions.
I am voting against the resolution because it does not make it sufficiently clear to what extent the subsidies will be monitored and what formula is to be used to determine how these are to be distributed.
