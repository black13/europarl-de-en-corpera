Madam President, the question that we must ask ourselves is what is this directive intended to achieve?
There is relatively substantial agreement that there should be health protection for mothers-to-be and new mothers.
The great debate concerns the areas in which the aspect of equality should also be included.
On the other hand, as the European Parliament, we also need to be aware that we are adopting a directive that will be in force not just for five years, but perhaps for the next 20 or 25 years.
However, I hope that by then, women's working conditions will be substantially better and companies will be keen to employ young mothers - not least because of a shortage of skilled labour - and, above all, will also build up the appropriate infrastructure for this.
We need to bear in mind this perspective too.
Notwithstanding this, I also realise that at present, we do not have a majority that is prepared to adopt this perspective.
In view of this, we will probably arrive at a point where we agree on a compromise such as eighteen weeks, a higher rate of statutory payments or the continued payment of 75% of salary, which will indeed bring about an improvement in some European countries in particular.
A much more important point, and one which goes beyond the aspect of maternity leave, is the framework conditions surrounding young families.
This means childcare facilities; in Germany, for example, there are still not enough of these.
That would be a real equality policy that gives women a chance to go back to work.
