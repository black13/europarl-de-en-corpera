Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about the working conditions of women, which we want to improve in Europe.
I will specifically address the Thomsen report, for which I was shadow rapporteur; in other words, the subject of 'precarious women workers'.
This year is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
It is an established fact that poverty disproportionately affects women.
Naturally, we cannot, on any account, allow this to remain the case.
Poverty among women may be the result of various things.
It may result from the fact that women are not paid as well as men.
Naturally, that is not the only cause.
Women also take more career breaks, for example, when they have children and take time off to bring them up.
Women also perform the lower skilled jobs.
Things are particularly serious in the case of women whose employment conditions are precarious, because in some cases, they may not even have an employment contract or may have irregular employment contracts; they may have no protection whatsoever and they may have little access to information.
The situation is particularly bad for women with a background of migration.
This can lead to the poverty continuing, so that they also end up poor in old age.
We need to break out of this spiral, which affects women more than men.
One of the ways this can be done is through education and training.
Every woman - every girl - needs to get a qualification, whatever their background, and they need access to a profession which will genuinely secure them a proper living.
Lifelong learning must generally be possible for women too.
We also need to ensure that we have more women and girls going into the better paid professions.
These are frequently the professions that are more heavily dominated by men.
In other words, access to education in any event, and access to social security systems - that way, we can achieve many improvements for women.
