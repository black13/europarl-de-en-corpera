Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we should ask ourselves what we are actually trying to achieve with this whole debate.
Are we trying to bring about a small improvement in equality and a little assistance for families as cheaply as possible?
Of course, making family life compatible with work costs money.
I would simply like to ask my fellow Members from Germany: what is expenditure of EUR 1 billion in Germany if, at the same time, we are handing out EUR 450 billion in bank guarantees?
What do we actually want in this area?
Full pay for parental leave is quite correct.
What else should it be?
It is not time off, it is not holiday; this is work that people are doing.
Of course we want the period extended to 20 weeks, because we believe that this is the only way this work can be accommodated.
Moreover, we do not merely want to bring about a bit more equality in working life.
We want complete equality, for women and men.
We need to take drastic steps if we are to achieve this, such as a statutory minimum wage in all Member States.
