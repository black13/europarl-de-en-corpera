Madam President, the matter of maternity protection should remain a matter for the Member States on account of the cultural differences in Europe.
Austria has 16 weeks of maternity provision.
Extending this would cost EUR 17.4 million per year for each further week.
Making 20 weeks' provision mandatory would cost Austria more than EUR 60 million.
The additional costs would be even higher if there were also two weeks' paid paternity leave for every father.
Let us be clear in our deliberations: firstly, this is a completely personal decision by the parents, and secondly, I see this as presenting a risk of further discrimination against women of childbearing age.
This could encourage an increase in precarious working conditions, to which 31.5% of women in gainful employment are already subject.
The question is: is that what we really want?
