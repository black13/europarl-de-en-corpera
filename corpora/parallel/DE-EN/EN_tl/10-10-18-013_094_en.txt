Many thanks for your request to speak.
As I mentioned, there were many more people requesting the floor than we were actually able to accommodate.
We had 19 people wanting to speak in a slot lasting just five minutes.
I have therefore tried to give those people on the lists that I have here a chance to speak.
Naturally, your comments will be minuted.
We will try very hard in the coming debates to make the whole thing as fair as possible.
