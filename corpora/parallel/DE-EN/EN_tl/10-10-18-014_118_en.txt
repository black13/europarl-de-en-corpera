Madam President, I would first like to thank Mr Rangel for his report and also, of course, Mr Šefčovič for the negotiations that we have had.
He was not an easy negotiating partner, but he was a fair one.
I believe we have achieved a good result.
The specific result naturally forms the basis of our cooperation, and while the interpretation given by Mr Rangel is perhaps somewhat extensive, it allows us to remain focused on our goals.
What remains now is not just the openness and transparency between our two bodies, but also the need to convince the Council - which is not present - that if we work well together, it does not necessarily have to be at the expense of the Council.
Unfortunately, the Council sometimes behaves like a child who has had a toy taken away and is now upset and affronted.
Instead of feeling affronted and threatening complaints, the Council should work with us to achieve what is best for the citizens of our continent.
If we want to appear strong to the outside world - and the common foreign policy, common trade agreements, etc. are an important aspect of all this - then it would be best for us to work together.
