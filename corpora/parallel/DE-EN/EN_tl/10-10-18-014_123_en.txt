Madam President, in the EU, Parliament and the Council act as legislators and have a democratic mandate, directly in the case of the European Parliament and at least indirectly in the case of the Council.
Yet the Commission, which has no democratic mandate whatsoever, remains the only body that is able to propose EU regulations - and that despite the Treaty of Lisbon.
I therefore feel that huge shortcomings still remain in this respect.
If the European Parliament is to be able to exercise its right of initiative efficiently, the obligation to provide information also needs to be expanded accordingly.
The new instrument of the citizens' initiative should involve Parliament, as the body representing the citizens, in the legislative process at the earliest possible juncture.
The flow of information between the Commission, on the one hand, and Parliament, on the other, also needs to be strengthened in the area of international relations.
The EU's foreign policy must not be allowed to be the sole responsibility of a bureaucratic European External Action Service that is relatively remote from citizens.
