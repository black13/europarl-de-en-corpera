Mr President, I would like to express my great thanks to the Commissioner, who is answering this question on behalf of her colleague, Mrs Malmström.
We very much appreciate your doing so.
To be honest, however, I think we are not working from the same facts.
The essence of this is not just about the use of DNA databases.
My fellow Members have avoided mentioning that explicitly: the requesting of DNA data, the requesting of fingerprints, the requesting of data on criminal convictions - and all via the system that we created with the Prüm Convention.
Where that is concerned, we are talking about an elementary part of European policy.
Quite honestly, that is not really what concerns me here.
That is something we can talk about, we can have an exchange on it, we can find and debate ways and means if we consider it right to do so.
What annoys me is that neither the Council nor the Commission has the backbone to tell the US that its behaviour is not acceptable.
You cannot use the Visa Waiver Programme to blackmail Member States - in this case Austria, hardly a new Member State - by saying: we will take away your visa waiver if you are not prepared to give us this data.
What is interesting to note is that a Member State of the European Union cannot unilaterally withdraw its visa waiver from the US - in response, so to speak - because our agreement states that it is the EU as a whole that grants the visa waiver.
What annoys me is the tone, and that nobody has the backbone to stand up and say that while we want to work with you and have a transatlantic partnership, in any good relationship - just as in any good marriage - good manners and respect are an important part of making it work.
That is precisely what we expect from our relationship with the people of the US and with US policy, and we would like the Commission and the Council to place greater emphasis on this.
