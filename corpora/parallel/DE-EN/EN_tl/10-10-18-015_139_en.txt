Mr President, as soon as the SWIFT agreement had been negotiated, it became clear that what had been sold to us as data protection was, in fact, an embarrassing case of Europeans having pulled the wool over their own eyes.
Now my opinion has become official: the EU's own monitoring system has not - as I suspected - turned out to be a placebo, a sedative for critics, within the space of a few years, but rather after just a few months.
It is clear that the US does not give a fig about agreements.
Once again, the US has shown that it is not interested in partners, but at best only in states that say yes and amen to every omnipotent act of the almighty US.
We have had to grit our teeth and acknowledge that for years, the US has been eagerly helping itself to European banking data, and that when we then insisted on European standards of data protection in an agreement and appointed an EU monitoring system, the US was happy to agree to this because it could still have untrammelled access to data via the bilateral back door.
In my opinion, we should not wait for the next transatlantic talks, but should bring this nightmare to an end right now.
