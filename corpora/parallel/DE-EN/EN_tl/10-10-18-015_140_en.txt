Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse what one of the previous speakers said.
We greatly appreciate your coming here personally and making a statement.
I realise that this is not your specialist area.
However, I feel bound to state that the Commission's statement is extremely unsatisfactory.
Something has happened here to which I really must draw your attention.
All the main groups in this House want to discuss the principle.
We are appalled, to put it mildly, that the Commission is not taking action.
It was the same with SWIFT.
At the last plenary session, we had to make the Commission aware of the USD 14 entry fee.
Today, a fellow Member has quite rightly asked: What is the Commission doing?
What are the Member States doing?
Now I hear that there are even discussions on giving Americans preferential treatment over Europeans!
We need to state quite clearly that we want to have a very serious discussion with the Commission on the fundamentals.
The fundamentals include reciprocity at least.
It means that rather than allowing access to European data, such data must be retrieved under a push procedure.
These are principles that are now even more warranted; likewise, citizens' rights - namely that the citizen has a right to know what data about him is being used where, and how it is being used, and naturally, this should be based on a European concept.
What we are hearing today is that the Commission is actually weakening our negotiating position with the US by not going to the Member States and coordinating this, and secondly, by not taking action itself.
When will the negotiations start?
When is action going to be taken?
In the case of SWIFT, pressure from Parliament resulted in this suddenly being done within a month.
We need to see the same kind of action in respect of PNR and data in general.
