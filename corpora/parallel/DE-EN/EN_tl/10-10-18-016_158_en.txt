Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries established a very important organisation: the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, or NAFO.
Its aim is the conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources in the Northwest Atlantic.
The convention has since been amended and brought more into line with other regional conventions.
Modern concepts such as stock management have been incorporated.
I feel it is important that the structure of the organisation is streamlined and that the obligations of the contracting parties are clearly defined.
It is also good that the possibility of resolving conflicts through a dispute settlement procedure is provided.
The fishing possibilities accruing to the European Union under the convention are of great interest to the EU.
Parliament should give its approval under the new powers granted to it by the Treaty of Lisbon.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I commend Mr Wa≈Çesa's report to the House.
