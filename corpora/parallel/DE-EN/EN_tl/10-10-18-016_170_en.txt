Mr President, the annual conference of NAFO made amendments to the Ottawa Convention of 1 January 1979.
It is important that we do not lose sight of the fundamental considerations here: the optimum utilisation and sensible management of fishery resources.
This needs to be based on a sustainable and ecological concept if we are to ensure that fishing continues to provide food for future generations.
The agreements are intended, in particular, to preserve the small local fishing enterprises with their family structures, and to protect them from competition that uses illegal methods, as well as from large-scale fleets which plunder the seas using large amounts of electronic equipment and deep fishing nets.
In short, we want a fisheries industry, but not in this form which jeopardises the small-scale structures, the local structures, with its negative actions.
We need to provide sustainability for future generations, and we must protect this and secure it by contractual means.
