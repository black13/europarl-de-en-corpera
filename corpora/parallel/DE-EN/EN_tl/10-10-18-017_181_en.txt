Mr President, on Friday, 15 October, the Rheinische Post ran a headline report concerning the Commissioner for Transport, Siim Kallas, who had apparently said that the high-speed rail link between Paris and Bratislava was an extremely important trans-European east-west axis and that the Commission considered it of the greatest importance that it be built.
He further stated that Stuttgart 21 was a key element of this main line.
Is this some kind of hoax?
The coordinator of the project, Péter Balázs, has repeatedly said that while the track forms part of the TEN projects, the stations are a national matter.
In view of the limited financing for the development of the trans-European transport network, the stations and all the associated infrastructure are to be financed by the municipal, regional and national authorities themselves.
I call on Commissioner Kallas to confirm the Commission's position hitherto in a statement to the press and to state loud and clear that the underground station in Stuttgart will not be cofinanced by the European Union.
