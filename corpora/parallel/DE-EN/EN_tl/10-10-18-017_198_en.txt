Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today - 67 years after the removal of the dictator Benito Mussolini - fascist monuments are still being preserved, maintained and extensively renovated in South Tyrol.
For the South Tyroleans, this is a daily reminder of an injustice suffered.
This is not worthy of a united Europe of the 21st century.
Years ago, the then European Commissioner, Franco Frattini, suggested a Europe-wide law banning all Nazi symbols.
The logical consequence of this would have been that, as part of the drive against Nazi symbols, fascist monuments in South Tyrol would also have been banned and would have had to be removed.
Mr Frattini's proposal came to nought; it is now time to venture a new attempt.
The Commission should make it unmistakably clear that infringing minority rights represents an infringement against the values of the EU.
Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon requires further clarification.
In addition, we need to examine how well minorities are protected and binding sanctions need to be officially laid down.
