Mr President, I would just like to interrupt the debate very briefly to inform you and my fellow Members that last night, three terrorists stormed the Chechen Parliament, killing several security officers and taking hostages.
The terrorists were also killed.
Parliament ought to express its condemnation of this act of terrorism in no uncertain terms, because terrorism can never be justified.
Our sympathy goes out to the families.
I wanted to mention this briefly, especially in view of the fact that we will be discussing the Northern Caucasus again this week.
I apologise for the interruption.
