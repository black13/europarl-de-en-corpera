Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to be able to represent the interests of the European States on the international stage in a more effective manner, foreign policy actions must be discussed in advance and then communicated to the outside world with one voice.
With the European External Action Service, we are now attempting to bring the foreign policy instruments of the Union within a coherent framework.
The resources that we already have are being bundled together and new ones are being added to complete the picture.
As stated in the report by our fellow Members, in view of the novel nature of this structure, ambitious provisions with regard to transparency and budgetary and financial accountability need to be applied.
We need a detailed overview of the tasks and of the staff employed in the EEAS.
In order for the budgetary sovereignty of the European Parliament to also extend to the EEAS, the service must be incorporated into the structure of the Commission, and the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority, must be provided with the all information to enable it to scrutinise the accounts efficiently.
The discharge of the Council remains on our agenda.
The EEAS can only bear its name if all of the Member States are fairly represented within it.
On the other hand, of course, the qualifications of the candidates must take priority.
This leads me to the proportion of women represented.
It is far too low for my liking and I call for qualified women to be found for these positions.
They do exist.
