Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Frank Sinatra was referred to as 'the Voice'.
However, what would he have been without a big band?
You, Baroness Ashton, are now the voice of Europe, and with the External Action Service, you are getting a splendid orchestra.
I hope that you will make use of this orchestra to bring Europe's voice to the fore and to protect our interests.
Since Europe's first priority is to safeguard peace in Europe, the next major task, in view of the international challenges - from energy security right up to combating terrorism, globalisation and much more - is to look after Europe's interests in the world.
You and this service will have a special role to play in this regard.
Therefore, the progress that we make in the interests of our citizens will depend very strongly on your work and that of your orchestra.
In this process, we have succeeded in enhancing Parliament's cooperation, control and right to information, including in the area of the budget.
We have succeeded in safeguarding the Community character of the policies that are Community policies and also in ensuring that more than 60% of the staff must be Community officials.
I am certain that, in contrast to the Council, we have managed to introduce better geographical balance and gender parity.
The governments did not do this; we did their job for them.
Moreover, if this is now legally binding and a review must also be carried out in 2013, then it is an excellent achievement by this House - a good compromise that we have reached between the institutions.
This instrument must also be observed by us.
We will do this with the necessary flexibility, but we will also exert pressure to ensure that you, Baroness Ashton, are able to succeed in your task.
You will have our support in this, but you can also be sure of our criticism if we do not agree, because I believe that we can only stand together on this matter if our citizens have a future.
