Mr President, the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is now only six weeks until Baroness Ashton will no longer primarily be the Minister responsible for establishing an EU foreign ministry; she will instead be the Foreign Minister for Europe, and that is a good thing.
This will commence on 1 December and we wish you every success in this regard.
We have had many debates and we have achieved a great deal.
It was a fruitful political battle.
The lack of democracy associated with the old common foreign and security policy has been eliminated, there is a greater degree of accountability and the quality of the public debate has improved.
There will be more stringent budgetary control, the prerequisites for a genuine team spirit have been created and national diplomats can, if they so wish, remain in the European External Action Service.
There will be no geographical quotas - you could sometimes get the impression that this is the most important issue here, but it most definitely is not.
Germany, in particular, would benefit greatly from a quota, but I am nevertheless against this.
A common form of training will be provided.
I believe that the prerequisites for a successful EEAS are in place.
In other words, the European Parliament is almost happy.
We would be really happy if you were now to take advantage of the opportunity and actually establish the appropriate structure for conflict prevention and crisis management that has been promised.
Then we would have European added value right from the start.
