Madam President, the European External Action Service will, in future, take on the primary role in the European Union's common foreign and security policy.
In order for it to do justice to this role, clear rules are needed to allow the EEAS to do its job smoothly and efficiently.
I would, in particular, like to highlight the monitoring guarantee for the financial transactions of the EEAS, which were clearly dealt with in the report by Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini.
The key elements are, above all, the annual statements of assurance and activity reports that are to be presented to Parliament, as well as the European Parliament's power of discharge.
I also welcome the approach of making the Member States liable for financial irregularities committed by the relevant staff from the individual Member States.
This report has my full support and it represents an important step in the right direction.
