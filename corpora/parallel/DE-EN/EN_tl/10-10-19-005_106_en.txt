Madam President, after my speech at the start of this debate, I actually only have two more comments to make.
The first, which I quite deliberately left to the end of the debate, is that I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs for their friendly and constructive cooperation.
It is quite simply easier to negotiate when you know that your colleagues support you.
For that reason, these were not the most difficult of negotiations.
My second comment, however, is one that I would like to reiterate with regard to what has repeatedly been at the centre of this debate, namely, the question of geographical balance.
Mrs Neynsky stole the show by saying that the compromise states nothing at all about this.
I would simply suggest that, once we have adopted this, she quietly and calmly reads the text.
Read the text!
Reading the text will enlighten the mind.
Then you will see that the compromise most definitely does contain statements - and indeed very strict, legally binding statements - on this matter.
Then all of your concerns should, in fact, be dispelled.
