The EU has hitherto always boasted that it has a lean administration - which, of course, is not true if we take into account the separate agencies.
Fifty directors-general with a princely EUR 17 000 per month for an initial 30 employees, 73 promotions to the position of director - we could easily get the impression that this is a self-service shop.

The world order no longer consists of these two powers alone; there are also emerging powers like China.
We must not overlook that fact.
