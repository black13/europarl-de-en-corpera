Madam President, in today's sitting on the subject of poverty, we are deliberately focusing on the connection between global poverty and poverty in the Member States of the European Union.
However, hundreds of thousands of people have already done that before us.
In recent weeks and months, they have increasingly taken to the streets in Europe to call for this and the global action day was deliberately held in the vicinity of the UN Millennium Development Goals summit.
In contrast to these people, however, as the European institutions, we remain vague and inconsistent in all of our strategies and we create framework conditions that, in turn, hamper the fight against poverty.
The Treaty of Lisbon and also the Europe 2020 strategy have de facto eliminated the poverty goals.
Numerous Member States of the European Union are using the call for the sustainability of public finances to justify the reduction in social services and reallocations by way of cuts in the health service and in the pension systems, reductions in labour market policy instruments and in services provided for the unemployed and for children and families.
We are doing this ourselves in our EU Member States, and in this assembly, we act as if we simply need to campaign for people in poverty to no longer be excluded.
We do this ourselves through our political methods.
I would like to point out that the Europe 2020 strategy and the sustainability strategy of the European Union contradict one another, thus making it impossible to combat global poverty.
