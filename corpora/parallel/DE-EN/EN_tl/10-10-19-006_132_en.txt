Madam President, it is disturbing that thousands of people in the EU are living on the poverty line despite having a permanent job.
In view of this, attempts to establish an appropriate minimum wage are very much to be welcomed.
However, a minimum wage only makes sense when combined with additional measures.
An isolated debate could lead to the decline of the business location and an increase in the number of people out of work.
Finally, small and medium-sized enterprises will not be able to afford to pay a statutory minimum wage if the tax burden remains as it is, and, of course, higher wages also carry the risk of an increase in the price of goods and services.
That would set the inflationary spiral in motion once again.
The focus must therefore be on relief in relation to work.
Work must become worthwhile again for EU citizens.
A minimum wage is certainly a good idea, but it should be provided within a meaningful overall package of tax relief for workers and also for Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises.
