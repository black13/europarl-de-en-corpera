Madam President, I would like to appeal once again to the Commission to ensure that, if it establishes a poverty platform, it does not allow this simply to remain empty words, but that it takes up Parliament's initiatives.
Firstly, there is an initiative that provides for an examination of whether there should be a framework directive for minimum income, so that everyone in this European Union can have a dignified life.
Secondly, there is an initiative that goes further than just using the GDP when preparing the structural funds, but also includes the Gini coefficient as a measure of income inequality in the assessment - where there is disadvantage.
These are things that you must now decide on if we are to have any chance of introducing them.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner to place these two points from plenary on the Commission's agenda and ensure that the Commission has an answer for the European Parliament in this regard.
