The most recent studies have indicated that 31% of employed women work part time, compared with only 8.3% of employed men.
Part-time workers have a lower income and, consequently, receive lower pensions than those in full-time work.
Within teams, they are at a disadvantage when it comes to team work, which also manifests itself when it comes to promotions to, or in the filling of, higher positions.
We find 36% of men of graduate level or above in management positions, compared with only 15% of women with the same level of education.
As regards lower income, it has to be mentioned that in Europe - not taking into account the number of hours worked or the different work contracts - the gap between men and women is, on average, 18%.
