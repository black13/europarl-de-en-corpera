in writing. - These forms of employment are a problem predominantly experienced by women, as the incompatibility of a career and a family forces many women into these precarious work situations and makes poverty inevitable later in life.
In this regard, we must not overlook the fact that men are also affected by these forms of work, and there can be a risk of poverty even with full-time work.
The local social systems and social measures are, however, designed to cushion the hardworking local population if the need arises.
The report focuses far too much on women migrants, who often seem to find themselves in part-time work, and indirectly stipulates that the residence itself be supported.
Women are certainly particularly affected by the false promises of traffickers, the problems of globalisation and - in the case of illegal entry - of new forms of slave labour in companies.
Continuing to support imported poverty is not the solution.
It only increases the social problems and may permanently jeopardise social peace.
To reinforce this development is the wrong way to go.
Ultimately, it is only locally, in other words, in the countries of origin themselves, that something can be changed.
This reinforcement by the back door should be rejected in the strongest possible terms.
