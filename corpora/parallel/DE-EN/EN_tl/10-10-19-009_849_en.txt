We were already considering optimum utilisation and rational management for the conservation of fishery resources a good 30 years ago.
Now, the regulations of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) are to be revised, not only to harmonise them better with other regional agreements and international instruments, but also to bring them into line with current knowledge, for example, the fisheries management concepts.
Fish quotas and stock management are essential in order to prevent the complete overfishing of inland waters and oceans.
However, in this regard, we must also ensure that organisations like the NAFO remain capable of action by virtue of a streamlined structure and good organisation.
It is also important to prevent the costs becoming excessive.
For all that, at least a partial renationalisation of fisheries policy makes sense, in order for it to be possible for regional problems to be dealt with comprehensively.
I voted with this in mind.
