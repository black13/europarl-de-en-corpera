in writing. - Rising incomes and improved infrastructure lead to a higher consumption of fish in developing countries, too.
The quantities of fish caught are already increasing yearly and will therefore continue to grow.
Studies have shown that increasing fish stocks in the oceans and inland waters are mainly a result of aquaculture.
Increasingly, larger fleets are being used to attempt to catch fish from increasingly smaller stocks.
In order to curb the merciless overfishing, it is important to introduce a control and enforcement scheme.
Reports from fishermen who are held captive on the high seas like servants and have to work their fingers to the bone for extremely low wages in conditions that are akin to slavery are also cause for concern.
If we want our descendants to know the taste of fish, controls are essential.
For all that, at least a partial renationalisation of fisheries policy makes sense, in order for it to be possible for regional problems to be dealt with comprehensively.
I voted with this in mind.
