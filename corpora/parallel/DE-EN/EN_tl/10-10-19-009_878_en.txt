I am very pleased that the European Parliament has today decided to support numerous people who have been adversely affected by globalisation.
However, the European funds must now be provided quickly and with no red tape, so that these people can find a new job as quickly as possible.
This is an important and highly visible contribution by the European Union, which will demonstrate clearly to these people that the EU wants, and is able, to also help individuals in emergency situations.
However, we must also make every effort to shape globalisation in a way that makes sense.
It is therefore important that the European Union supports fair conditions for competition in international economic relations.
This will enable the disadvantaging of particular sectors to be avoided at the outset.
