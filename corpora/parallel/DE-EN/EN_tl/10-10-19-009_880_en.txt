This mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will benefit 1 429 workers in the motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers manufacturing sector in the Spanish region of Catalonia.
The Commission proposed that, in this particular case, an amount of EUR 2 752 935 be mobilised from the fund in order to support the reintegration into the labour market of former employees of a total of 23 enterprises, since the application, which was supplemented by additional information in April, meets the conditions for a financial contribution from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
