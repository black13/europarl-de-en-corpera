Since 1 May 2009, the scope of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has been broadened.
It is also intended to provide support for workers made redundant as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis.
In the NUTS II regions of Gelderland and Eindhoven in the Netherlands, 512 workers have been made redundant at NXP Semiconductors Netherlands.
An amount of EUR 1 809 434 is being mobilised to support these workers.
