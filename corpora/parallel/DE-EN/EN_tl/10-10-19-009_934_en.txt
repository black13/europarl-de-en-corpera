I must congratulate Mrs Matera most sincerely on a total of four reports on the mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
The broadening of the scope of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to include workers was an important step to enable us to support European citizens directly.
The instrument of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund is intended to help those who have been caught unawares by the effects of globalisation.
In order for it also to be possible for the money made available to be used effectively, it must reach its destination quickly and in a targeted manner.
That is the only way to ensure that we help European citizens and increase confidence in the EU.
