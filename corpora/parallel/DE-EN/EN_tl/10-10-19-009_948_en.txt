In order to be able to react, statistics are important, because they provide facts on which decisions can be based.
However, in the case of the collection of statistical data, it is always important to maintain a balance between the necessary collection of facts and the administrative costs.
Up to now, the data on the carriage of goods and passengers have been collected by 18 Member States on a voluntary basis.
This makes sense if the relevant data really do not impose any additional burden, in other words, if the Member States are indeed in a position to collate these data using already existing data sources.
The collection of complete statistics for the carriage of goods and passengers for all goods and for all modes of transport for the purpose of comparison seems excessive to me in terms of the administrative costs involved.
I have therefore voted accordingly.
