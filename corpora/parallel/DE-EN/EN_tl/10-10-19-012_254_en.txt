Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety regarding the budget, I will not be telling anyone here present anything new.
Nevertheless, I would like to point out once again that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is responsible for less than 1% of the budget as a whole, less than 1% of all environmental protection actions, biodiversity actions and actions in the fight against climate change.
It is responsible for the whole area of public health, for food and feed safety, and for veterinary measures, as well as for the extremely important work of five European agencies.
1%!
Well, in that case, it is certainly not possible to talk of excessive quantities of money.
This small amount of money is therefore desperately needed for carrying out our work.
It will therefore be no surprise to anyone that we are unable to accept the Council's cuts.
We need the resources.
