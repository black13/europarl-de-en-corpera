Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I would like to endorse the words of the previous speaker.
As the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we are responsible for the narrow area of customs, internal market and consumer protection.
We have tried very hard to pay careful attention to the figures and to put in only what is really necessary.
However, in times of crisis, money is, of course, needed for consumer protection, customs, training customs officers, etc.
We are therefore of the opinion that the old figures must be reinstated.
We would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed so far and we hope that this will continue.
