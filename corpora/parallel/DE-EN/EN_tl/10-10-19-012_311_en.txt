Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU budget for 2011 represents a challenge for everyone: Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has had more responsibility and more legislative work.
First of all, I would point out that the EU budget currently amounts to a little over 1% of GNI.
I would like to comment on three points in particular.
Firstly, the EU 2011 budget has set priorities, which need to be strengthened in light of the economic problems throughout Europe following the structural crisis of recent years.
Above all, the reduction in the current level of unemployment in Europe must remain at the centre of our efforts, for example, through investment in the economy, industry, tourism and energy and climate policy, and by safeguarding existing jobs and creating new ones.
In this regard, I am thinking, in particular, of the priorities of youth, education and mobility.
We must give our attention to programmes like the lifelong learning programme or the Youth in Action programme.
They support the EU strategy for economic recovery and the EU 2020 strategy.
With better education - particularly education that provides them with qualifications - considerably better opportunities on the labour market will open up to young people.
Erasmus not only facilitates the acquisition of languages, but also mobility - which is essential in an age of globalisation.
However, with regard to mobility, young people are also required to take responsibility, and this programme ought to be utilised a lot more.
Secondly, the main goal of the common agricultural policy must continue to be to maintain market stability and food security.
Last but not least, my third point is that money is tight in these difficult economic times.
As I have said many times before, we need to streamline bureaucracy in every possible area, and we need to find synergies with the Member States and utilise them.
