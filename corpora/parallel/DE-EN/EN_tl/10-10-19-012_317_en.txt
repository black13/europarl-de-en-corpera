Madam President, I would like, in particular, to thank the two rapporteurs.
As many fellow Members have already said, it would seem that we are using the equation 'more money equals better policies'.
However, I believe that precisely the opposite is true, in other words, that better policies justify more money.
It needs to be the case that the money we make available is spent in an efficient way.
Regarding that as an essential criterion, together with the corresponding controls, will also lead to success.
There is no point in us financing sacred cows such as the agricultural budget and structural and cohesion policy if we do not, at the same time, reform and modernise them.
Many of my fellow Members have said - and I absolutely agree with them - that we need to focus on the areas of research and development, renewable energies, energy security and educational mobility.
With regard to the subject of discipline, allow me to return once again to the agreement reached in Deauville, because discipline is something that we must also expect from the Member States.
The news service AFP quoted a French representative: 'There are Ayatollahs in Germany who take a Prussian hard line on such questions', he said, referring to the unyielding position of the German Government.
Personally, I doubt that the French representative of Europe has such a savoir vivre belief that money that we do not have should be given out freely and future generations be made to pay for debts incurred today.
I cannot believe that that is what the Member States want to do, and it is also high time we demonstrated that in the relevant budget negotiations by showing the discipline that we called for and displayed in May.
