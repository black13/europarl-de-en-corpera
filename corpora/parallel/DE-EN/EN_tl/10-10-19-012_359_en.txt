Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, Mr Lewandowski, during this parliamentary term, I have been rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with regard to the budget and I can tell you that I cannot fully understand some of the speeches that I have just heard.
Of course, as Members of the European Parliament, we consider ourselves to be in a position of solidarity with the Member States, which are having to cope with and announce significant backward steps in their budgets.
We are, naturally, prepared also to go along this difficult route of announcing these decisions.
However, if you look at the budget for the new European agencies, for example, then you will discover that you cannot make savings because, on the contrary, we have additional expenditure to cope with.
With regard to the second point relating to European statistics, the Council has been trying for years to brush these aside to a certain extent and to avoid them.
Today, we can see that putting more money into European statistics would have been a sound investment.
I am not saying that to put the blame on you alone.
However, I do believe that in the next few weeks, we need a debate that goes through the individual subject-specific points and does not attach importance to the percentage points of savings in Europe, because ultimately, it needs to be our goal that the people of Europe benefit jointly from a common budgetary policy of the Member States and the European Union.
We await your proposals in this regard.
