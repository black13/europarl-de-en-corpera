The effectiveness of the European Union is completely dependent on its budget.
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because the important policy areas and the individual opinions have been taken into account.
It must be clear that the EU will not be able to fulfil its extensive tasks in future with fewer financial resources.
As a representative of farmers, I am absolutely opposed to money being taken away from agriculture.
Financial recoveries should be used to provide planning certainty for our farmers instead of reallocating them to other policy areas.
Currently, funds are to be taken from agriculture and used to finance the nuclear research project ITER.
This example shows that the financing of large-scale research projects is dependent on recoveries from other areas, the amount of which is difficult to determine in advance.
It should not be the case that no long-term and carefully considered plans are made for the financing of European research.
Agricultural policy also has long-term considerations and plans and this type of security is something we must pass on to agricultural undertakings.
As the weakest link in the food chain, farms need the security to be able to make plans in order to be able to exist.
Ring-fencing of the financial resources provided for this is necessary in order to strengthen the competitiveness of agriculture in the EU.
Investments in agricultural research and green technology are investments in the future and they will create new jobs.
