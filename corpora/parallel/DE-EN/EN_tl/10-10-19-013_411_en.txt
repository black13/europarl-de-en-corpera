Mr President, Commissioner, I will say right at the outset that I think it is a good document that we have before us here.
It is balanced, as Mr Lewandowski has always promised us - balanced with a large number of suggestions and ideas for how we can, and should, continue to work.
However, it is not what we as budget specialists in the Committee on Budgets expected.
To be honest, we thought there would be an analysis of the current financial framework, and the real optimists even believed that we might also get a small revision for the remaining period of the current financial perspective.
However, what we have before us now is purely a glance into the future.
Almost every other section mentions how we should do things better in future with regard to our budget, whether in relation to our priorities, how to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, better cooperation with our neighbours, better European infrastructure or our future agricultural policy and cohesion policy.
This paper even presents ideas with regard to the future structure of our budget and the length of the next financial period.
