Commissioner Barnier, I would be very interested to know what effect Basel II is having on the US market, where a lot - hundreds - of small banks have now gone bankrupt.
What impact has it had on the large banks?
What is the situation with Basel III in the US?
Will this be implemented here at the same time as it is in Europe or will the US implement it before us?
What is the timetable for implementation of Basel II and Basel III in respect of the US?
