Mr President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for that very comprehensive reply.
I now have another brief question regarding cross compliance and biodiversity, which you have also already mentioned today.
Sound agriculture can help to preserve biodiversity and halt the extinction of species.
However, it should not only be the job of the Commissioner for the Environment to create awareness of this.
Commissioner, my question to you, specifically, is what will you do to increase the awareness of the parties concerned - and by that I mean the political decision makers, consumers, but, above all, the farmers concerned - of the value of biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services?
