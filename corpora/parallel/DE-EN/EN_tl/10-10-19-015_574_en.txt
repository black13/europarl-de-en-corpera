Madam President, with the new regulation of late payment in commercial transactions, we can bring about a real improvement for all businesses in the European Union.
For small businesses in particular, it is unacceptable to have to wait several months for invoices to be paid.
I am therefore very pleased that today, we intend to lay down fixed payment deadlines and reminder charges for both private and public contracting authorities.
With this Europe-wide harmonisation, we will really help to improve commercial transactions throughout Europe, which will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
We must now tackle the black sheep of the industry.
The black sheep are those who, at the time they place the order, already know very well that they will never pay for it.
