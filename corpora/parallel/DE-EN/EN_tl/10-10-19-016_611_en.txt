Madam President, Commissioner, I think this disaster demonstrates quite clearly once again how important European legislation is, as well as the implementation and monitoring of this legislation.
Environmental disasters and their effects quite simply do not stop at the borders of a Member State or any country in the world, but extend beyond these borders via groundwater, contamination of rivers, fine particles or through the air, and then spread throughout other regions.
Commissioner, a few people have already mentioned to you that the European legislation that we have in place is, to a certain extent, inadequate, and that it is also inadequately transposed and not monitored sufficiently by the Commission.
One example of such legislation is that relating to liability.
There is a real gap here insofar as the party that causes such disasters must be called to account and made to pay.
What legislative amendments do you intend to introduce here to ensure that the polluter has to pay?
What do you intend to do with regard to Hungary to enable independent investigations to be carried out, and what is your opinion of the proposal - as Mrs Hassi has already mentioned - to set up our own EU task force?
I have one final point, which is that we have heard about journalists being obstructed in their investigation of this accident.
Do you intend to use your influence on the Hungarian Government to ensure that an independent report can be provided?
