on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, if you look at your list of speakers, you will see that the next speaker is my colleague, Mr Jáuregui Atondo.
Before he takes the floor, please permit me, as chair of our Group, to inform the House that this morning, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, was appointed by the Spanish Government as its Minister for the Presidency.
As you can imagine, that is quite an honour for our group.
I offer him my sincere congratulations.
(Applause)
