Mr President, I have a question for you, Mr Farage.
Perhaps you would be so kind as to answer it for us.
You are so concerned about the British tax coffers.
Just like me, at the beginning of this term of office, you had the option of choosing from which coffers your daily allowances would be paid: from the UK coffers or from those of the European Union.
Please would you tell the House whether your daily allowances are paid from the EU budget or whether you have opted for the national system in the UK?
