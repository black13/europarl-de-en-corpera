Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, this debate shows one thing: the Deauville deal hinders us from overcoming the crisis, the Deauville deal is a backward step for the European Union and the Deauville deal shows us that neither member of this charming couple has learnt anything from France and Germany's inappropriate behaviour in 2002 and 2005 when these countries began undermining the Stability Pact.
Instead, we are now seeing a continuation of such inappropriate behaviour.
We want to overcome the mistakes of the past.
We want a European answer to the nationalism and the vetoes that have been built into most European regulations.
We did this in the case of supervision of the financial markets.
We are doing so with the report in response to the crisis.
We are doing so with the Feio report and we are doing so with our daily legislative work.
Let us concentrate on that and not allow ourselves to be sidetracked further, including in this debate.
We need to move forward.
We need to find the answers.
The report by the five groups sends a clear message.
We have not yet overcome the crisis.
Fiscal and monetary policies are no substitute for structural reforms.
We are clearly stating that we want deficits to be reduced as a prerequisite for securing the future.
You cannot reduce deficits by simply taking a pair of shears to them.
It has to come about as a result of reforms, investments, savings and changes.
This report sends a clear response that we want to have more Europe as part of the solution.
Let us break through to the next step in integration - the creation of an economic union, the creation of a social union, the creation of a defence and security union, and let us make the internal market the home market of all our citizens.
The community of Europe - the initiative of the European Union - is the answer.
The task force and the Deauville route have failed.
