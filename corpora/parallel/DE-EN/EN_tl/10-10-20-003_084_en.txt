Mr President, scarcely have we half regulated the financial sharks of the stock market monopoly than we are faced with the problem of a global race to devalue currencies which, despite China's slight accommodation today, has not yet been averted.
Something that is anathema to us in Europe - namely, devaluation or intervention in the currency markets - is now a problem forced upon us by globalisation.
The US wants to reduce public debt, the Japanese want to boost the economy and the Chinese want to increase exports.
This soft currency policy conducted by other economic powers naturally harms Europe, as well as other countries, and therefore must, in my opinion, be an important topic of debate at the G20 summit.
After all, flooding of the world's markets with cheap Chinese imports is easy if the currency is artificially undervalued.
This kind of enduring intervention distorts the market; an extremely dangerous game which, in a worst case scenario, could bring the entire global economy to its knees.
Even if the prospects of success are doubtful, it is essential that plans for a financial transaction tax are broached at the summit.
