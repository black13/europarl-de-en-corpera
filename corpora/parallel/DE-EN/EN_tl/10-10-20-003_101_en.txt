The economic and financial crisis has revealed all too clearly the shortcomings and weaknesses of the existing instruments and methods for coordinating economic and currency policy.
In the past, some Member States, particularly France and Germany, were too hesitant at introducing stricter regulation.
Overcoming the economic crisis is one of the greatest challenges we have faced and one to which there can only be a European answer, not a national answer.
This also applies to sanction mechanisms, which are still being blocked by some Member States.
Under the new rules of the internal financial market, however, it is high time that the currency union were strengthened and, at the same time, public debt, in particular, reduced in order to secure the future of the European economic area.
The national parliaments, in particular, need to be more intensively involved in this process in order to Europeanise the debate in the Member States.
Only then can a European answer be found with which to overcome the crisis and achieve a robust, strong economic union.
