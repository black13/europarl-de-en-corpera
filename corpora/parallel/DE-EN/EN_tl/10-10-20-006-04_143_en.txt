Mr President, we have had no opportunity to discuss this as a group.
I was informed about it by Mr Daul a few minutes ago, during this morning's debate, and I have discussed it with the chairs of other groups, namely Mrs Harms and Mr Verhofstadt.
I also want to address this point to my group, as we have not, so far, had the opportunity to discuss this.
I believe that, with a postponement, there would be a very good chance of reaching a broad consensus over the calendar for 2012.
I therefore believe that we should vote through this postponement today.
