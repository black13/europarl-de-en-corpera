The Treaty of Lisbon allows the European Parliament a considerable measure of new powers of codecision.
As a result, there should, not least, be a deepening of democracy in the European Union and improved participation by European citizens.
By codifying and realising these rights, the new framework agreement takes account of these entitlements and the new balance between the Commission and Parliament.
This is very much to be welcomed, as Parliament will now be better able to do justice to its role as the representative of the EU's citizens.
It is now up to us to use these new rights responsibly.
