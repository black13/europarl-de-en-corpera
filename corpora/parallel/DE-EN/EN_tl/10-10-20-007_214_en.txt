The European External Action Service (EEAS) will be the future foreign policy mouthpiece of the European Union.
In this service, our different positions will find one voice - communicating a strong message - and it is important to give it our support.
In order for the EEAS to be able to work effectively, efficient financial control is necessary.
Only if the EEAS forms part of the Commission can the best possible control be ensured.
The clear distribution of rights and obligations will allow it to work smoothly.
I support Mrs Gräßle's and Mr Rivellini's successful report, and I have, of course, voted in favour of this constructive contribution from the European Parliament.
