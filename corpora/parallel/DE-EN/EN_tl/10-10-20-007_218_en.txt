In addition to the duplicated structures that will be created by the European External Action Service (EEAS), personnel costs will also rocket in the wasteful and bureaucratic way that is typical of the EU.
Of the 1 643 posts that the EEAS will start off with on 1 December, 50 are, believe it or not, director-general posts, and during the initial phases, there will be barely more than 30 members of staff under one director-general.
When the final structure is complete there will not even be as many as 80.
The aforementioned directors-general will, on average, earn EUR 17 000 per month.
Below these directors-general, there is another level containing 224 directors and 235 heads of unit.
In addition, we are still waiting for specific tasks and objectives to be defined for the EEAS staff.
We want the EU to have a strong voice in the world, but this surely does not require a bloated administrative apparatus that will cost EU citizens billions as a result of duplicated structures and members of staff who will enjoy a very lucrative source of income.
I therefore voted against this report.
