In order to be able to represent the interests of European states on the international stage in a more effective manner, foreign policy actions must be discussed in advance and then communicated to the outside world with one voice.
An attempt is now being made, through the European External Action Service (EEAS), to bring the Union's external policy instruments into a coherent framework - the existing resources are being brought together and complemented by new resources.
In view of the novel nature of this structure, ambitious provisions with regard to transparency and budgetary and financial accountability need to be applied.
Since Parliament's budgetary authority includes the EEAS, the service must be integrated into the Commission structure.
Otherwise, it will be impossible to grant discharge within the meaning of the treaties.
The annual activity reports are also provided to the budgetary authorities.
