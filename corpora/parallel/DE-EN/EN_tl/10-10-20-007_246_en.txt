Consideration surely does need to be given to the precise form of the European External Action Service (EEAS) that is to be established.
A system in which each of the 50 directors-general would initially have 30 and later a good 80 staff members would mean bloated and expensive administration.
Similarly, the establishment of the EEAS is expected to bring with it a wave of promotions.
A few issues have not yet been cleared up sufficiently.
Possible effects on the building costs must be subject to prior scrutiny.
Other factors, such as actually giving proper weight to German as a working language, as laid down in the treaties, have been ignored.
For these reasons, I feel that, in its present form, the funding for the EEAS must be rejected.
