The thinking is that, in order to overcome the economic crisis, as much money as possible should be made available to fund the EU's priorities for 2010.
This was made possible by reallocating budget funds.
Financial support for accompanying measures for the banana sector were not envisaged when the current multiannual financial framework was being drawn up.
To cushion trade liberalisation at the WTO level and the associated reduction in most favoured nation status tariffs, we are told that EU financial support for ACP countries that supply bananas is now to be maintained.
Especially in times in which the EU itself is wrestling with the economic crisis, this kind of utilisation of the flexibility instrument must be rejected.
