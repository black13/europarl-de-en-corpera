I support the European Parliament's proposals for the draft 2011 budget.
The important political areas and the individual opinions have been taken into account in the report.
Parliament acknowledges that in future, the European Union cannot manage to fulfil its extensive and varied tasks with fewer financial resources.
That applies, above all, to agriculture.
The Opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the 2011 budget already expressed the concern that, in the planning and utilisation of unused resources, the Commission's assumptions are too optimistic.
Large-scale European research projects are financially coupled to recoveries, the amount of which no one knows in advance.
The Commission is called on to ensure the long-term financing of research and development in future and to draw up precise financing plans.
Financial recoveries from the agricultural pot should be used for their original purpose.
