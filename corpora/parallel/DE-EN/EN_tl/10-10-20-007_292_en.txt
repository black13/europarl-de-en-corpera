One of the things that the Treaty of Lisbon changed was the financial structures of the EU, in particular, the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the annual budgetary procedure.
The treaty gives the MFF binding legal status and states that it is to be laid down by the Council, acting unanimously after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.
There is no longer a distinction to be made between mandatory and non-mandatory expenditure, for decisions on which both budgetary authorities are now jointly responsible, with the process being simplified accordingly.
The fact that Parliament now has the right of codecision on the entire budget reinforces democratic control.
Some further steps to simplify the bureaucracy are also envisaged.
It is important that the European Parliament, as the EU's only directly elected institution, has its budgetary rights strengthened so that it can influence important EU decisions such as the demand for cost savings in the new External Action Service.
However, I cannot support tendencies to centralise.
