The key points in the EU budget for 2011 are investment in training, research and innovation - a necessity given the current situation on the labour market.
The reduction in current unemployment in Europe needs to be at the heart of every decision - including when it comes to actually implementing the ambitious Europe 2020 targets.
Prioritising youth in connection with the training and mobility programmes is a very worthwhile investment, with good opportunities for development for the labour market.
There are some increases, but also cuts - the budget is a compromise, like every multi-party decision.
Redirecting money into nuclear research, however, cannot be in the interests of the people of Europe and this money would be better spent, for example, on renewable energy sources.
