I support improving the European minimum standard for maternity protection.
However, in the end, I voted against this report, as I come from a country that has established a particular combination of maternity protection and waged/unwaged parental leave.
Alongside 16 weeks of leave on full pay and an absolute ban on working, women also have the right to unwaged maternity leave with child benefit.
The amount of child benefit drawn during unwaged maternity leave depends on its duration and the most recent level of income.
The Austrian rules go far beyond the minimum standards stipulated in this report.
Moreover, I am also in favour of introducing fully paid paternity leave, although a different legal basis should be chosen for this.
I believe that such paternity leave should not be regulated by the directive on maternity protection, but should instead be regulated by a dedicated directive that is not aimed at the protection of the health of mothers and children.
