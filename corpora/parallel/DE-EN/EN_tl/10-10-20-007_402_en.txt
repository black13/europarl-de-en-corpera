I welcome the decision of the report to stand firmly on the side of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Late payment is a massive economic problem in commercial transactions within the EU.
In the agricultural sector, too, it is a serious matter if liquidity problems are shifted on to agricultural undertakings.
Clearly defined payment deadlines will put a stop to these methods.
I support the 30-day payment deadline as standard proposed in the report and also the introduction of a general upper limit of 60 days.
I find it incomprehensible that, in many Member States, payments of public money in connection with transactions with public administrations are delayed.
Late payments seriously impair the business environment and the internal market and have a direct effect on the Member States.
The flat-rate compensation that has been called for, which is to be paid from the first day on which the payment becomes late, represents a tangible method of preventing this.
