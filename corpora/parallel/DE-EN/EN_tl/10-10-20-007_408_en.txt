Outstanding debts represent a considerable financial risk, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
A lack of a payment moral, especially in times of crisis, can severely restrict liquidity.
There is certainly a benefit to be gained from measures that lead to a greater consciousness about payment.
I have abstained because I am not convinced that it makes sense to regulate this at the pan-European level or that doing so would have a positive influence on the payment moral.
