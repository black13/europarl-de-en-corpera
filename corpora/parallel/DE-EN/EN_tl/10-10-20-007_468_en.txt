I voted against this report because it turns budgetary consolidation by the Member States on its head and contains the usual flowery Communist dross about inter-State transfers.
Moreover, there is a very clear violation of the principle of subsidiarity in the social sphere.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, social assistance and the State-guaranteed income via Hartz IV long-term unemployment benefits are already so high that for low-end jobs, it is not worthwhile working.
In this connection, there needs to be a mandatory minimum separation between welfare payments and income.
The prerequisite for all prosperity remains, as it always has been, healthy economic growth.
