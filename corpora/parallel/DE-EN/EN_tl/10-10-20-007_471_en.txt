Around 85 million people in the EU are currently facing the threat of poverty.
This includes various different groups: children and young people up to the age of 17 have a higher risk of poverty, which, in specific terms, means that one in five children and young people are victims of poverty.
Elderly people also face a higher risk of poverty than the general population.
In 2008, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for people aged 65 years and over stood at 19%.
However, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for those in employment was 8% on average in 2008 - the so-called 'working poor'.
The concept of a minimum income will contribute significantly to the social integration of groups that are at risk.
However, in the drawing up of the directive, the greatest possible attention needs to be paid to maximum control and avoidance of any possible 'exploitation' of this social assistance.
If we just look at the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, there are 23 million people who need to receive unemployment benefits in order to be able to live with dignity.
