I voted in favour of the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, which represents a constructive compromise between all the groups involved.
We do not need less Europe, we need more of it!
Our national economies are closely intertwined - national egotisms will only intensify the crisis.
This report calls for Europe to be unanimous on essential issues.
Sustainable EU financial, economic and employment policy needs to be the cornerstone of our action.
The recommendations for action show a clear way forward: in future, businesses must have their credit ratings assessed by an independent EU ratings agency.
An end must be put to high risk speculation through a financial transactions tax.
The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be better connected to the Europe 2020 strategy.
We are unambiguous in calling on the Commission to create a balance between growth, equality of opportunity and financial market stability.
There is a need to reduce the taxation on work in order to strengthen investment and thus, Europe's competitiveness.
Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, need easier access to credit.
In the social sphere, the advancement of human resources - through real, tangible measures to get people trained and qualified - takes top priority.
Numerous public hearings, workshops and analyses have enabled us, as committee members, to make well-founded, fact-based contributions to the public debate.
It is important for Parliament to offer clear answers to crises.
Only in that way can we strengthen our credibility and reliability in the eyes of the citizens.
