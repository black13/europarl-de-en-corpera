The economic and financial crisis has clearly shown us that there is an urgent need to improve economic cooperation within the European Union.
To do this, the Stability and Growth Pact must be reinforced and expanded to include suitable and effective sanctioning options.
There is also a need, however, to keep a closer eye on the national budgets and the competitiveness of the Member States.
In future, we need to identify imbalances between the countries of the euro area and any shortcomings in competition earlier and we need the ability to demand effective countermeasures.
The object must be to make the monetary union and the euro durably strong and robust in order to be able to prevent a crisis like the one in Greece.
