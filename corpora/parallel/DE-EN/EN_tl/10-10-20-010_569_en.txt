Mr President, I am speaking on the subject of the ICI+ Instrument.
The Instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories (ICI) was launched in the previous parliamentary term.
In an opinion, the Committee on Foreign Affairs called for a financing instrument for foreign affairs to be created that had no connection with development aid but was aimed at the countries of Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.
The Commission then created the little instrument that is the ICI Instrument.
Unfortunately, the Commission saw this as an interim solution.
It replenished the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) countries but otherwise, produced little that was new and treated it as a trade instrument.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs therefore put forward an amendment concerning the title of the instrument that clarified the original intention to identify it as a foreign policy instrument.
The new title is a 'Financing instrument for cooperation with countries in the Middle East, Asia, the Americas and South Africa'.
We ask for your support for this.
It would be worse than regrettable if the EU had no foreign policy financing instrument that was actually named as such.
