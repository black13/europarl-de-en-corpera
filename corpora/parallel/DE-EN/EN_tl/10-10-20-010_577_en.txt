Mr President, it is important to make clear at this point that, when it comes to the EU's foreign policy financing instruments, the Treaty of Lisbon abolished the European Parliament's right of supervision.
In so doing, the competency for these financing instruments was fully transferred to the Commission and to the High Representative, and with her, to the European External Action Service.
I find it completely unacceptable that Parliament and the Council are to be ignored, despite the fact that what is at issue is the European Union's far-reaching foreign policy measures and their implementation.
We support Parliament's cross-group efforts aiming to re-establish parliamentary supervision of the financing instruments.
Accordingly, we will support the amendments to the delegated acts in this regard, which, of course, were discussed earlier.
All the same, I would like to close by expressing my major concern in respect, in particular, of the Instrument for Stability and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as I believe that these instruments are used in an undemocratic and non-transparent way and, in some cases, against the will of the countries in question, which gives them the character of an interventionist EU foreign policy.
