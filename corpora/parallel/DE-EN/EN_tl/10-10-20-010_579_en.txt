Mr President, as ever, the funding bodies of the EU are having some problems.
Financial aid is difficult to obtain due to its complexity, while the monitoring systems continue to be designed in a less than optimal way.
One example of this is pre-accession aid, which, as we all know, is awarded to potential candidate countries, but which it only makes sense to pay if the states in question are getting to grips with their corruption problems or if the necessary structures are actually established.
I hope that, in this connection, the EU has learnt from its overhasty enlargement of 2007.
When it comes to the Instrument for Stability and development cooperation, the budgetary funds far too often do not reach, or only partially reach, the local institutions for which they were intended.
This is partly due to the weak institutions in the recipient countries, but it is also due to faulty incentive structures and a lack of documented accountability.
There is food for thought in the fact that, according to an IMF study, the public expenditure of 33 countries is more than 50% dependent on international development aid.
When it comes to financial aid from the EU, of whatever kind, the monitoring needs to be tightened up.
