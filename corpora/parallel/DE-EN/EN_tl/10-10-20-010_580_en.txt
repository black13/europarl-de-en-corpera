Mr President, I would like, first of all, to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Scholz, for the positive and open cooperation that we enjoyed.
In the trialogue, in particular, there was not always agreement, but we did enjoy a constructive atmosphere for discussions.
Expanding the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories will give the EU the opportunity to establish cooperation with the crucial emerging and developing economies on an equal footing.
This includes educational exchange programmes under the Erasmus Mundus scheme, and supporting entrepreneurial or cultural cooperation, and is something that I very much welcome.
There is one point that I would like to draw your attention to, and that is that, given the EU's current financial situation - and that of every Member State - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) does not find it acceptable to demand new, not currently available funding to realise the measures just described.
There needs to be a financial evening out with the financing instrument for development cooperation, the resources of which were only intended to be for all the emerging and developing economies.
I have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the PPE Group that makes it possible to achieve such a financial equilibrium.
I also want to say a quick word about the delegated acts.
This is an important issue - it has already been mentioned twice this morning.
There is absolutely no doubt, as far as I am concerned, that Parliament must have a right of supervision and veto over the whole package on the financing of foreign cooperation currently under discussion by means of delegated acts.
The spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon needs to make itself felt here.
There can be no compromise on the issue of whether delegated acts are or are not to be included in the financing instruments.
