Mr President, before I start, I would like to thank you for the constructive way in which you chair our session and for your fairness in naming who is to speak and who is not to.
The OECD countries pump over USD 100 billion per annum into development aid.
This means that they make up 90% of the publicly funded development aid in the world.
The EU is the world's biggest donor of development aid.
However, every year, EUR 3 billion worth of aid gets lost due to qualitative defects.
What can be done about this?
In future, we expect monitoring that ensures that the funds are employed in a way that is traceable and durable.
We also expect the recipient countries to be reminded of their obligations, for example, with regard to cooperation in the repatriation of illegal migrants.
It is absolutely possible to use development aid as a means of applying pressure to conclude readmission agreements.
Uncooperative countries of origin for millions of illegal migrants must not be allowed to continue to look forward to millions in development aid.
I expect clear words in this regard at the forthcoming EU-Africa summit in November.
