Mr President, the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in relation to the Instrument for democracy and human rights was good; the relationship was very cooperative, in fact.
Occasionally, MEPs were invited to take part in an exchange of opinion between the Commission and civil society on specific programmes.
The debate, too, has shown that there are hardly any problems in administering the instrument.
That does not mean, however, that we can rule out occasional problems in application in future.
That is why Parliament's right of supervision is very important.
However, the one point on which we have not been able to reach agreement so far is the establishment of a binding right of supervision for Parliament, which the Treaty of Lisbon allows for.
I therefore join the multiple others who have expressed the hope that we reach a compromise - in other words, a political solution - quickly and one that takes full account of Parliament's rights.
