Mr President, I said that looking to achieve economic prosperity through authoritarian rule is not a route that we in Europe can go down.
We know this from China.
I did not make a comparison, I merely stated that that would be the wrong route to take, that it would not be a European route.
The image that I sketched is a very realistic one, I think, for the people on the ground.
The supposed economic achievements there still need to demonstrate their effectiveness.
