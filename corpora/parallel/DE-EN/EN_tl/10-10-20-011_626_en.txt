Mr President, within a few months of the presidential election in February of this year, in which Mr Yanukovych celebrated his comeback, the democratic accomplishments of the Orange Revolution are clearly being lost.
When, however, even the financial markets judge the new government to be more stable and predictable than the government put in place by the Orange Revolution, that is probably a sign that democracy according to Western - according to our European - preconceptions cannot be transposed on a one-to-one basis to every country, including to those of the post-Communist sphere of influence.
The current decision by the Constitutional Court would indeed strengthen the position of the President and weaken that of the parliament, of that we can be sure.
Those who know the region say that a de facto presidential system was already in place before the pro forma court judgment.
Growing restrictions on the freedom of the press and of opinion put Mr Yanukovych's reassurances that democratic standards will be maintained in doubt.
If the President succeeds in both reinforcing his own power base and achieving an economic recovery by carrying out central reforms in Ukraine, which is, of course, one of the poorest countries of this continent, he will perhaps keep himself on his presidential throne for longer and I believe that that would be something that, plainly and simply, the European Union would have to take note of.
