Mr President, I would like to ask Mrs Vaidere: now that we have put down in black and white all the points concerning our consternation in relation to the misuse of power and the repression in Ukraine, what objection can there be to taking this text to Kiev in a fortnight's time in order to discuss it and then to decide how we proceed from there?
I would like to know the answer to this question, as, from the previous experience of our delegation, I think this is the best and most productive way to move forwards, especially if we want to gain democratic influence.
