Mr President, I think we all need to live up to our responsibilities.
The government in Ukraine needs to implement the rule of law and the freedom of the media, and it needs to do so effectively, but the opposition, too, needs to show that it is responsible and must not give out false information.
When I look at how many of the claims contained in your draft resolution were then immediately denied by the people in question, it shows how much false information is often passed on here.
We, too, need to show that we are responsible.
We cannot allow ourselves to become embroiled in the internal political argument.
Ladies and gentlemen - and I address this in particular to Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - there is no point in us defending one group or another in Ukraine on party-political grounds.
That is not our job.
Next week, we will be having discussions with the Foreign Minister, then we have the elections, then the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, which is travelling to Ukraine, and it has always been the case - Mr Gahler, I am appealing to your sense of fairness here - that we say whether or not things went well after the elections, rather than pre-empting the elections by saying that things will not go well.
That is not our job, and I am appealing to your sense of fairness - something that you normally always demonstrate - and I beg you to remain fair in this case, too.
