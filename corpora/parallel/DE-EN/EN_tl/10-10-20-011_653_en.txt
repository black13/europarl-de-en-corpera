Mr President, I wanted to respond in detail to what Mr Swoboda had to say.
He made a point that was not entirely correct.
It is true that, in our resolution, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) did incorrectly quote the Venice Commission.
I have spoken with Mr Markert and he told me what he actually said.
That is why the joint resolution no longer contains the quotation.
You can see, therefore, that this is no longer a subject of debate.
You spoke about the rule of law in general.
However, I would have liked to have heard you, as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, say something clear and specific about the things that the secret police do there.
When parties there are not permitted to take part in elections, that is something that you can criticise even before an election, as, in such circumstances, the results of the election obviously cannot meet democratic and European standards.
