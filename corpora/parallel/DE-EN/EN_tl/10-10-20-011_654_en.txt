Mr President, this is not supposed to be a dialogue.
However, Mr Gahler, you should at least be made aware that I made very clear, in a press release, no less, which was also on behalf of my group, that the secret services must be monitored.
I also brought this up in my talks with Prime Minister Azarov.
We have a clear position on this matter.
I would ask you, once again, to consider overnight whether it would not really make more sense for us to adopt a resolution together, as a broad community, rather than adopting one with a narrow majority as would be the case at present.
Have another think about that.
That would be sensible.
