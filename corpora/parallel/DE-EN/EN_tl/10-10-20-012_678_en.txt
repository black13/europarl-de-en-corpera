Madam President, in Copenhagen, even cooperative countries like Indonesia and Brazil ultimately fought on the side of the G77 states, thus joining forces to form a bloc against the so-called rich states of the North.
The climate debate became a debate about fairness and, even in the preparatory conference, the emerging economies made it clear that they had no intention of making concessions in Canc√∫n.
My question to you, then, is as follows.
How can the formation of blocs like this be avoided and how can this kind of changing of the subject be prevented?
Should the EU not take on an important role as a mediator here?
