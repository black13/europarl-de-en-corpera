Mr Chastel, we do have agencies that already deal with these issues.
I would remind you of the Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna.
Would it not be possible to ask that agency to focus on this issue and to concentrate its work on it so that we do not have to create a new body but could instead pass this activity on to the existing agency in Vienna?
We have very qualified staff there.
It would be good if that could be arranged.
