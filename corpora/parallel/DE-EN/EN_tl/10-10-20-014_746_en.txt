Madam President, the flooding disaster in Pakistan has humanitarian consequences on an unimaginable scale.
I consider it to be the European Union's duty to make sure that aid gets to the people of Pakistan quickly.
Measures designed to invigorate the economy and employment over the long term are an important contribution for the EU to make in order to help this hard-hit country out of its crisis.
However, I question whether a simple reduction in the customs tariff will have the desired effect.
We need to clear up whether or not preferences for Pakistan flow into Third countries via indirect channels and thus, whether they have the desired effect.
As well as the textiles industry, I am thinking here, above all, about the field of bio-ethanol.
My specific question to the Commission is whether setting up a tariff quota for ethanol is regarded as a truly sustainable and efficient option that will help the people of Pakistan.
Can it be assessed whether the necessary sustainability criteria for imports into the EU are also fulfilled in the production of bio-ethanol.
