Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Muscardini for the work that she has done on this report and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation.
My group welcomes the approach of providing more transparency for consumers in relation to the origin of products, and supports the road map, as Mr Rinaldi described it, to a stage victory.
In fact, we would prefer further information to be made apparent, such as information on products' ecological 'footprints', on whether workers' rights are observed in the manufacturing process or on the equitable sharing of profits by producers and workers.
At the same time, we do not believe that this extended wish list belongs in a regulation on the indication of the country of origin, as the name of the country on its own does not provide any reliable information in this regard.
Let us take the example of India, where child labour is prohibited.
While there are black sheep amongst the companies there, the vast majority do comply with the law.
In a European regulation, we therefore have to take into consideration the fact that neither competitors nor nationalists can drag the name of an entire country and its products through the mud.
We advocate the development of certification systems.
Fair trade labels represent a model to follow here, and these should now be further developed with EU support.
Additionally taking account of low carbon production methods and humane working conditions would enable us to incorporate modern challenges.
I call on the Commission to take steps to initiate an additional regulation in this direction.
Allow me to add one more thought.
A consistent introduction of the 'Made in' provision also has a part to play in solving complicated political conflicts; for example, the unhindered access of 'Made in Palestine' products to the EU market, which would deliver the chance of autonomous economic development in Palestine.
