Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Muscardini for her hard work, particularly in view of the controversial issues, some of which have already been discussed.
I am convinced that European consumers need to have this matter explained to them.
I am also of the opinion that it must be our goal to protect the citizens of Europe from products that are dangerous and harmful to health.
End users should know what raw materials are used, how these are obtained, where and how they are processed and what social and production standards apply in the relevant countries.
The goal is clear, but we need clarity on how we intend to get there.
Unfortunately, the current version of the proposed 'Made in' provision tell us nothing about the actual origins of a particular commodity.
I should like to illustrate this with an example: Uzbekistan is the world's third largest exporter of cotton.
Ninety per cent of the harvest is picked by hand, most of it using child labour.
The gathered cotton is then shipped to Vietnam, where it is processed.
According to the Commission's current proposals, the textiles now imported into the EU from Vietnam should be labelled 'Made in Vietnam', but what about the transparency for the European consumer?
Nobody knows where the raw materials come from and how they have been obtained.
The level of information is quite inadequate.
The European Consumer Centre in Austria has published an up-to-date analysis, which indicates that the world's leading and most prominent textile businesses are unable to guarantee that raw materials from state-sponsored companies involving child labour are not used in their production.
A 'Made in' provision of this kind, which excludes raw materials from the production process, clearly misjudges the requirements of European end users.
I am in favour of more truth in product labelling and therefore oppose this proposal from the Commission.
