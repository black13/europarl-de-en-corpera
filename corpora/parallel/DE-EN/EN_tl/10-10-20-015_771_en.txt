Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during a recent delegation trip on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I had the pleasure of visiting a number of production sites in Europe, small enterprises that are forced to operate in very difficult conditions: I witnessed superior quality, fair wages, good working conditions and a rational working atmosphere.
This is a direct result of our traditions and European legal order.
However, there are plenty of countries where such principles do not exist, where working conditions are poor, and where no guarantees exist for workers.
I believe that, at the very least, European consumers must be able to recognise in future whether the products they are buying come from a particular country where basic principles do not apply.
This is something that will be required in future thanks to the directive that Mrs Muscardini has so efficiently prepared.
Accordingly, we should agree to the proposal.
To those businesses that have moved their production abroad for their own convenience and in order to avoid bureaucracy, and which are now complaining, I would say: you have only yourselves to blame!
