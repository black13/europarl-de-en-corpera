Mr President, in the agricultural sector too, consumers are entitled to detailed and unambiguous information about the origin of the products sold in the European Union.
By this means, we can enable them to make well-informed, deliberate purchasing decisions.
However, the long-term goal must be that our high product and security standards in Europe should also apply to imported products to be sold in the European Union.
This is not a question of trade restrictions, but rather, on the contrary, aims to establish equal competitive conditions as a decisive prerequisite for fair global trade.
Unfortunately, the motion for a resolution presented by the Commission will not achieve this aim.
