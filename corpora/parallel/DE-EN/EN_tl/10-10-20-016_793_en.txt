Mr President, CommissionerÂ°De Gucht, it is obvious that the ACTA agreement negotiated will shortly be adopted.
This is an agreement that entails a whole series of commitments by the contracting parties in strengthening the enforcement of intellectual property rights.
We, as Members of the European Parliament, will soon be asked by you, the Commission, to approve this agreement.
However, for months now, Parliament has made it clear that a number of the declarations of intent made by the EU within the ACTA agreement run the risk of going beyond current EU law.
Not only is it unclear whether sufficient competence exists for this kind of trade agreement, involving as it does provisions such as punitive measures or intervention in fundamental rights, we also lack information on the extent to which ACTA will necessitate the introduction of illegal measures in the EU.
For this reason, ACTA will have to be sent back to the negotiating table.
And yet you are willing to sign up to the agreement now.
That is why I would ask you firstly: Have you already signed?
If not, when do you intend to sign?
Secondly: When will we receive a detailed impact assessment on the extent to which ACTA could affect fundamental rights within the EU?
I look forward to hearing your answers.
