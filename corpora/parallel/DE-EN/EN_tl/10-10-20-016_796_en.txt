Mr President, the ACTA negotiations seem to be more or less concluded.
The wording of the latest version of the agreement already reads like legislative text as it applies in individual Member States.
Thus, the ACTA agreement will leave the existing legal situation in Europe almost unchanged.
The original aim of the agreement was to improve enforcement.
However, I am unable to identify any specific solutions in this regard from the proposal.
Prior to publication, it became known that the disputed points were to be dropped.
However, this version does not seem to take adequate account of the various conflicting interests.
For example, Article 2(2) of the agreement reads: 'Procedures adopted, maintained, or applied to implement this Chapter shall be fair, equitable and provide for the rights of all participants subject to procedures to be appropriately protected'.
The chapter on temporary measures contains no explicit reference to the right to due legal process, neither is there a provision for verifying the need to destroy counterfeit products.
Last but not least - we hear that the last points of the negotiation are to finalised by e-mail.
However, these last points include the area of application of the agreement as a whole.
Surely this should be defined before we start on the formulation of the content.
Perhaps this would then also give rise to some practical solutions in the agreement itself.
