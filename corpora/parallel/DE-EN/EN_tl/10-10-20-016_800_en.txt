Mr President, Commissioner, since the text of the ACTA agreement has become available, we find that it gives rise to far more questions than answers.
This is partly due to the very unclear and vague legal terminology used in places, which seems to rule nothing out and everything in.
Let me just touch on one key issue here, which is the call for cooperation between service providers and rights holders in implementing rights.
Are we to take this to mean that, for example, Warner Brothers would work together with ISPs almost like deputy sheriffs?
How would this work in detail?
Would it mean streaming the Internet in order to identify violations?
This confusion stems from the fact that, for example, the term 'private use or commercial use' is not adequately defined and a common definition has not been found.
I believe this to be an extremely problematic issue because it entails the privatisation of legal rights.
As has already been mentioned, yesterday, the Commission gave an undertaking that there will be an impact assessment in relation to civil rights in any new provisions.
When can we expect this impact assessment in relation to the ACTA agreement?
What can we expect from this assessment and when will we actually be able to read it?
This is decisive in enabling us to evaluate this agreement.
