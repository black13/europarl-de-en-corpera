Mr President, Commissioner, of course, the attempt to reach good international agreements is very praiseworthy and I freely admit that this is a far from easy task.
Nonetheless, when considering such agreements, at some point we must stop and ask: who will benefit and who will suffer as a result?
I get the feeling that in fact, it benefits just a few people who want to make a fat profit and who have little interest in upholding human rights, freedom of information, etc. and that it actually harms far more people than it genuinely benefits.
I am still not clear about the actual situation with regard to generics.
Admittedly, there is not a lot that can be achieved through criminal penalties.
However, we know that civil actions and the associated major compensation claims, etc. can inflict far more damage than criminal proceedings.
Then the question of trademark protection versus origin markings arises.
We have just had a discussion where it was stated that origin markings are gaining increasing importance and offer opportunities beyond the ambit of trademark protection.
However, everything seems to have got hung up on the issue of trademark protection.
The idea of using Internet providers as a de facto private police force, something that has already been mentioned by other Members of the House, is a concept that I utterly reject.
Who is going to control the providers?
There is no duty to provide information and no data protection, as should really be the case with public bodies.
These are all things that give me cause for concern.
Furthermore, I do not know what these impact assessments will achieve in terms of human rights and, above all, what the Commission will do if this House forms the impression that this is a watered-down solution and refuses to endorse it.
