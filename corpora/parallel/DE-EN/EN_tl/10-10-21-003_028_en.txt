Mr President, when we have considered the Balkans in the past, for example, when we focused on the problems of Kosovo or Bosnia, we have tended to overlook Moldova.
The EU should long ago have taken on the role of mediator in the conflicts involving Moldova and its neighbours.
It is regrettable that Moldova has now rejected the EU's offer of mediation in the Transnistrian conflict.
It is no coincidence that Moldova is the poor relation in the European family.
This is due to the country's chaotic, post-socialist economy.
As we know, the prime industrial area in the east of Moldova has declared its independence with the support of Russia and, by doing so, has put the seal on the country's economic decline, because the economy is based solely on agriculture.
When the citizens of Moldova go to the polls at the end of November to elect a new government, it will be important to ensure that the elections run smoothly, in order to prevent further unrest and an intensification of the conflict with Romania, for example.
