Mr President, I am glad that the European Commission did not exist in the 15th century.
If it had existed, Christopher Columbus and his companions would probably have sailed in the next container, which would promptly have sunk, and they would never have reached the continent of America.
We know what the cause of this problem is.
We know that something needs to be done about it.
What does the Commission say?
It says that it is not possible to do anything.
This is simply not acceptable.
We know that inaccurate stowage is the cause, that the containers have faulty lashings, that they are overweight, that they fall into the water even when the weather is not stormy and that individual countries with their own regulations cannot change any of this.
Who else should be bringing about change, if not the Commission, which is responsible for ensuring that things like this do not happen in European waters.
It is not only the environmental damage that we are concerned about.
Human lives are also being put at risk.
What would happen if a small boat with a plastic hull were to ram one of these containers in mid-Atlantic?
It would sink.
It would not just be the boat itself that would sink, but also the people on board.
Spending a long period in the water in the middle of the North Atlantic wearing a life jacket is not much fun.
This is something which we need to take into account.
Therefore, I think it is wrong that nothing is happening.
I believe that the European Commission must introduce regulations as quickly as possible in order to put an end to this situation.
It is dangerous, it is wrong and something must be done.
I am calling on the Commission to take urgent action, because it is responsible in this case.
