Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, integrated maritime policy is a forward-looking area.
The oceans are being used increasingly intensively for transport, maritime economic activities, offshore energy and fishing, and the development of these areas must be coordinated.
The space available is limited and, therefore, the various maritime sectors must take a responsible and thoughtful approach to working together.
The use and the protection of the seas must not conflict with one another.
These two areas are mutually dependent, because the oceans can only support us if they are healthy.
I would like to highlight the positive cooperation between countries bordering on the Baltic who are working together to promote the dynamic development of the fisheries, the environment, the infrastructure and tourism in coastal regions.
We must continue to focus on the fishing industry, which is in a weak position and is often regarded as being a low priority, but which, because it provides us with food, represents a vital link in the coastal economy.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on this positive report.
