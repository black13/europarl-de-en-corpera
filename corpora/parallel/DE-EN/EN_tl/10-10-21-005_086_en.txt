Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we must preserve the world's oceans as an ecosystem.
However, the oceans and the concept of globalisation are not mutually exclusive.
Shipping routes are essential to our prosperity, because they are the arteries of world trade.
There is a lot to be done in this context in order to ensure that we protect the environment and that our transport routes are secure.
In future, we will also have to secure our supply of raw materials.
Scientists are predicting that valuable raw materials can be found on the sea bed and in the sea itself.
The important consideration is to extract them in an environmentally friendly way.
The third aspect I would like to look at is the link between the oceans and inland waterways.
I believe it is important to establish a connection with inland waterway transport.
The development of the Danube plays a major role in this respect.
As the longest river in the EU, in combination with the Rhine-Main-Danube canal, it can link the Black Sea with the North Sea.
We should be creating a connection between integrated maritime policy and inland waterways.
