Mr President, we still know far too little about marine ecosystems and many areas of the deep sea in particular are just white patches on our maps.
However, the seas and the oceans represent one of the major challenges of this century and not just because they provide us with food and protein.
Their role in our climate system and, therefore, their contribution to the welfare of the human race should not be underestimated.
The example of the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates that marine ecosystems can regenerate if the necessary environmental protection measures are put in place.
In the protected areas of the reef, the fish population has increased by between 30% and 75% in only two years.
Given the fact that more than 40% of the world's population lives less than 100 kilometres from the sea and could therefore be hit by a tsunami, I very much welcome the plan to implement a joint European disaster prevention strategy for our coastal areas.
However, the establishment of differing emission limits within EU waters conflicts with the integrated maritime policy, which aims to take all factors into account.
We need to be consistent in this area.
