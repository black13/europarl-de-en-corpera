Mr President, I would like to highlight once again the European Union's transport strategy.
Our aim is to move goods from the roads to the sea and to provide efficient and environmentally friendly means of transport.
However, in certain areas of shipping we must not set our environmental objectives as high as the sulphur emission control areas in the Baltic and the North Sea, otherwise the cost of transport will rise dramatically.
Mr Itälä and Mr Fleckenstein have already referred to this.
I would like to call on Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn to evaluate the study which is being drawn up very carefully.
We do not want to move transport from the sea back to the roads and we want fair competition in northern Europe, in the European Union and in the Mediterranean area.
That is one of the fundamental requirements.
On the subject of maritime safety, I would also like to say that it should play a greater role in integrated maritime policy with regard to the very busy shipping lanes and straits.
For example in the Kadet Trench and in the Bosphorus, as one of my fellow Members has mentioned, there should in future be compulsory pilotage.
Where large tankers pass through and highly complex cargoes are being transported, compulsory pilotage would increase levels of maritime safety.
