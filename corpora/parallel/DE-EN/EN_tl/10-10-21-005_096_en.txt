Thank you very much, Mr Pirillo.
I have not included your initial remarks in your speaking time, because what you have said is important.
However, I can assure you that all the Vice-Presidents make a great effort in this respect.
I would like to invite you to take part in a competition with me.
We will pull the names of Members of this House out of a hat and see who is better at pronouncing them.
Nevertheless, mistakes sometimes do happen in the heat of the moment and I would like to ask for your forbearance.
