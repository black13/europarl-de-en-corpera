Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order.
I would like to thank the chair for bringing the debate to a close today a quarter of an hour before the vote, because this is a dignified way of ending the debate, which allows us to finish speaking calmly and gives the Members time to come in.
Yesterday things did not work well at all and the planning was not how we would like it.
Today everything is as it should be and I hope that the chair will take this into account in future and schedule sufficient spare time between the end of the debate and the start of voting.
