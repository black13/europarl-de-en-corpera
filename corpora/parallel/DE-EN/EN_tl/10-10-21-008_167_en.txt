Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to what Mr Hannan has just said.
It is, of course, essential for this Parliament to have a seat, but the seat is established by our treaties and it is here in Strasbourg.
You are right to say that we need to save taxpayers' money and that we must work towards being based in one place.
However, the refuge of parliamentarianism, Mr Hannan, is here in Strasbourg.
This is where we as Members of Parliament and representatives of the people can work together.
