Mr President, the Estrela report yesterday covered a very important topic.
I would like to say at this point that it was rather difficult for me to vote in favour of it.
As a young father, I was present at the birth of both my children and I have to say that I do not know why I would have needed a holiday then, because I did not give birth, my wife did.
This is all about maternity leave and we have included fathers.
It is difficult point.
Nevertheless, it is important for young women to have the opportunity to have a child and then to return to their professional life.
I believe that this will be possible under the new system.
Although I would personally have preferred 18 weeks, I did eventually vote in favour of 20 weeks in the final vote.
We must now ask ourselves whether this will bring more justice and more children in Europe.
Family policy in Europe is an issue for the future.
I hope that we are sending out a signal that we have taken action in this area.
Now we just have to hope that the Member States take corresponding measures.
