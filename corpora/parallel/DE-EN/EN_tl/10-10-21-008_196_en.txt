in writing. - The bilateral relationships between the industrialised nations and other high-income countries and territories, in particular in North America, East Asia, South-East Asia and the Gulf region, have been developed by the EU in recent years.
The main objective of this is to enhance and strengthen the role of the EU in the world as a whole.
Now the list of countries that come within the sphere of competence of the ICI regulation, which establishes a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories, will be significantly extended.
This will result in a considerable increase in costs for the EU Member States.
I have voted against the report, because it is likely to cause costs to skyrocket.
