in writing. - Origin labelling is intended to provide consumers with information which will allow them to make informed purchasing decisions.
Many countries label their products accurately.
However, in the past items which were advertised as coming from one country frequently came from somewhere quite different.
Labelling is an area where it is easy to deceive the consumer.
In principle, more accurate labelling is a good thing, but this report is apparently not in a position to guarantee that label fraud can be totally prevented.
The procedures are not sufficiently precise and leave room for interpretation.
Therefore, I cannot vote in favour of the report.
