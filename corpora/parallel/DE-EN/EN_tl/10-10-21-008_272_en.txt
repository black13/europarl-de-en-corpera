in writing. - In the last few years, Latin America has become an emerging economic region.
Trade agreements with South American states represent a very positive development.
As the European Union has already carried out very important development work, it should now further strengthen its position as the region's second largest trading partner, just as Russia is already doing.
However, the EU should also consider carefully which states it trades with, as the exploitation of workers is still the norm in many South American countries.
I have voted against the report because it pays too little attention to the sometimes very poor working conditions in Latin America and offers too few proposals for improving them.
