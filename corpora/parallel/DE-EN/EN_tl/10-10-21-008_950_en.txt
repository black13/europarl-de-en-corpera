in writing. - The European Union maintains good economic relations with countries in Latin America at WTO level, but also at bilateral and multilateral levels.
These trade and economic relations must continue to be developed in light of the sensitive economic sectors of the EU.
I therefore expressly support the amendment to paragraph 30 that has been tabled, which calls for 'agricultural imports to be allowed into the EU only if they have been produced in a manner consistent with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards and minimum social standards'.
Our European citizens must comply with high production standards and should not be put at a disadvantage as a result of unfair competition.
In order to be able to ensure that costs are covered, it is necessary to have planning and income security.
These things also need to be taken into consideration in connection with free trade agreements.
