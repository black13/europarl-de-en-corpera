in writing. - The aim of the motion for a resolution is visa liberalisation for the Republic of Moldova.
The consequences of this for the European Union would be an increase in migration and cross-border crime.
Such simplifications leave the door wide open to abuse, and a short-stay visa is only too often followed by permanent residence.
I therefore voted against this report.
