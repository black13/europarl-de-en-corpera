in writing. - Without a doubt, European consumers have a right to be informed about products imported into the EU from third countries.
The highest possible level of transparency and maximum rights are needed in order for it to be possible to make objective purchasing decisions.
I am in general in favour of a project that aims to inform EU citizens of the origin of the raw materials used, the stages of production, but also the production, social and working conditions prevalent in the country in question.
Unfortunately, the Commission's proposal does nothing of the kind.
The mandatory 'made-in' regulation contained in the current version says nothing about the actual origin of a product or about the conditions under which it was produced and processed.
Even prominent European textile firms, despite voluntary self-regulation, are unable to guarantee that raw materials obtained from companies in third countries and used in their production have not been extracted using child labour.
I understand product transparency for consumers to mean something different.
This proposal does not go far enough and does not meet the information requirements of interested end users.
For these reasons, I was unable to support the Commission's proposal.
