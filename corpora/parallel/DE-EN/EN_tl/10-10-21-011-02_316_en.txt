on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Cambodia is a very beautiful country with a great history, but there are dark sides to both the country and its history.
The latest problems include people disappearing, people being imprisoned without trial, high levels of corruption, illegal land-grabbing and illegal logging.
The thing which should most concern us as Members of the European Parliament is that the people who criticise and denounce these practices are dragged off the street, face sham trials and are then put in prison.
Sam Rainsy, the opposition leader in Cambodia, has been subjected to serious persecution.
He has already been elected, but was thrown out of the parliament in 1995.
However, he managed to return.
There were a number of attacks on him during election rallies, one of which left 80 people dead.
I have had the privilege of visiting him in Cambodia.
I found him to be a very peaceful person and a committed supporter of democracy and human rights.
Now he has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for a symbolic act on the basis of flimsy arguments.
Anyone who locks up the leader of the opposition party also locks up a large proportion of the people of the country who are represented by this person.
Anyone who locks up the leader of the opposition party and prevents him from taking part in the next elections is blocking the democratic process and violating civil and human rights.
I believe that we should not accept this and I call on the Commission to demand that, in particular, the terms of article 1 of the cooperation agreement with Cambodia are fulfilled.
This refers to respect for human rights in Cambodia being a precondition for the provision of aid by the European Union.
