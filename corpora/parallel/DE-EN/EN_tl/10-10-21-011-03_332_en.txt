Mr President, the North Caucasus was a victim of tsarist colonial policy and of attempts at genocide by the Stalinist regime.
However, unfortunately it was also involved in two brutal wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union which went as far genocide against smaller ethnic groups, such as the Chechens.
Today it is still a region where small, evil satellite regimes, like that of Mr Kadyrov, commit horrific violations of human rights.
We condemn all forms of terrorism on all sides, but this regime has nothing to do with democracy and the rule of law.
In order to resolve this situation, we need a three-pronged approach, involving close cooperation between the Council of Europe, together with the European Court of Human Rights, the European Parliament as the driving force behind the European Union and the human rights organisations in the region, which are attempting to protect it from the might of Russia.
The human rights organisation Memorial plays a central role in this respect.
Therefore, we are calling not only for Mr Oleg Orlov to be left in peace immediately, but also for him to be given support for his commendable work on behalf of human rights.
We owe that to him and his fellow combatants, to the people of the North Caucasus and also to our murdered friend and comrade Natalia Estemirova, whom many of us knew personally and whose murder must finally be resolved.
We are under an obligation to her to ensure that human rights and the rule of law are introduced into the North Caucasus.
