Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to request that the vote be held.
It has already been deferred once, before the elections.
We should not now defer it until after the EU-Ukraine summit.
In this resolution, we call on the summit and also on the Commission and the Council to push ahead quickly with the negotiations with Ukraine in respect of the free trade agreement, visa facilitation and the matter of the association agreement.
However, we would also like discussion to take place regarding the fact that the opposition was disadvantaged in the regional and local elections, that it was not able to stand everywhere and, moreover, that there is increasingly little separation of the executive and the judiciary.
It is important to make clear our positive approach to Ukraine.
It is a European country that must have a European perspective.
We do not want it to descend into an authoritarian regime that makes it impossible to achieve this goal.
We should pass a resolution ahead of the summit, since otherwise it may be misinterpreted as meaning that the European Parliament does not oppose such negative positions.
We have seen nearly all the electoral observer organisations conclude that the elections were problematic.
We are practically the last to take a position on this.
We should not bring about the loss of our own credibility.
