Mr President, I am somewhat surprised, because there was an agreement between all the parties that a very carefully prepared resolution would be passed during the November II session in Strasbourg.
Of course, everyone has a right to change their mind.
I simply feel firstly that it would be sensible to wait for the report by the electoral observers, so that once this has been clearly presented, we can then base our statements on that.
Secondly, there is no question that in our view, there were problems with these elections; in some cases, serious problems.
We are not the ex officio defenders, but, ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), please do not be the ex officio defenders of the opposition.
If you were to be as critical of the opposition as we are of the government, then we would be able to find a common denominator.
I advocate that we observe matters in Ukraine objectively, not through party political spectacles.
I recommend that we make our decision in November.
However, if a majority here today decide that we should vote today, then I would request and urge the PPE Group to join us in attempting to find a common critical way forward on all the critical issues, not just against the government.
