Mr President, the coming months will show what the effects will be of the weakening of President Obama in his own country as a result of the relatively poor showing of his party in the recent elections to Congress.
I am thinking, for example, of whether protectionist tendencies will increase and influence trade and economic policy, or whether President Obama will turn his attention more towards foreign policy areas such as the Iran conflict, the Middle East or the conflict in Afghanistan.
We shall see.
For Europe, and for the EU in particular, this should only be of limited interest, because the EU needs to be able to define its own emphases and objectives, and its own interests.
This is particularly true of the area of global politics, where the European Union's presence is rather dwarfed.
One only has to think of the Middle East conflict, where we do not even have a place at the negotiating table.
As everybody knows, on all the relevant issues - whether it is Iran, Afghanistan or the conflict in the Middle East - we tend to sail in the lee of the US, with no vision of our own.
Yet in areas where greater cooperation with the US would be appropriate - such as in resolving the Cyprus problem, where the US could influence its ally Turkey - very little happens.
Although President Obama appears to be more interested in the Pacific than in the Atlantic, from our perspective, we need to place greater focus on Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
Greater cooperation or coordination with the US is undoubtedly also required in the Transatlantic Economic Council.
There is no doubt that the West - in other words, Europe and the US - should maintain its position as the global leader in the areas of research, innovation and development.
Finally, we should not forget that improved data protection as well as the maintenance and upholding of citizens' rights should also play an important part at the summit.
