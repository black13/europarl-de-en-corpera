Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to make three brief points, on behalf also of some of my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
These are critical points that I would ask the representatives of the Commission to bring up in their discussions.
The first is that although it has already been passed, the travel promotion tax is an unacceptable unilateral decision by the US Government.
We hope that you can persuade it to think again on this.
Secondly, the exclusion of Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Cyprus from the visa waiver programme is something that the European Parliament cannot endorse, and, in our opinion, it should not be allowed to continue.
Thirdly, we welcome the joint efforts to elaborate international security standards and to develop smart security concepts, but unilateral stipulations such as compulsory container scanning are not a solution because they are one-sided and disproportionate.
The costs are out of all proportion to the benefit and it is unreasonable to expect this of European ports and enterprises.
