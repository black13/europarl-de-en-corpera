Mr President, the United States and Europe are the West's companions in fate.
Access to third country markets is a shared concern and is in the interests of both the EU and the US, particularly since the economic upturn following the financial crisis is likely to begin in emerging countries such as Brazil, India and China, where there remain considerable and discriminatory trade barriers as well as non-tariff barriers to trade.
We are convinced that the Transatlantic Economic Council not only can, but indeed must, play an important part in promoting a joint approach by the Economic Union and the US to their trade relations with third countries.
We urge this Transatlantic Economic Council to work towards a common approach and a common strategy for new free trade agreements by the US and the EU, although I realise that this will not be without its problems.
Furthermore, such harmonisation between the US and the EU is urgently and rightly being demanded by industry in the context of the G8 and G20, as well as in WTO negotiations.
Moreover - and I expect the US shares this desire - we would like to see the Doha Development Round being concluded as quickly as possible.
However, it will be necessary not just for us to make new and substantive proposals, but also for the emerging economies to move towards us.
Here, too, a common strategy by the US and the European Union would be beneficial to both sides.
If I may address you directly, Commissioner De Gucht: when it comes to cooperation, it would be good if the Commission and Parliament could learn something from the way that Washington works together in the area of trade policy.
