Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international terrorism is undoubtedly something that we must fight together; that is beyond dispute.
However, we must fight it on the basis of our common values and the rule of law, not based on the very individual interpretations of the law currently being proclaimed by former US President George W. Bush in his book and on talk shows.
I mention that also in view of the new majorities in the US Congress.
The decisive thing for us is that we advance the level of data protection, that we respect our citizens' rights; for there is one thing that must also be made clear, which is that the song of freedom cannot be played on an instrument of violence.
We cannot tell people in other countries what we expect of the rule of law if we do not jointly uphold the same standards and act accordingly.
I am very pleased, however, that President Obama has brought a breath of fresh air into the US, even if his position may appear to have been weakened somewhat recently.
One thing is clear, and that is that we will be on the side of those who defend this rule of law.
