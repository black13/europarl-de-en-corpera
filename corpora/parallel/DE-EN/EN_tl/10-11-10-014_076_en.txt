Mr President, I refer to the data protection agreement and would like to point out that all existing agreements absolutely must comply with European data protection standards.
This applies not just to the agreement on the forwarding of banking data, but also in the area of Passenger Name Data.
The Commission cannot deviate from this position when negotiating the data protection agreement with the US.
We cannot allow EU standards to be tailored to those of the US.
We need uniform protection instead of the piecemeal approach that has existed to date, and each new individual agreement on data exchange must include principles such as purpose limitation, minimal retention periods and the right of EU citizens to effective legal remedies in respect of data processing.
We must not, on any account, allow the EU to keep moving closer to the increasingly grotesque profiling systems of the US or to feed the US with the personal data of EU citizens.
Notwithstanding this, an agreement without adequate guarantees would have no chance of standing up in the European Court of Justice.
