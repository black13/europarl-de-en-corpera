Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the data protection agreement.
For me, there is no question that, following the conclusion of a data protection agreement, the existing agreements between the US and the EU will need to be checked and updated in accordance with this new framework agreement.
That is the real purpose of the agreement that we are working towards here.
As I see it, the risk of legal uncertainty comes if we did not do this.
After all, our highest priority must be to protect our citizens.
