Madam President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, ladies and gentlemen, we, as Parliament, will tomorrow adopt a joint resolution which once again emphasises our concerns regarding the exchange of passenger name record data.
Why will we do so?
We will do so because we have been raising points of criticism for several years, but we have the feeling that insufficient attention has been paid to them in the current negotiations, and because it is important to us that this criticism is taken into account from the outset so that this agreement will at least have a chance of ultimately receiving approval here in Parliament.
There are three principal points of criticism, and Mr Voss has also already mentioned some of them.
First of all, it is important and necessary to understand that we want a common European approach and not different data exchange measures with different provisions on data protection.
It is therefore important to make it clear that a uniform solution should be found to this with the contracting parties at European level.
The second point - and this is even more important - is that all of this is above board and in accordance with the legal basis in the treaties.
As Parliament, we have made it clear many times that we reject the use of passenger name record data for profiling purposes, and long storage times are incompatible with constitutional law.
For us, that means that the proactive and reactive use of passenger name record data is actually out of the question as a matter of principle.
This must be made clear in the mandate and also in the negotiations in order for it to be possible, ultimately, for Parliament to grant its approval.
