Madam President, the way that the Commission has put its global approach to transfers of passenger name record data to third countries up for discussion is to be welcomed, particularly before negotiations with third countries get under way.
That shows that it has learnt from past methods.
As has already been said many times with regard to ACTA and SWIFT, here, too, I have huge concerns with regard to data protection standards.
However, in this case, it is essentially about the handling of data with which the authorities, for example, intend to identify possible accomplices of suspects.
At first sight, this is something entirely beneficial, but on further consideration, it is a very serious assumption to place European citizens under general suspicion on the basis of meagre circumstantial evidence.
Would we actually supply the names and data for this purpose?
