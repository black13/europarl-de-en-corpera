Mr President, how I would like to stand before the electorate and say 'Yes, we have achieved great things.
Yes, we have finally made a breakthrough where - in complete contrast to what the previous speaker said - in the opinion of the overwhelming majority of Europeans, we need clear rules'.
Unfortunately, however, a major opportunity has been missed once again.
If, Commissioner, even as you are presenting this, you are already saying that the directive needs to be revised sooner than planned, and if various speakers are now saying 'It is all to do with the Council, but we, the European Parliament, are on the right side', then I have to ask: Why do we not just say 'no' tomorrow?
Why are we allowing the European AIFM structure to continue to remain full of holes precisely because of this passive commercialisation?
Why do we not hold on to that much applauded saying of the German Federal Chancellor: 'No product, no actor, no institution must remain unregulated'?
Why is it that, precisely as a reaction to what will now go through on the nod tomorrow, here in this Parliament, we had to witness it being said for the first time from many different quarters - many Members from many different groups - that we need independent expertise, we need 'financewatch.org'?
We have been made helpless in the face of the lobbyists.
Why do we not have the nerve to indicate what we believe we are able to succeed with by saying 'no'?
Why are we once again leaving precisely those who we should be representing in the lurch - in other words, with regard to private equity and the undermining of companies?
I find that extremely disgraceful, and it will do more harm than good to Europe and the European idea, of which I am a great supporter.
