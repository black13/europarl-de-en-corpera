Madam President, the hedge fund regulation is not a consequence of the crisis.
It fills a legislative gap.
It will take us a step further towards the Europeanisation of the internal market for financial products.
What is it all about?
We will register and authorise all funds.
We will establish a minimum capital requirement of EUR 125 000.
The European Securities and Markets Authority will be the supervisory body.
Our principle of transparency will be applied to the investment strategy, investment policy, payment methods and the delegations.
The concept of the single market will be put into practice by means of the passport.
There will be no EU passport for funds having more than 30% of investments outside the EU.
The bonus regulation that we have introduced for bank managers will also be extended to hedge fund managers in order to ensure sustainability here and to minimise the risk.
This is a good result.
