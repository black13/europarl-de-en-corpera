The fact is, the Single Market Act is a revolution.
It is this Commission's most tangible work programme.
It is our third large project after the introduction of the euro and the enlargement of the EU.
We need more dynamism, decisiveness, courage and European-mindedness in order to be able to implement the 50 proposals.
The single market must become the domestic market of 500 million people, because it represents our potential for growth, employment and competitiveness.
Many treasures are yet to be unearthed.
The single market will also make the so-called net contributors, such as Austria and Germany, into large net receivers.
Utilising the potential means freeing the single market from its chains, overcoming protectionism and nationalism and choosing to perceive the EU as a continent.
Whether this will succeed is primarily up to us politicians.
So, let us get on with the work!
