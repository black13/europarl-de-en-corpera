Mr President, I wanted to ask whether the Council's speaking time is longer later in the evening.
I think it is rather impolite of the President-in-Office of the Council to speak for twice as long as Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy combined, even though we know that we still have other important points to discuss.
He could perhaps be a little more concise.
