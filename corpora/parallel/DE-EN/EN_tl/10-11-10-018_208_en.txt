Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the Innovation Union, the European Commission is moving in the right direction.
I was very pleased to read that the European Commission has agreed to the many demands made in the innovation report of September 2010 which was adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
We are in agreement that the European Union must utilise its potential for innovation much better in future, not least in order to keep pace with countries that are strong in terms of innovation like the United States and Japan, and also with emerging economies like China.
However, the Innovation Union will only be a success if it is implemented jointly with the Member States and the regions.
For this purpose, the Commission is planning to use, among other things, the Innovation Partnerships, which we are currently debating and which are the subject of our cross-group question.
However, in this connection, I would like to warn against creating yet more duplicate structures.
The idea of the Innovation Partnerships has not yet been completely clearly outlined.
The statements by the Council have also not helped to provide definitive clarification.
However, the idea of the Innovation Partnerships has certain similarities to instruments that already exist, such as the technology platforms of the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) within the framework of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
I would like to point out that, in this regard, we absolutely must ensure that synergies are created and utilised and that we take a uniform approach.
