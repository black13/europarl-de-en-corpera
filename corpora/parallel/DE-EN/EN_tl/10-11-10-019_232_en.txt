Mr President, my group welcomes the fact that, after several years, the European Parliament is now substantially engaging with the subject of the OSCE and in so doing, is essentially providing a positive response to the question of the relationship of the EU to the OSCE, to the goals, values and mechanisms agreed in Helsinki but, above all, to its current tasks.
Your report, Mr Vice-President, makes it clear that the European Union and the OSCE are not secret competitors, but partners that can, and must, bring their individual skills and experience to bear in order to solve the complex problems in Europe.
There are two aspects that I would like to highlight in particular with regard to Astana.
In Europe, we need a renewed pan-European dialogue on the future of our continent from the point of view of security policy, this continent being larger than the EU and still characterised by major security policy imbalances.
The Corfu Process brings the prospect of structured debate and should be arranged by the Member States in such a way as to ultimately achieve specific results in the area of disarmament and defence conversion.
Just as the EU and OSCE need each other in this area, the issues of climate protection and energy supply also require enhanced structured cooperation.
