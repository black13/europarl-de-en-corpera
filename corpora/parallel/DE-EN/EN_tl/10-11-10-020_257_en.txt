Mr President, Taiwan is on the positive list.
In other words, the people of Taiwan are permitted to travel to the European Union without a visa.
I am pleased for these people.
However, politics is a question of give and take.
I would have liked Taiwan, in return, to immediately grant visa-free entry to all citizens of the European Union, too.
As yet, however, that has not happened.
Taiwan has merely declared its intention to implement this by the end of the year.
I hope that this declaration of intent will also be followed by action.
For the rest, I have confidence in our rapporteur, who has raised the prospect of this, and I will vote in favour of this motion as a whole.
As I said, I hope that Taiwan will also resolve the problems and thereby also allow all EU citizens to travel to Taiwan without the need for a visa.
