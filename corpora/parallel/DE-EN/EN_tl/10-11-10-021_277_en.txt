Mr President, the G20 summit will begin tomorrow in Seoul.
The topics that will be discussed at this summit include one that is of particular importance: the limitation of exports of rare earths by the People's Republic of China.
China controls 95% of the extraction of rare earths, which are desperately needed by European industry.
The sectors most affected are the knowledge-intensive sectors dealing with the development of new technologies.
The fact that small and medium-sized European enterprises are being put at serious risk as a result of artificial supply bottlenecks is a serious problem.
The European Economic Area is world renowned for its technological expertise.
Putting up with interruptions in this area is not acceptable.
I therefore call on the representatives of the European Union, together with the other states affected, such as the United States and Japan, to speak out against China's trade despotism at the G20 summit.
A solution must be found to this as quickly as possible.
