Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Mann, on his excellent report.
I think that justice between generations is an important characteristic of a developed society.
Essentially, this merely means that no generation must, or should, live at the expense of another.
What is logical and self-evident in people's private lives and in the family is harder to represent in society.
If the state accepts credit that it cannot repay, it is burdening the next generation.
Anyone who over-exploits raw materials is harming the next generation.
The saying that we have only borrowed the Earth from our grandchildren is perhaps the best way to bring this conflict home.
For me, this means that we must examine every act, every regulation and every directive to ensure that they provide for justice between generations.
In my opinion, this report is an important step in the right direction.
