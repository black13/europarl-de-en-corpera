The report by Mr Mann clearly reveals problems to which we ought to pay greater attention.
Far-reaching changes to the structure of the European population are currently becoming apparent.
Thus, the birth rate throughout the EU is currently 1.5 children per woman.
This is something that we must pay due attention to in our policies.
On the one hand, we need to highlight the importance of traineeships and jobs for young people.
The call for a European Youth Guarantee, whereby young people, after a maximum period of four months' unemployment, are to be offered a job, an apprenticeship or other training opportunity, is an interesting proposal that we need to look at in more detail.
On the other hand, reference must be made to the importance of 'active ageing' and justice between the generations.
We need to bring about change in this area in the future, too.
I support Mr Mann's report.
