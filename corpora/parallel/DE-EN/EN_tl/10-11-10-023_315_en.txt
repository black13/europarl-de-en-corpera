In today's knowledge-based society, expertise has a key role to play, particularly in view of the deepest economic crisis in recent history.
Research, development and innovation are extremely important in order to maintain Europe's position as a global economic player as well as its competitiveness.
European initiatives for public funding of research programmes are still too bureaucratic and associated with high administrative costs.
Simplification of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), currently the largest publicly funded programme for research and technological development, is therefore essential in order to create sufficient incentive for scientific research.
The research funding should be more trust-based and also more risk-tolerant towards participants in order to allow even projects with a higher risk potential to still seem attractive and to enable the pursuit of cutting edge research.
