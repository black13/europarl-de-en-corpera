Mr President, it is true that the error rate in the area of cohesion has fallen significantly from 54% in 2007 to 36% in 2009.
That is correct.
It is a fact, and even I have to acknowledge that.
However, as the rapporteur has already said, if you look more closely at how these figures have been produced, it is obvious that they must be seen in relative terms.
It is also a fact that, according to this report from the Court of Auditors, the control systems in the area of cohesion are not effective.
In addition, it is a fact that at least 3% of the money should not have been paid out at all.
This means that there is still a great deal for Mr Hahn to do, among others, to put this portfolio in order.
In my opinion, the increase in the error rates in the area of agriculture is obviously a retrograde step.
Furthermore, wastefulness, in cases for example, where subsidies for miners are paid to billionaires, is not counted as an error.
I have already mentioned in the committee that I have not received an answer either from the Court of Auditors or from the Commission with regard to the social security benefits which have been paid twice.
Once again, my question is: Who made the error in this case?
Will the money be paid back and how big is the amount involved?
Finally, I would like to say that it is important in future for the Court of Auditors not only to check that payments are being made legally, but also to ensure that they are cost-effective and efficient.
