Madam President, I would like to ask Mr van Dalen whether he is aware that the high percentages refer only to the percentage of the sample.
In other words, it is not 36% of the payments that are in error, but 36% of the payments in the sample.
If this is extrapolated up, the result is at least 5% in the case of the Cohesion Fund.
Therefore, the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts.
Were you aware of this?
