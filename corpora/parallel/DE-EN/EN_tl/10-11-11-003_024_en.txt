Madam President, estimates provided by the European Court of Auditors show that EUR 6 million disappeared from the European budget in 2009 as a result of carelessness, mismanagement, fraud, ignorance and a lack of checks.
The Court of Auditors has revealed the scandalous fact that around 40% of EU officials are receiving double the normal amount of family benefits.
Greece is once again causing problems.
It has not only been bailed out by other Member States with a rescue package amounting to billions of euro, but is also the front-runner when it comes to subsidy fraud.
You only need to look at the wooded areas for which Greece has claimed subsidies for green spaces to see the sheer audacity of its behaviour.
Of course, the situation is particularly bad when it comes to the regional subsidies.
As the previous speaker has said, if 36% of the payments that were checked were made in error, that is bad enough.
This is why we are calling on Mr Hahn to take drastic measures with regard to his very important portfolio.
We do not have money to give away.
Finally, I would like to compliment the committed employees of the Court of Auditors.
They are highly motivated and we politicians should be encouraging them to make even more careful checks.
As politicians, we are in a position to draw up and implement guidelines.
