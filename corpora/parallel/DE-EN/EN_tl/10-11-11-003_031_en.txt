Madam President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, cohesion policy is the sick man of the EU budget.
Last year, he was in intensive care and this year he is convalescing.
However, he is far from making a full recovery and he could have a relapse at any time.
More than 5% of all the cohesion policy payments were in error and 3% should not have been made at all.
This amounts to around EUR 700 million.
A large proportion of these erroneous payments could have been prevented by the Member States.
The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding, despite the existing control systems, which have been approved by the Commission.
We need to take another careful look at these control systems.
In my home country of Germany, the samples showed that all the control systems there which had been tested were only partially effective.
The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission.
We can discuss this contradiction - errors in the Member States which are the responsibility of the Commission - in our home countries, we can explain it to the media and we can tell our citizens about it.
However, in political terms, it is the job of the Commission to resolve this problem in the Member States.
Mr Šemeta, you need to take control in this area and you will have our support for doing so.
