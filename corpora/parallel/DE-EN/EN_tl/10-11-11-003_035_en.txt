Madam President, I would like to offer my very sincere thanks to the Court of Auditors.
This report is an impressive demonstration of the fact that the controls are constantly improving.
I am not necessarily concerned by the error rates that have been highlighted, because I believe that the auditing process is a learning system.
It involves looking more and more closely at the problems and, thank goodness, discovering an increasing number of errors.
Our task is to work together to avoid these errors occurring in future.
Therefore, I would like to draw everyone's attention once again to the Fifth Cohesion Report which was presented yesterday.
The Commission is inviting everyone involved to express their opinions about the questions raised in this document.
This represents a major opportunity to lay the foundations for future subsidy arrangements which will ensure, on the one hand, that subsidies in this area are easier to obtain, that access is simplified and red tape reduced, and that, on the other, the necessary strict controls are in place to protect the taxpayers' money which is being used.
Therefore, I am calling on everyone involved to comply with this request from the Commission.
We in Parliament will, of course, do so.
