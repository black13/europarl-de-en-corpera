Madam President, Mr Oettinger, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Brempt's report, I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report.
We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include.
This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved.
However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt.
This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject.
Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt.
We are very concerned about this.
It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas.
We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued.
We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so.
This is where the budget needs to be more flexible.
