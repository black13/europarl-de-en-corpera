Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, funding has been available, which should have been invested in the energy sector, among other areas.
We have discussed this in great detail in the committee and we were not sure whether all the money could be spent.
At that time, the Commissioner promised us that he would guarantee that none of the money would be left over or returned to where it came from.
The most important thing for me is that the Commissioner has kept his word.
He submitted a document to us fairly quickly which allowed us to ensure that the funding that otherwise would have been lost could be used for the energy sector.
This was the first step.
The second step was that Mrs Van Brempt managed to guide the members of the committee towards a solution and a compromise.
She deserves our thanks for this.
This was not easy, because it is simpler just to push through your own view, rather than finding a solution.
This ultimately ensured, since we were also under time pressure, that the funding could be made available and could be used.
Last but not least, we finally succeeded, with the help of the Council, and we must admit this in all honesty, in finding a compromise that allowed us to secure all the funding for the energy sector down almost to the last euro within the specified time and, as a result, to make sure that the funding was not lost.
That was the most important thing for me and the most productive outcome and, therefore, I would like to thank everyone involved.
