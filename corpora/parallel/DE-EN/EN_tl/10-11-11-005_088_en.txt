Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today's motion for a resolution will help to set the European livestock sector on the right course.
I would like to thank Mrs García for this initiative.
The objective of the motion is not to cut Europe off from the rest of the world or to override the rules of the market.
Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry, which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in future.
We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to provide one certificate of competence after another, while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards.
Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products.
Therefore, I am grateful to all the 534 Members of this House who voted in Strasbourg in favour of requiring agricultural imports to comply with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards in future.
Mr Cioloş, Parliament is ready to give you its full support.
These standards must be applied to imports and this is why my group welcomes and supports this motion.
