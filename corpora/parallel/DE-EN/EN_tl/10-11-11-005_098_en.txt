Madam President, Mr Cioloş, there is no question that the crisis must be resolved.
However, this motion proposes solutions which we cannot support.
Making the import of GM soya easier will not help to resolve the crisis in the livestock sector.
On the contrary, we must begin to redevelop our own source of plant protein in Europe.
Around 75% of our plant protein is imported.
This is not acceptable and we need to introduce urgent changes.
I also do not understand why many people are questioning the compromise which has been negotiated by all the groups and why they want to open the door to GM soya imports.
That is not a solution.
We also need to discuss what type of livestock farming we want in Europe.
Once again, the small farms have been hit hardest by the crisis.
On the other hand, industrial-scale livestock farming is developing in Europe which is not livestock friendly and which is not fair in agricultural terms.
We ultimately need to do something in this area as well.
My final point is that I am very surprised that EUR 450 million from the agriculture budget is being transferred to the ITER nuclear fusion project.
I would like Mr Cioloş to explain what we should think about this.
