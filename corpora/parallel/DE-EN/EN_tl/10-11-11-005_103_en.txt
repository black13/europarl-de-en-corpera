Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs García very much for this initiative and I would also like to refer specifically to the situation of livestock farming in mountain areas.
In many regions of the European Union, there are agricultural alternatives to livestock farming, but this is generally not the case in mountain regions.
If there were to be no grazing stock in the mountains, then many of the agricultural areas there would simply be useless and would be abandoned.
This would not only restrict the business opportunities in mountain regions, but would also change the landscape and eventually reduce biodiversity.
The dairy sector plays a special role in this respect, because it creates jobs and generates income in mountain regions and in other areas.
This is why I believe that we must focus specifically on three issues in the reform of agricultural policy.
We need a common agricultural policy (CAP) which takes into account livestock farming in mountain regions and provides subsidies to livestock farmers there.
Secondly, we need a flexible second pillar of the CAP which makes it possible to provide special support for livestock farms in mountain areas.
Thirdly, we need a quality policy which focuses, in particular, on products from mountain regions and which provides options for special labelling, so that added value can be obtained on the market for these products from the livestock sector in mountain areas.
