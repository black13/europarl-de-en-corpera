Mr President, I and my group welcome the fact that the citizens of Taiwan can now travel freely to the European Union.
However, as far as I am aware, none of the EU Member States has recognised Taiwan.
Nevertheless, I am not opposed to the visa liberalisation and I think it is a good thing that Taiwanese people can visit the EU without needing a visa.
However, what is happening about Europe's newest state, Kosovo?
A total of 22 EU Member States have recognised Kosovo and only five have not done so, but the discussion on visas with Kosovo has not even started.
The Commission has still not got under way with this.
I hope that Mrs Malmstr√∂m will finally begin a discussion on visas with Kosovo in order to make it clear that the citizens of Europe's newest state can travel just as freely as the citizens of Taiwan.
