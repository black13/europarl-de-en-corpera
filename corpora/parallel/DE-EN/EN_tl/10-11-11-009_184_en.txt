The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) receives annual funding of EUR 500 million with the aim of providing financial support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns.
Estimates indicate that between 35 000 and 50 000 employees could benefit from this support each year.
The money can be used to pay for help in finding new jobs, tailor-made training, assistance in becoming self-employed or starting up a company, mobility and support for disadvantaged or older workers.
In order for the employees of a company to receive this support, at least 500 workers must have been made redundant within a period of four months.
Therefore, the Irish company SR Technics Ireland Ltd is fully entitled to funding, because it has made 1 135 people redundant.
I am voting in favour of the report, because SR Technics Ireland meets all the requirements for receiving support.
