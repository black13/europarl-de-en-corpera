in writing. - The Polish citizen and Member of the European Parliament, Krzysztof Lisek, has been accused of three crimes by the district prosecutor in Koszalin in Poland.
These are financial offences which are illegal under Polish law.
In order to allow the case against Mr Lisek to be investigated under Polish law, a request for a waiver of his immunity has been made.
As current European Union law clearly states how the immunity of Members of the European Parliament and waivers of immunity are to be handled, there must be a vote.
I vote in favour of lifting Mr Lisek's immunity, firstly, because it will help him, and secondly, because this is the only way in which he can respond to the accusations made against him in his home country.
