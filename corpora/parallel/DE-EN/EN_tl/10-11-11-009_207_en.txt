Investment funds help to finance the European economy.
However, the systemic risks involved in the different types of funds, such as private equity, real estate and commodity funds, are, of course, different.
The stricter regulations which are being introduced in the financial sector as a result of the banking and financial crisis must cover all types of financial instruments.
On the one hand, it is important to reduce the risk of losses and to minimise the potential for faulty decision making at a management level.
On the other hand, this must not result in the introduction of unnecessary red tape.
We also need regulations on short selling, because this played a role in the financial crisis.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report.
