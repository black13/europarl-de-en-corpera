When it comes to visas from third countries with a visa requirement, it is essential for each individual case to be examined.
In the past, visas were frequently sold.
It is important that we stop these scandals and ensure that the Schengen rules are followed.
The principle of reciprocity should apply to visa requirements, but the example of the USA, which openly uses visa requirements as a threat during negotiations, shows that this is not always the case.
It is also important to distinguish between the different third countries.
Taiwan is a special case.
Until now, it has had relatively good economic growth, which leads the EU to assume that there is a low risk of illegal immigration.
However, I cannot support putting people without a permanent residence in Taiwan, who do not have identity documents, on an equal footing.
It is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of this report.
