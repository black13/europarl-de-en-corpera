In recent years, fundamental rights have increasingly been curtailed as part of the so-called war on terror.
The rationale behind this is extremely questionable.
While passengers are searched almost down to their underwear and are not allowed to carry nail files or deodorant in their luggage, checks on freight are often left to the shipping companies themselves.
If this is to change in future, it is important that the balance between freedom and security is preserved.
In the case of passenger security checks, this balance has already been lost and, therefore, as the hysteria surrounding terrorism subsides, the regulations will once again be relaxed.
Just as questionable is the issue of whether the FBI needs to know the name, address, e-mail address, credit card number and number of suitcases of people travelling to the USA and whether it should be permitted to store this data for up to 15 years.
The information should only need to be kept in a few exceptional cases.
If fundamental rights are infringed in order to create a sense of security, the infringement must be as limited as possible and the rights of those affected must be reinforced.
Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen at the moment and, therefore, I have voted against the motion.
