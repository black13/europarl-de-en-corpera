On 21 September 2010, the European Commission presented its global approach to transfers of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries.
The purpose of transferring and processing data, such as ticket information, seat number, luggage details, route and payment type, is to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences, including terrorism, within the framework of police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters.
This 'global approach' is intended to act as a guideline for future negotiations with third countries.
Negotiations with the USA, Canada and Australia will be opened shortly and other states have expressed similar intentions.
The European Parliament's motion for a resolution confirms once again the importance of the principle of proportionality.
The needs of security and freedom are in a delicate balance.
We are calling on the Commission to provide factual evidence that the collection, storage and processing of PNR data is necessary for each of the stated purposes and to carry out an adequate investigation into possible alternatives.
The European Parliament maintains its position that PNR data must not, under any circumstances, be used for data mining or profiling.
