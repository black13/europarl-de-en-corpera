The Innovation Union is an innovation strategy which is being promoted at the highest political level.
It is one of the central initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
The idea behind it is to enable us to meet future challenges, such as climate change, energy and food security, health and an ageing population, in an appropriate way and to raise them to a transnational level.
The result will be to allow blockages caused by financing problems, fragmented research systems and markets, inadequate support for innovation in public contracts and slow standardisation to be managed more effectively.
I have voted in favour of the resolution because a joint concept, such as that of innovative partnerships, will bring benefits for every Member State.
