For some years, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was founded during the cold war as an institution for monitoring and confidence building purposes, has been undergoing an identity crisis.
According to critics, the organisation is not equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century, such as the global financial crisis and environmental issues, including climate change.
In theory, the three main players in the OSCE are the USA, Russia and the EU.
Even though the situation has improved slightly under the influence of the new president, American foreign policy has very little interest in multilateral organisations.
Russia appears to have equally little interest and sees the expansion of the EU and NATO as an intrusion in its historic sphere of influence.
As a result, it is understandable that Moscow is calling for the OSCE to take a new direction and to shift its focus from human rights and the process of democratisation to establishing a European security structure.
Russia is essential to the EU, not only because of its supply of energy, but also as a strategic partner.
If the EU wants to change its role in the OSCE, it must become a counterpole to the USA, rather than a powerless paymaster.
Ultimately, a sensitive approach will be needed not only in relation to Russia, but in relation to all the Eurasian states which are represented in the OSCE but who are not members of the EU.
As the report takes this into account, I have voted in favour of it.
