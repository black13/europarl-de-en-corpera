The principle of justice between the generations will be one of the main political challenges of the next few years.
As demographic change is influencing relationships in our society, it is particularly important that one generation is not living at the expense of another.
This not only applies to financial and budgetary policy, but also includes protecting the environment, the available resources and the climate.
In order to ensure that our society remains cohesive, we must see justice between the generations as a mainstream task.
As a result, we must examine all our political decisions in this light.
It is important that we devote our attention to this subject in order to maintain the sense of solidarity within our society in future.
