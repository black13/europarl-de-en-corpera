I have voted in favour of the report on the demographic challenge, but against the paragraph which calls on the Member States 'to give consideration to regulated labour migration (immigration from third countries into the EU)'.
In my opinion, this wording implies a positive assessment of labour migration from third countries.
I have voted in favour of the Mann report because the recommendation to change the way in which pensions are financed in the original report was not adopted by the European Parliament.
However, I very much oppose the requirement to encourage private pension provision and to ensure that, on average, public sector pensions are no more generous than comparable private sector pensions.
In addition, I am opposed to private sector pension funds playing a more important role in diminishing the future burden of providing state pensions.
In my opinion, the pay-as-you-go system is the most economically sensible and sustainable system.
