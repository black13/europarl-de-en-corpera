The European Union is faced with an increasingly ageing population.
By 2060, there will be only two adults of working age for every one person over the age of 65.
Currently, the ratio is 4:1.
As a result, the older generation could become a major burden on the working population which is responsible for supporting the economy.
As it is to be expected that the retirement age will be increased, working conditions for older people should be adapted and made more attractive.
Older employees should be given better opportunities for participating in the labour market.
A new approach is also needed in society to ensure that older people are no longer discriminated against because of their reduced capabilities, for example.
I am abstaining, because although the proposals concerning healthy ageing are very much to be welcomed, there are still some unclear areas relating to the issue of a longer working life.
