I have voted in favour of the report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between the generations, because the recommendation to change the way in which pensions are financed in the original report was not adopted by the European Parliament.
I am very much opposed to the requirement to encourage private pension provision and to ensure that, on average, public sector pensions are no more generous, both in terms of contributions and benefits, than comparable private sector pensions.
In addition, private sector pension funds should not play a more important role in diminishing the future burden of providing state pensions.
The pay-as-you-go system must not, under any circumstances, be replaced by capital-funded systems.
In my opinion, the pay-as-you-go system is the most economically sensible and sustainable system.
However, I have voted against the passage in the resolution which calls on the Member States 'to give consideration to regulated labour migration (immigration from third countries into the EU)'.
In my opinion, this wording implies a positive assessment of labour migration from third countries.
