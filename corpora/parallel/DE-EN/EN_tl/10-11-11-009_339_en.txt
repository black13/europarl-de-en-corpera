As always, Mr Mann has done a very good job on a sensitive subject.
As a result, I was able to vote in favour of the report.
I would like briefly to add another aspect to the discussion.
As a Member of the European Parliament from Saxony, a region which is hard hit by demographic change, and as a Member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and rapporteur of the own-initiative report on future innovation policy in the EU, I would like to say that at EU level and, above all, in the Member States, we must, of course, continue to combat demographic change and make the regions more attractive for young people, in particular, by increasing economic growth, creating jobs and developing a tailor-made education policy.
However, I would also like to emphasise the special importance of older workers in SMEs with regard to innovation.
The EU has finally recognised that, in particular in SMEs, it is not only new technological inventions which are innovative, but also, for example, the ability to adapt a product to meet a customer's specific circumstances or improve service processes.
Particularly in this area, it is older employees who have a wealth of experience and can make a company innovative.
For this reason, we must combat age discrimination in the workplace.
The EU and the Member States must take this into consideration in all their social and labour legislation.
