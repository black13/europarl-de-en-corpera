During the economic crisis which developed out of the financial crisis, between EUR 4 billion and EUR 5 billion from the EU budget was redeployed to energy projects from other subsidy funds which still had money available in order to aid the recovery of the economy.
As the Commission explained in its presentation of the 2020 energy strategy, an investment of EUR 1 trillion is needed to develop the outdated power grid in Europe over the next few years.
It is to be expected that consumers will have to pay the cost of this, rather than the energy sector.
An important factor in this respect will be energy research, providing that it focuses on the genuinely more cost-effective technologies.
We must bring an end to the emphasis on nuclear power which, in addition to posing the risk of environmental catastrophes, is by no means cost-effective when the cost of expensive terminal storage, a problem which has not yet been resolved, is included.
We must devote our attention to green technologies.
I have voted in favour of the report.
