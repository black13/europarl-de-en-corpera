I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her many-faceted and highly successful report.
She highlights a number of areas for improvement with regard to simplifying the administrative processes.
I was happy to vote in favour of this report.
I would like to add one brief point which I often hear about from small and medium-sized companies in the area which I represent, and that is the language issue.
Many companies which are entitled to apply for European subsidies and whose ideas will bring added value on a European scale do not have the necessary language skills to go through the application process in English.
In the Seventh Framework Programme guidelines, under the heading 'Tips for a successful application' the following text appears: 'Although it is possible to submit an application in any of the official EU languages, applications should always be submitted in English'.
This means that a project with an application which is not in English does not have a chance, even if, for example, the common working language of the group of companies in question is not English.
In order to reduce the administrative work involved for the companies at which these subsidy programmes are aimed, the EU Commission should change the way in which the project applications are examined by their experts, so that at least during the initial stage, the project documentation can be submitted in one of the Commission's three working languages.
