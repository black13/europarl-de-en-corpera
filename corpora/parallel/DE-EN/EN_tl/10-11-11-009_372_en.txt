Many livestock farms in the European Union are in a difficult situation.
This is primarily due to a considerable increase in the price of cereals and, consequently, of feedstuffs.
For this reason, it is important for us to take measures which will help livestock farmers to emerge from this difficult period in a stronger position.
In addition to the rise in the feed price, two points are particularly important to me.
The first is that the high European product and safety standards which our livestock farms have to comply with must be applied to imported products that are sold in the European Union.
This would help to ensure that European farmers are not at a major competitive disadvantage to producers in third countries and, at the same time, would guarantee that all the products sold in the European Union are of high quality.
The second point is about making agricultural policy simpler and more transparent.
Unnecessary regulations take up a lot of time and cost a lot of money.
Therefore, it is important that they are removed.
This would really make life easier for all the farms within the European Union.
The motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development includes a number of good proposals of this kind which will bring about a permanent improvement in the situation of livestock farms.
I am expecting to see these reflected in the Commission's future activities.
