I am disappointed that Amendments 1 and 2 were adopted by a majority in Parliament.
Despite the self-inflicted interruption in supplies, we must not allow our agricultural industry to be contaminated with GMOs.
The acceptance of unauthorised GMOs and the establishment of a threshold 'for adventitious GMOs which are not yet authorised in the European Union', and which have not yet undergone full scientific testing, have resulted in a flood of authorisations of GMOs in the USA and, in particular, in developing countries.
On account of the testing capacity in these countries, this leads to an increased risk of damage to health and the environment.
Countries outside the EU now have an increasing influence over authorisation practices within the EU, with the result being an ongoing decline in the health and environmental safety levels of authorised GMOs.
In addition, with regard to Amendment 3 that has been adopted, I am not of the opinion that the current ban on meat and bone meal for non-ruminants should be reviewed.
This would increase not only the potential risk presented by genetic engineering in agriculture, but also the potential risk of a new outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
However, I believe that this report plays a useful overall role in highlighting the crisis in the livestock sector within the EU.
