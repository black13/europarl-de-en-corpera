The current situation in the livestock sector is very difficult and some areas are unprofitable because of the high production costs.
On the one hand, farmers are being paid lower prices by consumers, while on the other, they are faced with major fluctuations in feed prices.
It is important for us to prevent a serious crisis occurring in the livestock sector by making immediate use of the available instruments to stabilise the market.
Another factor which has an impact on European farmers is the growing competition from third countries where production costs are lower and the increasing tendency in trade policy to exchange larger quantities of food imports for services, without at least requiring the same production standards.
I support the resolution which calls for specific measures to be taken on behalf of the livestock sector.
I would like to thank Mrs Herranz for her initiative.
Against the background of the difficult market situation and the discussion which has been initiated about the future of agricultural policy in the EU, Parliament needs to make a clear commitment to giving all areas of agricultural production the necessary security to allow them to plan for the future.
