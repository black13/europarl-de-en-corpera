The crisis in the livestock sector is not only the result of rising production costs.
A modern society requires healthy food and high standards of hygiene and animal welfare which can be found in small-scale farming businesses and organic farms.
These cause an increase in production costs and consumers then choose cheaper products.
While our domestic farmers are subject to strict regulations, it is difficult to monitor the standards which apply to cheap agricultural imports.
This is why we need fair prices and a change in the agricultural subsidy system.
We must move away from supporting multinational agribusinesses and large-scale hobby farmers like the Queen and instead support small farmers who can only survive by running their farms on a part-time basis alongside another job.
This report does not deal with this problem in sufficient detail and, therefore, I have abstained.
