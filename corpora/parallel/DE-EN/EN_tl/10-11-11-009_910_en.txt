There is a need to maintain a balance between the three dimensions of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
In any case, security threats must be tackled across all three dimensions.
This also applies to current threats such as organised crime, terrorism, cyber threats, human and drug trafficking, energy security, as well as activities relating to early warning mechanisms and conflict prevention and resolution.
It is both sensible and beneficial to reinforce the interaction and promote the synergy between the EU and the OSCE.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.
