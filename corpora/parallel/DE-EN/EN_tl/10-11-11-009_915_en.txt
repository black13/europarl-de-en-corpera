The benefit of the new concept of innovation partnerships lies in the clear-cut scope and spheres of responsibility for the various partners involved.
It also includes precise deadlines for the implementation of individual projects, together with measurable and achievable targets.
In addition, it offers simplified administrative procedures for implementing projects and improving the dissemination of research findings.
Therefore, I have voted in favour of this report.
