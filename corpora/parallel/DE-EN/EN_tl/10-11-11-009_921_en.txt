It is true that evaluating and processing Passenger Name Record (PNR) data at an international level can help in combating terrorism and organised crime.
However, agreements of this kind often cause problems with regard to data protection.
Therefore, the European Parliament must take a consistent approach on this issue (in a similar way as in the case of SWIFT), in order to protect the fundamental rights of EU citizens.
There are currently a number of regulations governing the transfer of PNR data to third countries with which the EU has concluded agreements.
The more countries which demand this data, the greater the risk that the different systems will have a negative impact on legal clarity, the protection of personal data and the costs for airlines.
Therefore, the EU must put in place uniformly high security standards, which will guarantee a coherent approach in future.
This is what I expect from an efficient EU foreign policy strategy for the transfer of PNR data.
This motion for a resolution does not guarantee this and I have therefore voted against it.
