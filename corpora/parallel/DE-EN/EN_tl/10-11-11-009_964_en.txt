Alternative investment fund managers, who manage around USD 1 000 billion of assets, play an important role in financing the European economy.
This sector is made up of a wide variety of actors and financial products, including alternative funds, private equity funds and real estate funds.
It is important to take into account, in particular, the special systemic risks of private equity funds.
The management of these funds should not be exempt from the regulations governing the entire financial services sector.
The current financial crisis shows that the malfunctioning of the global financial system is partly due to key operators in the system being overly exposed to risk and partly due to weaknesses in the systems for managing these risks.
The Commission's proposal and the report seek to achieve greater stability in the financial system and to increase the protection for investors.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report.
