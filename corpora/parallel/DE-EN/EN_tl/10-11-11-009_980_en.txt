The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has recently demonstrated on more than one occasion that it is a useful tool for combating unemployment, which is one of the frequent side-effects of globalisation.
The EGF can be used to finance job creation measures, retraining programmes and workshops to support business start-ups.
For these and other reasons, I wholeheartedly support Mrs Matera's report.
To ensure that the money can also be used effectively, it must be carefully targeted and must reach its destination quickly.
We must give priority to aid for European citizens and we must always keep this in mind.
