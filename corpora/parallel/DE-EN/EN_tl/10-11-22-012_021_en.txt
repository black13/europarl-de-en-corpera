Mr President, on the agenda for Tuesday, there are six reports by Mrs Matera concerning mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the Netherlands.
I am taking the floor on this because I think that the way Mr Daul has been attacked on this matter in the Dutch press is not right.
At the Conference of Presidents, Mr Daul raised the question that had been discussed by the heads of the various groups concerning whether these reports should not be dropped in the light of the budget debate.
I would like to make two comments on this.
Firstly, we should leave these reports on the agenda.
We should also vote them through and transfer this money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to the Netherlands.
Secondly, however, Mr Daul suggested it in a comment made at the Conference of Presidents.
If it is then taken from the Conference of Presidents into the public domain without him even being given an opportunity to answer questions and explain it himself, then, as the chair of a group, one has to consider very carefully what in fact one can say at the Conference of Presidents.
That is the first point.
My other point is that it is not the European Parliament that is claiming that money is being squandered here.
It is an element of the Dutch Government - not all of it - that is constantly claiming that money is being squandered in Europe and therefore Europe should get less money.
The Matera reports show that, on the contrary, money from this budget is being used very responsibly and - in my opinion - for very important projects in the Netherlands.
Consequently, adopting these reports would show that the criticism in the Netherlands in respect of this budget is not justified.
(Applause)
