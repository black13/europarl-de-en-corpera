Mr President, I must ask Mr Ferreira to pay attention for a moment.
We discussed this topic in great depth at the Conference of Presidents and during the preparations for the Conference of Presidents.
On behalf of my group, I would like to say that we are very concerned about what is going on in the Western Sahara.
If the pictures that we have seen are accurate, then this must give rise not just to serious debate, but also, if necessary, to consequences.
This means that we must proceed properly, however.
Proceeding properly includes discussing the events this week.
At our request, the Moroccan foreign minister has now stated that he is prepared to attend a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
He does not have to do that.
The Moroccan foreign minister does not have to appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament.
As far as I am concerned, we should take advantage of the fact that he is doing so in any case to first confront him with the reproaches made, and only then adopt a resolution.
I believe that is a much more proper way to proceed, rather than adopting a resolution now and then listening to what he has to say afterwards.
Let us adopt the resolution in the light of the information and the questions that we will have the opportunity to ask the Moroccan foreign minister in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I personally consider that a more proper way to proceed.
Moreover, until this afternoon there was consensus on that among all the groups.
