Madam President, Mr Trichet, we all know that the main task of the European Central Bank is to ensure monetary stability and that you can best achieve this aim by being politically independent.
We have always supported you in this.
The crises of the last two years have shown that you have a further task, and that is to ensure the stability of the financial markets and of the financial system.
This task, too, you have performed very professionally and convincingly.
However, to do so, you have had to accept being yoked together with the governments concerned.
In other words, you were not able to act with complete political independence here; instead, you had to work together with the governments.
I would be interested to know how exactly you would like to arrange this role in the future to ensure firstly, that you are independent, and secondly, that you can continue to perform this task properly without governments exploiting this opportunity to in fact undermine your independence.
