Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to the rapporteurs.
In view of the high level of imports of fish and fish products into the EU, it is essential that we maintain and support our local fishermen, as well as the domestic aquaculture sector.
We urgently need improved catch methods in order to secure the long-term livelihood of both our seas and our fishermen.
It is equally essential that we enable aquaculture to expand further.
We are in urgent need of more effective data collection and more intensive research, since only once we know what is actually going on will we be able to make the right decisions for the future.
Our lack of success in combining economics with ecology - which are not actually that different - is often down to excessive bureaucracy and insufficient knowledge.
