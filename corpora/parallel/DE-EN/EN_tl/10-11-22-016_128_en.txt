Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, I am very pleased that this week, we are able to adopt four important regulations on fisheries policy, and that we have been able to reach agreement among ourselves as well as with the Council and Commission on the reports concerning aquaculture and technical measures in the Baltic Sea.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the two regulations on long-term management plans.
The right formula for management of sardine stocks has always been subject to considerable argument among the committee.
I believe that the submission to plenary looks very good and I am pleased that it seems that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has also now realised this, as it has tabled no more amendments.
I assume that you will be voting in favour tomorrow.
We have a much more serious problem where the Council is concerned, however.
Contrary to the advice of their own legal experts, the majority of the Member States are refusing to accept the European Parliament's right of codecision - a full year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon!
I consider that outrageous.
I have therefore suggested to the chair of our committee that a joint letter be written to the European fisheries ministers.
I would be pleased if we could reach agreement in the coming days so that together, we can demonstrate how determined Parliament is.
We will not allow ourselves to be fobbed off by the Council so easily.
