Madam President, the wellbeing of patients is key here.
In order to cover themselves, pharmaceutical companies often include every minor side effect in package leaflets, which, of course, complicates matters greatly.
Confused patients tend to change the dose on their own initiative or to discontinue the medication.
Moreover, the flood of information via the Internet, some of which is reliable and some not, adds greatly to the confusion and uncertainty.
Certified websites are a step in the right direction, but are not yet enough.
A further priority is to make the information comprehensible even to those without medical or pharmaceutical qualifications.
The package leaflet must be unmistakable and legible.
The font size should be increased, particularly for older people.
I regret to say that there are third countries that are profiting from the high level of protection in the European pharmaceutical sector.
Both original and fake medicines are thus freely available in large quantities in Turkish bazaars.
We therefore also need to impose obligations on these third countries in order to put an end to this black market entirely.
