Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his address, Commissioner Dalli himself said that we must focus on the patient.
Although the original proposal from the Commission tended rather to put the market at the centre, we have now succeeded - through a wide range of amendments that were adopted with a large majority - in putting people at the centre instead, thereby taking into account what Commissioner Dalli said.
The right of the patient to high quality non-promotional information on the benefits and risks of prescription-only medicines was urgently needed.
We need this regulation.
I myself come from the world of advertising - my professional background is in advertising and PR - and I know that advertising has one aim, and that is to sell.
Our task, however, is to provide information.
I believe that the present report and the corresponding amendments give due consideration to our responsibility to provide information.
Commissioner, since the costs of medicines make up a large proportion of healthcare spending, I urge you to work to ensure that patients are well informed and continue to pursue and focus on your initiatives, prevention and health promotion.
Together, we will then be successful.
