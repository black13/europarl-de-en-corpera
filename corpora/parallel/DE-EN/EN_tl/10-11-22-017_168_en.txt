Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, and his shadow rapporteurs.
Under difficult conditions, and despite battling against a severe headwind, a very good result has genuinely been achieved with this report.
The Commission proposal has been improved considerably.
A strict ban on advertising remains: there will be no information on the radio, television or in magazines; instead, patients must actively seek out the information.
I base my position on the idea that patients are responsible people.
They want to be informed, and I would very much like to help them achieve that.
I therefore also want the patient to be at the centre of the information.
I would like to focus on two key points.
I myself have said in no uncertain terms - including in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - that I would like to see health portals on the Internet and similar information in printed media.
Our citizens often look things up on the Internet, where they often come across poor and uncontrolled information.
We must therefore counter this with an alternative: controlled information.
Pharmacovigilance was a first success, with the adoption of drug safety portals that included the package leaflets and information on the medicines.
However, I would like to go beyond this, Commissioner, and would have liked to have seen comprehensive Internet portals that also provide information on illnesses and prevention.
If I have understood you correctly, you support this in principle, but perhaps have not said so in this dossier.
I would like the Commissioner to make a clear statement as to whether he also supports this.
I consider this to be a very, very important matter.
