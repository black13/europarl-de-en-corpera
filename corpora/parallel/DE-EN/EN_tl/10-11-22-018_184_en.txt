Madam President, I hope that our Commissioner gets his voice back again, because we need a voice at the climate conference in Canc√∫n.
I had been rather surprised that Mrs Damanaki was speaking here on the revision of the hazardous substances directive after also speaking on the fisheries revisions; thank you for stepping into the breach.
Parliament has not got everything that it wanted.
Annex 3 has been dropped, which we regret.
However, we will continue to keep an eye on these substances and when the revision takes place in three years' time, you will have to come back to this House with your impact assessments and provide evidence of the problems that exist there on a substance-by-substance basis.
We also have a considerable number of exemptions, so that it rather resembles a Swiss cheese.
We also need to check here the gaps and shortcomings that exist as regards human health and the environment.
I will simply say that solar panels were highly controversial.
We want to keep cadmium out of the environment, but these panels put 100 000 tonnes of cadmium into the environment.
That is something we will have to watch carefully.
I am pleased that the Commission has made some concessions with its four statements, so for now, we will take what progress has been made in 2010 and we will meet again in three years' time for the revision.
Naturally, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs.
