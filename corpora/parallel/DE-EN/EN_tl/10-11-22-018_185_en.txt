Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we have before us legislation that has come about surprisingly quickly.
I am very surprised that we have reached a compromise already which I and my group - and I expressly underline that - consider acceptable.
When all is said and done, this piece of legislation has had a very difficult passage through Parliament.
We expanded its scope, only to restrict it again straight away.
We have quite incidentally attempted to declare certain substances highly dangerous; perhaps we should ask ourselves whether this legislation is really the right forum for such a debate.
Personally, I did not think it a good idea to include PVC and nanomaterials in a directive on 'hazardous substances'.
I therefore think it sensible that this is no longer the case in the compromise.
The previous speaker has just said so already, but it really is remarkable that we consider each gram of polluting substances so carefully and are then sometimes very irrational in our debates.
Apparently, there are industries in Europe which we are ring-fencing for political reasons.
This seems to be the case for enterprises in the renewable energy sector.
The fact that we instantly exempt them completely from the scope of this legislation by saying that we have to put up with environmental pollution for the sake of climate protection and our objectives in the area of renewable energy is incomprehensible.
It does not add up.
I only hope that we do not do the same thing in the case of electronic waste - the decision on which is also imminent here - because that would be even more astonishing.
