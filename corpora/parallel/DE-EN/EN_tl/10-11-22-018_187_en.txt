Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, who has done a good job and salvaged what was possible in the face of great resistance from the Council and the majority here in Parliament.
One major success of the new version is the open scope.
This approach is exemplary and I am pleased that we were able to agree on it.
On the negative side is the fact that the list of six substances that were already banned has not been expanded to include substances such as chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, phthalates and PVC.
Although there is sufficient evidence of the risk to health that these substances present, they will not be banned in 2011 when the new version is in force.
Certain leading electronics manufacturers have been placing products such as mobile phones, televisions and laptops that do not contain these pollutants on the market on a voluntary basis for a number of years, and without any great increase in costs.
We have passed up a great opportunity here to make the growing electrical and electronics industry a little more environmentally friendly.
Leading manufacturers are showing us the way.
Instead of supporting these manufacturers with good initiatives, however, the EU is behind the times.
It is the poor of this world that will suffer as a result.
After all, every year, we dump millions of tonnes of toxic electrical and electronic waste on them.
The poor cannot afford to pay for lobbyists in the European Union.
