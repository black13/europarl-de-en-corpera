Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recast version of the directive should help improve protection for the consumer and environment alike.
I believe we have achieved this because we have established a realistic framework that is based on the actual risks to consumers and the environment and that offers businesses legal certainty for investments and innovations.
This is very important for small and medium-sized businesses carrying out research in specific areas.
It is comforting to know that we have been able to agree risk-appropriate guidelines in relation to this important topic and, in this regard, I would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs.
We have heard several speakers express their regret that the panels have been dropped.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not talking about cadmium here, but about cadmium telluride.
The issues at stake here are innovation and investment.
Indeed, we need to consider these questions separately.
The devices in question are not electrical appliances, but rather equipment for generating electricity.
This is a very significant distinction.
We cannot take a catch-all approach, saying 'These are all poisonous substances'.
After all, for example, my own body contains a certain amount of sulphur.
Now, sulphur is not something I would readily choose to ingest.
However, things are quite different when we are dealing with chemical compounds.
That is why I am pleased that we have finally managed to put the question of PVC behind us.
The businesses that manufacture PVC have done a lot of research in the last few years.
One only has to look at the latest developments to realise what has been going on in the world.
We do not need to revisit a debate that is already ten years old.
I am satisfied with the version now before us.
I am certain it will enable us to achieve great benefits to the environment and consumer, as well as promoting innovation.
