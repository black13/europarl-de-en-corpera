Madam President, I believe that the fundamental intention of this directive should be endorsed.
The committee has finally faced up to its responsibilities and has improved significantly on the Commission's proposal.
Nonetheless, there are a couple of issues that still need to be discussed.
Firstly, we need to remember the international dimension in all that we do.
After all, what use is it if the European Union remains unblemished, but the importing of hazardous substances is still permitted.
Secondly, small and medium-sized companies must be able to cope with our regulations and, above all, the associated bureaucratic effort involved.
Thirdly, I assume that the process launched will be dynamic rather than static in nature, which is why this problem will need to be brought before the European Parliament at regular intervals.
