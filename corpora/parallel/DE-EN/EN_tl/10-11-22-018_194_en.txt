Madam President, Commissioners, although I believe this is just a small step, at least it is a step in the right direction.
At least the tabled amendment manages to encompass all the exceptions foreseen.
I believe that this will also provide some important guidance for the business sector.
However, what is particularly important in respect of these guidelines is that consumers should be kept informed.
I believe it will continue to be very important in the future that consumers should know about the potential environmental pollutants that they may be buying when they purchase electronics or electrical appliances.
This is the only way to ensure that the correct procedures will be followed with our next directive, namely, in relation to the disposal of these devices.
It is important for the Commission and the Member States to supply this information now, because a transition period of eight years really is a very, very long time.
