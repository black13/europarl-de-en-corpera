Revision of the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment poses a particular challenge.
However, a recast is urgently needed in order to eradicate uncertainties in respect of the scope, the lack of clarity of the legal provisions and definitions, as well as the differences between Member States and potential procedural overlaps with other EU legal acts, for example, REACH.
The Commission's original proposal was tailored far too much to large enterprises.
The economic capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises is taken into greater consideration in the current version.
After all, these small and medium-sized enterprises form the backbone of European competitiveness.
The derogation procedure and the relevant deadlines for a Commission decision have also been set out clearly.
The requirement laid down to review the directive within 10 years in order to adapt it to technological progress should also be highlighted.
When this review is carried out, it must, in particular, take account of the availability and reliability of alternative products as well as the socio-economic impact.
