Madam President, the democratic participation of employees in business is one of the cornerstones of social policy in the European Union.
For a month now, workers at the Atlas plants in Ganderkesee, Delmenhorst and Vechta have been striking day and night for precisely these rights.
Workers are fighting to secure a collective wage agreement that will enable good, secure jobs to be preserved.
Unfortunately, the management has refused point blank to negotiate with the Industrial Union of Metalworkers and the works council.
During the course of the industrial dispute, employees have been extremely intimidated and pressurised by management.
I wish to call on the management, specifically Mr Filipov, to open discussions and to return to the negotiating table.
Democratic participation cannot be allowed to stop at the factory gates.
A hire-and-fire system engenders fear and sows the seeds of social unrest.
There should be no place for such systems in Europe, as they are damaging to our democracy.
