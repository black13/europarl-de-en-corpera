Madam President, I am also of the opinion that the dual media system can also be a success here in Europe and that it is important that we should have public broadcasters, on the one hand, and the private channels, on the other, operating in free competition, in a free market economy.
Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different.
There is evidence of a huge trend towards monopolisation, particularly in the private sector.
We need to take steps to counteract this.
This trend is particularly dangerous because it is happening against a background of grave economic difficulty.
On the other hand, we have public broadcasting companies that are failing in their public service duties by allowing party spin-doctors and handlers to decide on the subject matter and content of their editorials.
Of course, this cannot be allowed.
Let me take the example of ORF in Austria: this broadcaster operates like a branch of the civil service, but not in terms of economic efficiency.
There is no liberalism or pluralism in the media and no editorial freedom at present, or at least not as much as there should be.
What can the EU do about this?
I am convinced that the early warning system for identifying monopolies already presented to the European Parliament some time back is a good solution to this problem.
