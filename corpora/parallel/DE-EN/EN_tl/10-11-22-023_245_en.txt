Madam President, the combination of civil and military powers is nothing new.
Take, for example, the Command Centre, which has been in place in Council for some time now.
Military and civil information has already been collated here.
The Situation Centre is now to move to the External Action Service.
I think it important to emphasise above all that the European Union has gained a high profile on the international front for its civil mechanisms, something that has brought the European Union a great deal of positive recognition.
However, I believe we need a clear separation of civil and military powers.
At this point I would like to pick up on something that Mr Szegedi mentioned a moment ago.
I would like to express my grave misgivings about the march organised by the Hungarian Jobbik party in Austria's Burgenland province recently, at which rifles and fixed bayonets were in evidence.
I do not believe that this is in any way acceptable.
I would like to express my clear opposition to such actions.
There can be little doubt that they run contrary to the European spirit.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
