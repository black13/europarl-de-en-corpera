Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, I would like to express my sympathy for the victims and for those affected.
All the groups in Parliament are in agreement on this.
We also agree that we must provide aid quickly.
A lot of sensible things have already been said.
It is not necessary for me to repeat them, but I do fully support them.
There is one further aspect that I would like to highlight and that is the long-term damage.
We must not forget that many of the consequences will have a more lasting impact on the natural environment than we may currently anticipate.
Therefore, it seems important to me for the Solidarity Fund and the measures that we are taking to be targeted at these long-term consequences of natural destruction.
I would like to make one last point.
We can sit here and discuss this issue, but the most important thing for us to do is to provide support, so that people can begin to organise help for themselves, because they have a better understanding of the local conditions than we do here in Parliament.
