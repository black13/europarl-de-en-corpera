Mr President, exactly 10 years ago, women's rights as a fundamental element of human rights first became a topic for discussion by the UN Security Council following a call for gender equality in conflict and crisis situations.
This was a milestone on the road to the introduction of a mandatory requirement under international law for the participation of women at decision-making levels in peace processes and security policy.
The Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, made an urgent call in 2005 for national action plans to be drawn up for the implementation of resolution 1325.
We have already heard that only 20 states have so far done this, including European countries such as Sweden and Great Britain, but also African countries, for example, Liberia and the CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
I believe that all the EU Member States should adopt action plans of this kind.
This also applies to countries such as Germany, where I come from, which has so far refused to compile an action plan.
The gender perspective has definitely become more important at an international level.
A new UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence has been appointed and the UN Entity for Gender Equality has been established.
However, we must be aware that all of these measures are very much in their early stages.
This is about providing support for women and girls who have been the victims of sexual violence.
We must intensify the resolutions and the aid programmes that are already in place.
However, this is also about support for identifying and prosecuting the offenders, which must always be linked to the reform of local judicial systems.
Mr Chastel's message on behalf of Baroness Ashton concerning the provision of EUR 2 million to support this resolution is a very positive one.
I would like to make it clear how important it is to involve local women's rights NGOs, so that the money goes to where it is really needed.
