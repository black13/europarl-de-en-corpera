Madam President, women and children continue to be disproportionately hard hit by wars and their consequences.
However, women's rights must not be misused in order to give legitimacy to military interventions.
The example of the Republic of Congo shows that military measures do not help to protect, secure or establish women's rights.
Unfortunately, exactly the opposite is true.
The situation of women in Afghanistan today is worse than ever as a result of the war.
The promise made in resolution 1325 can only really be honoured by avoiding conflict and taking only civil measures in war and conflict situations.
Therefore, I believe that it is completely unacceptable to distort this resolution with the aim of increasing the number of women involved in warfare.
I am calling for the EU to stop providing support on principle, including aid for equipment and training, to regimes and military forces which send child soldiers into armed conflicts, violate human rights or commit systematic acts of sexual violence.
