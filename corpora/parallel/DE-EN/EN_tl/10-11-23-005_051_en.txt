Madam President, it is not only justifiable for us to continue supporting the coal industry, but, in my opinion, it is also absolutely essential.
We must go on providing support not only until 2014, but also beyond that time.
It is our duty to protect the citizens of the European Union from the many negative impacts of globalisation.
This also includes offering workers in industries which are not fully competitive on the world market long-term retraining to allow them to take on other jobs.
You do not need to be an expert to realise that specialised workers are needed in the mining industry.
Many miners work in the pits for their entire lives.
Therefore, in my opinion, we need plenty of time in order to be able to offer all of them new jobs.
It may no longer be sensible to give older miners the option of retraining.
We must enable mining regions to become gradually less dependent on the mining industry without their prosperity being significantly reduced.
These regions still have considerable economic potential if they are given the opportunity of restructuring their economies.
The drastic reduction in the subsidies for coal mining over recent years has represented an ordeal for many mining regions.
A number of areas were not able to react quickly enough to the changes in economic conditions because of their strong links with the mining industry.
The result has been increased poverty.
This does not have to be the case.
We can protect many European regions from major economic and social damage and, therefore, we must vote in favour of these regulations.
