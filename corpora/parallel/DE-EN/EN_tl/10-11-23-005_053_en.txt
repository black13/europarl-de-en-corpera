Madam President, Mr Almunia, we need to bite the bullet now, rather than prolonging the agony.
This is what comes to mind when I think about the subject that we are discussing today.
I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date.
The cost of each job in the coal mining industry is much higher than the average.
This money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future.
Therefore, I believe it is right to phase out state subsidies for uncompetitive mines in 2014.
We must invest the money which becomes available in research and development and in education and training.
This is the only way in which we can maintain our technological head start and remain competitive in the global economy as a whole.
