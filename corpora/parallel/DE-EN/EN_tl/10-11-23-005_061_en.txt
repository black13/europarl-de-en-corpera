Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few things to our Liberal friends and to Mrs in 't Veld in particular.
Competition will not be distorted, because the coal-fired power stations will continue to operate using imported coal, which will increase their carbon footprint.
In other words, the argument does not make sense, whichever way you look at it.
In addition, this cannot be continued after 2018, for example, in Germany's case, because the treaty, which applies to those involved and not just to the state, requires everything to come to an end in 2018, so that the long-term costs of pit closures do not have to be borne by the state.
The long-term costs, which will amount to many millions over several centuries, will be paid by a foundation.
If the foundation were to collapse, it would cost the state a lot of money for an indefinite period.
Having developed such a clever concept with a clear end point, it is important to do justice to it and not to attempt to come up with theoretical definitions of the market which are completely unrelated to the reality of the agreement.
