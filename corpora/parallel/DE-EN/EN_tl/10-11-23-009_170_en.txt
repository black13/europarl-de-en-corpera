In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of environmental disasters.
In particular, heavy rainfall has frequently caused floods which have devastating consequences for the environment and result in damage that costs huge amounts of money to rectify.
The European Union Solidarity Fund is being mobilised to repair the damage caused by the floods in Ireland in 2009 (to the agricultural sector, housing, businesses, the road network and other infrastructure).
The overall cost of the damage which is a direct result of the disaster is estimated to be around EUR 520 million.
The contribution of EUR 13 million from the EU budget will help with the reconstruction work.
I have voted in favour of providing this support.
