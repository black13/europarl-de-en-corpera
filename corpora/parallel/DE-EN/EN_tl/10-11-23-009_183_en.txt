in writing. - Growing numbers of people are being made unemployed as a result of globalisation measures.
In the nine-month reference period from 1 April 2009 to 29 December 2009, there were 140 redundancies in two companies in the Dutch region of Drenthe.
Now, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is being mobilised to provide a contribution of EUR 453 632.
I have voted in favour of the report, because it allows the EGF to fulfil its obligations.
