The far-reaching effects of globalisation are resulting in more and more people losing their jobs.
Redundancies are becoming increasingly common.
Between 1 April 2009 and 29 December 2009, 129 workers were made redundant by a machinery and equipment manufacturer in Limburg in the Netherlands.
Now an application has been made to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for a contribution of EUR 549 946 to help those affected.
I have voted in favour of the report which will prevent those people who have been made redundant from suffering further financial problems.
