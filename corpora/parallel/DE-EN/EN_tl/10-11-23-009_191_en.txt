In the nine-month reference period from 1 April 2009 to 29 December 2009, 650 workers were made redundant by 45 companies in the two Dutch regions of Gelderland and Overijssel.
The redundancies were the consequence of the economic crisis and of structural changes in world trade patterns.
In order to improve the future prospects of people who have lost their jobs, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created, with annual funding of EUR 500 million, to intervene in cases such as these.
I have voted in favour of the report, because the redundant workers deserve the support of the EGF.
