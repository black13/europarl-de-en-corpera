During the nine-month reference period from 1 April 2009 to 29 December 2009, there were 598 redundancies in a total of eight companies in Noord Holland and Zuid Holland.
Each one of these workers was a victim of globalisation.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to cushion the impact of social injustices of this kind.
I have voted in favour of the report, because all the requirements for the mobilisation of the EGF have been met.
