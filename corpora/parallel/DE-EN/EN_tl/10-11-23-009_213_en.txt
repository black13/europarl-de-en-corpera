Firstly, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the chair of the committee, Mr De Castro, and to the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Mrs Jeggle, for their hard work.
The final extension of the German alcohol monopoly which was adopted today represents an important step forward.
It gives our fruit distilleries, in particular, the security to plan for the future beyond 2010.
This is important because it enables them to prepare for the transition to the free market and to maintain one of Germany's unique cultural landscapes.
However, it is now essential to make intensive use of this period of time to put in place the necessary adaptation measures, because there will be no further extensions of the monopoly.
That is the message of today's report.
