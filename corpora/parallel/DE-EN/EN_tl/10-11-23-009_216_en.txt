Whether and in what form the German Alcohol Monopoly will be retained and what changes will be made to it are all factors that will have an impact primarily on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The EU constantly claims that it wants to provide more support for SMEs, which are the motor of the economy and the main providers of jobs.
In this context, we need legal certainty and, therefore, an extension of the monopoly over a longer period.
This is the only way in which small and medium-sized businesses can afford to make the necessary purchases to prepare for the forthcoming deregulation, for example, by establishing cooperatives, modernising their equipment or extending their direct marketing activities.
Of course, the issue of the monopoly could have been combined with the phasing out of the common agricultural policy and the new regulations which will apply from 2013.
However, there were no pressing grounds for doing so.
The important thing is to ensure that the adaptation process is designed to allow the distilleries to survive after the monopoly has come to an end.
I agree with the rapporteur on this issue.
However, I am not in favour of the internal procedure, which does not adequately meet the requirements for transparency and democracy.
For this reason, I have abstained from voting.
