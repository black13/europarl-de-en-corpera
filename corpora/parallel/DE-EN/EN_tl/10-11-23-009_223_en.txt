As part of a World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement, the EU, the USA, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and Macao in China have decided to reduce the duties on certain pharmaceutical products and active ingredients to zero.
Of course, the list of products is constantly being amended and extended to keep pace with the results of research and the latest developments in the pharmaceutical world.
The list of products that benefit from duty-free treatment, which originally contained 6 000 items, and which was created by the industry and reviewed by the states in question, will now be expanded to include more than 8 600 pharmaceutical and chemical products.
It is important to justify the duty-free treatment of pharmaceutical and chemical substances and active ingredients.
However, the entire system seems to be highly complicated and will result in additional bureaucracy for the customs authorities.
The gradual expansion of the list, on this occasion by more than one third, will, at some point, mean that the customs systems reach their data capacity limits.
Therefore, I am calling for a simplification of the fundamental principle and, for that reason, I have abstained.
