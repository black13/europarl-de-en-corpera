In today's modern world where technical developments are so short-lived, making cooperation in scientific and technical fields easier will be of benefit to both sides.
As the renewal of the agreement apparently brings economic and social advantages for both sides, it is also in the interests of the European Union.
The costs of implementing the agreement, in the form of workshops, seminars, meetings, etc. will be charged to the relevant budget lines of the specific programmes in the EU budget.
In order to promote technical progress in the face of competition in a globalised world and in the light of the benefits which technological developments bring not only to our everyday lives, but also, for example, in the field of medicine, I have supported the renewal of the agreement for scientific and technical cooperation with Ukraine.
