The European Union has set itself ambitious targets in the field of technology and not only in the context of the Lisbon Strategy.
These objectives have now been reinforced in the plan for the near future, the Europe 2020 strategy.
This makes cooperation in science and technology even more important.
Against this background, we should welcome the fact that a series of agreements have been reached with other countries to promote this cooperation by means of workshops, meetings and seminars, for example.
This issue is of such great importance to the EU that a subsidy option has been made available within the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities.
Now we are about to renew our agreement with a group of islands in the North Atlantic, the Faroe Islands.
Unlike Denmark, the Faroes are not a member of the European Union and do not form part of the customs union.
Instead, they have created a single economic area with Iceland.
In order to encourage technological progress, I have voted in favour of renewing the agreement on scientific and technical cooperation with the Faroe Islands.
