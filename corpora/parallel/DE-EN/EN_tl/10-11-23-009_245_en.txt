Japan is a role model in the field of technological development.
Japanese technology is always state-of-the-art, whether it involves hybrid drive systems or entertainment products.
The country is not only well-known for exporting its high-tech products; they are also of great importance to its citizens.
For example, in Japan, it is already possible to pay for goods or services securely using a mobile phone.
The shortages of the so-called rare earths that are essential for the electronic components of the latest technological products is the result of the Chinese strategy to ensure that these substances are in short supply and to keep their prices artificially high.
All of this will accelerate the search for alternatives.
Cooperation in the field of science and technology and the renewal of the relevant agreement deserve our support not only for these reasons.
The requirements of the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy, where the European Union has set itself ambitious targets in the field of technology, also play a role here.
