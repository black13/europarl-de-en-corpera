Despite the fact that the environmental issues are overshadowed by the conflict in the Middle East, there is likely to be a need for more advanced technological solutions in these regions.
The drinking water strategies of both Jordan and Israel are gradually leading to a reduction in the flow of the Jordan River and an increase in the pollution of the water.
Against this background, there will be a high level of demand for technological developments, for example, in the field of water and sewage treatment plants.
Scientific and technical cooperation is important, in order to enable knowledge to be shared and to lay the foundations for new technological developments.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of renewing the agreement with the Kingdom of Jordan.
