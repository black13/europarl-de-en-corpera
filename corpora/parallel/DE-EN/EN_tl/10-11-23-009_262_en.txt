Bilateral fisheries agreements between the European Union and third countries are of significant economic benefit to the EU.
A new agreement is currently being negotiated between the EU and the Solomon Islands.
The disadvantages of the new agreement are an increase in the contribution to be paid by shipowners, a lower level of profitability for the EU than other tuna fisheries agreements and the same financial support from the EU in return for lower catch quotas.
According to the rapporteur, the benefits of the agreement include the fact that the Solomon Islands need foreign exchange reserves to maintain their macro-economic stability, that the agreed reference tonnage of 4 000 tonnes of fish is a relatively large amount for the EU, and that there is a need to pursue cooperation on a regional basis with a view to achieving sustainability beyond EU waters.
I have abstained, because the advantages for the EU are not clear enough in relation to the costs.
