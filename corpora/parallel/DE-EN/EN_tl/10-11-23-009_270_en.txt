Minimum value added tax rates are one aspect of the efforts to harmonise European tax rates.
However, we must oppose these moves towards harmonisation.
On the one hand, they could lead to attempts to introduce tax sovereignty for the EU through the back door and, on the other, regulations of this kind represent an intrusion into the sovereignty of the Member States.
The Member States must retain the power to set their own tax rates, because each country must decide for itself on its own priorities, as this depends on the extent to which the state spends money in different areas.
All of this is also an expression of Europe's historical development.
We must reject calls for minimum tax rates so that the pressure to conform, the amount of EU red tape and the centralism of Brussels can all be reduced.
I strongly oppose the extension of the mandatory levy of a minimum standard VAT rate of 15% for a further five years.
The EU should be focusing on cooperation on tax fraud, because billions of euro are being lost in the value added tax systems in particular.
There are some approaches in this area which are worthy of further discussion.
