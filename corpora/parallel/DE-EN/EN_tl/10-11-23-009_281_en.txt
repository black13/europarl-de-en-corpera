I have voted to support the European Central Bank (ECB) annual report for 2009 as it clearly highlights the consistent action taken by the ECB and its primary objective of maintaining price stability.
In the crisis of 2009, the ECB acted and reacted effectively.
With independence and determination, it laid the foundations for a lasting climate of confidence.
Our most important proposal for improvement should be put into practice consistently.
In other words, the ECB should make its activities more transparent in order to further increase its legitimacy.
The new Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009, made the ECB into a European Union body.
I very much welcome this, because the ECB is primarily accountable to Parliament, a fact of which many people are not aware.
It must continue to be able to make its financial policy decisions independently of political influence and to justify them to the citizens whom we represent.
The ECB was, and is, a reliable ally in finding a balance between sound public finances and the necessary reduction of debt in the Member States.
It has constantly underlined the fact that the euro area needs a stability pact with authority.
This must be applied to the letter and must not be circumvented or undermined.
