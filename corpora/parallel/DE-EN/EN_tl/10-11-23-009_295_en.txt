I have voted against the report on civilian-military cooperation and the development of civilian-military capabilities.
The report describes in great detail the current developments in security policy.
However, in my opinion, it does not provide clear, decisive and positive answers to the important questions, such as whether the EU will be able to stand on its own feet in the long term or whether it will maintain its very close links to NATO and, therefore, will hand over its foreign policy responsibilities to the USA.
