The Treaty of Lisbon has made the establishment of a common defence policy into one of the EU's concrete objectives.
The aim is to improve the ability of the European Union to act in a crisis management role by allowing financial, civilian and military resources to be provided and used more efficiently.
Military capabilities will be developed at an EU level among those Member States which want this by means of a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PSC).
Mr Ehler's report calls for the conditions for military cooperation to be laid down and for a clear definition of the PSC.
For me as an Austrian, clear definitions are of great interest, in particular, with regard to the implementation of the solidarity clause as outlined in Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the mutual assistance clause as outlined in Article 42(7) of the Treaty on the European Union, which are also called for in the report.
The mutual assistance clause specifically states that it will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States, which guarantees that neutrality will be maintained.
As before, the solidarity clause leaves to the national authorities the decision on whether, and in what form, EU assistance should be requested.
However, the citizens of Austria have become very concerned following a series of different reports in the media and, therefore, we need definitive information about these new military components of the EU.
