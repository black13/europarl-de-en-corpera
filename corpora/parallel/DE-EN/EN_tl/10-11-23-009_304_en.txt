Although catch quotas have been introduced for the anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay, this does not apply to pelagic species and tuna.
The number of fishing vessels in this area has declined from 391 vessels in 2005 to 239 vessels in 2009, which has had a significant influence on the economy of the area.
However, according to the rapporteur, the anchovy stock has not yet recovered.
A new management plan is needed to resolve this problem which is linked to the anchovy stock and which does not need to be renegotiated every year.
The rapporteur believes that the new plan should also define the control mechanisms used to inspect catch levels.
I have abstained, because the rapporteur has explained that the articles in the plan relating to the controls are likely to be amended by a new control regulation from the Council and she does not know exactly what this involves.
