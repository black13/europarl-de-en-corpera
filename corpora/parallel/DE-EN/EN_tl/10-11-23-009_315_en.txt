During a time when overfishing of stocks is becoming more widespread, we need more discussions about introducing catch quotas and, consequently, also about how these can be adhered to and monitored.
However, scientists have not yet succeeded in accurately determining the level of fish stocks, in this case, of the Atlantic horse mackerel.
As a result, all the measures that are taken are based on estimates.
Nevertheless, these estimates must be used to establish the total allowable catches.
I have abstained because the report does not focus in sufficient detail on the economic aspects of mackerel fishing.
