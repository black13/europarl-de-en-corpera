Increasing numbers of fish species in the Baltic Sea are under immediate threat.
For example, fewer cod are being caught in the Baltic than was the case 15 years ago and the fish are smaller and of poorer quality.
One of the major contributory factors to this decline is industrial fishing and the way in which by-catches are handled.
Traditional, small-scale, inshore fisheries are, in some circumstances, able to guarantee that fish stocks are managed sustainably.
I have abstained, because the report clearly states that no reliable scientific data is available on this subject.
