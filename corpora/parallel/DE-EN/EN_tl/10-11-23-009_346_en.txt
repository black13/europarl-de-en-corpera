It takes time and a great deal of confidence to adapt to changes in social structures.
Therefore, the European Union and Germany intend to end subsidies for non-competitive coal mines.
The period from now until 2018 will be used to put in place the necessary restructuring measures.
This is a successful compromise which is evidence of the far-sighted approach of everyone involved.
Given the large number of people employed in the industry, it is important for the European Union and the Member States to make every effort to cushion the negative social and regional impact of this change and to keep the impact to a minimum.
Therefore, I am very pleased that the European Parliament has shown its support for this view today.
This will enable the difficult but necessary adaptation processes to be implemented in Europe and in Germany, in particular, in a balanced way and on a sound political footing.
