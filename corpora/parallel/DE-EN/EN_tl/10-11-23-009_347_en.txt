On the question of continuing the subsidies for unprofitable coal mines, I have gone against the line taken by my group and abstained.
In my opinion, the vote in Parliament is based on a nationalist reflex and short-term thinking.
I oppose the subsidies because I believe that the use of coal and the accompanying CO2 emissions in principle run counter to all our efforts to combat climate change.
The money which we could be investing in renewable energy sources is literally being thrown into a bottomless pit.
In my view, we should be looking for sustainable alternatives in the field of energy production.
However, we also need alternative solutions on the labour market.
It is obvious that mistakes have been made in the past and that there has been a short-sighted approach to employment policy.
Given that many jobs are at stake, I would prefer to see funding being made available for retraining the workers who are affected, rather than a continuation of the coal subsidies.
For this reason, I have decided to abstain rather than voting against the report.
