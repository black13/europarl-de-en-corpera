I have voted in favour of Mr Rapkay's report because the plan to phase out coal mining subsidies by 2018 is, fortunately, supported by a broad majority across all the groups.
The example of Germany shows how a coal pact between central government, the federal states, unions and management can result in efficient coal production without the need for redundancies.
There is now more security for 100 000 jobs throughout Europe.
To avoid any misunderstandings, it is important to realise that these are not permanent subsidies and that the aim is not to prop up uncompetitive businesses.
This is all about taking a responsible approach to a traditional European industry.
The use of coal can easily be justified, either as a fuel for generating electricity or as a raw material in the chemical industry, particularly in times when resources such as oil and gas are in increasingly short supply.
The production of a minimum amount of coal contributes to our energy security and prevents us from being dependent on imports.
It is wrong to say that ending subsidies for coal mining will help to protect the environment.
From a climate perspective, it makes no difference whether we use domestic or foreign raw materials.
We must continue to support environmentally friendly coal technology and a secure energy supply using domestic products.
An active industry policy is not a thing of the past but a task for the future, on the basis of a consistent competition strategy and a sensible social policy involving job security.
