It is essential that we continue to support the coal industry in Europe to allow uncompetitive mines to be closed down gradually.
However, the Commission's proposal does not go far enough.
Mining is concentrated in only a few regions which will have to completely restructure their economies over the next few years.
We have seen often enough in the past that mining regions which have become uncompetitive have suffered a severe social and economic decline within a short period of time.
Previously, many of these regions were the 'black pearls' of economic performance in Europe.
If we give them the time to adjust to the change in circumstances, they can continue to be economic powerhouses.
However, if we leave them in the lurch, we will incur considerable costs as a result of unemployment and bankruptcies.
The argument put forward by the Greens that this process is harmful to the environment is pure invention.
Domestic coal is much more environmentally friendly than imported coal.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report, which is very clearly worded.
