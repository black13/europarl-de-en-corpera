I have voted against the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009, because it is very vague and its wording is imprecise.
In addition, it does not contain any plans for more efficient development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states (ACP) in future.
Development aid, in its current form, is a failure in 80% of cases.
It has simply increased the dependency of the states in question on external aid.
We need to help these states to help themselves.
It must be possible for them gradually to develop a functioning national economy.
The ability to feed themselves plays a major role in this context.
However, this report doggedly supports the status quo, which is why I have voted against it.
