Since the European Union acquired shared competence over justice and home affairs, huge progress has been made in the area of civil justice.
Article 67 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes the importance of respecting the different legal systems and traditions within the EU and Mr Berlinguer's report highlights this as one of the strengths of the EU.
Subsidiarity is one of the basic principles of EU law and is based on the condition that the subordinate member is able to resolve problems and carry out tasks independently.
The areas of justice and home affairs have traditionally been the responsibility of the Member States.
Each Member State has its own special features and traditions which reflect the cultural diversity of Europe.
However, in order to keep pace with the changing reality in today's world, joint responsibility with the European Union is needed.
Nowadays, treaties with cross-border implications are the rule and partnerships or families where the partners come from different Member States are commonplace.
However, these involve challenges for national civil legislation which we will have to overcome.
As the rapporteur recommends, it is now time to develop a European judicial culture alongside the national judicial cultures.
