While fish stocks in the world's oceans are slowly being depleted and catch yields are reaching their limits, the farming of fish and shellfish in aquaculture has been growing in importance in recent years.
Aquaculture production is consequently a growth sector, which is being afforded the necessary attention with this report.
The proportion of aquaculture facilities established inland, such as pond fish culture or flow-through systems, show higher growth rates than other food production sectors, and production in these facilities already exceeds that of maritime facilities.
Pond fish culture in particular has a long tradition: fish and crustaceans have been farmed for hundreds of years, mostly in artificial ponds.
Closed aquaculture systems clearly provide enormous ecological advantages as well as advantages with regard to the antibiotics problem.
I support the report, which calls for important framework conditions for closed aquaculture facilities and strictly defines the prerequisites for the introduction of exotic fish species.
In order to prevent disruption to native ecosystems through the optimum introduction of exotic species, it is important to support closed system farming.
