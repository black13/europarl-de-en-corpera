The German Alcohol Monopoly as a concept is to be phased out.
The farmers affected have prepared for the opening up of the market.
Thus, the aid is no longer fully utilised and measures have been taken, such as the establishment of cooperatives and changes in direct marketing methods, in preparation for this opening up of the market.
However, a sufficient amount of time is required for these measures to be taken.
At the end of the day, it is not large enterprises that are affected by this arrangement, but many small farmers in rural areas.
For this reason, I support an extension of the arrangement.
