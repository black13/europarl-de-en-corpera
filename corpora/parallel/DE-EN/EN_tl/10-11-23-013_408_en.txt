Mr President, there are many interpretations, Mrs Morvai.
That much is completely obvious.
It may be that your interpretation of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU is different from mine.
However, this is not about the interpretation, but about the application of the treaty and this includes a clear budgetary procedure.
Incidentally, you are, as far as I know, a member of the Hungarian Jobbik party, or if not, then a member of another party.
Please explain to the voters in your country that if we adopt the EU budget, then it will actually be possible to pay out the cohesion funds within the European Union in the long term.
If there were no budget, then the funding could not be made available.
