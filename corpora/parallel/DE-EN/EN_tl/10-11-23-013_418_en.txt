Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three equal partners are sitting around the negotiating table for the 2011 budget: the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
The European Parliament has agreed to the budget increase of 2.9% proposed by the Council, but only in combination with a political package.
In the context of the Treaty of Lisbon, this is a highly justified demand.
With regard to the extent of the increase, I think it is important to make it clear that we are still working with an EU budget volume which goes back to the time when there were 15 Member States and, therefore, it is geared to a Union of this size.
However, there are now 27 states in the Union with a range of new tasks to be taken into account.
In the light of the economic crisis, it seems incomprehensible that we are increasing the EU budget.
However, we have to take into consideration the fact that almost 95% of the money is returned to the citizens of Europe in the form of direct aid, for example, via the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
It must ultimately be clear to everyone that the current budgetary situation in some of the Member States is self-imposed.
The fact is that without a 2011 budget, the three financial supervisory bodies cannot be funded.
Given the current drama in Ireland, it would have been good if these organisations could have begun work yesterday.
