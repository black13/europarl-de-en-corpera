Mr President, the Conference of Presidents is meeting at 17:00 at your invitation.
I would not have spoken again at this point if Mr Wathelet had not made these remarks.
In the light of the fact that the Conference of Presidents will be discussing and deciding on the next step for Parliament at 17.00, I would be grateful if we could have Mr Wathelet's speech.
I must say that what has been said represents a step backwards.
It is less than what we have so far heard from the Council.
If that is the Council's line, then I must say to you, Mr Wathelet, and this is not an accusation directed at the Belgian Presidency, that we have tough, confrontational times ahead of us.
I would like to thank you, Mr Barroso.
Your remarks have shown that the two community institutions, Parliament and the Commission, are working along exactly the same lines.
