Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to emphasise once again that for this House, this self-assured European Parliament, the important issue is to honour the Treaty of Lisbon.
This is not about going beyond the terms of the treaty, as Mr Barroso has already so rightly said, but it is about keeping to the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the additional powers for Parliament, ensuring that the Council does not turn back the clock and adhering to the arrangement on how we work together and how we come to an agreement between Parliament and the Council.
This was laid down in 2006 in the interinstitutional agreement.
All we want is for this to be confirmed again.
Thank you very much, Mr Barroso, you have rightly highlighted this issue once more.
Mr Wathelet has now attempted to persuade the House not to make such rapid progress towards a genuinely pro-European future, but instead to hold back.
If we do that, we will already be admitting defeat.
As Mr Schulz has said, this is, in fact, about a political dispute.
How will we handle the increased powers of the European Parliament and the Member States which are behaving in a more and more eurosceptic way?
If we want the European Union and its citizens to have a powerful future, including at a global level, Parliament and the Council must reach a pro-European consensus.
Therefore, we must not give in at too early a stage.
Instead, we must fight for European added value, because this is in the interests of both the national governments and our citizens.
