Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the traditional representatives of the European Parliament are calling for extensive flexibility in the budget, but I have noticed that no one has mentioned the interests of the net contributors or the interests of the citizens.
It is ultimately the net contributors which finance the EU, which were responsible for restarting the engine of the economy after the crisis, which rescued the countries with budget deficits and the euro itself and which are imposing a heavy burden on their citizens.
In my opinion, it is therefore quite comprehensible and justifiable that these countries and their citizens want to keep to the budgetary appropriations, ensure that the net balance cannot be changed retrospectively on a whim and prevent money from being diverted into different channels.
Of course, I am not referring here to the aid provided following disasters.
I am excluding that.
Equally, the critical approach to EU taxation has nothing to do with an apparent lack of solidarity.
It is simply due to the fact that the Member States are largely opposed to it.
For this reason, it is clear that we must retain the ratification by the national parliaments for the sake of subsidiarity.
