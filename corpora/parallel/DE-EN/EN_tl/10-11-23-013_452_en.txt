Mr President, firstly, I would like to make it clear, following repeated claims in this House, that during the budget negotiations, we have not requested a single cent more than the Council had offered us.
This means that we were completely in line with the Council's wishes.
On the subject of the flexibility instrument, we need it because the Council regularly gets us into difficulties with its decisions on major projects for which it has not made provision for the funding.
We then have to attempt, together with the Member States, to find a solution for these projects, in order to be able to support them financially and to make sensible plans.
We have also not demanded more than what is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
Instead, we are calling for compliance with the treaty.
Nothing else, nothing more and nothing less.
On the subject of own resources, it is surely not asking too much for Parliament to say that it would at least like to discuss the issue, what form it could take and whether own resources are in place.
They cannot simply refuse to talk about this and then put the blame on Parliament.
