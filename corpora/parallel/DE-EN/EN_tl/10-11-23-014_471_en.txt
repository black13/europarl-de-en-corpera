Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on its ambitious work programme, but we must attempt to align it more closely with Europe's strategic objectives and with the long-term strategy.
I would like to ask the Commission to look more boldly and less anxiously to the future.
You have the necessary support from Parliament, while the Council, in particular, plays more of a restraining role.
The progressive forces must stick together in this case.
Competitiveness is one of the central issues that we need to deal with, to ensure that Europe remains competitive and that we can achieve our objectives, such as sustainable growth and social growth.
It is also important that we convey this message correctly.
Unfortunately, the anti-European forces have a much greater presence, particularly in the media, than the pro-European forces.
However, everyone is aware that Europe can only move forward jointly in the right direction.
We must call on the Commission to focus in its overall programme during the next few years on increasing efficiency in the field of energy, in the use of resources and raw materials, and in education.
Universities and schools must make a contribution to creating a smart Europe.
The field of research and development faces particular challenges in this respect.
We need to be aware that the rest of the world is not sleeping.
We must not look with anxiety to the future and continue with our parochial approach, as is happening to a certain extent in the Council.
Parliament and the Commission must look to the future together.
