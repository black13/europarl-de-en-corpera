Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we want the European Commission's legislative programme to be in line with Europe's long-term objectives and we believe that there is room for improvement in many areas, although we very much welcome the basic approach of this legislative programme.
With regard to the internal market, an area which I am responsible for, I would like to say in particular that we want to ensure, on the basis of the paper produced by Professor Monti, that all the citizens of Europe can gain more benefits from the internal market.
When we discuss the Commission's work programme and when we take the Monti report as our foundation, this means, of course, firstly that the Commission must tackle the requirements of this paper, in other words, it must ensure that the infringement proceedings taken by the Commission against the Member States are strengthened to enable the transposition deficit to be reduced from 1% to 0.5%.
Unfortunately, there is nothing about this in the work programme.
Alongside the individual measures which are addressed in this report, such as the digital agenda, mortgage credit, concessions and many others which I will not refer to individually, we believe that it is important in every case that the measures which are announced for 2011 are actually presented in 2011.
The additional information about the fact that the Commission is evaluating certain legislative plans does not help in this respect.
Finally, I believe that we should call on the European Commission to carry out an impact assessment of all its legislative proposals, so that we can understand why they are needed.
