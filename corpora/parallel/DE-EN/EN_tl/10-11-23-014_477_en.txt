Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have made major progress on behalf of the citizens of Europe with the Treaty of Lisbon, because we have included the social market economy among the principles of European policy.
It is clear that we as Europeans and as parliamentarians expect the social market economy to be turned into a reality.
Now we are looking at the internal market itself and the issues relating to the internal market as a whole and we can see that some of the things which should have been included have been omitted.
It is not enough to carry out social impact assessments of European legislation.
We need a social clause to be put into practice, so that the promises which were made that the citizens would really benefit from Europe are fulfilled and do not simply remain on paper.
This is not just about the social clause, but also about important issues such as the services of general economic interest, which require special protection.
It is very important to me that the European Commission finally addresses this question and looks more closely at issues concerning workers than was necessary, for example, in the context of the Posting of Workers Directive, where we are still waiting to find out what will happen next.
Finally, and now I am slowly starting to get really annoyed, we have been calling on the European Commission for a long time to introduce a system for class actions at a European level.
The Commission has already carried out six or seven different studies.
What do we find now in this work programme?
Another study has been commissioned.
We cannot go on like this.
We want the Commission to finally come up with some proposals and decisions in this area.
