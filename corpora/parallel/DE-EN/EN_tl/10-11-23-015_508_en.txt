Mr President, Mrs Vassiliou, Mr Andor, we had great expectations of the agenda for new skills and jobs.
It was intended to create an impetus which would help employees in Europe to prepare for environmental change.
Most importantly, after Parliament came up with a series of ideas in its resolution on green jobs, we expected the Commission to take up these ideas, develop them further and then propose specific measures which define how new jobs can be created by means of environmental change or existing jobs adapted so that they can be preserved, in order to make European industrial society greener for the benefit of the workers.
What have you done instead?
You have revived the old subject of flexicurity.
Do you really believe that new jobs can be created by means of deregulation?
We have just established that the precarious jobs are the ones which are lost during a crisis and they are the first ones to go.
All I can say here is that you are wrong if you think that a knowledge-based, sustainable economy can be developed on the basis of uncertainty and poor working conditions.
Your focus is on poverty through work, instead of on increasing prosperity.
However, poverty is not a good accompaniment to progress.
In order to make environmental progress, we need a wide-ranging programme of education and training for all employees and, in particular, for those at lower levels.
Please continue to work on this agenda and introduce the necessary improvements.
