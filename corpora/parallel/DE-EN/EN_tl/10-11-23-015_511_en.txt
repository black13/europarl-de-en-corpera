Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, new skills for new jobs is a very important subject.
Why is this?
Because it is all about the future.
It is not just about us muddling our way through the challenges that we are already aware of, such as demographic change and the economic crisis.
It is also about the fact that additional qualifications will give people the opportunity to design the jobs of the future and, therefore, to make an active contribution to an innovative economy.
Mr Andor, you place a great deal of importance on the social partnership, which is a good thing.
However, I would like to encourage the Commission to focus on working conditions and the physical and, above all, mental stresses of a busy working life.
What use is it to society if people produce high levels of performance in the short term, but in the long term, turn into burnt-out wrecks?
None at all.
Therefore, the systematic evaluation of the acquis communautaire should be based on this approach and not on better regulation.
On the subject of flexicurity, I do not approve of the Commission proposal for a kind of introductory employment contract, which only offers full employment rights after a certain period of time.
It seems to me rather shabby to treat young people, who are so important for our future, in this way right at the start of their professional careers.
Does this mean that the Commission is more or less giving up on precarious employment relations?
I would very much like to see the Commission making improvements in this area.
