Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, it is true that combating unemployment and the goal of full employment together represent one of our most urgent tasks.
As Mrs Harkin said, the people of Europe do not want concepts; they want concrete solutions.
I would like to thank you for your initiative.
There are a lot of positive approaches here which two colleagues from my group have referred to.
However, I believe that some improvements are needed, because more flexibility and more mobility will not create a single new job.
I would like to endorse what Mrs Schroedter said in this respect.
We need good, secure jobs in Europe and the Member States and businesses must ensure that these are permanent jobs which allow people to earn a good living.
This must become a general rule once again and we must work towards this on a European level and choose the right course.
In the agenda, you refer to new forms of employment contract with fewer rights for employees who are just starting their careers.
You refer to these as open-ended contractual arrangements.
In my view, this will not create any new jobs.
Experience shows, and the Social Democratic government in Germany found this out a few years ago, that weakening employees' rights will not result in any jobs being created.
Measures of this kind simply turn secure jobs into precarious jobs.
We must not allow this to happen in future.
