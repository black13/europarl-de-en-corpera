Mr President, the focus of these measures must be to make the best possible use of the human resources available within the European Union, rather than opting for mass immigration.
In specific terms, this means developing new, long-term skills, which match the new requirements of the labour market.
We need a programme of further training for those EU citizens who have interrupted their education either at school, during an apprenticeship or at university.
In addition, we need incentives for further education, retraining measures and lifelong learning.
When the labour market is opened up to the countries of Eastern Europe in 2011, the EU will be obliged to take measures to protect citizens in those Member States that will be particularly affected by the opening up of the labour market.
Less skilled workers and also self-employed contractors in these Member States will be the first victims of this change.
I expect the Commission to provide these people with adequate protection against unemployment, cheap labour and social dumping.
