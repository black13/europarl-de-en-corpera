Mr President, obtaining a permanent job and establishing a decent lifestyle are very important goals for most young people.
They have been hard hit by the most recent economic crisis and are often forced to take short-term jobs or low paid internships, which also means, of course, that they are not contributing to a pension.
This makes long-term life planning difficult.
Therefore, I would like to know: Does the Commission intend to put measures in place which will guarantee permanent jobs for young people in particular?
Or to put it another way: Are directives being planned which will introduce standards for temporary jobs?
