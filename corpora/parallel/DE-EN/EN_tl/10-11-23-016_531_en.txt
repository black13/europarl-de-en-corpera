Thank you very much, Mr Oettinger, for your clear and convincing answer.
I believe that the Commission has done a great deal towards achieving these objectives.
However, in my opinion, it should be possible to provide the public with more information and to win over the mass media, in order to gain more support in this area.
This is not what is happening in my country, Lithuania, for example.
Of course, that is the responsibility of the national governments, but the Commission could provide them with assistance.
My final question is: In your opinion, which states have been relatively successful in meeting the 2020 objectives and which have not?
