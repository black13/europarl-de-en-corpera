Madam President, Liu Xiaobo has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and we are very pleased about this because it is a demonstration of the universality of human rights, which lies at the heart of our political self-understanding.
We were also happy to see that our pleasure was shared by many countries throughout the world and also by many people in China.
The Chinese Government has responded harshly to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize.
It has reacted excessively harshly, both internally and externally.
I believe that this is regrettable.
It does not seem to me to be a good idea to acknowledge this negative response, if I can express it like this, by caricaturing China's current position.
With all due respect, I must make it clear, although I agree with the previous speaker about supporting the call for the release of Liu Xiaobo, that I think it is not only wrong, but also harmful to describe the China of today as a terrorist state.
In my opinion, this is not true, nor does it help the positive relationship which it is important for us to have with China.
China will have to accept that we support universal human rights, because we will continue to do so.
However, we must not confuse this with a strategy of confrontation.
No one would benefit from this, least of all the supporters of human rights within China.
I have already said and, in summing up, I will say again that China has reacted excessively harshly to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize.
It is attempting to exert diplomatic pressure on other countries not to attend the ceremony in Oslo.
That is simply unacceptable.
Parliament will not accept this and, therefore, I am pleased that the President has already agreed that the European Parliament will be represented in Oslo.
