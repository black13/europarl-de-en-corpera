Madam President, the relationship between the European Union and China is not always a simple one.
Above all, this is due to the fact that we have a different understanding of the importance of human rights, freedom and free speech.
The European Union has taken the responsibility for promoting these values throughout the world and, therefore, for supporting human rights defenders in other states, such as Liu Xiaobo in China, so that they can bring about changes in the situation in their own countries.
For this reason, I believe that it is very important that Parliament, but also the Council and the Commission, clearly commit to attending the award ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Heidi Hautala will be taking part as an individual, but I hope very much that the European governments, the Council, the Belgian Presidency and the Commission will be represented at the highest level.
This is the only way that we can make it clear that our arguments are rational and that our call for respect for human rights throughout the world is a credible one.
