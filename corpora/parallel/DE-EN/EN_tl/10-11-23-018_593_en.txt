Madam President, Mr Cioloş, I am pleased that you are here today to answer questions.
On 18 May, the European Parliament adopted with a large majority a resolution to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP).
Of course, it has not been possible for you to implement this resolution yet, but I would like to ask you, Mr Cioloş, to take into consideration all the demands made in this motion for a resolution when you begin restructuring agricultural policy.
Unfortunately, I have to point out one fly in the ointment.
I have just had a discussion with a group of farmers who were concerned that your proposals for the first pillar, Mr Cioloş, would not reduce the amount of red tape, but could instead lead to a huge increase in bureaucracy.
The European Union cannot be held responsible for every piece of red tape, Mr Cioloş.
A large proportion of the responsibility lies with the Member States.
This is why I am asking you to ensure that we can work together on the forthcoming reform so that it is structured in such a way that it can be implemented with as little administrative and supervisory effort as possible.
This will allow farmers to focus on their main job, in other words, producing food, rather than requiring them to check the current legislation to find out what they need to be aware of before they do anything out in their fields or their barns.
In no other agricultural area in the world are farmers burdened with so many requirements and regulations as in the European Union.
You are not yet responsible for this, Mr Cioloş.
You have the chance to be the first Commissioner - before you eventually step down, and I do not know when that will happen - who can say that during his period of office, the amount of bureaucracy has been reduced rather than increased.
As the rapporteur for agricultural reform, I would like to offer you the opportunity to work together with us to find a solution, so that this goal can be achieved.
