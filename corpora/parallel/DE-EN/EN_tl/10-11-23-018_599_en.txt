Madam President, Mr Ciolo≈ü, ladies and gentlemen, one of our top priorities as Members of the European Parliament is to reduce bureaucracy and simplify legislation and regulations in all the political areas of the European Union.
This is the only way in which we can manage taxpayers' money efficiently and increase the acceptance of our political decisions among the citizens of Europe.
For this reason, it is important for farmers to feel the direct effect of simplification measures of this kind in the agricultural sector.
Their job is to produce food, not to write books.
At a time when local authority budgets are becoming increasingly tight, it is also important for us to reduce the amount of work to be done by their administrative staff.
Regulations must be drawn up in such a way that they are not padded out unnecessarily.
In addition, we must ensure that the sanctions we impose are in proportion to the breach of regulations.
An efficient, long-term policy is characterised by the fact that it places a greater emphasis on advice than it does on punishment.
This is the only way that we can give our citizens and our farmers the incentives to implement new findings and to fulfil society's requirements.
We need to take all of this into account when we discuss the future common agricultural policy.
We also need to focus more closely on ensuring that there is no duplication of formalities and controls and that forms are only filled out when they provide real added value for the administrative bodies and for the farmers themselves.
We must finally learn to work together and not against one another.
