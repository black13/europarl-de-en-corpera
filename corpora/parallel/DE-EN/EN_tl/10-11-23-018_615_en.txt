Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely dangerous to talk about an increase in bureaucracy, because this sort of discussion often backfires.
I hope that this will not be the case here.
I am very pleased, Mr Cioloş, that you have proposed simplified rules, in particular, for small farms, in your communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
That is highly commendable.
There are a lot of things that can be done.
For example, in the case of multiannual commitments in the agricultural environment programme, farmers have to submit new applications every year for the same areas of land.
This is simply ridiculous.
We must go much further and make the system much simpler, for small farms in particular, without losing sight of the fact that we need to achieve our objective of preventing fraud.
Ultimately, we want a CAP which increases the number of flowers in the meadows and not the number of pieces of paper on the desks.
