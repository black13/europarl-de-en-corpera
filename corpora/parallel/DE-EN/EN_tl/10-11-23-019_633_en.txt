Madam President, Mr Ciolo≈ü, ladies and gentlemen, providing protection for bees is in the best interests of the agricultural sector and many farmers are also beekeepers.
We have seen a decline in the bee population in many regions of Europe.
We must identify the causes of this problem and take the necessary countermeasures.
It is a good thing that the budget funding for the national bee programmes up to 2013 has been increased from EUR 26 million to EUR 32 million.
However, that is not enough.
We must ensure that these programmes are continued after 2013.
In order to achieve this, it is also particularly important for us to improve and simplify the process which allows researchers, beekeepers and farmers to share specialist knowledge.
We should focus as soon as possible on combating the diseases and parasites to which bees are subject.
We must not leave the beekeepers to fight this battle on their own.
We urgently need better and more standardised statistics from all the Member States throughout the EU.
This is because we need to work with facts and not just with speculation.
As the number of beekeepers is constantly falling, we also need to invest more in education and training.
We should provide more support for young beekeepers and also for full-time beekeepers, to ensure that the profession has a future and does not die out.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this resolution.
