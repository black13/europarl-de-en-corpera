Madam President, we do not have enough bees and we also do not have enough beekeepers.
The constant decline in the bee population over a number of years sends out a clear alarm signal.
The high levels of bee mortality caused by the Varroa mite and the unresolved problem of colony collapse disorder will unfortunately not go away.
Therefore, we must make sure that the beekeeping sector receives support beyond 2013.
Two points are particularly important to me in this respect.
Firstly, without wide-ranging scientific research, it will not be possible to provide an effective explanation of bee mortality or to do anything useful to combat it.
My second point is about the product of beekeeping, the honey.
The same quality standards must apply to imported honey as to the honey produced in Europe.
Anything else would be seen as an attempt to deceive consumers and to put European producers at a competitive disadvantage.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, have presented some good proposals.
I would like to ask the Commission to take action on this basis.
