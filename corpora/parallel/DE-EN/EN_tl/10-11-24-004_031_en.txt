Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to overcome the present financial crisis we need fundamental changes to economic responsibility in Europe: an increase in financial discipline, monitoring of economic policy and an improvement in the coordination of crisis management.
Strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact would inevitably lead to an increase in economic responsibility.
Successive sanctions could come into play at an early stage in the budgetary surveillance process and account would be taken of the deficit criterion and public debt.
Finally, a new crisis mechanism means, among other things, that banks and insurance providers, for example, can be held accountable.
I call on these institutions to be more responsible towards taxpayers.
I would just like to say one more thing regarding Canc√∫n.
The EU wants to speak with one voice.
These difficult times in particular provide an opportunity to invest in renewable energies and energy efficiency, for example, and in so doing improve the environment as well as our growth policy.
