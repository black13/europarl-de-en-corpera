Mr President, there is one thing that it is important for citizens, too, to understand: the European Union is not in debt.
We are talking here about a debt crisis in our Member States.
The European Union is the only political level in Europe that is debt free.
I would also like it to remain that way.
However, we are joined together in a shared destiny by the euro.
In this regard, Mrs Harms and Mr Schulz rightly lamented the lack of European spirit.
Deauville was a mistake.
Germany and France have been blackmailed by the United Kingdom.
The Commission must impose the sanctions, not the finance ministers.
Mr Van Rompuy, the automatic nature of the sanctions during the preventive phase was sacrificed in Deauville.
The finance ministers must take the decision again here.
These are the ones who were previously responsible for triggering the financial crisis and the debt crisis in the Member States.
What is economic governance?
Everyone is talking about economic governance, but what does it actually mean in specific terms?
Do we really want the European Union to interfere in the details of our labour market and social policy?
There is a big question mark here.
Setting the legal framework for entrepreneurship, stimulating growth, they are all well and good, but above all putting public finances in order once again in the Member States - that is the challenge.
That is why the European Semester is so important, and that is why it must be implemented.
