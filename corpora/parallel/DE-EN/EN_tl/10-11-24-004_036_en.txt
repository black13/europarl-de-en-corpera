Mr Graf Lambsdorff, you are, of course, a member of the Federal Executive Committee of the Free Democratic Party.
Is your assertion that Deauville was a mistake also the opinion of the leader of your party and the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, or is it your personal opinion?
May we take that as the opinion of the FDP or just as the opinion of Mr Graf Lambsdorff?
