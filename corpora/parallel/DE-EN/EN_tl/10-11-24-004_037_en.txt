Mr President, of course I am happy to answer that.
Mr Schulz is, of course, also a member of the Bureau of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and will also occasionally make statements here which are probably not entirely congruent.
There is, however, one thing I would like to say, and it is that, if Mr Schulz can show me who from the FDP was present in Deauville, I would be grateful to him.
We made a relatively clear statement on this at the end of the summit.
I believe that the key point, namely actually relinquishing the automatic nature of the sanctions in the preventive phase, was criticised by us in no uncertain terms.
If we get the change to the treaty, this will be rectified retrospectively.
However, the decision made in Deauville was clearly a mistake.
