Mr President, anti-counterfeiting is an extremely important issue.
Twenty years ago we could still laugh if someone bought a 'Rolex watch' for USD 10.
The market in this premium price bracket was not put at risk by this.
Today the situation is completely different.
In particular, products in the lower and middle price brackets are also counterfeited.
T-shirts, toys and protective clothing are counterfeited, as well as intellectual property.
In this case, it is not only a question of financial interests, but also of safety at work, environmental protection and protection of health, as well as social standards.
Anyone who wants a fair world must fight hard to combat counterfeiting.
