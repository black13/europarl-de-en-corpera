EUR 1 billion per year is available to the European Solidarity Fund.
In the current calendar year, there has as yet been no request for the mobilisation of this Fund.
The rules for the mobilisation of this Fund, which under no circumstances serves to provide compensation for private losses, but rather to restore infrastructures, are laid down precisely.
Ireland has now requested aid that is intended to be used to repair damage caused by floods.
I am voting in favour of the report, as there has not yet been a mobilisation of the Fund this year and the budget really ought to be used in a beneficial way.
Furthermore, Ireland fulfils all of the criteria.
