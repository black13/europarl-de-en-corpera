I voted in favour of the report because it provides a clear and sustainable improvement to patient information on medicinal products.
The advertising of medicinal products continues to be prohibited.
The doctor-patient relationship will not be adversely affected by the directive and the authority of the service provider to prescribe medicinal products remains clear.
Overall, we have a very successful proposal for a directive from the pharmaceutical package for second reading.
