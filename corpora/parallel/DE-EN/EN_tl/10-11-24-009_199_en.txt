This directive will introduce for the first time uniform regulations on the provision of certain information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription.
The necessary information is to explain to patients the benefits and risks associated with prescription-only medicinal products to enable them to make informed decisions.
Following consultation with patient organisations and healthcare professionals, among others, the Commission will adopt quality criteria for information.
These criteria will ensure the reliability of the data provided - including on websites and on Internet portals - and will hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for the information it provides.
Mr Fjellner's amendments also recommend information campaigns to raise awareness among the general public of the risks of falsified medicines, which have already had fatal consequences in Member States such as the United Kingdom.
For years, the EU customs authorities have been noticing a rapid increase in the import of falsified medicines, in particular antibiotics, painkillers and even cancer medicines.
Contrary to some reports in the media, the directive relates only to medicinal products subject to medical prescription.
No one need fear for their herbal tea.
