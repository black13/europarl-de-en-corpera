in writing. - In view of the fact that, in Germany alone, around 25 000 people die each year as a result of adverse reactions and interactions and 3% of accidents can be attributed to prescription-only medicines, it is clear that we must provide patients with better information.
For instance, we could take France as an example, where any functional impairment is clearly indicated on the packet.
We need to provide patients with information, but we also need to help them through the medicinal product jungle, for example by agreeing on the daily routine, package designs or special labelling.
This will save the public purse billions and spare the patients the adverse reactions and interactions.
This proposal contains a couple of initiatives intended to enable patients to be better informed about the medicines they have been prescribed and the use of these medicines.
Whether patients will actually make use of this improved access to high quality information is questionable given the behaviour of many patients.
Nevertheless, it is of course important for the information to be made available throughout the EU.
For this reason, I voted in favour of the report.
