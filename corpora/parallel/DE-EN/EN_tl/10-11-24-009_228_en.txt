The directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS) governs the use of hazardous substances in devices and components.
It is also an important instrument for setting a European, as well as global, standard for manufacturers.
The extension of the scope of the directive is intended to also take account of the waste treatment of hazardous substances.
I abstained from voting, as the report does not yet completely resolve all of the problems associated with the handling of hazardous substances.
