I am very pleased that the report by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Conservatives and Reformists has been adopted.
As a result, the poisoned, demagogic work of the opposition did not have a chance.
Congratulations to the authors, our coordinator, Mr Caspary, and the whole group for showing unity here on this important matter.
