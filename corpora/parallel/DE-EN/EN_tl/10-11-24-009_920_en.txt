I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Conservatives and Reformists on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).
The resolution expresses the same concerns as those expressed by EU citizens with regard to data protection.
It expressly rejects a 'three-strikes' regulation, which has been discussed as a measure to be used in the event of copyright infringements.
The resolution also points out that the agreement must be in line with the acquis communautaire, in other words the common body of EU law.
Counterfeit products and international copyright infringements damage the European economy, thereby putting European jobs at risk too.
Decisive measures must be taken to counter this.
