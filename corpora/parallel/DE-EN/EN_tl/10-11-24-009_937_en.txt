There has certainly been a rapid growth in the market for electrical equipment, in particular in the areas of IT and telecommunications.
This and the ever shorter innovation cycles are also resulting in ever increasing amounts of electrical waste.
The recast of the RoHS Directive is aimed at preventing the use of hazardous substances that could harm the environment or human health.
Some of the proposals are controversial: on the one hand, large computer manufacturers like HP, ACER or Sony Ericsson have pronounced themselves in favour of a ban on all brominated flame retardants in electrical and electronic equipment.
On the other hand, the results of the Commission's studies are clearly not very conclusive, at least as regards the potential damage to the environment.
In addition, there are concerns being expressed by the industry with regard to the ban on PVC, particularly in the area of the cables industry.
The negative properties of PVC are disputed and there is a fear that costs will increase if there is a ban on PVC-covered cables.
These arguments need to be weighed up before specific bans are laid down.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
