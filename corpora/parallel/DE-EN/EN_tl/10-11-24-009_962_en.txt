Elderly people and the chronically ill in particular have a multitude of medicines prescribed to them, which could adversely affect each other - because, of course, one doctor does not know what his colleague has prescribed.
Meanwhile ever more products, from aspirin to cold remedies right through to sleeping remedies are sold without a prescription.
Does anyone actually consider the possibility that even natural plant-based products could interact with various medicinal products?
Patients also contribute to the confusion: nothing is said about prescribed medicinal products that we have taken at the wrong time, or medication that we have taken it upon ourselves to stop taking or to change, and so on.
The economic damages arising as a result of insufficient compliance with treatment instructions run into billions.
Therefore, the clear distinction between advertising and information called for by the rapporteur is important.
This will hopefully result in better clarification of the fact that non-prescription medicines can also interact with prescription medicines.
The prescribing doctor must remain the primary source of information, as only he selects a medicine that is tailored to the patient's age, gender, weight, known intolerances and so on.
In view of these considerations, I abstained from the vote.
