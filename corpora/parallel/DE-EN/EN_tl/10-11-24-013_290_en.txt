Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs and to you, Mr Oettinger, because what you have presented in the last few days and weeks is crucial for the development of the European Union.
However, like Mrs Van Brempt, Mr Turmes and others, I am of the opinion that we need to go a step further, because - if I may say so - a sensible, environmentally sound energy policy is almost like a launch vehicle for green growth and green jobs.
We discussed this again yesterday with the President of the Commission.
Unfortunately, very little has been said about this today.
Nevertheless, we must take these extra steps.
Of course, a lot of what is involved in environment-oriented energy policy is still more expensive.
However, if we consider the environmental benefit, and what it means for European industry to play a leading role, we see that it is also very important for jobs.
Mr Reul is right: we need many energy sources.
Perhaps not all of them - in that respect our opinions differ on many points.
However, we need to know the direction in which energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies are going.
These are the engines of a future-oriented European economy.
