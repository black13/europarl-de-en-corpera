Mr President, I do not know whether I have understood that correctly.
What is important is simply that we have this debate with our citizens openly and - as I said - on the basis of the World Meteorological Organisation's figures.
These are simply average figures for the world, which indicate that the temperature is increasing by 0.63 degrees, but in Europe our values are different.
This is because weather is a local phenomenon and we are talking about climate, which is a long-term global phenomenon.
Therefore, let us make this decision.
If we say that it is becoming increasingly colder and winters are arriving earlier, then we must also communicate that correctly.
Therefore, my appeal for greater communication is important.
