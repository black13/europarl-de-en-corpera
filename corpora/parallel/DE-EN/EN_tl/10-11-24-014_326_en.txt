Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I am concerned that we are going from one extreme to the other.
Prior to Copenhagen we were perhaps too ambitious, and now, ahead of Cancún, I am concerned that we are not being ambitious enough.
I therefore think it is good that, in its resolution, Parliament addresses all the issues that we believe to be necessary for there to be progress and for us to achieve results even in Cancún.
We have one major demand, and that is that the EU switch its strategy.
Prior to Copenhagen, we made ourselves dependent on what was done in the United States and perhaps on what was done in China.
That did not work there and it will not work in Cancún either.
We should therefore take climate protection measures to protect our own interests.
Hence the call by the majority in committee, and I hope in plenary tomorrow too, for us to increase our targets from 20% to 30%.
That will be necessary during the course of the process in any case.
We need to achieve this target at least before we go to South Africa.
I also think that we are still on the wrong track with regard to Kyoto.
Here too, we are relying on everyone else.
I believe that our offer should be to establish Kyoto II.
We will have no problem doing this; we will achieve it.
Finally, with regard to the EU speaking with one voice: I saw how this worked in Nagoya.
We had one microphone for the EU.
Different people could speak, but they had to convey the same message.
That is what I would like to see from the Council and the Commission in Cancún, too.
