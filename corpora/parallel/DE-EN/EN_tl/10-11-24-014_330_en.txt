Mr President, the climate conference in Cancún must exert positive pressure on our states in order to make progress in terms of international cooperation and national climate protection legislation.
As part of an alliance of responsibility, the EU must demonstrate political leadership, regardless of what the United States does, and allow itself to be judged by the principle of climate justice.
This means that there must be a second commitment period for the industrialised nations under the Kyoto Protocol.
Additional funds must be provided for financing climate measures.
With regard to long-term financing, the EU must lay its cards on the table in the negotiations.
The EU must present ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases.
The global temperature must under no circumstances increase by more than 1.5°C. This target will result in technical innovations and create jobs at a time of economic crisis.
