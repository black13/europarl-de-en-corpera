Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, Parliament has already, and on numerous occasions, made a clear commitment to the climate protection measures.
Unfortunately, this attitude would seem to me to be less prevalent among the decision makers in the Member States.
The environment ministers, who are often very ambitious, are in many cases left to their own devices.
Finance and economic ministers and those with responsibility in respect of the economy hopefully also think in terms of longer timeframes.
However, action is taken most often for a very clearly defined space of time, namely the period leading up to the next elections.
Nature, however, can take no account of every-day political necessities.
It will respond to climate change, with all its associated negative consequences for people, indeed for humanity as a whole.
If we do not succeed in communicating the urgency of this matter, and particularly the urgent need to take action, a significant proportion of our funds will have to go towards disaster aid in the not too distant future.
Commissioner, under the motto 'one planet, one voice', I wish you much success in Canc√∫n for the sake of future generations.
