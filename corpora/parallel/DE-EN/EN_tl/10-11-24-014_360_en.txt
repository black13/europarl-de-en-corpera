Mr President, the aim of the climate conference is to establish a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.
We urgently need to make progress in combating climate change.
Overall, the EU is well on the way, relatively speaking, to meeting its climate targets.
However, it would be crucial for us, the EU, together with the United States and China, seek to establish the legal prerequisites for a global climate protection agreement.
In these difficult times in particular, the strengthening of environmental policy will also provide a substantial opportunity for economic policy, for example through investment in renewable energies and energy efficiency.
