Madam President, specific initiatives for growth and employment are to be discussed at the EU-Africa summit, and that is a good thing.
However, it is not good for a ludicrous project like the trans-African Super Highway to be built with EU support, because the 500 km of road, planned for 2012, to be built right through Tanzania and Kenya, right through the largest game reserve in the world, the Serengeti, is a project that should be rejected.
Every year, millions of wild animals roam through the Serengeti to their watering holes in the north.
Scientists are issuing specific warnings about the ecological disaster that is looming here: if the animals cannot access the water, the ecosystem will collapse, biodiversity will be lost and it will damage local tourism, which accounts for 23% of Tanzania's income.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to say a definite 'no' to this project, which represents ecological and economic madness.
Let us protect Africa's last resources, let us save the Serengeti for a second time.
I would also ask you, if you will, to sign the written declaration against this project, the Serengeti Highway, that I have submitted.
