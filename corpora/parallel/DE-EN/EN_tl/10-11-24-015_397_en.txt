Madam President, everyone knows the African proverb that asserts that 'poverty is like a lion; if you do not fight, you get eaten'.
If we consider the current development aid and the cooperation between Africa and the European Union, we cannot help thinking that billions are currently being thrown as food for the lion rather than actually being used to help people.
Of course, the African continent has a whole range of problems.
For one thing, there are the numerous armed conflicts that we do not really succeed in bringing to a peaceful end and which the money provided in aid, which often falls into the wrong hands, repeatedly serves to fuel.
Secondly, the fact that economic growth rates hardly go hand in hand with success in combating poverty is problematic.
In this regard, we need to take seriously the criticism that the EU is pressing the African states to opening up the markets, which could exacerbate poverty and hunger.
This needs to be brought up in the free trade agreement discussions at the EU-Africa summit, along with the criticism that cheap food exports are putting the livelihoods of whole population groups at risk.
