Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the clear words chosen by Mr Piebalgs.
It is important for the European Parliament to show clearly where it stands and also to condemn the brutality that has taken place there.
It has taken us a long time to hold the debate on Western Sahara in the European Parliament, and I think that we have been too hesitant in our actions and that we act only after there have been fatalities there.
I am pleased that we will be able to adopt a resolution tomorrow with all parties, which will perhaps not go as far as one or other of the groups would like, but it represents a broad consensus and is a clear signal to Morocco and to the population of Western Sahara that the European Parliament stands by its fundamental values.
As chair of the Intergroup, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all of its members, who have ensured that Western Sahara has remained, and will continue to remain, on the agenda.
I am certain that, together with Mr Piebalgs and Baroness Ashton, we must remain committed to Western Sahara.
