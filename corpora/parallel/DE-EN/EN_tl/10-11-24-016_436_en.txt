Madam President, Morocco's desire to suppress reports of the incidents in Western Sahara does not show the country in a good light.
When the Gaza aid flotilla was attacked there was an immediate international outcry.
However, when a protest camp was cleared in the occupied Western Sahara, with people being killed in the process, and the town in question was declared a no-go zone, even for journalists, there was a lack of combined dynamic action from the international community.
Of course, it was only to be expected that, in view of the intractable situation, the liberation movement would at some point no longer feel bound by the ceasefire.
This was also linked to a referendum on Western Sahara - a referendum the participants of which could never actually be agreed on.
Meanwhile, more and more Moroccans settled there.
In my opinion, these incidents must be fully investigated.
The European Union should act as a neutral mediator and try to bring both parties in the dispute to the table once again.
