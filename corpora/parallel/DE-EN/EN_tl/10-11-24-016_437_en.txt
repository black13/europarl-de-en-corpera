Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the compromise reached for the resolution.
As coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Fisheries, I am also interested in the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
It is good that we are calling for the resolution for international law to be respected in connection with the exploitation of resources in Western Sahara.
Unfortunately, most Members of this House are not aware that there is an opinion issued by Parliament's legal service which states that the current fisheries agreement with Morocco contravenes international law if it is not demonstrated that the people of Western Sahara benefit from the agreement.
There is currently no demonstration of this and the European Commission has therefore put negotiations concerning renewal of the agreement on hold.
I very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here.
However, it has to be clear to us that we cannot ignore international law on account of economic interests.
