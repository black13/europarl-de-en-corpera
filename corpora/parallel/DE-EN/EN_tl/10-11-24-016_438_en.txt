Madam President, I, too, am very pleased that we finally have a resolution on the conflict in Western Sahara in this House.
I think this should have happened a lot sooner on other grounds, not only after the occurrence of these atrocious incidents in the Gdaim Izyk camp.
I really do not understand why Morocco is not prepared to allow an independent inquiry.
If it has nothing to hide, the inquiry should be carried out.
So why is it not being done?
I very much hope that this resolution will be adopted in Parliament tomorrow - of course that does not mean that there should not be dialogue with Morocco.
Next week, the Moroccan and Algerian foreign ministers, as well as the Polisario Front, are invited to attend a meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs.
I hope they will come and engage in a discussion with us.
However, I do not think the suggestion to postpone the resolution is a sensible one, because, as the European Parliament, it is important for us to respect and support the principle of compliance with human rights, as well as the principle of a people's right to self-determination - in this case for the Sahrawi.
I visited the camps close to Tindouf for the first time 23 years ago.
Since then, this people has been fighting to finally be able to observe its own law and to hold a referendum that is fair and just.
I am therefore pleased that this resolution is now on the table and that tomorrow it will hopefully actually be adopted, too.
