Mr President, we all know that Ukraine is one of the EU's largest neighbouring states and that it has a considerable amount of potential for the future.
Therefore, it is certainly an extremely important partner for the EU.
However, from a political point of view it seems noticeably to be distancing itself from the EU.
It was, of course, not without reason that the pro-Russian fraction was successful in the last local elections.
That probably also represented a defeat for the European Union.
The EU is therefore clearly losing its attraction for Ukrainians.
Ordinary citizens in Ukraine would probably like to be European, but not necessarily part of the European Union.
The EU is gradually giving away its trump cards here by acting rather like an arrogant superpower.
The Ukrainians, however, would no doubt like to be regarded as equal partners, by the EU as well as by Russia.
Therefore, let us not merely look down on the Ukrainians from a lofty height as if their highest goal could only possibly be accession to the EU.
Let us give them the chance to develop their own identity over the coming years and then to decide whether they want to draw closer to the EU or perhaps would prefer to remain independent.
