Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us be frank.
Unfortunately, the Orange Revolution, and I would like to emphasise the word 'unfortunately' here, has not achieved what it should have done.
This is because of the dispute between Mrs Tymoshenko and Mr Yushchenko, among other things.
Mr Yushchenko is now saying that Mrs Tymoshenko is exactly the same as Mr Yanukovych, which is interesting.
Sadly, the local elections have not lived up to our expectations.
They did not comply with European standards and this has now also become clear to the people of Ukraine.
Let us be honest, what Mr Severin meant was something quite different, Mr Gahler.
You should talk to Mrs Tymoshenko in the same way as we do to our friends in the Ukrainian Party of Regions, in other words, you should encourage her to take the European route.
Let us leave the oligarchs behind us and move towards a democratic state.
Do not attempt to interrupt the work of Parliament and we will definitely exert pressure to ensure that European legal standards are met.
Mrs Harms is sitting in the middle.
Although this is not always the position taken by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we can agree on what Mrs Harms has said.
Let us give this country a helping hand, on the basis of European standards and a European legal system.
This is important on all sides.
It is our policy and we will continue with it until we get somewhere.
This is why we were critical of the fact that the elections did not go well.
Make sure that Mrs Tymoshenko helps to set up a constructive opposition.
Advise Mrs Tymoshenko in the same way as we did Mr Yanukovych.
