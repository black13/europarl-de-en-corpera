I would like to ask everyone for their forbearance, but there are some things which simply should not be allowed to happen.
You have a speaking time of four minutes.
Despite my interruption, you spoke for more than four-and-a-half minutes.
I draw a rough line for every Member of this House.
I attempt to be as fair as possible, but in the middle of your speech you said: 'I am keeping an eye on the clock'.
If we want to have more lively debates, this does not necessarily mean that we must read our speeches more quickly.
You should not only be thinking about your French voters - and that applies to all the Members, who should not only be considering their own electorate - because all the citizens of the European Union can access the interpretation of speeches via the website.
If the interpreters cannot follow what is being said, the people in the rest of Europe will not be able to understand your speech, because it was read too quickly.
Therefore, everyone should keep to their speaking time and not break into the speaking time of other Members, because this is ultimately deducted from the catch-the-eye procedure.
