It certainly is my job to interrupt.
You can pay a one-hundred-metre runner EUR 1 million to run the one-hundred-metre race in 10 seconds.
However, even if you pay him EUR 100 million, he will not manage to do it in five seconds.
I am obliged to interrupt Members if they speak too quickly.
I have been a Member of this House for 13 years and I know very well that when the interpreters can no longer keep up, they press a button and a bulb on my desk lights up.
You are very welcome to have a look at it.
It is labelled 'slow down'.
I have already experienced this in the committees.
At some point, the interpreters say that they are going to stop working.
If a Member then complains, the whole thing comes to a grinding halt and the speaker cannot go on speaking.

Mrs Ber√®s, I am doing what you also do in your committee, which is to explain the situation when a point of order is raised.
(Heckling)
It is precisely the same thing.
