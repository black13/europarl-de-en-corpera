I would like to remind you about this once again.
This time I have refrained from interrupting the Member shortly before the end of his speaking time.
However, just as he stopped speaking, the interpreters said: 'He really is speaking too quickly.
We are sorry.'
I would like to ask the Members to keep to a normal speaking speed.
