Mr President, Mr Wieland, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate all three rapporteurs on their reports.
I think that the discussions and negotiations about these three reports were a very good example of how we can reach a common approach in Parliament on important subjects like these.
I would like to focus primarily on one point.
I have the impression that in these three reports we have spoken in great detail about the contribution of trade policy to the three areas of policy addressed in the reports.
In the case of Mr Désir's report, which is about companies, Mrs Saïfi's report, which is about human rights and environmental standards, and Mr Jadot's report, which is about climate change, we have examined very closely what trade policy can contribute to these other policy areas.
However, I often wonder what these individual areas of policy themselves achieve.
Are we imposing a sufficiently strong obligation on the environmental and social policymakers and on policymakers in other areas to do their homework on their own subjects?
In order to ensure that we do not misunderstand one another, I should say that I think we all agree on the objectives.
However, sometimes I am concerned that we are overloading trade policy, when other areas of policy increasingly often do not do their homework.
One example of this is the environmental policymakers in Copenhagen who did not succeed in finding a solution in the field of climate change policy.
The result of this was to overload trade policy with the responsibility for making up for all these shortcomings.
I would be very grateful if we could pay serious consideration here in Parliament over the next few weeks and months to the contribution that other areas of policy could make to trade policy in this respect.
Therefore, I would like to hear us saying in future 'trade and ...' and not always discussing everything else and then also trade.
