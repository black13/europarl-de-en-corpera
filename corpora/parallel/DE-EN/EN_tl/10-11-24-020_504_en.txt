Mr President, the European Union has a major responsibility for human rights, social standards and safeguarding the environment in its current and future trade relations.
These standards form an important basis for the discussions on free trade agreements.
The EU should set an example in all its negotiations and call for fair employment conditions and the sustainable use of resources.
In this context, I would like to highlight, in particular, the current Mercosur negotiations and those with India.
Does the European Union really want to import cheap products which have been manufactured using child labour and which involve the destruction of natural resources?
Our objective must be to ensure good working conditions and good wages in these countries, instead of quick profits.
The European Commission must continue to incorporate clear standards in future trade agreements and to include them in international negotiations.
However, these standards are not just about the ethical considerations and the values which the EU represents, but also about equal treatment for producers both inside and outside Europe.
Other important factors are the growing demand from European consumers for products and the traceability of production methods.
Against this background, I would like to look last of all at Mr Jadot's report.
Paragraph 48 is highly critical of the common agricultural model.
However, this model guarantees a secure supply of high quality food.
The report refers to its apparent negative impacts on climate change.
I would like to make it quite clear that the priority here is food security for our 500 million citizens.
The EU must remain self-sufficient as far as its food supply is concerned and should not become dependent on imports.
This would be a disaster.
I have a strong obligation to the citizens of the EU and, therefore, I cannot support this passage in the report.
