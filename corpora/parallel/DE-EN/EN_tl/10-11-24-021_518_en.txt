Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, anti-dumping measures play an important role in the world.
For us in the European Parliament, and I believe I can speak for the majority of Members here, this is not about protectionism, but about a sensible use of the anti-dumping instrument.
We must be able to defend ourselves if other countries distort competition using state subsidies.
We must be able to defend ourselves if companies dump products onto the market, in other words, if they sell products at less than the cost of producing them, in order to force their competitors out of the market and to gain an illegitimate advantage.
I would like to look at one point in particular.
I would be interested in answers to the following questions from the Commission.
Does the Commission have any experience or any feedback from the Council on the extent to which foreign governments are involved in these activities?
Are there cases where governments in whose countries specific companies are based attempt to influence the decisions made in the Committee on Anti-Dumping Practices?
Have there been reactions or perhaps even attempts to exert influence which have led to a difference in the results of votes?
I would be interested in finding out about this, because companies have come to me in the past with their concerns.
My second point is that on several occasions companies have approached me and asked me to make contact with the Commission and to prevent anti-dumping investigations from taking place in certain cases.
If you impose an anti-dumping duty, this will have a negative impact on European companies doing business in other areas, such as Asia.
I would be interested to know what the Commission's feeling is in this respect.
What is the current state of affairs?
Are there cases of this kind?
