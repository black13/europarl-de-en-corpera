Mr President, cheap labour and social dumping are methods which are used very frequently in developing and emerging countries.
The problem of anti-dumping shows how important it is to call for environmental and social standards, in particular, and also trade protection measures during negotiations on free trade agreements with third countries.
European companies in all areas of manufacturing must not be put at a disadvantage because of their high quality standards, which, of course, are reflected in their prices.
The developments during the current Mercosur negotiations are causing me great concern in this respect.
We must not open the door to social dumping, but instead we must incorporate a sustainable approach into trade agreements.
Dumping is a major problem in the agricultural industry, in particular when it results in the disappearance of small, independent farms which are replaced by agricultural contractors.
In this context, I would like to highlight the own-initiative report on trade relations between the EU and Latin America.
This report clearly explains the concerns of the European Union on social, environmental and production standards.
I would like to thank the Members who raised this important question with the Commission.
