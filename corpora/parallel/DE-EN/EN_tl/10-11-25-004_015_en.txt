Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, this is a joint debate we are holding here.
I am speaking on behalf of the Chair of the Committee on Petitions, who unfortunately is ill, and I would like to limit my remarks to Mrs Paliadeli's report.
This House has often debated and discussed the issue of access to documents and the benefits of transparency and the question of where the line should be drawn between the legitimate rights and interests of the public at large, on the one hand, and the legitimate interests of individuals and companies, on the other.
By the way, Mrs Paliadeli, the shoe can also be on the other foot, namely that information is made available to an NGO and a company or individual then seeks to find out exactly what information has been shared.
We are not considering the question of who is good or bad here, but simply the issue of timeframes and deadlines.
These deadlines must be honoured insofar as they relate to individual citizens and, of course, to the Ombudsman.
This is what you might call a fundamental principle of good administration.
We would expect the Commission, which has shown such an interest in speeding business up, as the Vice-President has already mentioned, to take a closer look at this issue and to effect an improvement.
