Mr President, I also once lodged a complaint with the Ombudsman, and, although things did not work out quite so well for me and I was not satisfied with the judgment, nonetheless I would like to compliment the Ombudsman on his work.
I believe it is very important for us here in this House to support the work he does.
In his opening speech, the Ombudsman rightly pointed out that his success or failure largely depends on the actions of the institutions.
If we consider the Porsche case, for example, then the limits of the Ombudsman's powers and the lack of seriousness with which some institutions regard his recommendations become quite evident.
Of course, it is also necessary for us to put our own house in order, for example, in the case of the purchase of the Altero-Spinelli building, where there have been some enormous irregularities.
The Ombudsman made some clear recommendations and amendments were issued.
However, so far, very little progress has actually been made in Parliament.
The amendments were rejected.
This demonstrates yet again how the House views these recommendations.
What I am getting at is that it is very important for us to put our own house in order and to take the recommendations of the Ombudsman seriously, thereby strengthening his position.
