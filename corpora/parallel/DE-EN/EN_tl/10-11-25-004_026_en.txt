Mr President, Mr Diamandouros has been a real asset for our citizens and for the European Union and I would like to thank him sincerely for his work.
Of course, it also touches on a sore point, namely, the area where improvements are needed.
The Porsche case has just been mentioned.
As a German citizen, I must say that I am thoroughly ashamed of what has gone on here.
Here we have a German Commissioner and a German car company and correspondence between them.
All correspondence between the Commission and other car manufacturers in Italy, Spain and other countries is published, but not the German correspondence.
The Ombudsman has issued not one, not two, but three reprimands and yet no action has been taken.
Things urgently need to improve.
I would like to emphasise this in the strongest possible terms.
The second thing I would like to say is that when we use the word 'pilots', we generally think of a group of professionals who spend their working lives high above the ground.
I am not quite sure how the Commission hit upon the idea of referring to its new project on how to handle the complaints of European citizens as a 'pilot project' because in essence, it offers nothing new.
Citizens first lodge well-justified complaints in their own country.
No action gets taken there.
Hence, they turn to the Commission.
What does the Commission do?
It sends the complaint on a return flight to its country of origin and, once again, nothing gets done.
I do not believe that this is an adequate way of dealing with the concerns and complaints of our citizens and I would like to take this opportunity to ask Commissioner Šefčovič, who I hold in very high regard, to state that he either intends to abandon this project or to reconsider how we can ensure that the complaints of our citizens are sent to the place where they will actually be dealt with and that citizens will receive justice and redress.
