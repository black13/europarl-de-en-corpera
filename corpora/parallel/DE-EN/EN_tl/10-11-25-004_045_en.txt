Madam President, as we know, the European Union has been working for decades to reduce bureaucracy and increase transparency.
However, there is not much sign of this in the European Parliament itself.
On the contrary, one gets the feeling that bureaucratic paperwork seems to grow by the year.
Prior to the hearings for the most recent elections, the word transparency was on everyone's lips.
Thanks to the authority of their office and the associated rights, Members of Parliament can have their voices heard.
The same cannot be said for the citizens of Europe.
That is why they have the European Ombudsman.
When more than one third of the investigations by the Ombudsman were cases where there was a lack of transparency and when 56% of all cases were resolved amicably, the importance of the office of the Ombudsman is clearly evident.
To quote the words of the Ombudsman himself: Citizens have a right to know what the EU and its administration are doing.
Perhaps I might expand on this by saying that our citizens also have a right to know how the European Union spends their taxes and where resources are wasted.
It is high time that budgetary control was whipped into shape, so that its reports might even be somewhere near as useful as those of the Ombudsman.
