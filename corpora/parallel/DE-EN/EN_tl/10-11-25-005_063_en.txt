Madam President, Commissioner, allow me to echo what my fellow Members have said and, above all, to welcome the fact that the European Commission is including the business community, the Member States and the European Parliament in the revision of the rules for horizontal cooperation agreements at an early stage; after all, the existing group exemption regulations are due to lapse at the end of the year.
I believe that the draft from May 2010 contains some important changes, particularly in the areas of standards and the exchange of information, as already discussed.
Both of these will bring greater legal certainty and clearer rules for businesses, something that is extremely important for compliance.
We have already heard that compliance in the European internal market is a principle that must be followed by all businesses.
Competition and innovation are key elements for our economy, which is why it is important to adapt the 2009 rules to our present situation and to introduce effective mechanisms to promote compliance and the implementation of competition law for businesses and public bodies.
It is for this reason that the parliamentary question was backed by such a large majority in the Committee, something I welcome very much.
I would like to ask something about what you have just said.
The fact is that the purchasing agreements of large, international chain stores can be categorised as horizontal cooperation agreements.
In last year's communication on the functioning of the food supply chain in Europe, you were highly critical of the power of demand, but now you seem to view this very positively.
You have just said that cooperation among small retailers is something you welcome, provided the purchasing agreements are in the order of up to a 20% share of the market.
My question to you is: what is the reason for this change in how you view these horizontal purchasing agreements?
What has motivated this change of heart?
