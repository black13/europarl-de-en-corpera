Madam President, I believe that we can organise competition by introducing uniform rules, which is why I am interested to know what options are available to us in the telecommunications sector, specifically in the area of frequency licensing, to enable us to regulate auctions or so-called beauty contests in telecommunications processes.
After all, the new technologies available with the fourth generation networks will open up a whole new world of possibilities.
When you travel to a different country in Europe, you will find that many of the prices that appear on your phone's display are the same.
Do you have any plans to further stimulate competition in the roaming sector?
How do you envisage roaming can be the subject of proper internal market competition and how can you ensure that prices do not jump a thousand-fold when geographical borders are crossed?
