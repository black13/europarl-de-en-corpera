Mr President, with regard to the disaster of the budget negotiations for 2011, I would like to say: firstly, the right to draw up a budget is a central right of any democratic parliament.
Secondly, a parliament that takes itself seriously must exercise this right.
Thirdly, I would like to call on the European Council to respect and accept this self-evident right of the European Parliament.
Fourthly, a process must be found to ensure that the voice of the European Parliament is heard when it comes to budgetary decisions.
