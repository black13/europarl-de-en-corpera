Mr President, the media play a very special and important role in our democratic society.
They guarantee high quality information and thus make a significant contribution to the functioning of our democracy.
I am convinced that a high quality, well-balanced public media environment also has a positive influence on the standard of the private media.
Both public and private media need each other and have a positive influence on one another.
If we want a well-balanced, informative media environment, we must support independent public broadcasters as the counterparts of private broadcasters.
This is one of the keys to the freedom of the press and without it, there can be no meaningful freedom of expression in our community.
