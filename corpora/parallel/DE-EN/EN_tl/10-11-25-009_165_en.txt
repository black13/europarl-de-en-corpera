I have voted in favour of the resolution on the ongoing negotiations on the 2011 budget because to date, the budget negotiations have unfortunately shown that the Council has evidently not found time over the last 12 months to read and understand the Treaty of Lisbon.
All we are looking for here are rights and procedures that are based strictly on what was agreed in Lisbon - nothing more, nothing less.
It was the Council that insisted on the need for the new treaty.
The Council must stick to the treaty and is duty-bound not to allow obvious differences within its own ranks to impact negatively on Europe's citizens.
In this context, I welcome the broad determination of Parliament to agree the 2011 budget as quickly as possible before the end of the year.
We need flexibility.
What is more, we also urgently need the new financial supervisory authorities, as the dramatic situation in Ireland illustrates day-by-day.
