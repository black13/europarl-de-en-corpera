Bees are very important creatures, as without them we would have no pollination.
That is why the growing number of reports on the decreasing number of bee colonies is very regrettable and requires urgent investigation.
This is particularly the case for the agricultural sector, because it is extremely dependent on the useful work of bees.
It is unfortunately evident that industrialism and modern life have made it harder for these beneficial bees to survive.
Scenarios such as the mass extinction of bees as a result of the Varroa mite, the unexplained exodus of bee colonies in the US and the threat to bees from electro-smog and from incorrectly treated seed are unfortunately not just isolated incidents.
It is for this reason that I welcome the fact that Parliament has today agreed to support the beekeeping sector in the future.
I believe it is important that we concentrate on research into bee populations.
Without precise scientific data, we shall not be able to identify problems and deal with them effectively.
I hope we will succeed in explaining and preventing the decline in bee colonies, so that we can continue to profit from the important, multi-faceted role of bees.
