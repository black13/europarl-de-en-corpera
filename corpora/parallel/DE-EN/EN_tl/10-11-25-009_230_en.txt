I welcome the fact that, according to this report, the Commission and Member States are to ensure that the highest international safety standards are applied in both new and old nuclear power stations.
I also voted in favour of this clause.
However, I would like to clarify the fact that the discontinuation of nuclear power remains my ultimate goal.
Although we must move away from energy production using fossil fuels, nuclear energy is not the alternative.
The potential risk is still too great and the issue of the final storage of nuclear waste is still unresolved.
Promoting low carbon energy sources is a well-known argument used by the nuclear lobby to take the sting out of nuclear power.
However, climate change should not be used to justify the expansion of our nuclear power.
