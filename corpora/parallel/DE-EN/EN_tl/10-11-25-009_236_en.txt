In her report, the rapporteur deals with an improvement in Europe's energy supply, something that is to be welcomed.
However, it would seem that this goal is to be achieved by increasing the influence of the EU over the energy sector.
Energy policy is something very specific from country to country.
There is little agreement in Europe concerning the use of nuclear energy and 'renewable' forms of energy in particular.
For this reason, and because I believe that we should continue to decide for ourselves how we obtain our energy, I am convinced that energy policy is something that should be left up to the individual Member States.
I have therefore voted against this amendment.
