I have voted against today's motion for a resolution on the climate conference in Cancún (COP 16) because I feel duty-bound to climate protection, by which I mean realistic climate protection that combines sustainability and economic development.
It is a major step for me to vote against a report I played a significant role in drafting.
However, the motion for a resolution is a 'green pipe-dream' that pursues excessive and unrealistic targets.
We have succeeded in talking down some of the demands, such as limiting the rise in the average temperature to 1.5 °C. If we had pursued this demand, we would have had to reduce our emissions to zero in the next ten years and strive for negative emissions in the short or long term.
We did not manage to prevail in respect of a unilateral rise in EU reduction commitments, despite the fact that this is not helpful to negotiations at present and that we lack investigations as to how specific reductions are to be achieved.
We must avoid making such demands, as we risk losing credibility among our partners throughout the world, particularly those who are still unsure about joining with us.
Credibility is our chief asset at present.
I am convinced that in our efforts to secure this, Europe must speak with one voice.
That is why I am supporting the Council and the Commission.
