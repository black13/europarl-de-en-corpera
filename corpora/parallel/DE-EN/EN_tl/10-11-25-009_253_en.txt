During the forthcoming climate conference in Canc√∫n, globally binding limits are to be agreed for CO2 greenhouse gas emissions because the previous Kyoto protocol runs out in 2012.
While the European Union is working to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% by the end of the decade, Parliament is actually looking for a 30% reduction.
We have not succeeded in achieving our climate targets to date, a situation that will not improve by setting a higher percentage reduction.
This is particularly the case when emissions trading simply allowed some of the emissions to be moved elsewhere.
Here in Europe, we have a high level of environmental awareness, something that is not the case in some of the so-called emerging economies.
One only has to think of China or India, for example.
I am quite sceptical in relation to the system used to date.
My scepticism stems mainly from the fact that more nuclear power stations are to be built in order to reduce CO2 emissions.
This would simply mean jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.
I simply cannot support such a proposal.
