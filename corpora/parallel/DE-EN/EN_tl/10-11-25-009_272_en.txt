The fall of the Soviet Union gave the people of Ukraine the first opportunity in their history to decide their future with freedom and national autonomy.
The states and people of Europe owe a debt of solidarity and support to the great people of Ukraine, who paid an enormous price in the Stalinist period and in the Second World War, through the loss of many millions of lives.
The Orange Revolution proved that the people of Ukraine wish to shape their future under democratic conditions where the rule of law is upheld.
This is something that should never be forgotten by those in Ukraine who have political, economic and social responsibilities.
The management of the recent regional elections and the events before and after the elections in Ukraine give one cause to wonder whether the actions of those with political responsibility in Ukraine really do reflect the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.
The present resolution amplifies the position of the European Parliament whereby Ukrainians can be sure of the solidarity of the people of Europe, while also calling on Ukraine's politicians to respect the will of their people to live by democracy, freedom and the rule of law.
As a signatory, I have voted in favour of this joint motion for a resolution.
