This report is an attempt to find a solution to the problem of globalisation, a problem that the EU has itself created.
Cheap products are produced in countries outside the European Union under completely different conditions and are then imported cheaply into Europe, putting pressure on European wage levels and weakening our economy.
This report deals with the much higher levels of CO2 produced as a result.
However, it does not seek to impose an appropriate commercial disadvantage on the relevant products, but rather, on the contrary, favours giving away European technology and expertise to the world at large.
This will do nothing to reduce the globalisation problem, but will instead make it much worse.
It is for that reason that I have voted against this report.
