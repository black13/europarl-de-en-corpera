This report also seeks greater regulation of business by the European Union.
However, the European Union has frequently shown that its restrictions do not strengthen business or improve quality of life, but tend to be more counter-productive.
Happily, the rapporteur is aware of how important it is to put a cap on the worst excesses of globalisation.
He demands quite specifically that international trade should only be liberalised to the extent that will benefit all levels of society and provided that this improves the quality of life.
It is for that reason that I abstained from voting.
