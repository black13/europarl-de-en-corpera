Horizontal cooperation agreements can bring considerable economic advantages.
Thus, competitors share the risk, costs are saved, investments, know-how and product quality improve and variety and innovations can be more quickly implemented.
On the other hand, horizontal cooperation agreements can reduce competition if the competitors set prices, fix outputs or force the division of the markets.
Clear agreements which ensure stability would therefore be very welcome.
I am abstaining from the vote, because some points are still not worded sufficiently clearly.
