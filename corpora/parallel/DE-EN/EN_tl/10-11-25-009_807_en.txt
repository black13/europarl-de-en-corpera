I voted in favour of the report, as I believe that companies engaging in trade have a certain responsibility towards the people that work for them.
Firstly, the inclusion of social responsibility clauses in the trade agreements with third countries creates equal conditions for the companies in the EU and in these third countries and provides protection for the workers.
However, when the clauses are laid down, the principle of proportionality must be taken into account.
They must represent a balance and must not be set out in such a way that they impede trade to such a degree that it first has a detrimental effect on the workers and, subsequently, on consumers too.
