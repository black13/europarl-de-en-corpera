The EU has a responsibility to incorporate aspects of environmental policy relating to trade into its international trade policy.
I support the first steps in this direction already taken by the EU in its trade agreements.
However, there is still more to be done.
I was unable to give my support to Article 48, however.
Agricultural subsidies are necessary for food security and independence for 500 million Europeans and, for me, this is of central importance.
The subsidies also enable diversity in farming and contribute to landscape conservation.
