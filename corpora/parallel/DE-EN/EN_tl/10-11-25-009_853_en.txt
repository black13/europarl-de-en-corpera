The fact that the European economy had to cut back on its production on account of the crisis, resulting in reduced levels of emissions, is not an argument for the 30% reduction in CO2 emissions being called for by the EU Climate Action Commissioner, Mrs Hedegaard, now that the 20% reduction can easily be achieved as a result of the economic crisis.
However, climate protection can only succeed if it is carried out globally.
There is little point in reducing CO2 emissions throughout the EU while, at the same time, shifting industries that are harmful to the climate and the hazardous waste from industrial nations to developing countries.
On the other hand, restrictive EU measures hold our economy back and impede our companies in international competition.
Therefore, we should say 'yes' to climate protection, but not at the expense of our companies and not if we are the only ones taking the measures.
I therefore voted against this motion for a resolution.
