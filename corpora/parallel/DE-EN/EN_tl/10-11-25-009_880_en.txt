A sustainable European energy strategy is the basic prerequisite for safeguarding energy supplies and must therefore cover all aspects of the provision of energy.
An optimum energy supply is also important for a flourishing economy, as it provides and creates jobs.
I welcome the fact that the report emphasises the potential of the biomass resources of the EU Member States for producing significant quantities of second generation biofuels.
The use of fossil energy must be significantly reduced in the next few years.
Biomass can play a considerable part in replacing oil and gas.
For independence and security of supply, the necessary resources must also be available in the field of energy.
Agriculture can make a significant contribution to achieving the EU 2020 goals.
We need to recognise the signs of the future and invest in renewable energy sources and green technologies.
I support the parts of the report which call for measures to develop a sustainable energy policy in Europe with international importance.
