In 2010, the beekeeping sector suffered massive losses and bee stocks declined considerably.
This has a negative impact on the whole environment and on agriculture, as bees are important pollinators.
The situation is particularly bad when it comes to honey bees.
I have therefore voted in favour of this report, which takes measures to tackle the massive bee mortality.
