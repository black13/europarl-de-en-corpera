The loss of bee colonies is an EU-wide problem, the causes of which cannot yet be fully explained.
Factors such as the use of plant protection products, unsustainable farming techniques, climate change, pathogens and parasites and a lack of food and foraging as a result of the increase in monocultures have altogether resulted in a significant decline in the number of honey bees.
In addition to ecological consequences, this also has an economic impact, as increasing amounts of honey have to be imported.
In order to be able to tackle this problem, European beekeeping should receive more support in future.
The report takes a thoroughly balanced approach and that is why I have voted in favour of it.
