Women continue to be discriminated against in many countries of the world.
Violence against women is on the agenda, and this is particularly dramatic in conflict situations.
Studies reveal that women in crisis regions where there are military conflicts are often raped and/or subjected to sexual slavery.
It should be a prime objective to punish sexual violence towards women as crimes against humanity, including in war-torn regions of the world.
After all - and the Western nations also have a responsibility here - sexual exploitation is unjustifiable and criminal behaviour at any time.
The report addresses important issues and I therefore voted in favour of it.
