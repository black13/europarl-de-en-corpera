Information is gold.
In order to provide citizens with objective information and to fulfil the task of educating, we have public service broadcasters in the area of television and media.
In return for broadcasting high quality programmes, these broadcasters have a right to funding from fees.
Broadcasting represents the main source of information for citizens.
Some public service broadcasters have rather successfully changed their programmes as a result of competition from private broadcasters.
The best example of this is the British broadcaster, the BBC.
Others, like the Austrian ORF, are not only suffering as a result of falling viewing figures; they also cannot genuinely fulfil the requirement for impartiality and objectivity due to their party political influences.
In addition, private broadcasters have started a debate as to whether broadcasting fees are, in fact, legitimate at all, as public service broadcasters also, of course, profit from advertising income.
As the organisation and the framework conditions are different from one Member State to the next, no standardising decision can be taken at EU level.
I have therefore abstained from the vote.
