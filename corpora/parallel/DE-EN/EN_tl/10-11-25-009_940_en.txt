Evaluations are a means, where necessary, of making adjustments.
The EU Pilot Evaluation Report raised a number of questions in the committee responsible, which is why the European Commission has been called on to make available the relevant data.
We need to examine the question of what is more sensible in particular cases: the EU Pilot or the previous treaty infringement proceedings.
In this connection, the possibility of a revision of the treaty infringement proceedings should not be disregarded either.
What is important is that, irrespective of what form, revision or combination thereof is chosen for the future, it should not result in more bureaucracy and, in particular, it should meet the EU objective of greater transparency.
Although this report contains some good proposals, it cannot fulfil the specified aims.
For this reason, I have abstained from voting.
