The European Union has been working for decades to reduce bureaucracy and increase transparency.
There is often not much sign of this in the European Parliament itself.
On the contrary, I get the feeling that bureaucratic paperwork increases by the year.
Prior to the hearings for the most recent elections, the word transparency was on everyone's lips.
Thanks to the authority of their office and the rights that come with it, Members of Parliament can have their voices heard.
The same cannot be said for the citizens of Europe.
That is why they have the European Ombudsman.
When more than one third of the investigations carried out by the Ombudsman involved cases where there was a lack of transparency and when 56% of all cases were resolved amicably, it only serves to confirm how important the office of the Ombudsman is.
However, I cannot fully support the rapporteur's statements and for that reason, I am abstaining from the vote.
