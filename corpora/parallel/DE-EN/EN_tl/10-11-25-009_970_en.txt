It should certainly be in the interests of the EU to conclude trade agreements primarily with equal partners.
This means that more attention should be paid to human rights and environmental and social standards, because, as long as the EU complies with these standards, it can also require them of its trade partners.
However, particularly in the area of human rights, as well as social and environmental standards, the EU repeatedly hits a brick wall when other countries with which it has concluded bilateral trade agreements have different opinions in this regard.
I am abstaining from the vote, because I would question whether it would actually be possible to implement what the rapporteur has proposed.
