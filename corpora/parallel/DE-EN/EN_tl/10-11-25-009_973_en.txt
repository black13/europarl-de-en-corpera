I voted in favour of the report, as human rights, social standards and environmental standards should apply in all countries, not just in Europe.
Within our sphere of influence are those states with which we trade.
There is a responsibility associated with this which we ought to fulfil, and this report points us in the right direction.
It is the direction towards fair trade and, in particular, fairness towards the people and the environment.
If we are able to improve something in these areas, we should do so as far as we possibly can.
