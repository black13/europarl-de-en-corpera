The budget talks have failed on account of the conflict between budget stability and adaptability.
Thus, representatives of the European Parliament are calling for broad budgetary flexibility, but without considering the interests of the countries that are net contributors.
It is the net contributors which finance the EU, are responsible for restarting the engine of the economy after the crisis and which are rescuing the countries with large budget deficits, as well as the euro itself.
It is therefore justifiable for them to keep to the binding budgetary appropriations, so that the net balance cannot be changed retrospectively on a whim and money thereby wasted.
Those who are investing and paying out money must be assured of the greatest possible level of stability.
Equally, the critical attitude to EU taxation has nothing to do with an apparent 'lack of solidarity'.
It is simply due to the fact that the majority of Member States are clearly opposed to it and are retaining the ratification by the national parliaments for the sake of subsidiarity.
The 'emancipation of the European Parliament' that is so often quoted in this context seems to me to be more like a very disturbing emancipation from EU citizens.
I therefore voted against this motion for a resolution.
