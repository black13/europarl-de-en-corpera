Particularly in times of financial crisis, when citizens are being asked to tighten their belts and accept massive cuts in the social and family-related spheres, rigorous savings must also be possible in the EU budget.
Instead of this, an increase of a good 3% is planned.
Some projects have simply been pushed back so that, in the foreseeable future, we then have the prospect of only the most immediate major expenditure.
There would be numerous opportunities to make savings, for example, in connection with the two locations for plenary sittings, or by finally whipping the EU's fight against fraud into shape and fully recovering the funds that have been incorrectly paid out.
We also need to consider whether all of the prestige projects really should be continued.
Some of these will certainly also be future-oriented, but the implementation of some projects raises doubts as to their rationale or approach.
I cannot support this EU budget for 2011 under any circumstances.
