The European Union's budget forms the framework within which its Member States can act.
Particularly during economically uncertain times, it is important to be able to rely on commitments made in this regard.
It must be possible for people to have confidence that the funds will actually be made available to them.
I am talking here to the farmers in particular.
Unused funds in the area of agriculture does not mean that they were not needed.
It just means that they have been managed very carefully.
Farmers must not be punished for this by shifting the funds to other areas.
In the interests of EU citizens, agriculture must be safeguarded financially.
A compromise must be found as quickly as possible so that we can adopt the 2011 budget.
Only once we have done that can the financing for agriculture be safeguarded and national bottlenecks avoided.
