Madam President, on 10 November, five people were killed in a bomb attack against Christians and just a few days previously, there was an attack on a Catholic cathedral.
One hundred people were taken hostage and 40 died as a result.
In recent years, 900 000 Christians have fled Iraq.
These events offer a sad illustration of the situation for Christians in Iraq and in the entire Middle East region.
These are not isolated incidents, but rather a global trend that is being played out on Europe's borders, as well as in Egypt and also, occasionally, in Turkey.
The EU should be able to exert enough pressure to combat discrimination against Christians.
We only have to think of the northern part of Cyprus, where approximately 150 churches have been destroyed or converted into mosques since the Turkish occupation and where only one church remains where the Christian population is permitted to celebrate one mass each year.
Remember, this is not Iraq I am talking about, but an island in the Mediterranean on the edge of Europe.
I believe that it makes sense to introduce a permanent system for monitoring Christian persecution.
Concrete actions would have to follow; for example, the consistent inclusion of clauses prohibiting the persecution of Christians in international trade agreements with the EU.
We cannot have a situation where we want to do business but are content to turn a blind eye when Christians are persecuted.
I would like to close with a few words about the former foreign minister, Mr Aziz: Even former members of the Saddam Hussein regime are entitled to the due process of the law.
Revenge executions have no place here.
Even these former ministers deserve a fair trial.
This cannot be accepted, particularly in a young country that aims to become a democratic state.
For this reason, I would call on the EU to take the appropriate steps and to proceed clearly.
