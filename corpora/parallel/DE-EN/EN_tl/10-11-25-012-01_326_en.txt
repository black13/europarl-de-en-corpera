Madam President, it is a scandal that, after 2 000 years of the presence of Christian communities in the geographical area now known as Iraq, these communities are threatened with disappearance, particularly in view of the intervention by the West in recent years and the fact that these events are taking place under a democratic government that has the support of the European Union.
We cannot tolerate this.
Apart from the general issues of religious freedom, this is an absolute scandal and I welcome the fact that a number of Christian bishops from Iraq are to travel to Strasbourg in December in order to inform us in detail of the situation of their religious communities.
We must be clear that it is not enough to make the occasional tired gesture, but that we have a genuine responsibility here.
Eighty percent of Europeans are Christians.
Naturally, we are in favour of religious freedom in general, but who is going to look after the interests of these people if we do not?
These are people who even survived the vile regime of Saddam Hussein in their country, but whose very existence is now under threat.
That is why the European Parliament must focus its human rights work in this area.
I would call on Baroness Ashton to do the same and to keep us regularly informed of the situation of these Christians.
