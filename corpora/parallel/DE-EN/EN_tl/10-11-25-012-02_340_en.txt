Madam President, when we rise to speak in the European Parliament, we can use our native language.
The Chinese Government is planning to withdraw this fundamental right from the Tibetans, threatening them with a loss of identity.
Thousands of Tibetans have campaigned against the possible end to bilingual policy in peaceful protests in schools and universities.
On 27 October, I received a petition in front of the European Parliament building in Brussels from Tibetan schoolchildren seeking our solidarity.
China's ambassador, Mr Song, yesterday emphasised that bilingual education in Tibet was an important measure to support Tibetan culture.
While I have heard what he has to say, I am not sure I believe him.
After all, he has not denied the numerous media reports indicating that Mandarin Chinese is to be the main language used in educational institutions in the Quinghai region.
Cantonese and Shanghainese are also to be replaced by Mandarin throughout the education system and even on the radio, this despite the fact that the government claims that Mandarin is only spoken by half of the Chinese population.
Article 4 of the constitution and Article 10 of the law on regional autonomy emphasise the freedom of all ethnic groups to develop their own written and spoken language.
Commissioner Lewandowski, I would urge you to ensure that this worrying development is raised during dialogue between the EU and China.
Please send a group of experts to the region on a fact-finding mission to establish where the threat to the bilingual system lies.
The Tibetan language can be supplemented by Chinese, but certainly not replaced by it.
