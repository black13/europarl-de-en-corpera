(The speaker is answering a blue card question from Cristian Dan Preda in accordance with Rule 149(8)).
Madam President, I am much obliged to my fellow Member for asking this question, as it gives me the opportunity to repeat what I said before.
I did not say that you should believe the Chinese ambassador.
What I said was that we would be well advised to take our job seriously and to seek dialogue, and then to discuss a resolution.
It makes no sense to suggest that we should adopt a resolution now and then send experts to China to find out whether, and where exactly, bilingualism is under threat.
I believe that if we want to do something about the effectiveness of human rights, then we do not need simply to express pious intentions, but must also engage with the issue in order to avoid damaging an already difficult situation.
