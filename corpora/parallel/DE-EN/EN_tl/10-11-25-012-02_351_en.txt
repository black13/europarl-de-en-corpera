Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Tibetans must be allowed the right to speak in their native language, Tibetan.
It is a right that we all have.
Otherwise, they will lose their cultural identity.
On account of the situation in Tibet, I believe that bilingualism, in other words, learning Tibetan and Chinese, is the appropriate solution.
After all, bilingualism promotes the development of children in many different ways and is certainly to be supported.
