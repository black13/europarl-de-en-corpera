Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the images of the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi following her release from house arrest are still fresh in our minds.
They show a person who is unbowed by years of isolation, leaving us in no doubt that she will continue to campaign for democratic change in her country.
Any step in the direction of democratisation and an improvement in the extremely problematical human rights situation is to be welcomed.
However, this is not going to be an easy process.
The constitution now in place in Burma, following the undemocratic elections, puts the president above the law and guarantees an amnesty for past human rights violations.
This must be criticised in the sharpest terms by the European Union, as must the continued serious human rights violations against ethnic minorities, who are frequently driven from their lands and forced into slave labour, many of their children being recruited as child soldiers.
We must redouble our efforts to bring on board countries that have a significant influence on the government in Burma, such as China and India.
We must persuade them to exert their influence in the interests of the people of Burma.
They need to implement the undertakings they gave in respect of human rights by ratifying the ASEAN Charter; this charter calls on Member States to take action to combat systematic human rights violations.
