Madam President, speaking for myself and my colleague, Mrs AndrikienÄ—, we are very pleased to learn that our Sakharov laureate has been released.
However, we must not forget that there are still at least 2 200 other political prisoners being held in terrible conditions under the Burmese military dictatorship.
As was stated earlier, the whole country is like an open prison.
That is why we now need to be very critical and vigilant.
Was this all just a cosmetic operation or have the brutally manipulated elections exposed the true nature of the regime?
We must now use all the mechanisms available to us to press for change.
This change can be regarded as an acid test.
We must press for our Sakharov laureate to be allowed to travel here in December to collect her prize after a delay of 20 years and for her to be permitted to return to her homeland unmolested.
Only then will we have the slightest cause for hope that things are changing for a people who have been suffering under a corrupt socialist dictatorship for decades.
