Mr President, we have no objection to this topic being placed on the agenda.
However, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that members of some committees - and not just from our group, I think - still have concerns regarding the specific rules.
Certainly we need a deadline for the submission of amendments, so that we can vote on Thursday at the latest.
I would just like to say, however, that some discussions are still ongoing and I cannot say in advance whether or not our group will be voting in favour.
The debates are yet to come.
However, we have no objection to this topic being on the agenda.
