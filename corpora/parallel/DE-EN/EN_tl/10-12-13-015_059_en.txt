Mr President, I have long been an advocate of the euro, but now its future is at stake.
The Heads of Government in Europe do not have the courage to finally stop throwing good money after bad.
It is time to stop saying: 'Let's put the problem off for a couple of years'.
Instead, we need to finally be brave and responsible enough to take a debt haircut.
Only then will the banks be able to be held accountable.
It will hit people like us too - via our pension funds and life assurance.
However, where this is concerned, we need to bite the bullet now, rather than prolonging the agony.
This is where the great problem lies.
In this connection, I should like to call on all my fellow Members to become involved in the initiatives from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, particularly as regards financewatch.org, so that in the future, we will actually be able to find ways of proceeding against the banks, against the lobbyists who are unfortunately still dictating matters here, and to get independent information.
