Madam President, as we are aware, the officers of the Frontex border guard agency carry out important work as part of the operational cooperation between the Member States and third countries to combat illegal immigration.
In my opinion, this needs to be effectively combated in the transit countries in particular.
A dense network of immigration liaison officers and their close cooperation is therefore a sensible measure to enable us effectively to combat mass immigration into Europe with all its negative consequences for the peoples of Europe.
It must be ensured, however, that the information and assessments provided by liaison officers are made available to Frontex and the national authorities as quickly as possible and without any red tape.
In general, we definitely need greater cooperation on immigration issues between all the actors.
In my opinion, the powers of Frontex should be enhanced as quickly as possible - with the consent of the Member States - in order to be able to ensure that its work is uniform and effective, particularly at the external borders.
