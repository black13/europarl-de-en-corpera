Madam President, the Member States send immigration liaison officers to third countries in order to combat illegal immigration in contact with the authorities in those countries.
I therefore consider cooperation between these officers and Frontex to be urgently necessary.
We need a meaningful exchange of information and best practice, and we also need to avoid having duplicate structures.
I hope that such synergies will result in more efficient border controls - particularly since Frontex has no external officers of its own in third countries.
A key element of this cooperation must be the consistent processing of readmission agreements, whether in Eastern Europe or on the continent of Africa, because chaos reigns in the EU where the repatriation of illegal immigrants is concerned.
Some Member States proceed with great vigour, while others are very sluggish.
Naturally, this then has negative implications for all the Member States.
There is therefore an urgent need to act.
Frontex needs to be bolstered, and the EU also needs to force authorities in the Member States to fulfil their responsibilities.
