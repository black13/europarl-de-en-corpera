Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur on good governance; in particular, I want to express my thanks for her positive cooperation and to congratulate her on this excellent report.
This report shows the Commission what needs to happen in the time ahead, particularly in the area of the partnership principle.
It states how it must be ensured that local and regional levels are also involved, and how economic and social partners as well as representatives of civil society need to be involved in all phases - in the implementation and in the evaluation of the Structural Fund.
That represents a commitment by the Member States to real partnership.
It means that the partners will be empowered to talk to the administrations as equals, through training initiatives and financial support; it means that the partners will have a real influence on the form the programmes take.
So far, however, we have seen little commitment on the part of the Commission.
That applies just as much to the current period as to the proposals that it has made on the matter.
I welcome the fact that Mr Olbrycht said that if this development and investment partnership contract comes about, it will only be possible if there is a partnership and if the partners are involved in developing these plans on an equal footing.
Otherwise, there is a risk that we will move from being a Europe of regions to being a Europe of Member States, and that is not our aim.
Our aim is regional development and the involvement of the local and regional levels, of the economic and social partners, and of civil society.
