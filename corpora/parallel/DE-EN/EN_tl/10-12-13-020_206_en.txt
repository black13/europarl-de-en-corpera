Mr President, I should like to make four comments on these reports.
The first is that the European Union only makes sense to people if it tries to alleviate economic, social and territorial disparities.
The second is that European cohesion policy is the crucial financial policy instrument for achieving this objective.
My third comment is that those who criticise this should really come up with an alternative.
If they have no alternative to offer, then they should keep quiet.
My fourth point is that my home region - I come from eastern Germany - is an area where this policy has advanced economic development.
We are on the right path, but we still have some way to go.
We will therefore continue to need further support after 2013 if we are to keep making progress.
