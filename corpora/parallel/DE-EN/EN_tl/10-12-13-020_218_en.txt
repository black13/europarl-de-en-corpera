Particular attention needs to be paid to the EU's cohesion policy in the interests of greater sustainable growth and increased competitiveness.
In a Europe of the regions, GDP should continue to be the main criterion in determining regional eligibility for funding.
However, European regional policy must cover all the regions, while being sufficiently flexible to take into account regional and territorial differences.
If we are to exploit fully the potential for growth of the regions and achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion in the European Union, it is essential that particular attention is paid to competitiveness.
In so doing, we must also take into consideration small-scale problems in wealthy Member States.
In particular, research and innovation should play an important part in all the regions as a means of improving the EU's competitiveness, which is why it is necessary to continue to promote these areas in the future.
Although the EU 2020 objectives are defined at Community level, it is vital that the local and regional authorities are involved more in their implementation; a bottom-up approach is essential if we are to implement the economic objectives of the EU 2020 strategy efficiently.
