Mr President, accession on the part of the EU to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms also conceals the risk that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) will be able to pass judgment on any EU legal act; the judges of the European Court of Justice have already warned against taking this step.
I very much doubt that the ECHR will always pass neutral and appropriate judgments.
Its President has himself admitted that he would examine cases brought by asylum seekers more closely than other cases.
Preferential treatment for certain complainants is not fitting conduct for a neutral judge.
The ECHR is currently attempting to suspend the Dublin Convention and prevent deportations from Austria to Greece.
Why is this?
Is Greece unsafe?
Do we really want to be subject to a court that wants to ban the cross in classrooms?
The cross is the symbol of Christianity, one of the foundations of Europe and of our fundamental values.
If the European Court of Human Rights clearly has no respect for such human rights, I cannot see that it is possible to recognise it here as an approved and appropriate decision-making body.
