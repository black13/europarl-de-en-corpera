Madam President, the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction.
The principle must be that recognised victims of violence are afforded the same level of protection in all Member States.
The best solution would be harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on this matter, but it was not possible to achieve this.
A positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad: sexual violence, stalking and, above all, exploitation of minors, which I consider to be very, very important.
It therefore sends a positive message to the victims of violence and to women in particular.
However, there is one fly in the ointment: the grounds for non-recognition in Article 9 are very extensive and may also, to some extent, represent a means for Member States to avoid compliance with the directive.
Therefore, in a year's time, we need to assess very carefully how we can take this debate further, because all victims in all countries need the same protection.
