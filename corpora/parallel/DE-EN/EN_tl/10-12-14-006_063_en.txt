Madam President, even though some measures have been taken in recent years to protect victims, many of the people affected often feel left in the lurch.
While lawyers and judges hear a great deal in their training about the rights of defendants, they learn very little about dealing with victims.
This is not the only area where greater awareness is necessary.
It is also needed in medical training so that the use of violence can be better recognised.
For child victims, the matter of the statutory limitation of civil compensation claims in the case of sex offences is essential.
Only those who have an unblemished criminal record are allowed to work with children.
If, for example, forced marriages are now being prosecuted in Liechtenstein, even without the consent of the victim, and it is possible to take legal action in the case of genital mutilation performed on a minor, this clearly shows the potential danger of the much lauded multicultural enrichment.
In my opinion, it is important to take this development in the EU into consideration, as well as its significance in the fight against human trafficking.
