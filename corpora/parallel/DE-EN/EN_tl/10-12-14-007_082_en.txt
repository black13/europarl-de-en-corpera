Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs.
They have done a huge amount of work and, as a result, definite progress has been made.
It could be said that the draft directive is extremely important for the hundreds of thousands of victims of human trafficking and it should put an end to their lawless status.
It goes as far as to say that not only protection, but also prevention and, above all, compensation, should play a part.
It has a broad area of application relating to human trafficking.
We believe this to be right, even though we, of course, have difficulty with the problem of begging - which I openly admit - and also in many respects with illegal migration.
It is right that references to gender are to be found throughout this directive and - what to me is the most important point - that the welfare of children is taken into account in the case of unaccompanied minors.
I would also like to say from a German point of view that in this respect, we have a lot of ground to make up and I am very pleased that this aspect concerning the children plays a very important part in this draft directive.
Another point worthy of recognition is the fact that, when dealing with this problem, special account must be taken of pregnant women and people suffering from illness or disability.
Preventive measures, such as the training of public officials and the introduction of coordinators in the Member States, constitute major steps in the right direction.
If we vote in favour of this today, we deserve to be congratulated.
I also hope that this subject will be taken more seriously in the Member States, because in any case, they now have to present reports.
Perhaps that will also go some way towards achieving this.
