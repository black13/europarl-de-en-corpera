Madam President, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs.
Thank you for your cooperation.
I think we have put together a good document today.
We can take a decision on something today that can really put paid to human trafficking.
However, the challenge will be getting the Member States to put this directive into practice.
It is crucial that the enforcement bodies, such as the police and the courts, are made aware of how to actually recognise and to prosecute this crime.
This is vital, and it is also very important to raise public awareness - as Mrs Matera has already mentioned - so that people are aware of the fact that human trafficking is happening within the EU.
It is not just happening somewhere else; theoretically, it could also be happening right outside my front door.
Another important point that, as Liberals from Germany in particular, we had difficulty with - although this has now been resolved in a positive manner by empowering the Member States - is the criminalisation of people who make use of this sort of service, because if someone is liable to prosecution, he can refuse to make a statement in a subsequent trial.
If someone makes use of this right to refuse to give evidence - for example, a man who had been with a prostitute who had been endangered through human trafficking - information will be lost that could be used further to finally uncover this network of human traffickers.
It is therefore a good thing that this rests with the Member States, and I would like to thank you very much for your cooperation.
