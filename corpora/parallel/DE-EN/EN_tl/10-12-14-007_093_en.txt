Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we are taking a huge step towards combating human trafficking in an efficient manner.
The rapporteurs have achieved a good result in relation to minimum thresholds for sentences, jurisdiction, non-prosecution and statutory limitation - not all of this is perhaps quite what we would have liked to have seen, but it is nevertheless a very practicable solution.
Anything else would also, to some extent, have disrupted national criminal law in the legal systems of the Member States.
We need to be more restrained in this regard.
I am also convinced that we would have done ourselves a disservice by making customers of prostitutes liable to prosecution, because this is not something we would have prosecuted otherwise.
However, I would like to come back to the general question of criminal law and criminal procedure in the Member States.
This is a very sensitive area of national legislation, which has developed over hundreds of years.
We should therefore tread very carefully where this is concerned.
I am also mentioning this in view of the imminent European Investigation Order.
However, we have today established a good basis for cross-border cooperation in criminal matters.
I am pleased that we have now taken this step.
