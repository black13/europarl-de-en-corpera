Mr President, I am pleased that, in Parliament today, we have talked not only about the agreement between the European Union and Georgia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas but also about the agreement between the European Union and Georgia on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation.
In this regard, it is important that we do not merely deal with the pleasant things in life, but also with the serious issues, and I hope that, as Parliament, in perhaps a year's time, we will receive an interim report on how this agreement between the European Union and Georgia has been implemented and, above all, how well it has worked.
I would also like the European Parliament to be much more involved in the initial discussions next time.
