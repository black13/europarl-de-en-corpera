Today's decision will result in the workers from the enterprise Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg who are threatened with redundancy receiving around EUR 8 million in assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
These funds are to be used to assist these workers in finding new jobs as quickly as possible.
It is important to me that these people receive these funds quickly and without significant bureaucratic frictional losses.
The assistance is needed now and not in six months' or a year's time.
The European Union and the Member States must also endeavour to do more than simply counter the negative consequences of globalisation.
Globalisation is a process the progress of which we can, and indeed must, control.
