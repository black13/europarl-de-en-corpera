The effects of the economic crisis are still being felt throughout Europe.
In Germany, too, some enterprises are still struggling to survive and are making numerous people redundant.
Between 26 January 2010 and 26 May 2010, the printing machinery manufacturer Druckmaschinen AG, based in Heidelberg, had to make 1 181 workers redundant as a result of the crisis.
The Federal Republic of Germany has therefore applied for EUR 8 308 555 in assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
I am voting in favour of the report, as all of the stipulated criteria for mobilisation of the funds are met.
