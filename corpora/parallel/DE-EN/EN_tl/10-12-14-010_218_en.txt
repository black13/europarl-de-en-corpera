Apart from the application from the enterprise Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, I have, without reservations, voted in favour of all of the applications for mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund that have been voted on today, as I support the general idea of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and, in particular, the direct support given to the people who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation.
However, with regard to the aforementioned enterprise, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, I abstained from the vote.
In this case, I have definite reservations.
It is well-known that Heidelberger Druckmaschinen is a jewel of the German mechanical engineering sector.
The company made excellent profits for many years.
Then, admittedly, came two or three financially difficult years.
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen reacted with the reflex typical of large companies: it reduced staff numbers in the area where wages were high, in other words, in Germany, and, at the same time, invested and increased the number of staff in China, where wages were low.
If, during such a process, an application is made for mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, this represents a negative example of how a socially meaningful and very responsible EU measure is exploited by international companies to wheedle out of their social responsibility.
