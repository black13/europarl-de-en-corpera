In order to be able to prevent a significant increase in the level of unemployment as a result of the financial and economic crisis, the EU Member States need funds to be able to implement effective political measures quickly.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund makes available an annual amount of EUR 500 billion for this purpose.
If more than 500 workers from one or more enterprises are made redundant during a specific period, an application may be made for mobilisation of funds.
I am voting in favour of the report, as assistance amounting to EUR 633 077 for 1 104 redundant Polish workers from enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 is fully justified.
