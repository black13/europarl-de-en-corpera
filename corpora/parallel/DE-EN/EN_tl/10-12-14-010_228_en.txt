There have been 1 154 redundancies affecting 593 Spanish enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 47 in the NUTS II region of Aragón.
The financial and economic crisis has resulted in a drastic downturn in sales in the retail sector.
This situation has serious consequences, particularly for the region of Aragón, which has a lower population density than the EU average.
Further emigration from this region, which, prior to the crisis, was experiencing a slight upturn, is to be feared.
I am voting in favour of the report, as immediate action must be taken to respond to increased levels of unemployment, particularly in small regions with struggling economies.
