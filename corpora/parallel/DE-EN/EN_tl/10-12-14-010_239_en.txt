EUR 500 million is the annual ceiling for the funds that can be mobilised through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
As there were a total of 528 redundancies in 66 enterprises in Spain between 31 March 2009 and 30 December 2009, the mobilisation of funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund amounting to EUR 1 422 850 is not in the least surprising.
I am voting in favour of the report, as the full utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is extremely welcome.
