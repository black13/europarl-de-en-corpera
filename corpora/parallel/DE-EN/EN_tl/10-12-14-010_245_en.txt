In order to be able to apply for funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and for the application subsequently to be approved, there are clearly defined criteria that need to be met.
It is intended to benefit workers who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis by establishing measures that will guarantee their rapid reintegration into the labour market.
The fund provides an annual amount of EUR 500 million for such cases.
However, an enterprise must have made at least 500 redundancies - like the Spanish enterprise Lear Automotive, which meets all the criteria - for Spain to be able to apply for funds.
I am voting in favour of the report, as this is precisely what the funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are for.
