An agreement with Georgia would bring a wave of bogus asylum seekers.
Thus, we first need to dispel our security concerns.
As the experience with the Balkans shows, visa-free travel is not just used for travel to the EU, but also sets a real stream of asylum shopping in motion.
It is to be feared that the same thing would also happen in the case of visa facilitation for Georgian citizens.
In general, the facilitation of the issuance of visas to citizens of non-EU states should not be granted too hastily.
Before doing so, it must be examined as carefully as possible whether appropriate readmission agreements for bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants could prevent the abuse of the system.
The problems with the Schengen Information System II must also be resolved beforehand.
Finally, it must not primarily be asylum seekers, or even criminals, that benefit from visa-free travel.
The preconditions mentioned have not been met and I therefore reject an extension of the visa-free area in the strongest possible terms.
