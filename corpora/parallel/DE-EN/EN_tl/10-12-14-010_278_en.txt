A strong rapid reaction unit would be a good thing and would be able to help citizens of Europe and other states during their most difficult times.
Sadly, the rapporteur does not seem to be concerned with strengthening humanitarian aid or the EU's civil protection programme, but rather with making the 'EU' stamp as visible as possible.
It must not be the goal of this rapid reaction unit to promote the EU throughout the world.
As a result of the leadership of the United Nations and the involvement of the military in providing emergency aid, we also risk giving up our independence, which I do not wish to support.
It is for that reason that I voted against this report.
