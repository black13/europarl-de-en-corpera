Data acquisition costs in Europe are much too high.
They are sometimes ten times higher than they are in the United States.
The report contains some good proposals for reducing these and other unnecessary costs.
However, I fear that the author is on the wrong track with her plans to achieve this goal of cost reduction by introducing numerous additional provisions.
There is a danger that doing so will merely replace one bureaucratic obstacle with another one.
It is for that reason that I abstained from voting.
