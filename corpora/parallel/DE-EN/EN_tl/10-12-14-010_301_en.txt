The security of the civilian population in the event of possible incidents of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear nature is a very important matter and ambitions in this regard should essentially be supported.
Unfortunately, where this report is concerned, I have the feeling that the desire is to fight a terror spectre that, fortunately, does not exist in Europe in this highly organised form.
Thus, the intention is to create more panic in order then to be able to implement a particular policy.
Moreover, the report appears to deal predominantly with the subject of solidarity.
I believe there is a point at which we should say 'enough' where terror prevention measures are concerned and the same goes for EU solidarity.
I therefore abstained from voting on this report.
