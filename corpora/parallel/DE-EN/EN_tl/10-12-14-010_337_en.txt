The circumstances under which third-country nationals are permitted to reside and work in an EU Member State are a matter for the state in question, not the EU.
The fact that, in certain areas, periodic immigration of well-educated skilled workers may perhaps be useful must not result in an open door policy because, first and foremost, it should be workers from our own population, in other words, EU citizens, who are recruited.
If we have a shortage of workers in many areas, we should investigate the causes of this and respond by adapting the training accordingly, but also by providing opportunities for reskilling.
The fact that labour migration can be a problem for workers because it suppresses wage levels and can also lead to dumping prices has been shown time and again in the past.
It was for this reason, for example, that the transitional periods for the free movement of workers were introduced at the insistence of the countries with well-developed social security safety nets.
In the debate, it must not be forgotten that the rules and regulations for the supply of labour can be exploited by clever enterprises.
I therefore voted against the report.
