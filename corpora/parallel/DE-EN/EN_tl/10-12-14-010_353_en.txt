Even though some measures have been taken in recent years to protect victims, the people affected are often left in the lurch.
Lawyers and judges learn a great deal in their training about the rights of defendants, but they hear nothing about the right way to deal with witnesses and victims who appear as witnesses.
If the scheduling is tailored to the defendant only and absolutely no consideration is given to a victim who is bringing a civil action against someone, that is like a slap in the face.
Greater awareness is important here, but it is also needed in medical training, too, so that the use of domestic violence can be better recognised.
The question of the statutory limitation of civil compensation claims is essential in the case of child abuse.
The protection of victims also includes only allowing people with an unblemished criminal record to work with our children.
If forced marriages are now being prosecuted in Liechtenstein, including without the consent of the victim, and it is possible to take legal action in the case of genital mutilation performed on a minor, this clearly shows the potential danger of the much lauded multicultural enrichment.
Since victim protection is still in its infancy and the people affected often do not know who they can turn to in their own country and what their rights are, it is important that victim protection is harmonised within the EU.
I have voted in favour of the report.
