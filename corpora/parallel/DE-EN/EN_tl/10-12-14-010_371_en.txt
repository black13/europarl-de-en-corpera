Officially, slavery no longer exists.
Unofficially, however, it is very much in existence in the form of human trafficking.
This form of crime in particular has, for many people, become a lucrative business with billions being made in profits.
When it comes to combating human trafficking, we are lagging far behind organised crime.
Only a combination of different measures can ultimately achieve the goal.
On the one hand, the security apparatus, which, in recent years, has been starved of funds, must be topped up again.
Within the EU, only the spin-offs of human trafficking can really be combated, but we need to remove what underpins this.
Subsidiary areas, such as begging, would be relatively easy to combat by imposing a general ban on begging throughout the EU.
On the other hand, cooperation with the countries of origin, for example, for forced labour and forced prostitution, is essential.
Therefore, information and awareness campaigns via the education systems in the countries of origin, transit and destination are an important tool for combating human trafficking.
Some of the fundamental considerations in the report are right, but in other areas, I cannot give my consent without reservations.
I therefore abstained from the vote.
