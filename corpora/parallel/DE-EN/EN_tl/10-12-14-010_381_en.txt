The facilitation of the issuance of visas to citizens of non-EU states should not be granted too hastily.
Before doing so, it must be examined as carefully as possible whether appropriate readmission agreements for bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants could prevent the abuse of the system.
The problems with the Schengen Information System II must also finally be resolved.
Finally, it must not primarily be asylum seekers, or even criminals, that benefit from visa-free travel.
A great deal will de facto depend on whether, and to what extent, the agreement is actually implemented.
It will, in any case, increase Georgia's cooperation with the European Union.
In my opinion, the readmission agreement is not restrictive enough and therefore, I abstained from the vote.
