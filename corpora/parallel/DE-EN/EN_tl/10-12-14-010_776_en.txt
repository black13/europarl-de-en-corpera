Romanian children are being brought to central Europe and forced to steal and beg, and elderly and disabled people are also being forced to beg.
Meanwhile, the heads of the begging mafia are living in luxury villas.
Human trafficking is a lucrative and fast-growing business.
According to Europol, there are hundreds of thousands of victims in the EU alone.
Therefore, the stepping up by the EU of the fight against human trafficking is to be welcomed.
A particularly positive aspect is the fact that organised begging is also being addressed for the first time.
Left-wing romantics often shut their eyes and would have the public believe that these people are begging voluntarily and that there is no such thing as begging tourism or the begging mafia.
However, some of the proposed measures go too far.
Instead of placing the countries of origin under obligation with regard to the destruction of mafia structures and providing victims with local help and the opportunity for training and, therefore, a future in their own country, the EU is moving in the direction of residence permits and exemption from punishment for victims of human trafficking.
This is sending the wrong signal: these people are already being lured to Europe with false promises.
Residence permits in the context of victim protection and exemption from punishment if someone is caught stealing will be all the more of an incentive for someone to place themselves in the hands of the mafia.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
