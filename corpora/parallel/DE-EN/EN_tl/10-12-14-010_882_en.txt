According to the report, visa liberalisation for Georgia would provide an incentive for necessary reforms in the areas of freedom, security and justice.
Quite apart from the opportunities for abuse of the system that visa liberalisation would open up, this logic needs to be turned on its head: no visa negotiations until all of the necessary reforms have been implemented.
At the end of the day, this is about the security of EU citizens, who must be protected against visa tourists and organised crime.
I therefore voted against this report.
