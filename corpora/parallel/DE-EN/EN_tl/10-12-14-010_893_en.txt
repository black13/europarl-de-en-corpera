After residing in a Member State for five years, refugees are to be granted a long-term residence permit, which is then to apply throughout the whole of the EU.
Since the asylum systems in the different Member States have different levels of stringency, a well-advised refugee would settle initially in the Member State that has the most lenient asylum law with the most loopholes.
After five years, he can then leave his place of residence and move to any other Member State of the European Union of his choosing.
The result is secondary migration from countries with low standards to Member States with generous social systems.
People will first choose the Member States according to the stringency of the asylum law and then according to the level of social services.
That would, of course, put a particular burden on countries like Austria, Germany or the Netherlands.
The approach taken by this report is certainly not a sensible way to deal with asylum challenges in the EU and pursue appropriate integration policy.
I therefore voted against this report.
