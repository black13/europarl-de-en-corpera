Since the proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises specialising mainly in the manufacture of furniture, shoes, textiles, ceramics and toys in Comunidad Valenciana is very high and the service sector represents 60% of total employment in this region, this sector has been particularly badly affected by the high number of redundancies in the last two years.
This has a high impact at local level.
It is therefore particularly important for us to strengthen and continue to support the textile industry.
I therefore voted in favour of this application.
