Mr President, Mr Barroso, the European Council is meeting on Thursday and Friday.
I would like to ask you the following questions:
Firstly, do you believe that the introduction of Eurobonds can help to stabilise the euro?
Secondly, do you share the view of Chancellor Merkel that Eurobonds are not necessary?
Thirdly, in the event that your opinion differs from that of Mrs Merkel and you are in favour of Eurobonds, what do you intend to do in the Council this coming Thursday?
Fourthly, are you in contact with the Eurogroup President, the Prime Minister and finance minister, Mr Juncker, and, as President of the Commission, will you support him?
Fifthly, in the event that Eurobonds do not get the go ahead, will you inform Parliament immediately afterwards of the way in which you, as the Commission, intend to respond to a possible negative decision?
