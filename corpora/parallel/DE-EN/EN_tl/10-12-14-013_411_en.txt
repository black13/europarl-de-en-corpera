Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have answered my questions with your inimitable diplomacy, but I do not want to let you get away with this.
I will therefore ask you very specifically: in his role as President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker has announced that he intends to take the initiative in the European Council with regard to the introduction of Eurobonds.
Will you support him in this?
Furthermore, are you likely to try to convince Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to join the majority of the euro states, or, when Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy say 'we do not want that', will you say 'okay, because two parties say 'no', we will dispense with the idea'?
