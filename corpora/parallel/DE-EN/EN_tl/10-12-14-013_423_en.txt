Mr President, Mr Barroso, in response to Mr Schulz's questions, you said that the Eurobonds proposal will probably not be successful.
Previously, we were told that nothing would come of the financial transaction tax, and other proposals have also come to nothing.
We are now in the third year following the financial crisis and I am now asking myself whether you would be able to agree to boosting the euro rescue package - that would, of course, be an additional measure - or whether we have to expect that, by the weekend, yet another set of proposals will be rejected by you and others.
My question is: how expensive is this delay, especially as it is clearly costing a lot of money?
