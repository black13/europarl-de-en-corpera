Mr President, the Internet platform WikiLeaks is publishing - to put it simply - confidential information, and, naturally, that is always very unpleasant for the parties involved.
It should also be noted that as yet, no legal proceedings have been brought against WikiLeaks.
In the meantime, a proper cyber war is raging.
On the one hand, WikiLeaks servers are being attacked and, on the other, supporters of WikiLeaks are bombarding the web servers of Visa and MasterCard in order to bring them down.
My question, Mr President, is: will the Commission take action against such proxy wars?
You have already mentioned the activities of Commissioner Malmstr√∂m.
Is there already a timetable for this and do we already have any ideas of what we will do?
Is the Commission planning - and, in this regard, I would like a clear answer please, not excuses with details and judicial arguments - to take specific action against WikiLeaks in order once again to act as a willing agent of the United States on the sensitive subject of data transfer and to behave as such?
