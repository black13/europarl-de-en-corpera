Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel, who have carried out the budgetary procedure with a great deal of responsibility and a clear focus on the priorities.
With regard to the 2011 budget: when considering the EU budget, we must always remember that around 95% of the money goes back to benefit citizens.
The best example of this is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
At 6%, the EU's administrative costs are lower than quite a few of its Member States.
For many years, the EU budget amounted to plus/minus 1% of GDP.
This financed the enlargement from 15 to 27 Member States without any additional budgetary resources.
As a result of the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have additional tasks.
Budget increases are always difficult.
However, with themes such as new projects and additional Lisbon tasks, the 2011 budget is also an investment in the future of the EU and in the functioning of its institutions.
