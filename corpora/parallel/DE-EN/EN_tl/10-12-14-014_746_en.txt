I welcome the fact that we have finally come to an agreement on the 2011 budget.
This will ensure financial security for the vulnerable agriculture sector.
EU agricultural policy needs a stable budget framework, in particular, during difficult times.
A twelve-part budget would have caused serious financial difficulties for many Member States which have already passed on agricultural payments to farmers.
Agriculture is heavily dependent on EU subsidies.
Farming families need the security to plan ahead for the future of their businesses.
Throughout the EU, direct payments represent 40% of farm incomes and provide financial security against a background of low producer prices, increasing production costs and fluctuating markets.
The measures which form part of the rural development programme bring direct benefits for rural areas and stimulate regional economies.
Farms in Austria, in particular, benefit from both the 1st and 2nd pillar measures.
A total of 58 percent of Austria's annual agricultural budget comes from the EU.
Farmers in the European Union have a wide range of responsible jobs to do which are increasing in number.
They have to produce top quality food and comply with high standards of animal welfare while helping to prevent climate change, protect the environment and maintain biodiversity.
In order to be able to provide these essential services, farmers must have a reliable income based on sensible, stable EU financial policy.
As far as the negotiations on the financial framework for 2014-2020 are concerned, all aspects of agriculture must have the same level of budget funding.
