Mr President, we would like to thank the Commission and the Council, Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Schauvliege, for the daily briefings that the European Parliament delegation received in Cancún.
We can truly say that, in Cancún, the EU was not part of the problem but, in many cases, was part of the solution.
That should please all of us.
The positive mood must now be utilised to bring new momentum to climate policy in Europe and also to the European Union.
I would just like to mention three points.
It was absolutely right for Parliament, in its resolution, to call for us to raise our ambitions and achieve a reduction in CO2 of 30% by 2020, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will adopt decisions on this in the spring.
Secondly, we have the Green Climate Fund.
We proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax to finance this.
The people who rejected this must now come up with alternatives - we can no longer beat about the bush.
Thirdly, we must do our homework.
We must take the hot air out of the EU's carbon footprint.
My final point is this: This climate conference is done.
Now let us look to the next one.
The work must now be stepped up.
