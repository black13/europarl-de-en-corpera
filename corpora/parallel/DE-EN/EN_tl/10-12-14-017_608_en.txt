Mr President, I would like to apologise.
We had a group meeting.
Question time with Mrs Reding began at 20:00.
I saw that on the monitor and then came here as soon as the second question was asked - she had six, after all.
I thought that it would last half an hour, as scheduled.
I therefore just missed my question.
I would like to ask if you would be so kind as to still allow me to ask it after Mr Higgins's question.
I really did arrive in the Chamber just as I should have been speaking.
