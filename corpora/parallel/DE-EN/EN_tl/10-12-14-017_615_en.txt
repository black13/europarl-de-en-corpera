Mr President, thank you very much for your generosity.
I will be very brief, Commissioner.
Would you possibly be prepared to take a look at the link between Sombor in Serbia and Osijek in Croatia?
There is a large bridge over the Danube there and in Croatia, there is an airport, but no adequate road.
That really would be extremely important for the whole region.
