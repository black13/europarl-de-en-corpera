Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to make a correction: the German translation states that I am the chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but that is not correct.
I am the rapporteur.
However, in this role, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Bendtsen for his splendid work and excellent cooperation.
He has presented an ambitious strategy on the subject of energy efficiency in the European Union.
Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective means of lowering emissions and reducing our dependence on energy imports.
This will create jobs in Europe, and the money we invest will no longer flow in the direction of Russia, the Middle East or other regions, but will remain in our economy.
The Environment Committee has adopted a comprehensive opinion.
I do not need to repeat everything it contains, but it is also very ambitious.
Not everything it contains is of equal importance, either.
However, I would like to emphasise two points once again.
Firstly - we have talked about this, Commissioner - we propose that the European Union sets itself a long-term target in the area of energy efficiency, because if we plan up to 2050, we also need to know roughly how much we consume.
Secondly, we have also pointed out the problems with the definition.
I believe that we should take the quantity of energy consumed as the basis, as that is measurable and we have data for that.
We do not have data for anything else as far as measurement per unit is concerned, for example.
Therefore, this is the right approach in my view, and I hope that we can incorporate it into the strategy accordingly in the coming months.
