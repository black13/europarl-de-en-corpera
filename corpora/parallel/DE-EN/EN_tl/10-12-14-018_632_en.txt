Mr President, I have just one question for Mr Reul.
Is it not possible to have binding targets in the course of development and yet still to regard them as differentiated?
You contrasted 'binding' and 'differentiated', whereas I believe that it is possible to unite the two.
I am completely behind some of the steps that the Commissioner has put forward, but perhaps we can find a way to proceed in a differentiated manner according to the geographical and other circumstances, but still ultimately obtain binding targets.
