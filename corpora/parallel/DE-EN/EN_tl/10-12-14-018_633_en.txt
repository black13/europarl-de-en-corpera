Mr President, I, too, advocate differentiated solutions and, like you, Mr Swoboda, I am in the process of considering how such solutions can be brought about.
We should not rule anything out at all in respect of where something is to be done.
I will take today as my starting point.
At the moment, I believe it to be the wrong approach to essentially buy ourselves a little leeway with binding targets and percentages.
I would invite us all now to give more thought to what we can achieve and how, on a step-by-step basis.
It saddens me that we have not achieved more.
Perhaps we need to choose a different approach for that reason.
