Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bendtsen on a very good report.
Basically, I have just one comment to make, Commissioner, and that is that your background is in regional politics, in a large state in Germany, whereas mine is in local politics.
We will not achieve the targets, whether binding or otherwise - and I advocate binding targets - if we do not address states, regions and communities directly and specify to them what can be done.
When I think of the refurbishment of housing, transport policy - which, thank God, you repeatedly mention - and combating energy poverty, these are areas that are not regulated at the national level but essentially at the local, the regional and the municipal level.
We therefore also have to be active at that level.
It would be a major opportunity to win over the towns and the communities to our great European project of energy efficiency, energy saving and, of course, other areas of energy policy.
I would therefore ask that you act accordingly and perhaps also give some consideration to how we can better get through to the citizens, specifically via the towns, the communities and the regions, as that connection is absolutely vital in order to make it possible to actually get those targets accepted - binding or otherwise.
