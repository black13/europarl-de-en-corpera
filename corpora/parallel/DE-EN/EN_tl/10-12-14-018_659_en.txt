Mr President, Commissioner, clearly, energy efficiency is a very important subject, and naturally we have to be very economical with fossil fuels.
Clearly, the key figures required need to represent a challenge, but they must also always retain an adequate sense of proportion; they always have to be realistic.
They need to be efficient for society but also for the individual, and it needs to be affordable for owners.
For citizens, it must be comprehensible and explicable and, above all, it must also be economically feasible for them.
This is because, without public acceptance, there will be no climate protection.
This aspect, in particular, is an element I find to be missing from this report.
