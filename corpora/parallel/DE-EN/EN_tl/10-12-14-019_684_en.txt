Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Weisgerber for the truly collegial collaboration that we enjoyed.
I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that I am far from euphoric about the repeal of these eight directives.
There are, in fact, a number of outdated measuring instruments for which the rules and regulations are being abolished, but we have noted in the debates that the devil is in the detail, as you yourself have said.
It therefore was not always clear whether this route really was the right one to choose.
My group will vote in favour of this compromise in light of the fact that we have obtained an assurance from the Commission that it will examine the idea of properly incorporating these measurement instruments into the European Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which is, of course, being drawn up at the moment, where necessary.
This commitment to investigate - this, too, I am assuming - will also be taken very seriously and given earnest consideration.
We are voting for the compromise on this condition, well aware that there are still one or two issues that need to be investigated.
As for the correlation tables, I would like to say, at this point, that we have now stated that we are ready to accept the mild wording that is currently to be found in this text but that this is one of the last documents in which we have accepted this, as, for us, this really is about European law, which is created once the Member States have given their consent, being truly and properly implemented.
We can only check that, however, if we have the information, and we only get the information from these correlation tables.
We will continue to work towards that, at all events.
