Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling cooperation.
I think I can keep this brief as all the essential points have actually already been addressed.
Clearly, our group will support the compromise, but we are also working on the assumption that the Commission will take another critical look at things in the review of the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID).
Clearly, we support the fact that this compromise on the correlation tables was found.
This compromise has a time limit on it, however, and in future, the Council must react much more strongly.
We are no longer prepared to give way.
Ultimately, it must also be possible to monitor the Member States and for that, we urgently need correlation tables.
