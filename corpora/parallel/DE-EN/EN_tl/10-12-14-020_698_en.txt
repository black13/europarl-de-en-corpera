Mr President, year after year, we have this debate about the safety of toys.
Year after year, we have to observe that there is still much that is in need of improvement.
We are talking, here, amongst other things, about what are known as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMRs), substances that cause cancer and that may be very hazardous to the health and, in some cases, even the life of children.
The new information does indeed show that we need to ensure that the limit values are adapted and we are calling on the Commission to finally do so.
Commissioner, I really hope that this will actually happen.
This is not the only problem, however.
There is another problem in the shape of market supervision, and the Member States, too, have a responsibility here.
They have a responsibility to ensure that only toys that truly satisfy the safety standards that we have adopted reach the market.
That is not always the case, which is highly regrettable.
We therefore need to ensure that these safety standards are improved.
The third and final point that I wish to make relates to the marking of toys.
Many people wrongly believe that the CE mark is an indicator of safety.
It is not, however, as the Commission itself says.
It is therefore time, Commissioner, that the Commission gave some thought to how we could issue a European safety mark that is truly reliable and that is monitored by third parties, independent authorities or bodies, so that a dangerous toy simply cannot make it onto the market or into the shops where it can threaten the health of our children.
I believe that we have a major debt to discharge in this regard, and there is still much that we need to do, and urgently so.
