on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been dealing with the global economic and financial crisis for three years now.
One of the conclusions to be drawn from this long-lasting discussion is that our measures are obviously not tackling the roots of the crisis, but simply treating the symptoms.
I would like to repeat once again that decisions at EU level must not be determined by the financial markets.
We must not allow the banks to get away largely scot-free, to continue speculating and to leave the Member States to take responsibility for the risky transactions that the banks have entered into.
The tough austerity packages imposed on Greece and Ireland will result in the people bearing the cost of the crisis which they did not cause.
This will restrict consumer spending and prevent the necessary economic upturn from taking place.
Drastic savings measures will put other countries that are currently at risk, such as Portugal and Spain, in the same position as Greece and Ireland.
Simply readjusting the financial instruments or putting new safety nets in place will not help.
A permanent mechanism for preserving financial stability must include measures which regulate the activities of the markets.
These include, among other things, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and an obligation to meet minimum social standards.
It is also important for us to change the statute of the European Central Bank to allow it to provide direct financial aid for ailing states, while circumventing the banks.
These are the first steps we should be taking, but they are long overdue.
To make the situation absolutely clear, a narrow-minded national approach is blocking the regulations needed for effective control of the financial markets.
The Heads of State or Government are preventing us from making progress in the right direction.
I include the Chancellor of Germany among them.
