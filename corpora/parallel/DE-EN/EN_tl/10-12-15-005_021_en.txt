Mr Langen, you can sit down again now.
You have spoken very eloquently and you have said your piece.
I have one question for you.
Ireland is not a southern European country, as far as I know.
It is in northern Europe.
Ireland has huge debts.
Can you explain to us where the Irish debts come from?
Would you be so kind as to tell us which party has been in government in Ireland for the last 30 years?
