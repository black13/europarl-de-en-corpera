Mr President, I am happy to answer that question.
The Irish Government made the mistake of giving guarantees without demanding reform of the banking sector.
That was irresponsible and that is why it now has a budget deficit of 32%.
We know that.
However, you should not confuse the problems of other states with those of Ireland.
Ireland is a completely different case, because it concerns the second level of the banking crisis and not a structural problem, as in other countries.
Mr Schulz, you know that as well as I do.
Please do not attempt to distract our attention.
