Mr President, after four years of the Karamanlis government ...
(Uproar).
No, the structural problems in Greece go back further than that.
In 2000, this Parliament debated whether Greece should join the euro area.
The social-democrats, the German Government, had been calling for this.
With your help there was a two-thirds majority in Parliament in favour of Greece joining the euro area.
That is a fact and it has nothing to do with nationalism.
I would like to answer the question from Mr Schulz about debts in Germany and in Spain.
Of course, Spain's national debt level is lower than that of Germany.
Spain did not have to finance a reunification process.
However, the Zapatero government in Spain has other problems.
It has allowed 6 million people into the country and given 2 million of them Spanish citizenship and now unemployment is running at over 20%.
This is a structural problem and it is caused by one person: Mr Zapatero.
