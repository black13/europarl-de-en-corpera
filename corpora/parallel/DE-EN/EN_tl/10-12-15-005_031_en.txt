Mr President, we have just seen a tragic accusation being made against Germany.
It is an ominous reminder of the late 1920s.
As an enthusiastic pro-European and stubborn supporter of the Euro, I would like to ask you: Have you not noticed that you are driving the European Union, this great project for peace and economic prosperity, into the ground?
Mr Cohn-Bendit has rightly said that we always react too late and always in retrospect.
Now we must look to the future.
Have you not noticed what is going on outside?
People are no longer interested in the squabbling between the socialists and the conservatives, either in my home country or here in the European Parliament.
They are interested in solutions and in whether their money is still safe.
We have to say honestly to them that this is no longer the case.
We must bring forward the next step and admit that we need the courage to write off debts, we must finally make the banks pay, even if it affects our life insurance policies, and we must establish a new European political project which is not burdened with the problems of the Treaty of Lisbon.
We are caught in a trap.
If we amend this article, we will find that Ireland will vote no in a referendum.
We can expect the same thing to happen in my home country.
In addition, we have a huge problem in the United Kingdom.
Ladies and gentlemen, you must wake up to what is happening.
