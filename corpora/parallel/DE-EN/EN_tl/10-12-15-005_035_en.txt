Mr President, the Flemish politician Bart De Wever, in an interview in Der Spiegel magazine, said that Belgium had become a transfer society.
This fact lay at the heart of the problem in Belgium and not the language issue.
Solidarity had become a one-way street.
The EU is in the process of doing just the same thing.
We are turning a service society into a transfer society and the euro is one means of achieving this.
It is opening up the path to cheap money in a number of states.
As the President of the EU Council, Mr Van Rompuy, has said, it has become a sleeping tablet.
It is undermining the competitive ability of the various countries.
Now many European politicians are calling for the introduction of another sleeping tablet: Eurobonds.
This will simply make the gap wider.
If we continue in this way, within a few years the EU will be in the same position as Belgium is now: a transfer society whose political foundations are crumbling.
Over Christmas I will be reading the book 'Save our Money' by Mr Henkel, former president of the Federation of German Industry.
Perhaps you should do the same thing, so that you can find out what people in Germany are thinking.
