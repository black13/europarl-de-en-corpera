Madam President, Mr Schulz is right.
We are in the midst of a huge crisis of confidence and the members of the Council are pulling the wool over the citizens' eyes.
They are telling them that everything is under control, we just need to make small changes to the treaty by introducing a permanent stability mechanism and then the problem will be resolved.
In fact, the situation is not under control.
The Member States are reacting rather than actually taking action.
They are desperately firefighting, but they cannot put out the flames.
The markets are asking themselves: Who is actually in control in Europe and in the euro area?
The EU has reached a critical turning point.
If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo.
Instead we will take a step backwards.
What we need are further moves towards integration.
We need more Europe.
We must finish establishing the internal market, including the service sector.
Alongside the monetary union, we need an economic, budgetary and fiscal union.
We also need a strong Commission which has the right and the power to control and monitor this economic union and to impose sanctions automatically, in cases where this is justified.
If we take these steps towards more integration, then we can talk about the introduction of eurobonds.
Then we will have laid the foundations for them.
However, during all of this we must ensure that we have the long-term investment funding that we need, despite all of the justifiable austerity measures, to secure the European Union's competitive ability in the medium and long term.
We must finally tell the citizens the truth.
We need solutions without blinkers, we must discuss the issues without bringing in ideologies and we must stop trying to muddle through.
What we require is action for the long term, rather than short-term reactions.
