Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the summit on 16 December.
It would be good if the Council could say to us after the summit: We are aware of the gaps and the mistakes, we know where we have failed and we understand the limits of the treaty.
Self-satisfaction and accusations of guilt, attempts to gloss over mistakes and a superficial approach will not solve any problems or create any confidence.
Let us stop playing with Europe.
This really is all about Europe.
I endorse everything that Mr Klinz has said.
As it is now only a few days before Christmas, I would like to say: Light a candle of determination and common interest, a candle representing the new seriousness, honesty and confidence in the future of the Europe Union.
Light a candle for a change of political course in Europe, a move from the crisis to competitiveness, from the spirit of Deauville to the political union, from saving to investment and reform, from the monetary union to the political union.
Because of Germany's constitutional problems, the addition to the treaty is simply a political crutch for the further development of the rescue package, nothing more and nothing less.
It does not represent a solution.
Do not try to make it more important than it really is.
Stop the day-by-day policymaking and put forward a complete concept in response to the crisis which will move us towards political union.
Put an end to the discord.
It is enough, it is not enough and, actually, we do not know where things are going.
We must call on the Commission to produce a concept for an economic, social and financial union, so that we can take the next step towards integration at the end of next year and really do the job properly.
