- Madam President, the citizens' confidence in Europe and in the euro has been seriously damaged by the financial crisis and the political manoeuvring.
The citizens of Europe need easily understandable, clear prospects, which can be relied on in the long term, for the security of their currency.
The Stability and Growth Pact defines the upper limits for deficits and overall debt.
However, it is relatively ineffective.
New rescue packages will only gain the necessary broad acceptance among citizens if they also offer effective controls and sanctions.
In the case of the controls, Eurostat must be further reinforced and the sanction mechanisms must be easily implemented and effective.
The existing system includes sanction options.
Future rescue packages must involve continuous controls, a rapid and coordinated approach and effective sanctions.
