Madam President, I assume that you agree with me that it is very rude of some Members to ask questions and then to leave.
I would like to apologise to Mr Rehn, because it really is outrageous for him to give detailed answers after some of the Members have already disappeared.
I believe that we should work together to ensure that this no longer happens in future or at least not as often.
