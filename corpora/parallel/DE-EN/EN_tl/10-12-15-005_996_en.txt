in writing. - I would like to draw the attention of the Council to a problem which is threatening to paralyse the cooperation between the two institutions on the subject of fisheries policy.
This is about the regulations for long-term management plans.
These regulations lie at the heart of the common fisheries policy.
The Council and a majority of the Member States do not accept that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Parliament the right of codecision on these regulations.
The ministers are acting in opposition to the Council and the Council's legal service, in opposition to the opinion of the Commission and in opposition, of course, to the will of the European Parliament.
The Council currently has two management plans which cannot be adopted.
The Commission cannot submit further plans, which are urgently needed in the interests of our fishermen and our seas and which have long since been completed and are lying in a drawer.
This situation is unacceptable.
I am calling on the Belgian Presidency and the future Hungarian Presidency to start negotiations with Parliament immediately, so that we can find a solution.
We are ready to begin discussions.
Thank you very much.
