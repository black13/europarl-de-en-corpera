Madam President, I am not a member of any of the committees that are directly involved, but nevertheless I have given our rapporteur, Mrs Gurmai, my full support and I would like to thank all the rapporteurs.
I believe that we have taken a significant step forward in the process of democratising the European Union.
I know that many people are concerned about a possible misuse of the instrument.
However, it is up to us to take into consideration the worries and the problems of the citizens in our policies and then they will not be able to misuse the citizens' initiative.
It is up to us to use our policies to oppose the citizens' initiatives, if we believe that they are going in the wrong direction.
Opposition is certainly more useful than ignoring them.
In contrast to Mrs Corazza Bildt, I think that a good compromise has been reached.
I believe that political parties should not use the initiative instrument, because that is what the political parties and Parliament are there for.
Of course, it is absolutely right that politicians should not be excluded from the debate.
Therefore, I think that this instrument represents a move in the right direction.
It is now up to the political parties to implement the right policies under the watchful eye of the citizens and the citizens' initiative, to take up the wishes and concerns of citizens, to bring them into Parliament and to enter into a dialogue with the citizens to a much greater extent.
This instrument also forces politicians to act more sensibly and to shape Europe in such a way that it really is close to the citizens and not remote from them, which is a criticism rightly made by many people.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their hard work.
I believe that this is a major step forward for democracy in Europe and ultimately this is what we in Parliament are fighting for: a democratic Europe.
