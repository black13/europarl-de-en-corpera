Madam President, firstly I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible and, in particular, the former vice-president Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, who did much of the preliminary work during the previous parliamentary term to ensure that the day would come when the European citizens' initiative would become reality.
Sometimes the citizens of the EU feel as if Europe and its institutions are very remote.
This instrument, the European citizens' initiative, will bring the institutions closer to the citizens.
This is an excellent instrument which will strengthen democracy, involve people more and enable them to take the initiative.
I believe that two things will be very important over the next few months.
One is creating access, including digital access, to the citizens' initiative over the Internet in a way which makes it easy to use but is also secure.
The second is that if a citizens' initiative is successful, it should be followed by a legal act.
My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: How will we decide in future which initiatives will result in a legal act and which simply in a hearing?
Perhaps you could explain this, Mr Šefčovič.
I would also like to thank you once again for your work and for the work done by the Council.
