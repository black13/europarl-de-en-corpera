Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak after my successor on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because I supported this project for 10 years and the European citizens' initiative was included in the text of the treaty almost at the last second.
Back then, it was the Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments who took the initiative in the Convention.
This opens a new chapter in the relationships between the citizens and the European institutions.
All of us hope that this will reduce the distance between people and politics in Europe.
The citizens' initiative is not the cure for all our ills, but it can be a huge help.
Above all, I would like to see more openness in Europe, in the form of a cross-border debate on current issues which are of interest to citizens.
In my area, the environment, I can think of a number of subjects which could be put on the European Union's agenda using this instrument and, in particular, on the agenda of the Commission in its role as European government or executive.
I would also like to ask the Commission how it is preparing for these future initiatives.
We must not disappoint the people.
I would like to thank everyone and especially the rapporteurs Mrs Gurmai and Mr Lamassoure for their excellent work.
