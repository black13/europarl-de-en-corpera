Today's vote on the European citizens' initiative is a milestone for more democracy in Europe.
I welcome the compromise and I will support it, because the report produced by Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai is the first step in the right direction.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must not be afraid of citizens having more opportunities to express their will.
We must give the citizens of Europe more codecision rights, not just every five years at the European elections.
This needs courage, stamina and strength.
Courage to keep returning to the dialogue.
Stamina, because decisions cannot necessarily be made more quickly and strength because our representative democracy includes, at last, in my opinion, more participative elements.
Our goal must be to increase the dialogue in Europe between the citizens and the politicians.
I am pleased that we are moving one step closer to the Europe of the citizens today with the European citizens' initiative.
I am convinced that one day we Europeans will take joint European decisions, in the form of citizens' decisions.
