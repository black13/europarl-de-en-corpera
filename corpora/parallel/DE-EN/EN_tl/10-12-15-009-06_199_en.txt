Mr President, this is about the Union for the Mediterranean.
We know that it has currently come to a standstill and that we want to revive it.
The wording does not express this clearly enough, so we would like to insert the following text:
The current stalemate of the Union for the Mediterranean.
I know that there is a contradiction here.
Perhaps another wording would be possible, but the wording we are proposing is:
The current stalemate of the Union for the Mediterranean.
