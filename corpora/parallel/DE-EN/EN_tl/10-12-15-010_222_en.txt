Mr President, the right to draw up a budget is the central right of a parliament.
This also applies to the European Parliament.
Responsibility, trust and partnership are the three key aspects of the cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
The consultation process on the 2011 budget was not a confidence-building measure in this respect.
I call on the Commission and, in particular, the Council to respect the rights of the European Parliament, because, as I have already said, the right to draw up the budget is the central right of the European Parliament.
