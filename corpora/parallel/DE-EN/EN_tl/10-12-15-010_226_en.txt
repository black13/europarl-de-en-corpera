Mr President, the question is: Who monitors the monitoring authorities?
Even football referees have to undergo a monitoring or an approval process.
If this applies to football, then it must surely apply to the financial markets.
Here the process of evaluating the creditworthiness and soundness of financial products, of banks and even of whole countries has been left to the credit rating agencies.
However, when these agencies become a monopoly and manage to avoid any form of supervision, then they take on a godlike status and we find them being worshipped.
We must not allow this to happen.
It says in the Bible: 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me.'
This report is attempting to put the situation right, by introducing supervision of the credit rating agencies.
At the appropriate time, Parliament should ask itself whether these measures really have been successful.
