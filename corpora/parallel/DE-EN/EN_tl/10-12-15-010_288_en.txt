in writing. - The amounts referred to in this report are totally unrealistic.
Apart from the fact that the current financial framework would need to be sufficient to cover these objectives, if there were to be an increase, significantly smaller amounts have been planned.
Adapting the financial framework to the proposals in the report would not increase the flexibility of the Union, but would restrict it.
It is for this reason that I have voted against this report.
