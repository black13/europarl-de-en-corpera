in writing. - As was the case with the last proposal to increase the budget for 2011, I have also had to oppose this one in the interests of the citizens of Europe.
It is impossible to understand how the EU can afford to raise its budget when austerity programmes are being introduced all over Europe.
The latest increase is justified on the grounds of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the new institutions that it has created, such as the European External Action Service.
With great foresight the Freedom Party of Austria voted against the Treaty of Lisbon, which, while it brought a few benefits, primarily resulted in an increase in red tape and in costs for the citizens.
Therefore, I have opposed the budget for 2011.
