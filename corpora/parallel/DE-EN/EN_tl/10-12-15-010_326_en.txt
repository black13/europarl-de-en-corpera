in writing. - Separation and divorce are always difficult matters and involve a whole series of legal consequences.
Everything becomes particularly problematic when the husband and wife come from different countries.
We have been looking for a solution within the European Union, but we have only been able to agree on an enhanced cooperation procedure, which makes the situation only slightly easier for those affected, in other words, the couples from different EU Member States who are divorcing.
The scope of this procedure has not been specified and, therefore, is also not entirely clear.
Of course, cooperation does not mean that judgments, like those in the case of divorce, must be recognised in a Member State where there is no legal provision for doing so.
Equally, the procedure must not offer an opportunity to force Member States to recognise same-sex partnerships via the back door.
Equally little attention has been paid to the rights of parents in the case of cross-border separations.
For this reason, I have abstained from voting.
