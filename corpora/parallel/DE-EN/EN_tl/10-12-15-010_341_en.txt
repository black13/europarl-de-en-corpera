in writing. - More than anything else the financial crisis has made it clear to us that credit rating agencies have a dangerous monopoly and that their evaluations are not always adequate and are sometimes highly risky.
Therefore, it is important to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising rating agencies.
As they form part of a highly complex system of financial markets, the decision was made to introduce a double system for this purpose.
In addition, the report lays down the conditions under which ratings issued by third-country agencies can be used in the European Union.
It is, of course, essential for the supervisory system to allow sanctions to be imposed.
The future will show to what extent these will actually be applied.
The fact that several EU supervisory bodies have now been set up, involving increased administration and costs, is not a good thing for European taxpayers.
I have taken this into account when voting.
