in writing. - Eight EU directives currently cover the field of metrology in six different areas.
For reasons of better law-making, the Commission is therefore proposing to repeal the directives.
According to the Commission, harmonisation is not necessary, as the current situation of mutual recognition of national rules functions satisfactorily.
However, the rapporteur is of the opinion that the Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty.
I have voted in favour of the report, as the problems of legal uncertainty will be taken into account by the rapporteur.
