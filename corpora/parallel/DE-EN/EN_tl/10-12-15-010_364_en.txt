in writing. - The citizens' initiative that has been adopted today is an important step towards bringing the European Union closer to its citizens.
This finally gives the citizens of the European Union the opportunity to take an active part in political events.
In addition, it enables them not only to become involved in politics, but also to call directly on the Commission to take action.
It is important to ensure that the initiative is as citizen-friendly and straightforward as possible, without encouraging its misuse.
However user-friendly the citizens' initiative is, if it is overused it will become devalued.
The citizens' initiative will introduce more democracy and will contribute significantly to making Europe more modern and to bringing it to life for its citizens.
I would like to call once again on Parliament and also on the Commission to ensure that the Committee on Petitions is given an appropriate role in this process.
