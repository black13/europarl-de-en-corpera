in writing. - I support Parliament's decision to introduce the option of the citizens' initiative for the citizens of the EU.
The new EU-wide petition system is an important means of allowing citizens to become more involved and will ensure more direct democracy.
The Treaty on European Union as a whole improves the democratic functioning of the Union.
Citizens can participate in the democratic life of the Union and approach the Commission directly.
The citizens' initiative gives citizens a right of initiative similar to that of the European Parliament and the Council.
In order to ensure that the citizens' initiative is implemented correctly, at least one million signatures are needed from a minimum of one fifth of all the Member States.
In addition, Parliament recommends measures in its resolution which will make the citizens' initiative easier to use.
For example, the Commission should consider using the existing programmes which promote mobility and active citizenship, as well as new forms of communication, such as social networking, which encourage public debate.
I welcome the fact that the representations and offices in the Member States will act as interfaces and advisory bodies.
