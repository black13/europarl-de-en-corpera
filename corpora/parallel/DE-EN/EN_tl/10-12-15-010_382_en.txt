in writing. - Today's vote on the European citizens' initiative has established a new element of direct democracy almost exactly a year after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force.
I took up my mandate in the European Parliament with the aim of putting the concerns of the people of Austria on the table in Brussels.
I am committed to this principle and, therefore, it is essential for me that the concerns of the people are heard at a European level.
The European citizens' initiative should be seen as an opportunity to involve people more closely in the EU's decision-making process.
The citizens of the EU now have the possibility for the first time of submitting legislative initiatives to the Commission and, as a result, actively influencing EU policy.
Following long negotiations, it can be regarded as a success that the admissibility barrier has been lowered from the level of 300 000 signatures and the number of Member States reduced to a quarter.
One special feature in Austria is that young people can take part in citizens' initiatives from the age of 16.
This shows once again that it is important to Austria to include young people in the EU project, because they are ultimately the ones who will take the European spirit forward.
