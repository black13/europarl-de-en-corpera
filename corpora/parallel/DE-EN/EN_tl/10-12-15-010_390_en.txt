in writing. - In 2011 the Commission will submit its proposal for the multiannual financial framework for 2013 to 2020.
It is clear to me that the field of agriculture and rural development must have the same level of funding as it does now and that the food sovereignty of the people of Europe must be guaranteed.
The production of food and the revival of rural regions as economic areas and recreational areas within easy reach of towns must in future be one of Europe's highest priorities.
The Commission's commitment to sustainable and integrative growth takes into account the environmental and climate objectives for 2020 and requires investment in green technologies, which will in turn create jobs.
I welcome Parliament's call for the new multiannual financial framework for the period after 2013 to take into consideration the expansion of the EU's responsibilities.
The plans for the EU's trade policy are of great importance.
The Commission is obliged to bring the World Trade Organisation negotiations to a positive conclusion.
We must take a highly critical approach to the increasing focus on bilateral trade agreements, in particular the Mercosur negotiations which will be continuing next year.
