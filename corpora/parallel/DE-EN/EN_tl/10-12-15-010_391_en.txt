I have just voted in favour of the Commission Work Programme for 2011, but with reservations.
It no longer contains the promised communication from the Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTERPRISE) on corporate social responsibility (CSR).
Instead the Internal Market and Services Directorate General (DG MARKT) has started an online consultation on the disclosure of non-financial information by companies.
This is alarming and suggests a possible change in policy.
The DG MARKT is no longer asking whether EU regulation is needed in the field of CSR, but instead how it should be structured.
The DG ENTERPRISE held several transparency workshops from which it emerged that almost all employers and unions were strongly opposed to mandatory CSR.
Since 2006, the DG ENTERPRISE has been in overall control, as CSR initiatives represent contributions to a sustainable society by companies as part of their business activities.
They are the result of entrepreneurial commitment and are based on individual initiative and responsibility.
There is a consensus about this basic concept which has been developed over a number of years in numerous multi-stakeholder forums.
The DG ENTERPRISE has the institutional knowledge used to exercise control over these processes.
I am calling on the Commission to leave the responsibility for managing and structuring CSR with the DG ENTERPRISE.
I continue to oppose the idea of mandatory CSR reporting, as it will lead to new red tape and discourage companies from making additional voluntary commitments.
