in writing. - It is important for the EU to become closely involved with the African states and to tackle existing and future challenges by means of a common strategy.
These include, in particular, bringing democracy to Africa, improving the living conditions of the people there and also the sustainable exploitation of raw materials, which offers benefits for both sides.
Another problem which needs to be resolved is corruption.
It prevents many African states from developing in a way which would improve the welfare of their citizens.
Unfortunately, millions of euros of aid from the EU is continuing to disappear as a result of corruption.
This could be used constructively for the direct benefit of the citizens.
We must apply the principle of helping people to help themselves.
Unfortunately, the resolution takes no account of this and simply envisages the continuation of existing practices.
Poverty is one of the main reasons why people emigrate from Africa and come to Europe.
Instead of questioning the European practice of export subsidies, which have a massive impact on the ability of some African states to survive, we keep coming up with more empty words.
The negative consequences of migration are being glossed over and, therefore, I felt obliged to vote against this resolution.
