in writing. - We want consumers to be responsible, well-informed and in a position to make sensible decisions.
Our aim is to supply consumers with all the information they need to allow them to take the right decisions in economic terms.
Advertising also makes an important contribution to providing consumers with information.
However, it must contain objective, reliable and relevant details, otherwise what is supposed to be consumer information will rapidly lead consumers astray or even result in them being deceived.
The purpose of the policy is to ensure a fair and safe trading environment, so that consumers can be involved in the market on an equal footing.
However, it is also important to me that consumers do not become victims.
By making purchasing decisions, they are in a position to exert a great deal of influence, but they must ensure that they make good use of it.
