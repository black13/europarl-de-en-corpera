in writing. - Advertising is a powerful tool for business which in some cases can be used to address the subconscious.
The purpose of advertising is to influence consumer and purchasing behaviour.
However, the use of unfair business practices must be prevented.
The most important task is to protect public spaces, vulnerable people and privacy.
Assessing whether advertising has crossed these boundaries is, of course, extremely time-consuming.
In the case of sensitive areas involving legal drugs, such as alcohol and cigarettes, strict regulations have been in place for a long time.
Other areas will continue to be subject to self-regulation in the Member States, as a complement to the provisions of legislation.
There is some catching up to do, not only in the field of Internet advertising, but also, for example, in cases where additional costs are covered up and where the use of new technologies and advertising methods, such as social networking sites or blogs, represents new territory.
As it is important to protect consumers from 'hidden' advertising and similar problematic advertising tactics, I have voted in favour of the report.
