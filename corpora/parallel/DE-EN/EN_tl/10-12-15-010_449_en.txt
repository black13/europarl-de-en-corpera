in writing. - Energy efficiency is an area with great potential for the future where the EU already has some experience.
In addition, the EU Member States are home to many leading technology companies.
Alongside the obvious benefits for the environment, this sector also offers opportunities for boosting economic growth and creating jobs.
However, it has become clear in the past that the EU often sets itself ambitious targets and then has problems in achieving them or misses them altogether.
This could be the case with buildings which, of course, offer enormous potential for energy savings.
It is significantly simpler to implement measures of this kind in new buildings than in existing older ones.
Listed buildings present particular problems.
Last but not least, we must not allow the situation to get out of hand by imposing measures to increase energy efficiency which are so expensive to implement that the cost of living becomes almost unaffordable.
I have voted accordingly.
