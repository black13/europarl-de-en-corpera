in writing. - I have voted against this report.
I welcome the approach taken by the report concerning the Energy Efficiency Action Plan.
However, I believe that imposing mandatory energy efficiency targets 'from above' and setting obligatory modernisation and refurbishment targets for private and public buildings (such as schools) is a mistake.
At a time when budgets are tight in the provinces, local authorities and private households, these unrealistic requirements will put too great a strain on them.
For example, the EU Commission, whose buildings were covered by the new efficiency criteria, recently had to admit that it could not meet the additional requirements for the energy refurbishment of its building stock.
The EU must not require others to do things which it cannot do itself.
For the many medium-sized companies and, in particular, small contractors in Saxony these measures go significantly too far.
They will overburden businesses and will obviously result in job losses and in cost increases for consumers.
In my opinion, we need to take a critical approach in particular to the call for energy efficiency criteria to be applied to public procurement policy.
The right way to save energy involves educating the citizens of Europe and establishing tax incentive systems.
