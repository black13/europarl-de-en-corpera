in writing. - New media, in particular social networking sites and blogs, are opening up new opportunities for communication and advertising.
The possibilities of Internet marketing result in additional demands being placed on consumer protection law.
The current directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market does not provide for these new advertising methods.
Young consumers and, in particular, teenagers and children are making extensive use of these new technologies and may be exposed to misleading and aggressive advertising.
The study 'EU kids online' shows that one third of Internet users between the ages of nine and 10 use the Internet every day, while the figure for 15 to 16-year-olds is 77%.
This makes it all the more important to take urgent measures in this area, including implementing restrictions and, at the same time, providing education and information.
I support the resolution to give consumers more information about the new technical communication options and the risks they involve.
