in writing. - The EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, is problematic.
It puts fundamental rights in the EU under the control of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).
Apart from the legal problems which judges in the Court of Justice of the European Union are also warning about, it is clear that a court which passes a judgment opposing the presence of crosses in classrooms is not a suitable decision-making body for the EU.
The cross is the symbol of Christianity, which is one of the foundations of Europe and of our fundamental values.
The ECtHR has also recently attracted attention with its judgments, including its attempt to prevent transfers under the Dublin II Regulation from Austria to Greece.
The ECtHR seems to believe that the Member States with the best systems of social services should bear the entire burden of refugees in the EU.
This judgment by the ECtHR will not lead to the improved integration of refugees and is not an effective way of resolving the asylum challenges faced by the EU.
In addition, the neutrality of the ECtHR judges is not guaranteed.
One of the judges admitted that he would look more closely at appeals from asylum seekers than at other cases.
Giving preferential treatment to some of the parties who are lodging appeals is inappropriate.
In addition, one judge at the ECtHR comes from Turkey, where human rights are not respected and which has areas of the EU under military occupation.
For me the ECtHR is neither European nor a court of human rights.
Therefore, I have voted against this report.
