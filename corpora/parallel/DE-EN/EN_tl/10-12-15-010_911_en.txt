in writing. - The European citizens' initiative is the first tiny step in the right direction.
I have voted in favour of it because it is the first directly democratic instrument in the EU.
However, overall the citizens' initiative is simply a veneer of direct democracy, which will lead the citizens to believe that they have the right of codecision on some issues in the European Union.
The citizens' initiative does not involve any consequences, regardless of how many people sign it.
The parallels with the system of petitions for a referendum in Austria are obvious.
In Austria, these petitions are generally just shoved in a drawer and much the same thing will happen with the EU citizens' initiatives.
In addition, care has evidently been taken to ensure that non-conformist opinions can be suppressed.
The Commission makes the final check on the admissibility of a citizens' initiative.
In the real European Union, the rulers not only put in place the legislation and directives, they also want to control the will of the citizens.
However, the European citizens' initiative at least gives non-conformist movements and parties the opportunity to develop their ideas.
It will in future be possible at an EU level, as it is in Austria, to run campaigns and to show the citizens that there are routes to a different and better Europe which lead away from the blind alleys in Brussels.
