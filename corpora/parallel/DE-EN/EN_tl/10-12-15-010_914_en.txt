in writing. - Despite the improvements to the European citizens' initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles.
In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses.
For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote.
Some of our criticisms are as follows:
1.
Businesses are not excluded from the initiative.
2.
No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16.
Instead this is dependent on national electoral law.
3.
Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part.
4.
No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature).
As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all.
5.
There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens' initiative and they have no upper limit.
6.
No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected.
7.
If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision.
