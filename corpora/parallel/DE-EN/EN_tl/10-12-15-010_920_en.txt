in writing. - Some small improvements have been made in comparison with the original draft.
Therefore, I have voted in favour of the report.
Nevertheless, I would like to say that, even with this toothless citizens' initiative, there is still a striking democratic deficit in the EU, which does not have any form of direct democracy.
As a result, the next step must be the introduction of obligatory referendums for successful initiatives.
The inclusion of a mandatory public hearing for the initiators of petitions involving the Commission and Parliament is very welcome.
Now the Member States must implement the citizens' initiative quickly, without wasting time or introducing excessive red tape.
Identity card checks by local authorities, such as those which apply in the case of national petitions for referendums, will not be needed to evaluate the statements of support.
The national electoral authorities should rely on random sampling, as proposed by the European Parliament.
