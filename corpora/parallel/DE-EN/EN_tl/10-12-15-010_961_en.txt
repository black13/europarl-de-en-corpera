in writing. - This application is just one of a large number of applications from the Netherlands which we have recently approved in the Committee on Budgets.
Of course, I have voted in favour of Mrs Matera's report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to support citizens in Noord Holland who have been made redundant.
The purpose of the EGF is to make funding available to help individual citizens who have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation.
During the budget negotiations over the last few weeks, the Government of the Netherlands has excelled itself with its stubborn response to the legitimate positions taken by the European Parliament, which is always ready to compromise.
At this point, I would like to say that it seems to be compatible with the national perspective on politics to apply for tens of millions of euros in EU aid, on the one hand, and to refuse to have a legitimate discussion on the points put forward by Parliament, on the other hand.
