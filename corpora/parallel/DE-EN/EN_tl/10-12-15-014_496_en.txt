Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the EU has an extensive range of measures which can be used to improve human rights policy in a number of countries.
The EU is a regional power which should be calling in multilateral forums for human rights policies to be implemented and ensuring that there is a greater focus on making progress in this area.
Following the launch of the European External Action Service, will we take this opportunity to consider whether EU human rights policy is having the desired effect?
I hope so and I welcome the review of existing human rights policy announced by Baroness Ashton.
However, I am very concerned that it will not be possible to make appropriate use of the structures which are planned for human rights activities within the External Action Service.
There is a real risk that there will be even fewer resources available than there have been in the past and that we will have no visible, audible or effective European human rights policy.
The human rights department which is being established threatens to become a mere front if human rights policy is not represented in any way at the highest level.
The mainstreaming of human rights will not on its own produce the required results.
We need a substantial team of experts with links at the highest level and the requirement for everyone involved to take the issue seriously.
Only then will mainstreaming be possible in all areas of policy and at a central decision-making level.
It would be completely incomprehensible, unprofessional and retrogressive to focus only on mainstreaming.
Those people who are suffering from violations of their most fundamental rights expect a new and effective human rights policy from the EU and not simply the application of administrative procedures in this area.
