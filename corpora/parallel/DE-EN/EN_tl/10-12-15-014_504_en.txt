Madam President, a civilisation is measured not only by its technical progress and prosperity, but increasingly by its respect for human rights.
This is a quotation from a programme on the subject of human rights in the 21st century and should serve as a warning to us.
The credibility of the EU in this area should not be taken for granted and our policies are not immune to being measured on the basis of double standards.
The European External Action Service offers us the opportunity to follow up with actions the words which we approve every Thursday afternoon at the latest.
Human rights must be reflected in every area of EU foreign policy.
I welcome the comprehensive review of the effectiveness of all EU instruments in this area, because we are obviously not lacking the political will to make strict demands, but simply the will to implement them.
