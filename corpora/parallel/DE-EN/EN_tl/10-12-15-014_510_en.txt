Madam President, the fact that the EU is increasing its activities in the field of human rights and that the issue of persecution and discrimination against Christian minorities is specifically addressed in these reports represents a step in the right direction.
Christians suffer acute persecution in many countries, some of which have close contacts with the EU.
Examples include Egypt, Iran, Iraq and, of course, Turkey, where Christians are in some cases fighting for their very survival, both in economic and in physical terms.
We do not need a new post, such as the planned Special Representative for Human Rights, to force these countries to show more tolerance and to protect their minorities.
This will give rise to unnecessary costs and is not guaranteed to be effective, because we already have enough means of applying pressure.
We must take specific measures.
We must ensure that no treaties are signed with the EU and no financial aid is provided without a commitment to respect human rights and to protect minorities, in particular Christians.
Ladies and gentlemen, financial arguments are very powerful, especially when humanitarian arguments do not work.
Most importantly, they are well understood throughout the world.
