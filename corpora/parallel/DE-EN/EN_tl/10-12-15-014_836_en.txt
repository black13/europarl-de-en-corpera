in writing. - The fact that the EU wants to increase its activities in the field of human rights and that the issue of persecution and discrimination against Christian minorities is specifically addressed in this report represents a fundamental step in the right direction.
Christians are still suffering acute persecution today in many countries, some of which have close contacts with the EU.
To give just a few examples: In Egypt, Iran, Iraq and Turkey, Christians are fighting for their very survival, both in economic and in physical terms.
We do not need to establish a new post, such as the planned Special Representative for Human Rights, to encourage or even to force these countries to show more tolerance and to protect their minorities.
This will give rise to unnecessary costs and is not guaranteed to be effective.
We have enough means of applying pressure in the case of business interests and international trade relations.
We must take specific measures.
We must ensure that no treaties are signed with the EU and no financial aid is provided without a commitment to respect human rights and to protect minorities, in particular Christians.
Financial arguments are among the most powerful and they are understood throughout the world.
