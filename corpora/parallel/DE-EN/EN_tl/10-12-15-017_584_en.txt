Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the NATO Summit has shown that the cooperation between NATO and the European Union which was discussed there is highly important.
NATO remains essential to the collective security of Europe and it is an important means of tying in America.
The summit has made it clear that the missile defence system, which is now safeguarding the whole of Europe as part of a joint NATO project, is an important step towards further cooperation.
However, it also became obvious, and the debate on Afghanistan is an example of this, that there is a high level of civil and military cooperation in an area where the European Union can make a significant contribution.
I believe that we need to develop this accordingly.
However, we must understand that no progress has been made in one decisive area, because the necessary cooperation, which needs to be organised much more effectively, has been vetoed by NATO's partner Turkey.
Baroness Ashton, I believe that it is extremely important that this question is addressed in the context of the accession negotiations with Turkey.
We should not make NATO and the cooperation between NATO and the European Union into an instrument for use in a dispute with a Member State of the European Union which is not a member of NATO.
For this reason, I believe that the fact that Turkey has not yet taken the necessary steps is having a decisive impact on our ability to act.
Of course, I welcome the fact that the question of arms cooperation indicates that collaboration with the European Defence Agency is possible, with the cyberspace issue, in particular, being of great significance for the agency.
