Madam President, a historic breakthrough at the NATO Summit has been mentioned.
Although the dispute between Germany and France over nuclear disarmament has been settled, the fact is that we will not be able to do without nuclear weapons in future.
This would lay the NATO states open to blackmail from Teheran or Pyongyang.
A world without nuclear weapons and even without dictatorial regimes will remain an illusion while some states are only taken seriously when they join the ranks of the potential or actual nuclear powers.
It is also regrettable that the summit managed to avoid the subject of what will happen in the Middle East after the planned withdrawal of US forces from Iraq, which is an unpleasant topic for the United States.
The much-quoted reversal of Russia's foreign policy trend has proved, after a closer look, to be just a clever tactical move.
There were declarations of intent relating to terrorism and cyber war, rather than genuine concepts.
In my opinion, the NATO Summit was far from being a breakthrough.
