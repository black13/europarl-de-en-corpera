Madam President, what will the EU's responsibilities be with regard to security and defence in the context of the new strategic concept presented by NATO?
The EU defence ministers have touched on a sore point.
The EU does not have adequate capacity or capabilities.
However, the financial crisis and budget constraints are increasing the pressure within the EU and NATO to concentrate military capabilities.
The terms 'sharing' and 'pooling' describe what is now needed.
As soon as the Member States have investigated what is possible, the European Defence Agency must be the main focus of the joint development of capabilities.
In addition, the Commission must expand its cooperation with the European Defence Agency to include EU-funded research and development projects.
Do you share my view?
Because I had no speaking time on the previous subject, I would like to ask a question about the topic of promoting democracy.
I would like to find out from you how much money has actually been spent on the democracy and human rights instrument without the consent of the governments of the countries in question.
I also have something to say about election observers.
In this area we are inconsistent and sometimes even cowardly.
After parts of the Commission and some Member States had pushed for an election observation mission in Ethiopia and the report by the head of the mission could not be presented in Addis Abeba, it was completely hushed up in Brussels.
What I would like to know is: What has happened to your public protest?
You now have the opportunity to say something on this subject.
