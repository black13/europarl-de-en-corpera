Mr President, I am very pleased that this initiative, which is already implemented in some Member States, has now come before the European Union as a whole.
It was right and proper that a biennial cycle should have been chosen for awarding the label.
I would also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur in this matter.
However, I must admit that I have a slight reservation about the fact that we must manage to draw a precise distinction between UNESCO's world cultural heritage programme and the European character of this label.
Otherwise, it will be hard for our citizens to understand why this particular label has a special European dimension.
I have taken a look to see what sites have been nominated by the Member States so far and have found, naturally enough, that they are primarily man-made structures.
Our idea in the Committee on Culture and Education was not just to recognise buildings, although buildings are an important element, but, more importantly, objects of value and other sites, or even experiences, that are associated with European development.
Which brings me to the last point in my comments.
It will be particularly important to appoint appropriate experts to the juries who have assimilated these aims and who will help to implement and develop them.
This being the case, there would be no need to fear the bureaucracy that could conceivably arise.
