Mr President, understandably enough, Switzerland, which provides some of the financial backing for the 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes, now wishes to participate in these programmes.
However, in the spirit of learning, it would also be good if the EU were to take a leaf out of Switzerland's book when it comes to direct democracy.
When the Swiss population decides against the erection of minarets, this decision is accepted.
Likewise, the recent initiative on the deportation of foreign criminals.
The Swiss authorities are aware that when the people say 'no', they mean 'no', so that they do not simply continue to hold ballots until they get the result they want, as has happened in the EU in the case of Ireland, for example.
The fact is that the original rejection of the constitutional treaty for Europe at that time may have made it easier for some Swiss to vote in favour of the Schengen and Dublin Agreements.
They might find it easier to form an alliance with a loose federation of states than with a centralist European Union.
This is something that cannot be concealed by the voices currently being heard in Switzerland calling for accession to the EU.
Not everything in the European Union garden is rosy; centralising tendencies are on the rise and developments are moving inexorably in the direction of a transfer union.
