Mr President, like everyone else here, I have the feeling that Switzerland may come increasingly closer to Europe in this way, eventually, and hopefully soon, becoming a full member of the European Union, something that is certainly greatly to be welcomed.
We should be encouraged by this small white spot in the middle of the map of Europe.
According to our estimates, the 'Youth in Action' programme will reach about one million people.
The important prevailing aim is that youth organisations should take part.
This is a signal to the next generation that their active participation is very welcome.
I would also like to express my appreciation to Mrs Pack for her efforts.
We need to reach out from the Union to other countries, in this case Switzerland, as this is the only way that we can achieve success.
Simply waiting for the Swiss to ask to join the European Union will probably not be enough in times like these.
In addition, we must not forget that financial support for the Committee on Culture and Education in particular gives us reason to hope that Switzerland will also join in other programmes soon.
