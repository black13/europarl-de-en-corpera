Mr President, I am very pleased to see that some of my fellow Members from the ranks of the Euro-sceptics have voted in favour of this motion, agreeing how wonderful it is that Switzerland is to join this programme and that there will be greater European cooperation on education.
This will open up horizons perhaps also for the Members themselves, but certainly for the younger generation in Switzerland.
We are pleased with this.
Mr Mölzer is no longer here, but I note that he did not mention the fact that Switzerland did not hold a referendum on this cooperation.
It is indeed remarkable that Switzerland decided against such a step in this area in particular.
After all, it can be sure that the younger generation has been waiting a long time for the opportunity for such cooperation.
Mr Mölzer obviously failed to notice that a referendum did not take place in this case.
The people do not need to be consulted on every single issue.
Good things, such as accession to the European Union, will be self-evident.
I hope that the younger generation will benefit from the fruitful cooperation in these education and youth programmes and that they will become real Europeans who, at some stage, will say: 'Now is the time for us also to join the European Union, sharing with the rest of Europe in all other policy areas.
We are a single continent, and should also agree on these questions'.
I am certain that these education programmes will play an important role in enhancing European awareness among the people throughout Switzerland.
