Mr President, Commissioner, at this point, I would like once again to point out that a decision has already been made to ban the practice of battery farming in cages.
The Member States and the egg producers have had plenty of time to implement the directive for the abandonment of conventional battery practices.
The time has not run out quite yet - there are still twelve months to go before the practice is to be completely banned.
I believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 January 2012.
It must be possible to threaten the Member States who have not succeeded in implementing the directive by then with legal action, such as financial penalties.
We also need to ensure that eggs which originate from farming practices that do not comply with European law are not sold in the internal European market.
