Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have known for twelve years that battery farming practices would be banned in the EU from 1 January 2012 onwards.
How can it be that twelve years have not been enough for some Member States to implement this ban in good time and to prepare their poultry industry accordingly?
This is just one of many examples of how poor implementation leads to frustration.
Egg producers in Member States who have implemented the changes in good time are already experiencing competitive anomalies that run counter to the principles of the EU.
I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented.
Eggs should no longer be produced in battery cages after January 2012 and the then illegal eggs should no longer be allowed to reach the shops, putting an end to their negative effect on competition.
The farmers who have changed their practices to comply with EU requirements should not experience financial disadvantage while those who flout the changeover reap the economic benefits.
It is impossible to explain to people in Europe why EU law does not apply equally in all Member States and why some Member States are always seen to be dragging their feet.
The recent crises show where this can lead us.
We need a Europe that acts in a concerted way, rather than one in which every member can do as it pleases, regardless of the rest.
