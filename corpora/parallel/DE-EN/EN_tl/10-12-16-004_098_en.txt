Mr President, it must be clear to us all that the health of our animals and, by association, human health must be our prime concern.
In the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) scientific committee, where we carry out technology options assessments, we also have the 'Better Life' project, which looks at ways of improving future conditions in the area of nutrition and feedstuffs.
For this reason, particularly in the context of the Eighth Framework Research Programme, I would ask the Commissioner to work to ensure that the research programmes in the areas of foodstuffs/feedstuffs are strengthened, so that there is an improvement in research into the safety of foodstuffs and the health of animals and humans in this area and so that we can prepare the appropriate documents here for the citizens of Europe in the future.
