Mr President, I simply wanted to thank the House services because we have finished in an exemplary fashion today fifteen minutes before the vote, so that chaos will be avoided in the plenary sitting.
This orderly procedure sends out the right signals to the public.
I should like to express my particular gratitude to the House services.
