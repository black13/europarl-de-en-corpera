Understandably enough, Switzerland, which provides some of the financial backing for the 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes, now wishes to participate in these programmes.
In the spirit of learning, it would also be a positive development if the EU were to take a leaf out of Switzerland's book when it comes to direct democracy.
When the Swiss population decides against the erection of minarets, this decision is accepted.
Likewise, the recent initiative on the deportation of foreign criminals.
The Swiss authorities are aware that when the people say 'no', they mean 'no' so that they do not simply continue to hold ballots until they get the result they want, then express surprise at a drop in voter turnout.
The Swiss example should give us pause to reflect on the concerns that people have.
I cannot fully agree to the regulations described in this report, which is why I have voted against it.
