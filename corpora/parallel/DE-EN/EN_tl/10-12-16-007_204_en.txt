The report on human rights in the world 2009 is very detailed and addresses a wide variety of issues.
Unfortunately, I somehow get the impression that there has been a desperate attempt to pack in every possible issue here without following a clear strategy.
The fact is that the promotion of democracy throughout the world must be an important issue for the Europe Union.
However, this requires a clear approach and a definite, consistent strategy for resolving these problems, some of which are extremely difficult.
Since there is no sign of such a strategy, I abstained during the final vote.
