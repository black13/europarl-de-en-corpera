In general, the rapporteur has quite correctly recognised the situation in Afghanistan.
He is aware that resources and troops are being deployed completely incorrectly in Afghanistan and that additional resources and troops will do nothing to change this.
He has correctly recognised that the presence and disdainful demeanour of the Coalition is the primary reason for its absolute rejection by the local population.
He is also aware that it is not possible to foist democracy and Western values on the people of Afghanistan.
However, the rapporteur must be criticised for harping on themes such as women's rights which, although very important, are completely unacceptable at local level and therefore render the entire peace process even less likely.
In addition, the rapporteur, despite identifying their negative effect, also calls for more troops and more resources for Afghanistan.
I am convinced that the Afghan conflict is an unjust war and that the continued occupation of the country is of no benefit either to Europe or to Afghanistan itself.
Europe's first line of defence is not at the Hindu Kush.
It is for that reason that I have voted against this report.
