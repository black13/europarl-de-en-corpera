There have always been efforts to centralise control within the European Union.
These efforts seem to have increased recently in tandem with a rise in bureaucracy, despite all the statements to the contrary.
It must remain a matter for the Member States to decide what powers they wish to cede to the EU and/or the Commission.
This cannot be changed by judgments by the European Court of Justice, which seems to have been pursuing the principle of a centralised state in its judgments for years.
Likewise, the Treaty of Lisbon cannot be exploited for this purpose, nor may such objectives be pursued under the pretext of crisis management.
In theory, there is a clear acceptance of the subsidiarity principle.
However, this is frequently ignored or skirted in practice.
I voted in favour of the report because it basically goes against this trend.
