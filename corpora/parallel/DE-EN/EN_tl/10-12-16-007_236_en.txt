The motion for a resolution placed before us today with the specious title 'Establishing a Crisis Mechanism' is, in fact, a desperate attempt by the EU imperialists to bind all EU Member States together in a common European destiny, following the principle of 'United we stand, united we fall'.
Right from the start, the euro was a completely misjudged construct that was bound to fail.
It is not possible to shoehorn together states with completely different national economies under a single shared currency.
Because there is no desire for greater integration or for the transfer of taxes between the peoples of Europe, it will be necessary to abolish the existing monetary union and to establish a hard currency union.
For this reason, I favour bringing this business to a close instead of allowing it to lurch from one disaster to the next.
I am therefore voting against this motion for a resolution.
