The political situation in the Côte d'Ivoire is extremely critical.
In principle, I believe that it is not the job of the European Union to play the role of the world's police force because foreign countries must be able to determine their own destiny without needing the blessing of the EU or USA.
However, in this case, we are not faced with the will of the people of the Côte d'Ivoire, but rather with the tyrannical subjugation of this people by an established elite.
Some years ago, we had a situation in Europe where people were forced into a highly dubious form of state by political powers who had the necessary military means at their disposal.
It is important that these powers should not be driven from their positions by violent means.
However, it is equally important that peaceful means should be used to put pressure on these persons, so as to make it difficult for them to continue with their unjust policies.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.
