The banning of conventional battery cages in 2012 represents an enormous success for animal welfare.
However, these uniform standards must apply throughout Europe, otherwise they are pointless.
It is vital that we fight for this Europe-wide deadline in the interests of animals and of producers who have already invested in alternative farming practices.
In order to establish equal competition, the Commission must ensure that eggs that are not produced in the correct way are not allowed to reach the European market.
At the very least, consumers must be able to identify eggs and egg products produced in compliance with European standards.
I was the Christian Democrat spokesman on animal welfare in the German Bundestag when Parliament decided on this ban.
At the time, I defended the resolution because it was to apply to the whole of Europe.
I expect the Commission to take suitable steps to ensure that the deadline is met in all Member States.
This means that there should be no more conventional battery cages in use in Europe after 2012.
