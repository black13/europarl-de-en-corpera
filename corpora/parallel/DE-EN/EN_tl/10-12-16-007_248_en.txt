Eleven years on from a provision having been passed, it is hard to understand how it can be that so few steps have been taken for its implementation.
This can mainly be laid at the door of the Commission, which, in the past, has often watered down its former provisions, so that they were no longer taken seriously.
If it indeed proves to be the case that here, too, a lazy compromise will be reached, this will once again undermine the credibility of the EU.
It is my fervent hope that by 1 January 2012, there will no longer be any illegal battery farms in the market or, at the very least, that these will be hit with such punitive taxes that they will no longer enjoy any competitive advantage.
For this reason, I voted in favour of the report.
