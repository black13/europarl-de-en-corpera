The Member States of the European Union who are fighting at America's side in the war in Afghanistan should withdraw their troops from this country as quickly as possible.
The Afghan War will soon have lasted nine years and there is still no sign of any improvement in the security situation.
On the contrary, the Islamist Taliban is growing in strength.
Europe is wasting its resources instead of deploying them where they are urgently needed, for example, on the EU's Balkan borders.
It is hard to see what European interests are actually to be defended in the Hindu Kush.
It would seem that the primary concern is not to establish democracy in Afghanistan according to the Western model, as the Americans claim.
Instead, economic interests play a central role, particularly because, according to the New York Times, it is estimated that around USD 1 billion worth of natural resources lie buried in Afghanistan.
Obviously, the EU is required to help US concerns to exploit these riches without disruption.
It is for that reason that I have voted against this report.
