Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Malaysia is a wonderful country with age-old traditions and cultural riches.
As members of the ASEAN delegation, we have frequently seen for ourselves how quickly and remarkably this country has grown.
The resulting increase in economic power has led to Malaysia achieving top ten ranking when it comes to world growth rates, a fact that has greatly impressed us.
It is for this reason that I would like to state on behalf of my own group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, as well as all those here who signed the resolution, that we find it impossible to understand why Malaysia still practises this outmoded method of chastisement, which harkens back to the country's colonial past and which seems almost mediaeval to us in Europe.
We are not alone in voicing this criticism: lawyers in Malaysia itself are equally opposed to the practice.
Caning violates all United Nations human rights agreements and we believe that things need to change quickly.
We welcomed the charter of the ASEAN states, which emphasises in several articles and the preamble that - and I quote - 'the promotion and protection of human rights' is among the essential requirements of the ASEAN Charter, which has also been ratified by Malaysia.
Malaysia has long espoused democratic principles.
However, this also involves the rule of law with universal standards.
This is something we shall repeat again and again when we are in Malaysia and the ASEAN states, and the European Parliament will underline this with this resolution.
