Mr President, this resolution condemns the practice of caning in Malaysia.
The term caning should not be understood to mean an outmoded, harmless educational instrument, but is rather a horrific, demeaning and humiliating punishment, which is banned under the UN Convention against Torture.
Anyone who doubts this should take a look at a video showing how this punishment is meted out in Malaysia.
In terms of their brutality and horror, these images are nothing other than documentary evidence of torture.
Malaysia uses this horrific and humiliating practice to punish at least 66 misdemeanours and approximately 1 000 people are beaten in the country's gaols every year.
In addition, in recent years, this brutal treatment has also been extended to migrants entering the country without papers and to drug addicts.
It is estimated that a group of between 350 000 and 900 000 people are affected.
We therefore urgently call on the Malaysian Government immediately to desist from this horrific, demeaning and humiliating practice and to repeal the relevant laws in the medium term.
Malaysia is a member of the UN Human Rights Council.
As the previous speaker pointed out, this body also equates the application of corporal punishment with torture.
For this reason, Malaysia would do well to remain in this body, but also to uphold the principles represented there.
