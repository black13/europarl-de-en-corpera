Mr President, when you love someone, you have certain expectations of them.
It is the same when it comes to relationships between states.
States with whom we have a particularly close relationship do not fall into the same category as some terrible dictatorships on other continents.
Malaysia is a valued close partner of the European Union.
Its constitution is, in some respects, an example for a European constitution.
That is why we view what is going on in Malaysia so seriously.
Mr Tannock, caning in Malaysia was not introduced by Sharia law, but is a carryover from British colonial times.
Just as British colonial power no longer exists and Great Britain has changed in the meantime, Malaysia must also change and try to abolish this antiquated and barbaric punishment, which violates international law and human rights.
I want to be very clear on this.
For decades, Malaysia has been a country characterised by tolerance between the various ethnic groups and religious communities.
The country should stick to this path and it will do so as a particularly close partner of the European Union, which we hope will succeed in banning this barbaric form of punishment.
