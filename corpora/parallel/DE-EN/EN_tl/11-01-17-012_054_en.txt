Madam President, I am not convinced with regard to all of the points of the compromise, but I know that the new regulation represents a definite improvement on the current legal situation.
First of all, we will get a standardised European technical language for the performance of construction products and streamlined and simplified procedures.
We have made progress with the European internal market and, in so doing, we have benefited the companies and also, through standardised safety requirements, the consumers, too.
In principle, I regard relief from bureaucratic regulations for micro-enterprises to be important and sensible.
However, we also need to take account of the fact that micro-enterprises that process construction products are also users and must also be protected.
I am therefore pleased that my proposal was included in the compromise.
This provides for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises in connection with the evaluation of the performance characteristics of construction products.
However, if they apply such a procedure, they must prove the equivalence of the procedure used with the procedure that is actually provided for throughout Europe.
This is the only way to ensure that the details of the performance characteristics are also accurate and reliable and that the safety of buildings is also ensured throughout Europe.
