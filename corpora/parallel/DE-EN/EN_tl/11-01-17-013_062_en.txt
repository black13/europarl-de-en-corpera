Madam President, Commissioner, thank you Commissioner for the factual presentation of this dioxin scandal in Germany.
It makes me extremely angry, including in my capacity as a farmer, that again and again, we have to deal with scandals of this kind where the cause can seemingly be attributed to carelessness, but also to criminal activity.
We can put as many laws and regulations in place as we like - in Europe, we have some of the most stringent laws on the production of food and we have the lowest limit values for ingredients that could harm the health of our consumers - but still we are not immune to such dangers.
That is why it must also be a requirement - and the Member States are also responsible for this - that if the public prosecutor determines that criminal activity is involved, the magnitude of the penalty must be increased substantially.
Such people must not get off with a fine - prison sentences are called for here.
They must be put away so that they cannot cause such a disaster again.
Commissioner, I am very pleased that you have acknowledged that the German authorities took the appropriate sequence of measures - that was also my impression in Germany.
There was a certain amount of political commotion about the matter not being dealt with correctly.
We all need to get together and, where necessary, supplement the strict provisions that we have in place.
You mentioned one particular matter with regard to which you have our full support.
I, too, am in favour - and I am also speaking on behalf of my group - of the introduction of the strict segregation of food production from the production of other products to prevent such mix ups from happening.
You have our support, Commissioner, when it comes to improving our provisions and regulations further to enable us to better prevent such scandals in future.
