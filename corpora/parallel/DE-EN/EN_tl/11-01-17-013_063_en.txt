Madam President, Commissioner, I am rather surprised by your remarks.
My perception of the press - at least in Germany - is somewhat different.
It makes me extremely angry, too, that again and again, we are faced with scandals in the area of food safety.
We cannot allow this to happen.
I am aware that regulations and laws alone cannot prevent criminal activities in this area.
However, we must do everything we can to make it as difficult as possible for those responsible.
The Commission must call on the Member States to urgently review the level of their penalties in this area.
The wilful and negligent handling of food and feed must not be punished with trivial penalties.
Often, the fine is so low compared with the profit that it is paid out of the petty cash.
It is also extremely important to increase the number of state inspectors.
The current example in Germany demonstrates very well that the principle of self-checking has major shortcomings.
I would like to point out that the polluter pays principle needs to be applied consistently throughout the whole chain - from trough to table.
After all, the safety of our food begins with what we feed to our animals.
Innocent people should not have to suffer the consequences of the criminal behaviour of others.
As yet, it is not clear who will pay for the losses suffered by farmers as a result of the dioxin scandal.
One thing is certain: it will not be the polluters that have gone bankrupt, as there is absolutely no money left there.
This is unacceptable.
In this regard, a European fund should be considered that all feedstuff manufacturers would have to pay into.
The problems that keep occurring in connection with food safety continue to make one thing clear: for the whole process chain, for both food as well as feed, we need to ensure complete traceability.
The EU regulation and national legislation need to be improved in this regard.
