Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current dioxin incident is more than just a scandal.
The people of Europe have been shown their reflection.
How long have we been complaining that there is an extreme fight for prices and survival going on in agriculture, fuelled by the insatiable demand for ever cheaper food.
For a long time now, this fight has been more than simply a trial of strength.
Individuals are increasingly resorting to criminal means and methods.
However, we will all lose out in the end as a result.
We can enact more laws and directives, we can carry out more checks at even more cost, we can impose more severe penalties - none of these things will succeed against the criminal energy fuelled by such a tough fight for existence.
We must finally tackle the causes of this problem.
We must at last put an end to the constant demand for more and cheaper food.
As a farmer, I have experienced the powerlessness against the criminal activities of certain individuals - as in this case - on my own doorstep.
Together with my professional colleagues, I have shuddered at the thought of who will be next in line and innocently drawn into this maelstrom.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission: what do you and your colleagues intend to do to restore the value of food?
I welcome your proposals, but with these you will not solve the main problem.
