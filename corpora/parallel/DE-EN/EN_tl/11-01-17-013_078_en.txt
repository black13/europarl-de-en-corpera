Madam President, may I ask the previous speaker a question?
He said that, essentially, the system works.
I would be very interested to hear whether he is aware that it was not the system but consumers who helped to discover what had happened here.
Secondly, with regard to the information that the previous speaker is in possession of, I would like to ask him whether he is also aware that there are studies that show that citizens would be happy to pay a bit more if they could be sure that the products are of a high quality and have come from animals that have been kept in a way that is appropriate for their species.
