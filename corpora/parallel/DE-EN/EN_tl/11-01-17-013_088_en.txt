Madam President, let me start by saying that, as far as I am concerned, this is not negligence, it is a deliberate crime.
What is it that we need?
There are a couple of important things that we need: firstly, a mandatory EU-wide labelling requirement, but it should indicate not only the place of slaughter, but also the place of origin.
Consumers are currently being deliberately misled.
Studies quite clearly show that people would be happy to pay.
They just want the chain - where the product comes from and where it really originates from - to be fully traceable.
Secondly, we need more stringent checks.
At the end of the day, it was not a food inspector or an EU food safety agency that made the discovery, but the company itself.
Thirdly, we need the clear segregation of food fat and fat produced for technical purposes.
I totally agree with Pythagoras, who once again quite aptly said: 'everything that humans do to the animals comes back to them'.
