Madam President, Commissioner, I am not an agricultural romantic; in other words; I do not believe the advertising slogans about the happy hens and the happy pigs, because my daily experience is rather different.
However, I do nevertheless believe that consumers in Europe have a right to food that is safe.
Hence, my first major demand is that we need stringent checks and we need tough penalties.
However, I believe today's discussion has made it clear that we also need a different agricultural structure in Europe.
Commissioner Dalli, who is responsible for health, is with us today and, to some extent, he is the one in the firing line.
We also need to take the lessons we have learned from this scandal and use them in our agricultural reform to provide a structure for the agriculture industry in Europe that, on the one hand, meets the needs of agriculture and farmers and, on the other, also ensures safety for consumers.
I would ask that we truly learn from this scandal.
