Madam President, the German animal feed industry has a good system of self-controlled tests.
However, this system does not work in the case of criminal activities and schemes.
If someone intentionally or illegally mixes prohibited substances into animal feed, he will also intentionally avoid these self-controlled tests.
Following on from what my fellow Members have said, I think there are three more important principal conclusions: firstly, we need more state checks.
Secondly, we need it to be a requirement to report all of the results of feed tests, and these must also be produced during the relevant checks.
Thirdly, we need tougher penalties for the criminals.
This is not a minor offence - it was done with intent.
Finally, I would like to point out that, in this animal feed scandal, it is the farmers who are suffering the most, because at the moment, they are not able to sell their products at all, or if they can, it is at a huge loss.
