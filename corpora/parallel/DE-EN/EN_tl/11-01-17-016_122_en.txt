Madam President, I believe that the subject of timber will occupy us even more intensively in future.
For this agreement, it is therefore important that we provide appropriate support in the area of research and, above all, that, in terms of education and training, we make sure that the small and medium-sized enterprises in Cameroon and Congo have the opportunity to develop further in terms of their environmental knowledge in this area.
I am therefore very pleased that this debate is taking place.
It is important for all of us that the demand for timber is satisfied in future, too.
