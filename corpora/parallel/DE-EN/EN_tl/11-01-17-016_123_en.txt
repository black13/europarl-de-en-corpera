Madam President, forty percent of Cameroon's surface area is covered in forest.
Yet, we have to say, that although Cameroon is the largest exporter of tropical wood in Africa, in no other country are the forests being so extensively cleared.
Experts estimate that, in 10 to 15 years, the ecologically important tree species from the Congo Basin will have disappeared if the logging continues as it has done.
What can we do about this?
What is important for the protection of Cameroon's tropical forests is, above all, that corruption is combated, both at the level of the officials and also where the private tenant farmers are concerned, that effective criminal prosecutions continue to be carried out and, of course, that sustainable forestry is practised.
Where a lot of felling takes place, there must also be regeneration.
Something that is very important is better training in logging work in order to avoid premature damage during clearing.
Above all, European companies must take some responsibility, because around 80% of the yield is shipped to Europe.
The EU must also act accordingly in this regard by taking direct and decisive measures.
A voluntary agreement is all well and good, but in this context, it will not get us anywhere.
We need to make the companies accountable.
