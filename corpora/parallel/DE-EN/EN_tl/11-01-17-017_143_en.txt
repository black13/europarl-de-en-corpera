Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator for the Committee on Fisheries, I find the fisheries aspect of this interim agreement particularly interesting.
In this regard, there were a few controversial issues at the start with regard to the relaxation of the rules of origin for Papua New Guinea.
I support the Commission's idea of using this relaxation to stimulate the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world.
I am convinced that this is also something that should be of concern to those of us involved in fisheries policy.
At the same time, I can understand the concerns of the European industry, but I cannot honestly imagine that the relaxations granted will lead to Papua New Guinea becoming a serious competitor of our canning industry.
However, we need to be vigilant, because it will clearly not help anyone if we relocate half our canning industry to the Pacific region.
In this regard, I have to say, however, that during the debate on this agreement, we have been presented with very contradictory information regarding the question of the extent to which investments are being made in Papua New Guinea and which states are profiting indirectly from the relaxation of the rules of origin.
I would therefore urgently call on the Commission to closely monitor the application of this derogation and to submit a report to Parliament in a timely manner on the impact on Papua New Guinea's development and on the European canning industry.
If this arrangement does not have the desired effect in Papua New Guinea and entails unacceptable losses for European companies, we will have to make a different decision when we come to negotiate the final agreement.
Please keep us informed of developments.
