The Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Fiji and Papua New Guinea intercedes in the complicated and complex integration process in the Pacific region.
Unfortunately, it provides almost no development support for either of the two states.
I would like to remind you that the military coup in Fiji in 2006 was unanimously condemned by the European Parliament, the Council and also by the Commission.
With the conclusion of this trade agreement, the dictatorship that has been in place up to now will be recognised as a contracting party of sorts.
The efforts of our partners in Australia, New Zealand and other countries of the region to restore democracy in Fiji will be undermined by this agreement.
When I criticised the suppression of democracy by the military in Fiji in our meeting of the Committee on International Trade, the response from its representatives was: 'But we are in control!'
What I regard as sheer cynicism, seems now to satisfy the demands of the Commission for the legitimacy of its fellow contracting parties.
My group will vote against this agreement.
I am in favour of suspending the agreement until democracy is restored in Fiji.
