Children are among those in our society who are most in need of protection, particularly if they are orphans, vulnerable or abused children.
In the case of international adoptions, children who are taken away from the environment that they are used to often suffer a huge amount of damage as a result.
Therefore, the welfare of the child must always take priority.
That is something that the United Nations also needs to take into account.
Last year, a campaign was launched in Mexico City on subway tickets aimed at promoting the right of homosexual couples to adopt.
According to media reports, this campaign was supported by the United Nations, even though psychologists confirm that growing up with a father AND a mother as role models is of key importance for a child's development.
Stable family relationships are especially important in the case of adopted children who, as such, have already not had the best start in life.
There can be difficulties in any partnership, but, for the sake of the welfare of the children, we should not make problems a foregone conclusion right from the start.
