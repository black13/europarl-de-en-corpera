Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we are able to discuss this problem here in this House today.
I have two further comments or questions that always concern me when it comes to humanitarian aid.
Firstly, it is clearly indisputable and important that we should provide assistance if people are in need, but - as the previous speaker has already said - we must always ask the question: will these funds actually be used properly and appropriately?
Secondly, there is something else that we must not ignore.
It is right to provide humanitarian aid for people in need.
This could be a result of a natural disaster, but it is increasingly also a result of disasters that have been caused by people themselves.
This includes, in particular, political or armed conflicts.
We need to bear in mind that, although humanitarian aid provides emergency relief, at the same time, we must also eliminate the causes, namely, the political acts of violence.
