Mr President, it is the case in politics as it is in daily life: we do not fully appreciate what we have.
Thus, it also clearly seems to be the case that we in the European Union have an excess of food, and there is, of course, always plenty to buy.
If we compensate for animal feed exports, we have in the European Union a self-sufficiency rate of 88%.
That means that, in the European Union, we, too, must endeavour to ensure that we maintain this self-sufficiency rate in terms of agricultural products and foodstuffs.
I am therefore very grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs SÃ¢rbu, for bringing this problem into the spotlight once again.
In the European Union, we also need a common agricultural policy that can supply our citizens with sufficient food.
In view of the increasing global population, the effects of climate change and increasing energy prices, it is clear that farmers in Europe will not be able to manage this alone in future.
For this, we also need strategic coordination on a global scale.
