The own-initiative report recognises the fact that agriculture is of strategic importance in the context of global food security.
A glance into the future shows how urgent the need for action is.
By 2050, experts estimate that global demand for food will double.
Agriculture must be in a position to be able to meet the enormous needs of the growing population for safe and adequate food.
At the same time, the obstacles resulting from the limitation of natural resources, high energy prices and climate change need to be dealt with.
I supported the report, which clearly demonstrates that food security is a central concern in the European Union, too, and requires coordination of the individual policy areas.
Only if the areas of agricultural policy, development policy, trade policy, financial policy and energy policy, as well as research, work together can improvements be achieved.
Securing the incomes of farmers and an adequate supply of good quality food must therefore be key goals of the common agricultural policy.
The greatly fluctuating market prices in the agricultural sector are the result of crop failures, speculation and a concentration in trade, and these are significant uncertainty factors.
Interventions and stockpiling are the crisis mechanisms that will put a stop to market abuse and speculative transactions.
It is important that these market intervention mechanisms play a central role in the future common agricultural policy.
Another important point is the recommendation for the development of a global system of food stocks and emergency reserves.
