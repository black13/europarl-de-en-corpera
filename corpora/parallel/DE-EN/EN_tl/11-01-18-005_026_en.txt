Madam President, we, too, advocate the accession of the Western Balkans to the European Union and, of course, also that of Serbia.
Each country is discrete, of course, but the region is interconnected and the action of each country in the region has a crucial impact on the success of the process itself.
In this context, I would like to point out, once again, that, for us, Serbia's accession process cannot progress any further without a definite all clear from the International Criminal Court and, as my fellow Member just said, more proactive and, above all, more effective cooperation with the Court on the ground.
There have also been positive developments.
One such development was the adoption of the Gender Equality Act, which we were very pleased about.
What we want to see now is for its implementation to take place really quickly and we are calling on the Commission to make money available to support this process.
If this region wants to grow together, we also need more public transport options in and through the region again.
In this regard too, I call on the Commission to provide more support and funding in this area through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), as we are convinced that what is needed is contact between people and not just between leaders.
This is very much fostered if it becomes easier for the people of the region to be mobile.
Mobility is also a question that I would like to just mention quickly before I finish, specifically with regard to the vehicle licence plates that Belgrade continues to issue for seven regions in the north of Kosovo.
We call on Belgrade to finally desist from issuing these licence plates for Kosovo.
