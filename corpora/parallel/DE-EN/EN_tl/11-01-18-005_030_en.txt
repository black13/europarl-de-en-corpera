Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Kacin for what he has put forward.
His report makes a clear case for a 'yes' vote.
I think that, for all the issues where we continue to criticise Serbia, for all the imperatives for internal reform processes, all the necessity of cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), for the issues relating to the fight against corruption, which is particularly far-reaching in Serbia in particular, with mafia mob activities taking place and influencing economic life, the struggle in respect of all of this needs to be fought over the years and this is a condition for Serbia to continue on a positive pro-European course towards membership of the European Union, as they were firmly promised at Thessaloniki, and we need to be true to that promise.
I would also like to say, however, that it is necessary to cooperate with Serbia.
You only have to look into the history of the region to know that there can only be lasting peaceful development if Serbia is on board and that we therefore must see Serbia not only as an applicant for future membership of the European Union but also as an essential strategic partner in the sensible development of the entire region and that, for this reason, we should be a source of encouragement and that we should not treat Serbia less well than states that are Member States of the European Union or that are a long way down the road to accession, for whatever historical reasons, be they short or long-term.
Given the courage with which President Tadić has fought for a European course and how embattled he is in Serbia, it is imperative that we support these political forces and encourage them so that they are able to show their population that the path to Europe, rather than a nationalistic path, is the right path for the people, too.
For this reason, I would like to invite everyone, and the Member States, in particular, to move forward quickly with the ratification process and, in this way, send a signal that the steps that Serbia is taking towards Europe must be supported so that we can achieve security in the region in the long run.
