Madam President, I was in Croatia a few days ago and never has so much been spoken about Serbia there as in recent days, and specifically in a very positive sense because of exactly what Mr Brok said - the brave moves that Mr Tadić has made together with President Josipović - and I am also aware that Deputy Prime Minister Đelić is heavily involved in this regard - are significant steps towards Europe.
These are elements of a regional collaboration, but a regional collaboration with a great political as well as humanitarian significance.
It is therefore very important - and in this regard I fully back what Mr Brok and other Members have said - that we encourage Serbia to continue to take such steps.
Clearly, this also applies to relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We all know how important it is that Serbia positively engages - and the same applies to Croatia - in order for that country to hold together and also to carry out the appropriate reforms.
In this regard, Serbia really is very courageous here and it is absolutely crucial to regional collaboration.
One critical element that I nevertheless wish to raise is collaboration with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
I had, of course, invited Mr Brammertz to attend the working group of the Committee on Foreign Affairs that I chair.
We are not completely satisfied in this area - more can be done.
Our promptings in this regard have not really been satisfied.
I would therefore ask everyone to put pressure on for this to happen.
As Mrs Koppa has already said, this is not just a question for Europe.
Serbia must also work on these issues for Serbia itself.
Just as there has been this apology in Vukovar, which will undoubtedly go down in the history of the country, the fight against those who have committed major crimes must also continue.
