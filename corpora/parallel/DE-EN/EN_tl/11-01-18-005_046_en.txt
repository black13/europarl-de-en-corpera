Madam President, contrary to the view of those advocates of the EU who wear rose-tinted glasses, accession to the Union alone is not enough to resolve all conflicts just like that.
Especially when it comes to the applicant state of Turkey, it can be seen that the EU operates a double standard.
Serbia, after all, is ready to engage in talks with Kosovo even though the EU's attitude is manifestly inconsistent: in Bosnia, multiple ethnic groups are to be forced into a multicultural State while in Kosovo, it is deemed legitimate for a single ethnic group to hive itself off from a State.
Not only has Serbia expressed its willingness to talk to Kosovo, but it has also apologised for the genocide at Srebrenica.
Yet, despite this, Belgrade continues to be accused of failing to adequately cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
The violations of human rights in Turkey, however, where simply discussing the Armenian genocide is enough to merit punishment, are apparently something that can be overlooked.
The accusation against Kosovar Prime Minister Tha√ßi of trading in human organs also demonstrates that war crimes cannot be viewed in a one-sided way.
These accusations must be fully resolved.
For accession to the EU, it is very important that Serbia and Kosovo first resolve their disputes.
