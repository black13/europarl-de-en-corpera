Mr President, Belgium definitely took over the Presidency of the Council in a very difficult transitional phase, as, for one thing, the economic crisis had not yet been overcome, whilst, at the same time, the Treaty of Lisbon, of course, had not yet been completely implemented, while its limited fitness for purpose also became apparent.
In the whole debate about the euro rescue package, however, there is a significant aspect that must not be forgotten, namely, that both the rescue package for the euro area countries and the loans for Greece violate the Treaty of Lisbon.
Both measures thus lack the necessary legal basis.
That means that this is a clear case of the EU exceeding its competence, which ultimately makes a proper amendment procedure for the Treaty indispensable.
After further rescue package candidates - like Ireland and Portugal - Spain, too, is a problem child for the euro area.
On the other side of the coin, net contributors such as Germany and Austria are, by and by, becoming the cash cows of the European Union.
Obviously, things cannot continue in this way.
Belgium was not really able to master either of these two - admittedly difficult - challenges, namely, overcoming the economic crisis and implementing the Treaty of Lisbon.
