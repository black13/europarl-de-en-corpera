Belgium occupied the Presidency of the European Union for the last six months and hardly anyone there seems to have noticed.
The country was mainly preoccupied - and what is more, unsuccessfully so - with forming a new government, while the quarrelling between the Flemings and the Walloons has rendered the country unable to make political decisions.
It was therefore little wonder that the EU political establishment had an easy ride in its desire to push forward centralisation within the European Union.
The euro crisis was used as a pretext to forge plans for European economic governance.
Meanwhile, the so-called 'permanent rescue package' for the euro is nothing other than an assault on the net contributors, who will have to dig even deeper into their pockets in future.
Belgium should actually be regarded as a cautionary example of what can happen if peoples with differing economic performances are corseted up together.
Belgium, where the differences between the Flemings and the Walloons are evidently irreconcilable, and where the Federal apparatus represents a redistribution mechanism from the Flemings to the Walloons, shows what may befall the European Union and the euro area if they continue to follow the existing misguided path.
