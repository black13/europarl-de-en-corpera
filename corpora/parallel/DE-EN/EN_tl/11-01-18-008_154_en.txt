Mr President, I would like to say that I was very pleased by the report on recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security as this puts the significance of the rural economy back at the centre of things.
The first conclusion, for me, is that we also continue to need a strong European common agricultural policy.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur.
There was one point where I did not vote with the report, however, and this concerned the creation of a European food aid programme within the European Union.
I believe that providing aid on the ground, in other words, aid to ensure that no one in the European Union should suffer from hunger, must remain the responsibility of the Member States, quite simply because such problems should be solved where they occur, namely, in the Member States.
