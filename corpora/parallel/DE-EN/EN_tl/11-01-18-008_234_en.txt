The harmonisation measures in the report are too extensive.
The construction sector is a sensitive area: it is crucial for the development of infrastructure and thus, also for the individual Member States as business locations.
Labour, social and environmental standards are often important for protecting people and the environment in this sector.
Each Member State should, to a large extent, make its own decisions in this regard.
Therefore, I have voted against this report.
