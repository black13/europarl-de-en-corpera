The report on implementation of the European Consensus on humanitarian aid contains some important proposals which need to be acted on in the future.
One example is the development of capabilities and resources for civil protection, with the key idea being the creation of a European civil protection force.
Also of significance is improved coordination, not only between the Member States, but also at the international level, with the United Nations.
The approach of procuring foodstuffs and the like locally in crisis situations and thus supporting the local economy is also a sensible idea.
Unfortunately, in a few areas, the report is not specific or ambitious enough, for which reason I abstained from the vote.
