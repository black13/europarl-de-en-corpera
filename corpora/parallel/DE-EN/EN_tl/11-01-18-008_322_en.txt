Unfortunately, as a result of the votes of the conservative Members, a clause was included in this text for the proposal of a faster approval process within the EU for the importation of a new GM feed variant once it has been proved safe.
However, under no circumstances must the demand for food be met by genetic engineering methods.
I continue to be categorically opposed to genetically modified food and would like to remind the European Commission of the precautionary principle: even if there are scientific studies that regard genetically modified foodstuffs as not harmful to health, we perhaps do not yet have the right test methods to confirm this.
Ultimately, we have to respect the wishes of consumers, who reject this type of food.
