Agriculture is enormously important for global food security and we therefore need to take action.
Securing the incomes of farmers and an adequate supply of good quality food must therefore be key goals of the common agricultural policy.
The fluctuating market prices in the agricultural sector also represent uncertainty factors and need to be dealt with.
I support the report, which clearly demonstrates that food security is a central concern in the European Union, too, and requires coordination of the individual policy areas.
Only if the areas of agricultural policy, development policy, trade policy, financial policy and energy policy, as well as research, work together can improvements be achieved.
