When it comes to food security, in particular, there is a problem in that the Member States of the EU are increasingly losing their self-sufficiency.
It has not, as yet, proved possible to bring a halt to the worrying trend of farmers moving away from full-time farming and towards farming as a sideline business and of farmers leaving the land.
If we are discussing food security, then, we need to come up with plans for how this worrying trend can be halted and also for how to increase consumers' awareness of regional products.
In particular, there is a need, in this context, to scrutinise EU subsidies with regard to how the transport of foodstuffs criss-crossing the Union can be reduced.
This is not only for the benefit of the environment, in which regard it helps to implement the Kyoto targets on reducing emissions, but it also reduces noise pollution, especially for those people who live or work along the transit routes.
Last but not least, we should consider the extent to which we can better promote alternative propulsion systems, as the production of biofuels is beginning to threaten conventional agriculture, pushing it towards food shortages and higher prices.
These aspects are not covered in the report, and I therefore chose to abstain.
