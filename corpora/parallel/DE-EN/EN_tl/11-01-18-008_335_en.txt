The report contains some very good initiatives, such as incentives for traditional and organic agriculture, support for small-scale farmers in particular and the protection of domestic farmers from competition pressure from third countries with significantly lower quality standards.
On the other hand, the rapporteur advocates the use of GMOs.
Therefore, I have abstained from voting.
