In Russia, freedom of the press and of the media is a really major problem.
If you want to come out of this debate well, Mr Barroso, you cannot tolerate what is taking place at the moment in Hungary.
I would like to ask you why the Commission is being so lax about Hungary's Media Act.
In every area, it violates principles that apply in Europe and beyond.
We sought expert legal advice.
In summary, the advice is that the Act violates the Copenhagen criteria, the Helsinki Final Act, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the European Convention on Human Rights, the UNESCO Convention, which does cover the media, the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
I could continue, but I will stop there.
I would like to ask you, therefore, when will you intervene in Hungary appropriately?
What is the timetable?
Why have there still not been any infringement proceedings?
My criticism is also backed up by existing jurisprudence in this field.
