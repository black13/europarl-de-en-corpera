I would like to ask that all the documents that Hungary has provided to the Commission be made available for inspection.
We would very much like the opportunity to judge for ourselves, and we think it is time judgment was made on this issue.
We have the suspicion, however, that Hungary may not have provided the full text of the Act, that it is playing for time.
Give us the documents, please!
In addition, I believe it to be downright difficult to play politics, for example, in the accession negotiations with Turkey, and to repeatedly harp on about the Copenhagen criteria only to forget them once a country is a Member States of the European Union.
