Mr Barroso, we are all aware of how important the stability of the euro is.
That being the case, there is one event that I found myself not quite able to understand.
This was the debate about the increase for the rescue package, where you gave the green light but Chancellor Merkel gave the red one.
My question, therefore, is whether you do not coordinate with one another at all.
I appreciate that such things do happen sometimes, but this is not the first time that I have come across or heard about something like this.
The media have taken a great interest in this in the meantime.
Yet this is not a mere domestic quarrel between you and Chancellor Merkel.
It is an important political issue.
I can understand that - believe me, I do not always see eye to eye with the Chancellor, either - but the issue concerns whether such publicly differing opinions do not help the financial speculators.
