Mr Barroso, I fully and completely accept that you expressed your opinion, and the report.
My question remains, however - on such an important issue, where the euro is being speculated on, at a point in time as important as this one, how can it be that your opinion comes across as uncoordinated with Chancellor Merkel or President Sarkozy or other Heads of Government?
That is the public perception, in any case.
