Mr President, President Barroso, I would like to ask you a question about the harmonisation of feed-in tariffs within the Union.
Commissioner Oettinger, the energy commissioner, is pursuing a strategy here that, in our opinion, and also in the opinion of the German Minister for the Environment, would result in the destruction of the most successful programme of innovation that Germany has in the area of renewable energy.
What are you going to do to prevent German feed-in tariffs being destroyed in the name of harmonisation, thereby preventing innovation in the area of renewable energy?
What also are you going to do to ensure that Commissioner Oettinger does not buy time in this way when it comes to energy efficiency?
He does not want to do anything until 2012, even though you yourself have just said that it is already clear that the non-binding targets are not sufficient.
How are you going to speed things up?
