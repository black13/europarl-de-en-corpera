Mr President, on 4 February, the summit on energy will be held.
At present, there are two directives up for debate: on the one hand, the Water Framework Directive, and on the other, the EIP - the directive on environmental impact assessments.
In both cases, we need to consider how we can make these two variants compatible with each other in the long term.
The issues here are the environment and power generation.
It is my belief that approval procedures in this area should not take longer than a year.
The Commission has currently proposed a period of five years.
In the current situation, I do not think we can afford to take five years - which is, after all, an entire legislative period!
Is the Commission prepared to reduce the time accordingly?
Is it possible to adapt the Water Framework Directive so that in the future, storage power plants can also be given an opportunity to ensure there is a balance between solar energy and, on the other hand, wind energy?
