Mr President, innovation, climate protection, renewable energy - on reading the EU 2020 strategy, one might actually think that the EU takes its environmental and energy policy measures seriously.
If you look behind the fa√ßade of environmental protection, however, a different energy strategy very quickly emerges: atomic energy as a so-called less polluting energy source.
In his response to a question asked by me, Commissioner Oettinger made his position quite clear when he said that nuclear energy is currently making an important contribution to low carbon electricity generation in the EU and will continue to do so in the near future.
The European Commission has no plans for a directive on the maximum service life of nuclear power stations.
All this 25 years after Chernobyl - for indeed, we will be marking a sad anniversary on 26 April.
My question, President Barroso, is this: do you, too, believe that we can really - and with a clear conscience - sell atomic energy to the citizens of Europe as a clean form of energy that is less damaging to the climate?
