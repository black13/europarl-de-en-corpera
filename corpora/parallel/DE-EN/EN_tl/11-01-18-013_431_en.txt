on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, this really is an important day for patients all over Europe.
It was totally unacceptable that the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) had granted patients the right to travel to another Member State, but that many Member States had not put this judgment into practice.
The only option available to every single patient has been to take legal action and even to go as far as putting their individual cases before the ECJ.
I think that this is a cynical approach, because these people are not strong.
They are ill, otherwise they would not need treatment, and, in the worst case, they could die before the ECJ has decided on their cases.
This is why it is high time for us to clarify the legal situation.
Mrs Grossetête and everyone else involved have also achieved a great deal for those patients in countries where the judgment has been implemented to a greater or lesser extent, including the establishment of national contact points and European reference networks.
The result has been an improvement in the situation in those countries where the ECJ judgment has, in principle, been put into effect, in the form of a move towards a Europe for patients and a healthy Europe, just as Mr Dalli has said.
I do not have much time, so I would like to use my last 15 seconds to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Dalli the Commissioner, who has really committed himself to the cause and, above all, Mr Bowis, who is sitting in the gallery and is the father of this directive.
My sincere thanks and congratulations go to everyone involved.
