Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bowis, this directive creates clear, transparent rights.
If I want to travel abroad, the situation will be clear and the decisions will no longer be arbitrary, as was the case in some countries.
In addition, better information will be available if I choose to go to another country.
However, the directive will have to be implemented by the national governments.
What the directive has prevented from happening is something which some members of the Commission and perhaps of this Parliament have dreamed of, and that is the opening up of borders in order to improve national healthcare systems.
I am proud of the fact that with the two rapporteurs, including Mrs GrossetÃªte, we have succeeded in maintaining a balance.
We have shown our opposition to health tourism and our support for ensuring that the national systems are not undercut.
The directive will not resolve the problem of differences in the quality of medical care.
This can only be achieved by sufficient levels of investment in each Member State.
Mr Dalli and the Commission, I would be pleased, now that we have this directive in place, if you would focus more closely on the regulation on social security, which is the system on which everything is based, and which makes it clear who is paid and where everything is well organised.
You should put more pressure on the Member States to ensure that this regulation is implemented more effectively, instead of coming up with new ideas about deregulation and competition.
