Mr President, Mrs Gy≈ëri, Mr Dalli, as I understand it, the job of politics is to help safeguard and improve the quality of life of our citizens.
This is not an easy task in the field of healthcare at the moment.
It is primarily the responsibility of the national states to guarantee the provision of healthcare and access to the best medical treatment, regardless of the patients' incomes and of the regions in which they live.
However, even given the best possible national healthcare systems, there will still be cases where patients will need or want help, support and medical treatment from another country.
This directive lays down the legal foundations and guarantees that patients can access these services without additional red tape, without legal uncertainty, and without having to make large advance payments.
After the long process of negotiations, I see this directive as a genuine success, even though it will take a major effort by the healthcare systems in the individual states and by the insurance companies to implement it.
I very much hope that you will continue to apply pressure in this respect, because even the best directives can only be effective if they are properly implemented.
I am also calling on you to persevere in your attempts to extend preventive measures and healthcare provision.
I believe that we want the citizens of Europe to remain healthy for as long as possible and to have the best possible access to high quality medical care at the lowest possible cost.
