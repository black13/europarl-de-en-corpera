Mr President, the draft directive on patient mobility could quickly lead to healthcare in the EU being reduced to the level of the lowest common denominator, by means of a service-based approach.
My group is strongly opposed to the ability to pay becoming a criterion for the provision of healthcare and to patients being turned into customers.
The proposed directive will enable health insurance companies to send patients abroad for cheaper treatment.
This will lead to high levels of competition and pressure on prices in the healthcare sector.
If a specific treatment is available more cheaply a few hundred kilometres away, and if patients are sent there by their insurance companies, the result will be that this particular treatment will no longer be available locally.
Therefore, the health sector will simply be following the neoliberal logic of the market, instead of giving priority to patients' welfare.
I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether you want to see health tourism in this sensitive sector.
I am in favour of patients receiving healthcare close to where they live.
This is a public responsibility as part of the provision of services of general interest, which must be available for everyone in their local area.
