Mr President, I very much welcome the fact that this directive is finally coming into force.
I would like to remind Parliament that at one point, it seemed as if the whole legislative process would fail.
I believe that it is due to the skill of the rapporteur and the negotiating team and, of course, the Belgian Presidency, that we have a result that we can be very satisfied with.
I am particularly pleased that the right of Member States to put restrictions on treatment in another country has been more clearly defined.
This was not the case in the proposal put forward by the Member States.
I think that we now have a decision that will allow the process of rejecting a request for treatment to be traced and verified.
This is an important step forward.
Who are we helping, in particular?
I believe that we are helping the 60 000 people who are on waiting lists for organ transplants.
We have, of course, already adopted the directive on organ transplants, but this is another measure which will reduce waiting times.
We are also helping the millions of people suffering from one of the 30 000 rare diseases.
They will be able to receive more targeted and better quality treatment if they travel to another country.
However, I do not think that this directive will result in the development of health tourism in Europe.
I think that the fears expressed by those on the left of this House are totally unfounded.
This is not an issue that we need to concern ourselves with.
