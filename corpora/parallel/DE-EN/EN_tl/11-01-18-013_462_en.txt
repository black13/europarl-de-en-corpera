Mr President, patient mobility represents a huge step in the direction of a Europe for citizens and this directive is clearly structured.
It not only has a father, Mr Bowis, but also a mother, Mrs GrossetÃªte.
I would like to thank them very much for all their efforts.
We have spent a long time discussing the right path to take and we now know that we are not yet on the fast track.
However, we have a firm, well-designed foundation on which to build.
The situation is a complex one.
We have 27 Member States all at different starting points, both in terms of the structure of their healthcare services and their insurance systems.
Prior authorisation for a hospital stay in another Member State and the recognition of the ethical and moral principles of each country's healthcare legislation represent the right approach.
On the one hand, this enables support to be given to insurance companies and national responsibility to be encouraged and, on the other, it allows all citizens to have access to the services offered by other Member States.
This is a major step forward, particularly with regard to rare diseases.
Every Member State has a different level of facilities.
However, all of them can now benefit from research findings and the structures already in place elsewhere.
In addition, specialists will have the opportunity to develop their skills further, because of the increased demand resulting from more people having access to services.
For the people in my region, which is close to the border with Luxembourg, Belgium and France, cross-border access to health services is a major benefit and will enrich their everyday lives.
