Mr President, Commissioner Dalli, I agree that it is exasperating that we are having to keep switching between two topics.
I would have liked to have seen these matters being dealt with one after the other at least.
I am returning to Mr Klein's petition.
I am pleased that we have the opportunity to talk about it, because the Committee on Petitions has been dealing with this petition for some considerable time.
What has happened in that time?
Here was an innovative manufacturer which developed an inhaler for asthmatics.
It was good for patients because it was easier to use.
It was good for the insurance companies because it was cheaper.
The manufacturer quite rightly won an award for it.
Then came a sudden blow: the inhaler was banned by the German authorities, as a result of which the European Commission began a safeguard clause procedure.
Without going into all the details once more, I am convinced that the initial 1996 ban on the inhaler was not legitimately imposed.
The Commission would have been required to conclude the safeguard clause procedure with findings, in order to allow the party concerned to appeal.
As a result, Mr Klein - and I am quoting the position of our own Committee on Legal Affairs here - has been the victim of a flagrant denial of justice.
Commissioner, I am not in the business of apportioning blame.
What is important here is to find a solution as soon as possible to deal with the problem once and for all.
I am simply asking you to respect the unanimous vote of our Committee on Petitions.
I am hoping and relying on your cooperation and assistance - not just in the interests of the petitioner, but also in the interests of patients throughout the European Union.
