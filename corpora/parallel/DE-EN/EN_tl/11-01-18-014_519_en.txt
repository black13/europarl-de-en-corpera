Mr President, the Communication and the report are very good, and I would therefore like to express my thanks to Commissioner Dalli and Mrs Matias.
Alzheimer's is a plague of our times, and our biggest problem is that we simply know too little about Alzheimer's.
That is why we need research, research, and more research.
We need to pool our strengths and I therefore welcome the Commission's initiative to create an innovation partnership on the subject of healthy ageing; Alzheimer's fits in with this perfectly.
Many years ago, the US Government designated the fight against cancer as a lighthouse project.
They have not conquered cancer, but a great many medicines and a great many therapies have emerged as a result.
That is the kind of thing that we need here, and I therefore welcome the fact that we are to concentrate on Alzheimer's.
We need to know how to take preventive action.
What can we do in the future to combat Alzheimer's?
That is why we cannot continue to adopt the watering can principle in European research policy.
We need to concentrate on specific areas.
Alzheimer's could be one of the major themes that we get to grips with.
