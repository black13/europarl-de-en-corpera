Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my comments concern the petition.
I have been looking into this case since spring 2007.
In autumn 2007, I addressed a question to the Commission.
The answer was more than unsatisfactory.
I have had many discussions with the German Ministry of Health and with other authorities.
Everything was always very vague and unformed.
From your answer, Commissioner Dalli - from what you read out - I take it that you have no inclination whatsoever to look into this case in more detail.
It did not happen during your period of office, but there is such a thing as collective responsibility, and I would ask you - also on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Petitions - to make available to us all the documentation on which your decision was based.
Moreover, looking at the device, I would like to know - although I can imagine the answer - why certain companies have no interest in a different product coming onto the market.
Installing this plastic part in the inhaler is relatively cheap, but the margins lie in overall sales.
Looking at the lobbying engaged in by the pharmaceuticals industry, and looking carefully at the financial interests that certain parties have in keeping small companies out of the market, the answers are sometimes all too apparent.
I urge you to make your position clear here and now as to whether you will make the documentation available to us and whether you are prepared to have a proper discussion with us in the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Legal Affairs, rather than simply pushing the matter aside.
Our citizens have a right to be treated properly - and that includes those that may not be particularly wealthy or large.
