10 million people in Europe suffer from dementia; half of them are Alzheimer's patients.
These figures will continue to rise as a result of increasing life expectancy.
The own-initiative report is moving in the right direction with its call for a more efficient approach to the treatment of dementia, and especially of Alzheimer's.
Particular attention should be paid here to prevention.
Early diagnosis, free screenings for risk groups and, above all, making the population better informed have a key part to play in this, since Alzheimer's is generally identified at too late a stage in the EU.
The continued spread of dementia calls for a European strategy that, as far as possible, offers comprehensive structures which provide patients with equal access to information and treatment options.
It should not be forgotten that support for relatives and carers is also a part of this.
Furthermore, broad epidemiological and clinical studies as well as better research into dementia and Alzheimer's are important factors in the fight against dementias.
