Madam President, Commissioner, Haiti shows very clearly that real disasters are man-made.
The international community, and the European Union in particular, are all too ready to help.
It is not money that is the problem, however, but the unstable political circumstances.
At present, no nation is really prepared to put money into a corrupt political system.
My request to the Commission is therefore as follows: of course, we must continue to assist Haiti, but, in particular, we also need to invest in the political infrastructure.
Until there is a working system of government and a working administration, we will have to use the existing aid organisations because, quite simply, there is no real alternative.
