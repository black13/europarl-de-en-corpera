Madam President, after the fairy tales from the Italian members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), perhaps we could come back down to earth.
The facts are that proceedings were brought against Italy, and quite rightly so.
The court found against Italy - again, quite rightly so.
Italy did not meet the deadline.
Evidently, the government did submit a plan, but this was not forwarded in time.
We keep coming back to the same situation.
One cannot help but get the impression that those responsible delay and delay for as long as it takes for an emergency situation to arise, so that it can then react and make decisions using Italy's emergency legislation - which overrides all other standards.
If there is a lot of rubbish on the streets and if this is also mixed with industrial waste from the north and from the south, then it can quickly be put into unsecured landfill somewhere without taking or being able to take adequate precautions.
To the honourable Members from Italy, I say that this is not an Italian debate.
It is a debate about European law not being adhered to and not being implemented.
If this way of dealing with things were to spread to other countries, then it would have consequences for the whole of Europe.
What is happening down there is not a pleasant Sunday afternoon stroll.
It is a scandal.
It is not a matter of continually designating 536 new sites and using police violence to stop citizens protesting because they do not want domestic refuse that has been mixed with toxic industrial waste to be dumped on their doorsteps.
It will not do.
There must be consequences, and they must be consequences that make themselves felt.
It is a good thing that the financial resources can no longer be used to the extent that they were previously.
Enough has seeped away already.
We need to impose tangible consequences once and for all, because what we are talking about here is the implementation of sensible, necessary and good European law.
