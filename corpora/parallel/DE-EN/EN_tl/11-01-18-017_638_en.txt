Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the waste crisis in the urban area of Naples has now been going on for a full 14 years.
The existing landfill sites are full to excess, while the building of new facilities is blocked by the communities concerned.
However, the mistrust that citizens display towards any waste project can be explained by the fact that much has been promised in these times at a political level, but practically none of those promises have been kept.
In practice, this problem has been dealt with to date by means of short-term interim solutions.
Special commissions have been set up, but these have not even been obliged to keep local authorities and residents informed.
On the other hand, disposable items are part of everyday life in Italy.
As a result, its daily production of waste is far above the European average, while, at the same time, very little value is placed on separation of waste and recycling.
The sad result of this lack of environmental awareness on both sides is that Campania is today a region with large areas of contamination, and the cancer rate among its residents and the rate of respiratory disease among children in the urban area of Naples are both much higher than the average for Italy.
There is therefore an urgent need to find solutions and to get these implemented.
