Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my desire - and I hope it will be case - that today's debate will represent the starting shot of a comprehensive revision of waste management in Campania.
The ruling or order by the European Court of Justice must be implemented once and for all, and the European rules on waste collection and disposal must be implemented in that region.
Second, the damage that has been done by illegal landfills also needs to be tackled.
I know what I am talking about.
In East Germany, we are still today - twenty years after reunification - having to deal with the pollution caused by illegal or poor waste disposal.
However, I do not think that we will be successful in all this unless we attack the root of the problem.
Talk about management all you like; the fact is that mafia structures exist there.
We have to destroy these, otherwise we will not be successful in this.
Quite honestly, I would set four conditions.
First, a waste management plan must be drawn up.
It seems this has now been done.
However, the Commission should also assist in this.
Second, financial resources must be made available for the creation of new recycling facilities and waste facilities.
Third, there must be harsher penalties for illegal disposal, and I also think - and I am directing my comments here at the Commission - that Europol and Eurojust should support the Italian police and prosecutors in their fight against organised crime.
The resources that are available should be blocked until these conditions are met.
I would then be happy to vote in favour of the resources being released again.
