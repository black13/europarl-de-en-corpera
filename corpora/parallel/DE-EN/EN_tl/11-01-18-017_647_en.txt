Madam President, I have been able to see for myself the waste management situation in Campania as part of a delegation from the Committee on Petitions.
It must be said that the institutions there are faced with an extremely difficult task.
Not only do they have to deal with the waste management problems of the past - ecoballs being a particular issue - but also those of the present and the future.
My impression from this trip was that management of today's waste had been pretty much resolved at the time of our visit, in part, using military intervention.
Resolved in that the waste was taken away from the city and dumped in landfill; unfortunately, it must be said, sometimes in illegal landfills.
What we need are strategic solutions for the past but, above all, for the future.
The offer made by the EU is good, comprehensible and fair.
Once the region presents a coherent waste management plan, the European Union will release the funds.
We should also encourage the local authorities to do this.
I will say it again: as far as I am concerned, neither the Commission nor the European Parliament is interested in financial penalties.
We are interested in seeing the waste problems being dealt with locally in Campania.
We should make this deal with each other and work together.
