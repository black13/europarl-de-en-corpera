Madam President, Mrs Morvai, we have already had a brief exchange of views yesterday.
I have two questions for you.
It is not surprising that you support the Presidency from your position on the far right.
However, whether that suits Mr Orbán is another matter.
Are you aware that the Hungarian revolution was supported by many, many people and not only by conservatives on the right of the political spectrum, as Mr Schulz has said?
Have you noticed, Mrs Morvai, that the criticism of the Hungarian media law has come not only from social democrats, but also from very many citizens, including Mr György Konrád, who have nothing to do with social democracy?
Are you aware of this?
