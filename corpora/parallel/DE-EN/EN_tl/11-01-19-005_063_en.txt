Madam President, Mr Orbán, in an article which appeared yesterday in a major German newspaper, you cited Otto Graf Lambsdorff as one of your role models.
We last met at his funeral service in December 2009.
You attended as a private individual and we very much appreciated that.
I would like to ask you to honour his memory by respecting, following and defending the principles of the liberal constitutional state in all the measures that you take.
You have responded to the criticism of the media law with two arguments.
You have said that this is a campaign against Hungary and against you personally and that the campaign is unspecific.
I would like to make it very clear on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that this is not a campaign.
It is an issue for Europe if fundamental freedoms are interfered with and called into question in a Member State of the European Union.
I would like to say to the Commission and to Mr Barroso that a legal assessment must be carried out by Mrs Kroes.
However, the Commission is not just a solicitor's office; it is also a political body.
The assessment must take a political form and it must be completed quickly.
Your second argument is that the criticism is unspecific.
Mr Orbán, I would like to make a few specific points: slander, defamation and incitement to hatred are against the law in Germany and in other democracies.
That is what the criminal law is there for.
Please let the criminal law take effect in this case.
You need to improve the legal protection in Article 163, change the composition and the powers of the media authority in Articles 123 and 183, together with a great deal of other things.
There are many specific points.
I suggest that you postpone the application of the law until the Commission's assessment has been carried out and this must be done as quickly as possible.
