Madam President, Mr Orb√°n, you have two difficult tasks ahead of you.
The first involves overcoming eight years of socialist maladministration, bringing political and economic dynamism and stability back to Hungary and reducing debt levels.
The electorate has given you a clear mandate to do this.
Your second task is to lead Europe in your role as President-in-Office of the Council during these difficult times and to do everything in your power to resolve the economic and financial crisis.
You will have the active support of Parliament and of my group.
We are pleased that you have not presented us with a wish list today, as many socialist Presidents-in-Office of the Council have done in recent years, but instead have made your priorities clear.
Thirdly, we are pleased that Hungary has been a member of the European Union since 2004 and that the governing party in Hungary belongs to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
The campaign relating to the new media law, which involves calls for the withdrawal of the right to vote under Article 7, and which was initiated here in Parliament and not by you, but by the parties that lost the 2010 elections in Hungary, they sat here and they are still sitting here now at the front, at least those who have not gone running straight to the press, is hypocritical and intolerable.
The assessment will show that the media legislation in Hungary is no different to that in many other states.
In the case of Mr Schulz, who called for the law to be withdrawn, I can only say that he obviously has not read the law which was voted in by a majority under the socialist and green state government in North Rhine-Westphalia.
This includes provisions for the establishment of a media authority, for sanctions and for the diversity of opinions.
This is exactly what you are doing.
This hypocritical approach must not gain a majority in this House.
(Applause)
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
