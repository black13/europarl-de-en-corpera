Firstly, Mrs Merkel asked whether the law complied with European regulations in all respects and Mr Orb√°n agreed to change the provisions of the law if necessary, following the assessment by the Commission.

The law also states that the head of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia can give instructions to the state media authority and can impose fines of up to EUR 500 000.
