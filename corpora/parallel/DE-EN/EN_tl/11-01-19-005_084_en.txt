Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the press in Europe is under no obligation to take a balanced approach.
In Europe, we have freedom of the press.
If a body is established in Europe which aims to bring about a so-called balance by means of penalties which cannot be followed up, by ending the protection of sources and by creating an atmosphere of fear, I expect the Commission, which is the guardian of European law, to react.
However, it should not respond hesitantly, half-heartedly and defensively.
Instead it should take rapid, decisive and effective action.
It has not yet done this.
Mr Orbán, I have not been convinced by the aggressive and unreasonable defence mounted by your allies.
We thought you were a liberal.
I can imagine that this does not always feel good.
However, I would like to ask you how you feel now, when you are seen as someone who is leading a country away from democracy and towards totalitarianism?
(Heckling)
How do you feel as someone who has to be defended by the people sitting up there, Mr Orbán?
That is what I would like to ask you.
