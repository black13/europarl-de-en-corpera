Mr President, Mr Orbán, I agree with you on three points.
The first is the Croatia question.
We are taking the same approach and we hope to find a solution together with your foreign minister.
The second concerns the importance of integrating the Roma and the third is the European significance of the Hungarian revolution.
I come from Austria and I was born close to the Hungarian border.
I was aware of what was going on, admittedly from the better side of that border.
I was assigned to teach two of my classmates German.
I know all about the significance of the revolution.
However, it was a revolution against the claim to power, against the monopoly of power.
Its aim was to bring about freedom, including freedom of the press.
Mr Orbán, please think again about whether this law is really in accordance with the meaning, the spirit and the aims of the Hungarian revolution.
When you compare it with these aims, you will be able to draw up a better law.
Therefore, I am calling on you once again to consider for yourself how you can draft a better media law, which is in line with the Hungarian revolution and the spirit of that revolution.
(Applause)
