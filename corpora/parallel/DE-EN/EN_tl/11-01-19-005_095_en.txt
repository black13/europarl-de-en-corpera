Mr President, strengthening Europe also means strengthening the Commission and extending the safety net, both from the perspective of its finances and its content.
It means reinforcing democracy in Europe and it means a community of Europe.
The process of making Europe stronger begins at home.
Help us to make progress with 'europeanising' internal policy and to ensure that Europe does not become weakened by nationalism.
If we want to strengthen Europe, Mr Orb√°n, we must strengthen our common ground and reduce our weaknesses.
Our strengths include the same legal systems, the same values, the same freedoms, the community method, the internal market with its four freedoms and the common currency.
Parties are simply the instruments of democracy and not the other way around.
Our weaknesses are nationalism, egoism, polarisation and protectionism.
Let us use these six months to make Europe and the community of Europe stronger.
