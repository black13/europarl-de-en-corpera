Mr President, Mr Orbán, you have addressed me personally.
You have also spoken directly to some other Members of this House.
I would like to give you some thoughts to take with you for the next six months relating to the remarks about the Hungarian people and about you as the representative of the Hungarian people.
Mr Cohn-Bendit has described in his biography his relationship with the Hungarian people.
In my group there are Members of the European Parliament who have been locked up in communist prisons.
In my group, there is one Member, Mr Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez, who was subjected to torture in Spain because of his opposition to the Franco regime.
We all have a joint task, you and all of us who are sitting here, and that is to defend democracy, for example, against the sort of people who are heckling us here today.
No one who criticises a law is insulting the Hungarian people.
You can be sure of one thing.
The Members on the left of this House and, in particular, my group, will promise you that values such as freedom, democracy and justice are our common values.
If we believe that a law does not live up to these values, then we will criticise the law, but this does not mean that we are criticising the Hungarian people.
(Applause)
If we all take that to heart, Mr Orbán, then something will happen which we and you both need.
We cannot create a successful Europe by dismembering it.
Europe will only succeed if the sovereign Member States and the Union with its community work together.
Do not play one off against the other.
For the next six months, you have taken on the role of President-in-Office of the Council.
We want you to join with us in defending the values of Europe and not in playing off Hungary against the European Union.
(Applause)
