Hungary is taking over the Council Presidency from Belgium.
These two Member States could not be more different.
One is the epitome of a traditional European state and the other is a country which is still looking for a way into Europe.
I hope that the Hungarian Presidency will follow the route taken by Belgium with a focus on the overall interests of Europe.
The Hungarian Presidency has presented a comprehensive list of priorities.
As one means of bringing the EU closer to its citizens, Hungary has set itself the objective of implementing the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This should be interesting when you consider that Hungary is currently subject to a barrage of international criticism because of its new media law and this law is clearly in conflict with Article 11 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
As a full member of the Committee on Budgets, I am particularly interested in developments in the area of increased financial supervision and the permanent crisis mechanism.
Belgium has set a good example and has led the way in putting the focus on social issues.
Let us hope that Hungary will follow.
