I welcome the directive on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare.
The provision of healthcare services in the shortest possible time and with a clear patient focus, which can also be used by other Member States, is an essential requirement in order to bring Europe closer together.
Cross-border healthcare is a day-to-day reality in border areas like the one which I come from.
Against this background, I am very pleased that it will be easier to access reliable, high quality cross-border healthcare and to have treatment costs reimbursed.
I am particularly in favour of providing added value for patients who are on waiting lists.
These new regulations will enable them to be treated more quickly in another Member State, rather than waiting a long time for treatment in their own country.
It is true that establishing the rules for the refusal of prior authorisation is sensible and makes the situation clearer.
However, some cross-border healthcare problems remain unresolved, in particular, for long-term cross-border commuters, who, after they have retired, will have no access or only restricted access to services which are important to them in the country where they previously worked.
