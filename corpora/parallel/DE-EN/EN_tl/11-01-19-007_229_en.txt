If the waiting lists for operations in a patient's own country are full, the guarantee that the cost of treatment abroad will be paid for by his health insurance company will come as a huge relief.
These regulations will allow mobility within the European Union for those with chronic illnesses.
However, the regulations will only be useful if they can also guarantee that there will be no health tourism, which would put even more pressure on the already hard-hit health insurance companies.
Apart from the fact that some areas of medicine in countries with high medical standards could rapidly be overwhelmed, there is also the risk that poorer EU Member States, which have invested less in healthcare, will be required to pay massive costs.
In this context, we must also not overlook the fact that the system which should allow the social security systems of EU countries to reimburse one another does not function and that debts of millions of euro have accrued over a number of years.
Although the Member States can, in theory, exclude certain types of treatment if they are concerned that the influx of patients from abroad will put their healthcare systems at risk, in practice, this will not be so simple.
We have not even managed to resolve the existing reimbursement problems and the measures for preventing health tourism are unlikely to be effective.
I have voted against this draft resolution in order to prevent social security costs from rocketing.
