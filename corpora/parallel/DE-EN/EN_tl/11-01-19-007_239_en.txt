I was pleased to be able to vote in favour of the report, which, following the agreement with the Council during the second reading, will bring significant improvements in the free movement of patients within the European Union.
Outpatient treatment now presents no problems for the citizens of the EU and inpatient treatment has become much simpler.
It is in areas like this that Europe can contribute significant added value.
The result is that the healthcare sector is gradually being transformed from a patchwork of individual services into a single entity.
