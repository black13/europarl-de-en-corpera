We cannot expect the partnership agreements on the worldwide sustainable use of forest resources to produce any miracles.
It will only be possible to combat illegal logging effectively if the local systems can be made more resistant to corruption, if the back doors which are currently being used to get around existing regulations can be closed and, finally, if significant penalties and sanctions can be imposed for failure to comply with the regulations.
With regard to the environmental damage caused by activities in the forestry sector, it is important not to forget the damage caused by transport.
Although we cannot expect miracles from the agreement, it is a step in the right direction, which is why I have voted in favour of this report.
