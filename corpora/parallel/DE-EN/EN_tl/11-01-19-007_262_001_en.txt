Forty percent of Cameroon's surface area is covered in forest - for the time being - because Cameroon is the largest exporter of tropical wood in Africa and in no other country are the forests being so extensively cleared.
Experts estimate that, in 10 to 15 years, the most ecologically important tree species in the Congo Basin will have disappeared if the logging continues in the same way as it has been done up to now - aimed at maximum yield.
This ultimately threatens the green lungs of Africa, which are vitally important for the global climate, and endangers the unique flora and fauna of Cameroon.
To protect Cameroon's tropical forests, what is essential is the combating of corruption and bribery (at the level of the officials and also of the community tenants of state-owned forests), effective criminal prosecutions, sustainable forestry, where the quantity felled is only as much as will regrow, and better training for loggers in order to prevent damage to the land during logging.
Above all, European companies must take some responsibility, because around 80% of the yield is shipped to Europe.
The EU must act in this regard by taking direct and decisive measures.
I have therefore voted in favour of this report, as it is moving in the right direction.
