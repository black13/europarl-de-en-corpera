Although the partnership agreement with Cameroon in the forestry sector is commendable and, as it is being introduced during the International Year of Forests, is also a very convenient way for the EU to improve its image, it is doubtful whether the agreement is worth the paper it is written on.
Corruption is a fact of life in Cameroon.
In the world rankings produced by Transparency International in 2010, it was in 146th place.
Environmental organisations claim that the government of Cameroon is aware of the environmental crimes being committed by the forestry industry, but that corruption is preventing the companies from being monitored and prosecuted.
Foreign companies are said to control more than 60% of timber extraction and processing and three quarters of the timber exports.
Although we cannot expect miracles from the agreement, it is a step in the right direction, which is why I have voted in favour of this report.
