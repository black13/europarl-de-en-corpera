This sort of agreement will only have any meaning when we can be sure that foreign companies are no longer exploiting the local companies, which have no forestry and environmental expertise, and when the Republic of Congo clamps down on corruption.
The objective must be to establish a forestry sector which acts responsibly and plans for future generations.
While the local people remain unaware of these issues, the whole thing will continue to be a sham.
Until the failure to comply with regulations on felling incurs significant penalties and sanctions, the EU agreement will remain completely ineffectual.
Even if 'selective felling' does take place, it is important to remember how many trees will be lost during the transport process, for example, in order to build roads out of the forests.
Although we cannot expect miracles from the agreement, it is a step in the right direction, which is why I have voted in favour of this report.
