The consent of the European Parliament to the Voluntary Partnership Agreements between the European Union and the Republic of Cameroon and the Republic of Congo has resulted in an important step being taken in the fight against illegal logging and the illegal trade in timber.
A certification system, which ensures clear traceability, will benefit not only the European economy and the European timber industry in particular, but also the economy and timber industry in Cameroon and Congo.
I am definitely in favour of these two agreements.
