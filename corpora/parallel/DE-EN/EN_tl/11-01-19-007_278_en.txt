I have voted in favour of the EU signing a Voluntary Partnership Agreement with the Republic of Cameroon and with the Republic of Congo.
This year, 2011, is the International Year of Forests.
Healthy forests are essential in order to maintain local biodiversity and they make an important contribution to the climate objectives we have set ourselves, because they act as natural CO2 sinks.
Vegetation and woodland is being destroyed throughout the world, including in central Africa.
Satellite pictures show that around 25 000 kmÂ² of African forests and other vegetation have been lost in the last 30 years.
These new partnership agreements will promote the responsible management of the forestry sector in these two countries, which the EU has indirect responsibility for, as a result of its imports of timber.
The EU is now accepting this responsibility.
The introduction of traceability and legality verification systems for timber products will also ensure the necessary transparency.
