Children are the weakest link in our society.
Protecting their rights and subsequently ensuring that these rights are respected must be one of the major priorities throughout the EU.
However, children are still falling victim to human trafficking and exploitation within the European Union, often as a result of unregulated adoption.
Even though adoption is an effective way of ensuring that children do not spend their lives in orphanages, it is essential that strict inspections are carried out, in particular, of international organisations, in order to prevent abuse.
I am abstaining, because the resolution does not include sufficient measures to guarantee that children can be protected against exploitation as a result of adoption.
