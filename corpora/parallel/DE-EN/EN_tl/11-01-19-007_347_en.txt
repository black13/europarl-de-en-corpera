I have voted in favour of concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Serbia.
Serbia is of significance for the stability of the entire Balkan region and, therefore, it is important for us to have an ongoing dialogue with the country at an institutional level.
In recent years, Serbia has made major progress in moving towards Europe.
Following the ruling by the International Court of Justice that the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo did not violate international law, Europe must play an active peacebuilding role.
We also need to support Serbia in every way possible in its efforts to cooperate with the International Criminal Court.
