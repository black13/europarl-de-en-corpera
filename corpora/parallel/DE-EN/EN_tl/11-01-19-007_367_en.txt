Alzheimer's is an insidious disease for which there are no effective drugs, despite extensive research.
It is unlikely that we will find a cure in the near future for the disease and its consequences, such as increasing loss of memory and of other higher brain functions, which lead to a state of complete dependence on others.
This makes it even more important to start treatment at an early stage.
One important measure involves educating the public about prevention, but also about early recognition and delaying the onset of the disease.
Many general practitioners are apparently beginning the treatment with anti-dementia drugs too late, in order not to exceed their budgets, and this is counter-productive.
According to medical experts, treatment with the right medicines can postpone for up to a year the need for the person suffering from the disease to move into an expensive care home.
In this context, it is important not to forget the severe physical and mental stresses suffered by the relatives who care for these sick people.
These stresses lead to depression, burnout and similar disorders among around a third of carers.
We are attempting to alleviate the suffering of people with Alzheimer's disease at an EU level.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of the Matias report.
