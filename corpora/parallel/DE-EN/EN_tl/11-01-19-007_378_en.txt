As a result of the rapid increase in the number of people suffering from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, there is a need for rapid action by the EU, which involves ensuring a greater focus on early diagnosis and prevention.
This means, for example, that people who are at risk should undergo tests at an early stage and that targeted education campaigns should be used to help the relatives of elderly people to distinguish between the normal signs of ageing and the early symptoms of dementia.
The Member States must share their expertise and involve both scientists and healthcare professionals in the process.
The alarming number of people suffering from the disease and the resulting costs for the individual Member States make the need for prevention urgent.
This must take the form of a healthy diet and measures to delay the onset of the disease.
The report also refers to the provision of practical and psychological support for relatives.
It has been shown that a patient who is cared for at home needs three carers, who generally have to give up their jobs.
Finally, the report mentions the importance of maintaining the dignity of people suffering from Alzheimer's.
This can be achieved by an education programme, which should start in schools.
