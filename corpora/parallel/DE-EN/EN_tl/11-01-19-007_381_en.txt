I am pleased that Parliament has today adopted a resolution concerning Mr Klein's petition.
The Committee on Petitions has been working on this case for a considerable period of time.
In the 1990s, Mr Klein invented an inhaler for asthma sufferers and a disputed sales ban was twice imposed on this product.
Without going into detail, I am convinced that the initial ban on the inhaler in 1996 was not entirely lawful.
At the very least, the circumstances which led to the ban need to be examined critically.
The Commission was required to bring the safeguard clause procedure to a conclusion, in order to allow the party concerned to appeal.
The process has still not been completed.
The legal basis and the legitimacy of the second ban are definitely subjects for dispute.
However, there appears also to have been a violation of European Union law.
As a result, Mr Klein has been the victim of a flagrant denial of justice and this situation needs to be rectified.
It is important that the Commission quickly finds a solution which will resolve this problem once and for all.
