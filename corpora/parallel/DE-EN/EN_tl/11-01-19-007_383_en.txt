Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices explains precisely which requirements a device must meet, firstly in order to be authorised, and secondly, in order to remain on the market.
If a product has a CE mark, then it fulfils these requirements.
It is the responsibility of the Member States to put controls in place to prevent the unauthorised use of the CE mark and, if necessary, to have products withdrawn from the market.
The relevant authority must inform the Commission immediately of any measures of this kind that have been taken.
I have abstained from voting, because in my opinion, there is no need for the Commission to act in this case.
