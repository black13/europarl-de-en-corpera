A year after the devastating earthquake in Haiti, the situation in the country has not improved at all.
In fact, the outbreak of cholera has made things significantly worse, despite all the humanitarian and economic aid being poured into the country.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, still lies buried under tonnes of rubble and the local people have only shovels and wheelbarrows to remove it with.
While thousands of people still have no shelter and the trade in children is flourishing, the country, which is ruled by a dictator, remains in a state of political chaos after the elections.
I have voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, as the people of Haiti need our help and the Western world must face up to its responsibilities.
