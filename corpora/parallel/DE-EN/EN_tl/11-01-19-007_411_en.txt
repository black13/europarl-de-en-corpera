The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) guarantees that people with differing sexual orientations will not suffer discrimination.
When Lithuania signed the Treaty of Lisbon, it also became a signatory to the ECHR.
The European Parliament believes that the adoption of the law on the protection of minors against the detrimental effects of public information by the Lithuanian Parliament represents a clear violation of the treaty.
It also calls on the Lithuanian Government to abstain from any further legislative amendments on this subject and to include sexual orientation in the list of protected grounds.
I have abstained because, in my opinion, it is not clear to what extent the EU is interfering in national affairs.
