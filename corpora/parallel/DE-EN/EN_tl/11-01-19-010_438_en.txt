Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you very much for your statement.
It is correct, it has been made at the right time and it is also encouraging with regard to the basic approach taken by you and your organisation to the problem as a whole, with regard to cooperation with other countries and with regard to the measures that are needed.
This debate today is also necessary, not only as a result of recent events, but also because freedom of religion is one of our fundamental values and part of our European identity.
This debate is important because discrimination, violence and persecution are taking place in many countries in the world and it is particularly worrying that a high proportion of all of those who die as a result of religiously motivated violence throughout the world are Christians.
Our sympathy goes to all of those who have been killed, injured or tortured in attacks of this kind.
Our sympathy also goes to their friends and families.
We must do everything we can to reduce and even abolish this type of intolerance.
Unfortunately, we are also seeing discrimination against Christians by official bodies and we must make every effort to combat and overcome it.
We must make a commitment to ensuring the right to freedom of religion.
This must lie at the heart of our bilateral relationships.
We need effective instruments which will allow us to protect Christians and to protect freedom of religion.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that ensuring the human right to freedom of religion will be one of the items on the agenda in every bilateral form of contact.
We must also include provisions that guarantee freedom of religion in our agreements with third countries and I very much welcome your intention to devote a chapter of the European Union's annual human rights report to the situation concerning freedom of religion.
