Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in 2009, we encouraged an intercultural dialogue in Europe, between Christians and Muslims, Orthodox Christians and Catholics and between Protestants and Orthodox Christians.
In our community, we have attempted to bring about the growth of trust.
We are doing this among ourselves.
Of course, this means that we have our own views and the courage to express them.
Sometimes, this is obviously not the case.
I have recently read and heard that the European Commission has published a calendar for young people which includes the public holidays of all other religions except Christianity.
All I can say is that things like this will only encourage those people in Egypt and elsewhere to continue committing horrific acts.
We have an obligation to help Christians in those countries that have already been mentioned several times.
The majority of them live in countries such as Palestine, Egypt, Iraq and Iran, which are the birthplace of Christianity.
We must not allow these people to be driven out of their homes.
They are not minorities, they are Egyptians and Palestinians, just like all the other residents of these countries.
They want to continue living there, but this is being made difficult for them.
We must support Baroness Ashton and we must attempt to ensure that the European Union includes a guarantee of religious freedom in all the treaties which it concludes with third countries and, in particular, with the countries we have referred to.
We must make sure that no one is forced to leave their country for religious reasons.
