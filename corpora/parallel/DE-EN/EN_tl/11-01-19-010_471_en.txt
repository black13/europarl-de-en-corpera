Mr President, the Coptic bishop Anba Damian recently called for the establishment of a Christian alliance especially for Christians in Egypt, following the inflammatory campaigns in mosques and also the horrific massacre at the Christmas mass.
The charity Open Doors lists 50 states in its worldwide persecution index where Christians are subject to severe persecution.
I do not quite understand why we are showing our concern today.
We should not be surprised, because the problems start at the top.
If we in the EU and in the Commission distribute a calendar as the perfect example of self-denial to 21 000 European schools for 3 million school children, which does not list any of the Christian holidays, but does show Islamic, Sikh, Hindu and Chinese festivals, then this is no longer a question of self-denial, but of self-hatred.
Baroness Ashton, we need courage and we need to maintain our standards.
We must not be tolerant of intolerance.
