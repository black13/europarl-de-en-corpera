Mr President, what is this all about?
Is it about organised crime or about political and/or religious terrorism?
This is an important question when it comes to assessing the situation.
Experts on this region are of the opinion that this is more to do with crime than with religiously motivated international terrorism.
Measures against terrorism often have fatal consequences for peace and democracy and can be used as a pretext for promoting other interests.
It may be that this is also about Africa as one of the areas in which Europe is interested.
In the words of Gilles de Kerchove, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, it concerns Africa as Europe's backyard.
I am opposed to security policies which will help to militarise Africa.
The Sahel region can only be made secure by improving the situation of the population.
Increasing security and military budgets in countries where the population is suffering from an acute food shortage is a disastrous move.
Finally, I would like you to consider the fact that kidnapping and other crimes are a business in which many people are involved in a confusing array of organisations.
Western funding for security structures could have a counterproductive effect on efforts to combat crime and could continue putting innocent people at risk in future.
