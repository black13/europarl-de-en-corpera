Mr President, Baroness Ashton, my group has not signed up to the compromise resolution on Belarus.
However, I would like to make it clear that this should not be seen as an acceptance on our part of the results of the election, the arrests and the reprisals against those with differing opinions.
For us, fair, transparent and democratic elections - 'the freedom of dissenters' to quote Rosa Luxemburg - are a basic requirement for establishing a relationship with Belarus and with all other states.
This also includes the immediate release of all political detainees.
However, I doubt whether sanctions are really an effective means of bringing about the immediate release of political prisoners and radical changes in the democratic system in Belarus.
Sanctions have had little effect in the past in Belarus and elsewhere.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are as well aware of this as I am.
A better approach seems to me to be to confront those who hold political power with our arguments and demands in the context of a political dialogue, not to give them the opportunity to discredit the criticisms made by those in civil society by referring to external criticism, to establish a transparent political system and to coordinate our efforts with those of all our foreign policy partners in Belarus.
This also seems to be more honest in relation to our own arguments, as this morning's discussion on the Hungarian Presidency has shown.
