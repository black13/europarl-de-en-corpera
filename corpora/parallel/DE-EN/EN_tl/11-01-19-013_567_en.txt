Mr President, the overthrow of the Tunisian Government has caused shock waves in neighbouring countries in the Maghreb region, which are mainly dictatorships, and also in Libya.
A radical change of this kind is, of course, also an opportunity for democracy, but only when it cannot be exploited by Islamic agitators.
The unrest will certainly have an impact on the influx of refugees.
Therefore, it is important for us to cooperate more closely with the African countries on the refugee problem.
However, Colonel Gaddafi's call for the European Union to pay Africa at least EUR 5 billion a year to combat illegal immigration is definitely a move in the wrong direction.
The countries of the European Union are already paying billions of euro in development aid.
In my opinion, the aid system urgently needs to be reviewed to ensure that the aid no longer benefits dictatorships and corrupt regimes, but instead reaches the people who really need it.
In addition, the plight of Christians in Islamic countries must be given a higher priority in EU foreign relations.
