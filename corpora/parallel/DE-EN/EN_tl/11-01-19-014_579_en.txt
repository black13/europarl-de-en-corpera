Mr President, we have agreed in the European Parliament that we want a common European asylum system to be in place by 2012.
This also involves having the same or similar conditions in all the Member States.
However, the implementation of the system has met with resistance and that is primarily due to the fact that during the discussions on the asylum package, we were given inadequate information, sometimes no information at all, or even conflicting information.
We had very little data as the basis for the financial estimates relating to the Procedures Directive and the costs in the Member States.
Our aim is to call on the Commission to provide Parliament with a study or with the necessary information.
This concerns areas such as the interpreting service and also legal advice.
It is not clear what effects this will actually have in the Member States.
On the other hand, during the process of revising the Procedures Directive, it has become clear that we can produce a high quality, fast procedure which is of benefit to both sides, because it helps decisions to be made quickly so that the situation is clear to people and there is a low error rate.
Our objective as liberals is to give the Commission our complete support for its plans.
However, we need arguments, including in the discussions with the Member States, which will demonstrate the effects of the revision of this asylum package and, in particular, the Procedures Directive.
For this reason, we are calling on the Commission to give us genuine support to ensure that this asylum package becomes reality by 2012, so that we can establish a common European asylum system.
