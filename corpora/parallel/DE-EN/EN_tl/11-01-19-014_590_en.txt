Mr President, the aim is to standardise the right to asylum within the EU by 2012.
However, it is unclear whether we will still be able to make use of rapid deportation in transit zones, for example, which has proved its worth in Germany.
The Commission has rejected the plan to abandon this airport regulation with cryptic statements which indicate that it will still be possible in future to turn away asylum seekers at the border, if they come from a safe country.
We are all familiar with the debate about what is a safe country and opinions about this differ widely within Europe.
The plan is also to give siblings the right to stay, which previously only applied to parents and married couples, and to extend the right to medical treatment.
I do not even want to start discussing the proposals that asylum seekers should be brought into line with the relevant country's social security system.
Therefore, I very much doubt that these proposals will reduce the costs of the procedure.
I also doubt that there will be less red tape.
I believe that the burdens on the Member States will be greater and that asylum law will be relaxed, which will ultimately lead to an increased influx of migrants.
Unfortunately, that is not a good thing for Europe.
