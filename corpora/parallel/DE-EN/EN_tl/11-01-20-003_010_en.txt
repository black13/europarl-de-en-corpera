Mr President, competition policy is one of the most important, central policy areas of the EU.
Good competition policy enables markets to function properly.
Good competition policy also allows consumers to benefit from a wide variety of products at reasonable and affordable prices.
Good competition policy also contributes to creating growth again in Europe.
That is why it is so important, Commissioner, to include all the areas that you have mentioned in competition policy.
It is also important to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the driving force behind growth in Europe.
Market barriers must be abolished, which also means doing away with the excessive costs that still pertain where competition is not working, such as roaming charges on mobile phones, where competition still does not exist - something that needs to be changed.
Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, for his excellent work, and to the Commission I would say: be ambitious in your goals.
(Applause)
