Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation.
Transport is also a decisive issue when it comes to competition.
After all, transport is responsible for 30% of CO2 emissions, which is why I am pleased to see that it has been accepted that transport should be included in the central demands of the Europe 2020 strategy.
However, we still have unfair competition and this is where the Commission needs to take action.
For example, the aviation sector, which is the climate killer par excellence, enjoys an exemption from value added tax and duty on fuel.
This means that the European taxpayers pay out EUR 30 billion every year for aviation, simply so that the airlines can offer intercity flights at the same price as a short taxi journey.
The railways are required to bear the burden here.
We have a mandatory rail toll for every locomotive for every kilometre travelled.
This is a mandatory levy and has no upper limit.
On the roads, it is left up to the Member States to decide whether they charge any tolls at all.
The tolls mostly apply only on motorways and only to heavy goods vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more.
In other words, some of our Member States levy a high rail toll but no road tolls at all.
We cannot allow this because it completely misses the point.
After all, if we do not change mobility habits, we will never succeed in averting climate change.
Yet this is something we have to achieve.
That is why you must establish fair competition in the transport sector too.
