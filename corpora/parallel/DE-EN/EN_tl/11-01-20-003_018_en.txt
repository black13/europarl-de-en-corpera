Mr President, Mr Lamberts referred to the special supports that banks have received from the European Central Bank.
Perhaps he could explain in a little more detail what he means and how this worked?
He also made reference to the fact that this support is to be abolished.
How would he propose that we take control here, ensuring that the wrong people do not make a fat profit?
