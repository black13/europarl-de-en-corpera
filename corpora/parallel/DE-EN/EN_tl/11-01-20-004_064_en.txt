Mr President, I am not in favour of that and, of course, it is not possible to impose this from above.
The question remains, however: Who was consulted?
Which states are involved?
Which indigenous peoples are affected?
Was there any consultation with the people who may benefit from the situation, or with those who may lose their livelihood?
I think that further dialogue is needed.
The talks held so far are not enough.
We need to try to keep this dialogue as broad as possible, also consulting with wider sections of society, possibly including the indigenous peoples in particular.
