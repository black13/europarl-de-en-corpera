Mr President, as we know, the Arctic's untold mineral resources have made the area the subject of heated dispute.
It is estimated that 90 billion barrels of oil alone lie untapped under the ice.
Inevitably, there is a certain feeling of unease that British Petroleum of all companies, having caused the oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico last year, is now to be allowed to extract resources in this sensitive natural environment, where conditions are far more extreme than in the Gulf.
After all, the fact is that the Arctic region already provides the final resting place for the world's mercury emissions.
Nonetheless, in view of the global demand for energy, it is probably unrealistic to expect a decision to be taken to forego the Arctic's oil resources.
It is to be hoped that the European Union, in its role in the Arctic Council, will ensure that better safety standards are put in place, so that the Arctic's wildlife does not suffer a similar horrific fate to that in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the recent oil disaster.
In addition, from the EU's perspective, the Arctic is also of essential importance for the development of new world trade routes.
If it were indeed possible to open up a new shipping route between Europe, Asia and North America, this would immediately circumvent piracy in Somalia, while also saving the EU a lot of money because the Atalanta Mission would no longer be necessary.
Of course, this is to assume that the indigenous Inuit populations would not be driven to similarly desperate measures such as piracy as a result of losing their livelihoods.
This is something that needs to be kept in mind both when planning shipping routes and when drilling for oil.
