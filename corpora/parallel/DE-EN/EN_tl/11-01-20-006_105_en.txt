Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the Black Sea region is to develop into an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity and if these opportunities and challenges are to be fulfilled, we need an all-embracing strategy.
This resolution pursues that objective and is therefore supported by my group.
This is also because a number of our proposals have been included, for example, dealing with the unresolved conflicts in the region, improving cooperation in civil society, support for people-to-people projects and the promotion of small projects in the context of cross-border cooperation.
We also want to see a sustainable energy policy, greater energy efficiency and the establishment of academic and student networks.
However, what I would criticise is the lack of a coherent position in relation to the question of the energy infrastructure in the region - I would mention Nabucco and South Stream in this context.
I fail to understand why our call for stricter monitoring of oil rigs in the Black Sea has been rejected.
This is absolutely essential following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.
It is for this reason that we are presenting this amendment once again today.
