On account of their complexity and significance for Europe, relations between the European Union and Libya must be considered objectively.
Naturally, respect for human rights play an important role, which is why it also makes sense for Brussels to call on Libya to ratify the Geneva Convention on Refugees of 1951 or to urge a moratorium on the death penalty.
However, we must also consider the fact that Libya is an important transit country for illegal mass immigration from Africa to Europe.
For this reason, no purpose will be served by a general rejection of a readmission agreement with Tripoli, as contained in the report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
If we do not get a readmission agreement with Libya, the pressure on Europe as a destination for immigrants will increase even further.
Because illegal mass immigration is a vital issue in relation to the survival of Europe as an historical entity, the EU would be well advised to take a differentiated view of its relations with Tripoli and to include Libya in its strategies for controlling the flow of migration.
