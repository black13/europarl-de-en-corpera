In recent years, 75% of terrorist attacks of a religious nature have been against Christians.
In the last few months in particular, there has been an increase in the number of attacks, including direct attacks on churches while services were being held.
It is unacceptable in the 21st century for religious communities to have to be afraid to practise their faith freely.
The principle of the freedom of religion must apply to everyone throughout the world.
I therefore support the proposal to develop a strategy to actually enable the right to freedom of religious expression to be exercised.
