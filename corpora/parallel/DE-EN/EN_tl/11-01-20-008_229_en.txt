The lip service paid by the European Union to religious freedom is not enough.
In Islamic countries in particular, Christians are seen as fair game for suppression and, frequently, murder.
Despite this shocking situation, the EU, as a lofty community of values, has mostly chosen a policy of polite silence.
All in all, it would seem as if the political elite in Brussels, which is indifferent to Europe's Christian roots, has also forgotten the fate of Christians in Islamic countries.
Instead of demanding an end to the persecution of Christians, we take refuge in political correctness, preferring to concern ourselves with the welfare of those Muslims living in the EU, who enjoy a level of religious freedom that most Christians in the Islamic world can only dream of.
In future, the plight of Christians must play a special role in the management of the EU's foreign relations with Islamic countries.
The EU has sufficient ways and means to help improve the situation of Christians.
For example, development aid and other financial supports should be made conditional on allowing religious freedom for Christians.
I have voted accordingly.
