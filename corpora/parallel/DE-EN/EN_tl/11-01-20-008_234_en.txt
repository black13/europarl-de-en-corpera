This joint resolution deserved support because the number of attacks on Christian communities throughout the world grew in 2010.
In the European Union, religious freedom and freedom of expression are intrinsic to our European identity.
At the same time, Christianity is of key importance in this context, as well as a significant component in European culture.
In the EU, Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 9 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms govern religious freedom.
