There are comments in the media claiming that the reintroduction of the sanctions against Belarus' President Lukashenko, which were relaxed more than two years ago, would be tantamount to admitting that our longstanding efforts at rapprochement have failed.
The fact is that these efforts had failed before now, for example, at the time of the presidential elections and, if not sooner, they had certainly done so by the time the OSCE offices in Minsk were closed and accusations of attempted destabilisation were made against Germany and Poland.
However, in many instances, the resolution exaggerates the issues, making what is basically a good text susceptible to criticism.
For example, a call to ban all government officials and representatives of the justice system from entering the EU will not achieve the intended objective.
The cancellation of the 2014 World Ice Hockey Championships would be a similar example of excessive megaphone diplomacy.
It is for that reason that I have abstained from voting.
