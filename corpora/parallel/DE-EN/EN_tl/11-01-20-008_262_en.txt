The financial and economic crisis that has rocked the financial markets has naturally also impacted on competition policy.
This impact is apparent in the growing budgetary deficits and increasing public debt in many Member States, slowing down economic recovery, and also in the state supports provided in response to the financial crisis.
The government guarantees have led to a variety of effects and distortions, such as a reduction in the spread of private loans, as well as an impact on the strategy followed by the pension funds.
European policy on competition should make the internal market competitive on a global level.
There is little doubt that a coordinated approach in this area makes sense.
However, it should not degenerate into an attack on sovereignty.
For this reason, I have voted against the report.
