The High North is rich in resources and energy and will open up new sea routes that could be used by the European Union.
The mineral resources present there are valuable and must also be treated as such.
When extracting raw materials, it is important that the ecological system is not too badly affected.
The indigenous peoples also need special protection and consideration.
The Arctic is a world heritage site and must also be regarded as such.
Therefore, our focus should be on the preservation of this heritage, not the extraction of resources.
I support the report on a sustainable EU policy for the High North by my fellow Member, Mr Gahler.
