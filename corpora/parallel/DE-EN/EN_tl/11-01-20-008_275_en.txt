The Arctic's untold mineral resources have made the area the subject of heated dispute.
It is estimated that 90 billion barrels of oil alone lie untapped under the ice.
Inevitably, there is a feeling of unease that BP of all companies, having caused the oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico last year, is now to be allowed to extract resources in this sensitive natural environment, where conditions are far more extreme than in the Gulf.
After all, the fact is that the Arctic region already provides the final resting place for the world's mercury emissions.
In view of global warming and the expected consequences, this is a problem that cannot be overestimated.
I have voted in favour of the report, because it adequately presents the many factors involved.
