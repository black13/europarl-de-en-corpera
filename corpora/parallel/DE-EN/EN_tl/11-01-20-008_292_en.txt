The report on an EU strategy for the Black Sea is important and for this reason, it is rightly very comprehensive.
The further development of synergy in the Black Sea region is significant not just for energy strategy reasons.
We need new impulses for the modernisation of the economic area and new enterprise initiatives in the Black Sea region.
It is particularly important that natural gas supplies for Europe should be secured.
However, whatever the efforts by the EU, Russian interests should not be forgotten.
Russia is a vital strategic partner if peaceful and prosperous development is to be assured for the Black Sea region.
Criticising the prolonged stationing of the Russian Black Sea fleet represents an unnecessary provocation.
Nonetheless, I have voted in favour of the report.
