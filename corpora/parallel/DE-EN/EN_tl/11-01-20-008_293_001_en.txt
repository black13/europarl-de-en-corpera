In 2007, the strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU was recognised.
Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, part of the Black Sea became an inland sea of the EU.
As developments in this region, which is geopolitically situated between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, also have an impact on EU internal affairs, there is a need for stronger involvement in the area.
The aim is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region, as well as within the region.
The Black Sea region is intended to be developed into an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity.
In addition, joint projects are being set up, such as the creation of a Black Sea Civil Society Forum, strengthening of the academic and students' networks and creation of an Institute for European Studies in the Black Sea region.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
