I supported the report on EU strategy in the Black Sea region.
The measures previously taken in the Eastern European Mediterranean were not coordinated and the results achieved have been marginal.
The Black Sea region has known bilateral conflict for many, many years.
In view of the fact that two EU Member States border the Black Sea and the region has therefore become one of the Union's direct neighbours, the European Union must engage more closely in regional dialogue in order to foster political stability in the region.
Cooperation in establishing regional structures will also benefit the environmental situation, which is currently a cause for considerable concern.
The EU needs to provide active support in order to influence the balance between economic development and environmental protection.
After all, Europe also has interests that it pursues in the Black Sea region.
The area is an integral part of the EU's energy strategy, so that this new strategy is an implementation of the higher energy strategy and will bring synergy and continuity to our work at European level.
