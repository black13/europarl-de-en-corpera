Mr President, the violent death of the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, who was always a proponent of religious tolerance, brings the strengthening of extremist forces to the eyes of the world.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets after this atrocity, marching not against the murder but in support of the person who committed it.
Mr Taseer spoke out vehemently against the blasphemy laws, which prescribe the death sentence for blasphemers.
Just recently, as some of my fellow Members have already mentioned, the Christian, Asia Bibi, has been sentenced to death for supposedly having insulted the prophet Mohammed.
As a moderate member of the PPP political party, Salmaan Taseer was one of the strongest voices against extremism.
His death weakens the government, which is already fighting for political survival following the withdrawal of a coalition partner.
There are only 3 million Christians in Pakistan's population of 160 million.
What fate awaits this always peaceable minority?
Europe must intervene here and the delegation for relations with the countries of Southeast Asia, of which I am Vice-President, will continue to give its full backing to the human rights movement.
This murder must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrator and the people behind him must be brought to justice.
