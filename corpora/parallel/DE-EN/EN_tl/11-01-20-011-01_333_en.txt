Mr President, in many ways, Pakistan is a fragile country.
It is politically fragile because the government is not strong enough to implement effectively its moderate course of political and economic stabilisation and because the army's offensive against extremists in the border areas is, in fact, causing resistance to increase.
It is economically fragile because the global financial crisis and the devastating floods in the country have set back its development by several years.
It is socially fragile because social structures have failed to develop over the decades in such a way as to enable large sections of society to share in economic development.
We in the European Union must enter into dialogue with the political class there in order to promote a recognition that fundamental economic and social change are necessary so that people can be offered prospects that promise them more than the alternatives of extremism and fundamentalism.
