Mr President, the most hateful and violent regimes ever known were the anti-religious regimes of the Jacobins, Nazis and Communists in Europe.
For this reason, I do not think it is helpful for Mrs Vergiat to attack religions in such sweeping terms.
The fact remains, however, that religions are often misused for ideological purposes, which is something that we need to combat.
This is the case in Pakistan, for example.
On the other hand, we must remember that Pakistan was created on the basis of religious criteria when India was partitioned.
It is a country with no history, but was established as a Muslim state by the British colonial powers as they pulled out of the region.
That is why we should understand that this is an Islamic state.
However, we must insist that this country should be organised along tolerant lines and that religious freedom should be upheld.
Christians must be treated with greater respect than has been the case to date and the EU needs to show greater vigour in stepping up to its role as an advocate for this group.
After all, if Europe does not stand up for the world's Christians, then who will?
