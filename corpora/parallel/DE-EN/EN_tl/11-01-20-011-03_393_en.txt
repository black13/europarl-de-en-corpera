Mr President, we have a completely superfluous working group here in Parliament whose job it is to look at ways of making the plenary sessions more interesting.
This group would have done well to study today's plenary.
All we need is sufficient time, which is why we should also be allowed time on Thursday afternoons.
We also need the right President in the chair, who can exercise a judicious measure of rigour and flexibility.
This will produce a lively and interesting plenary.
(Applause)
