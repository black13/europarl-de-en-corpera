Mr President, Mrs Morvai, I am watching Hungary's internal politics very closely.
I was in Hungary quite often between 2002 and 2010.
I also saw demonstrations by your uniformed Jobbik party in Budapest.
I will not tell you what these demonstrations reminded me of.
As a German I will not go into that here.
Between 2002 and 2010 - in order to give you a clear answer - Hungary was, as it is now, a democratic state based on the rule of law with a left-leaning government governing according to democratic rules.
So far, I have no doubt that this also remains the case in Hungary today under a conservative government.
There is one thing I am sure of, however, and that is that your party is a right-wing extremist, neo-fascist party.
(Applause)
