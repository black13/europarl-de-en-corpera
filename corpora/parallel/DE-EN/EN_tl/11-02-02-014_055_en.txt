Mr President, with regard to the thorough preparations for the energy summit and the political priority areas: Mr Reul, what then is your view of the fact that, in a major interview today in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany, Mr Oettinger warned the European Union against setting too ambitious renewable energy targets?
This comes only a few weeks after the Renewable Energy Directive, of which all of us here were very proud, entered into force.
As regards thorough preparations on the subject of energy efficiency: what is your view of the fact that the energy efficiency action plan is still lying in a drawer and so there would in fact be absolutely no chance of debating it at the summit?
