Mr President, there are politicians who constantly demand something new, but never see anything through to the end.
There are also politicians who make sound preparations and implement initiatives.
That is exactly the point.
I do not believe in continually making new demands, and therefore Mr Oettinger is absolutely right.
First, let us do what we have already committed ourselves to.
Mr Schulz quite rightly pointed out that in many Member States the matter of efficiency leaves a lot to be desired and that many Member States have not yet achieved their renewable energy quotas.
We are fairly good, but not good enough.
In other words, we are still a long way from where we want to be.
Sometimes it is more sensible to achieve what you have set out to achieve first before taking the next step.
There are people who try to go too fast and then trip over their own feet.
