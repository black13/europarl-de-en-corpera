It is shocking that Christians throughout the world continue to be persecuted and murdered.
It is an indictment of Europe that the foreign ministers of the Member States in the Council cannot manage to respond to this.
They treat the will of Parliament with contempt.
The EU must do something.
I call on the Council to show responsibility for the basic right of freedom of religion, to swiftly draw up an implementable strategy to protect Christians throughout the world and to establish a separate unit for intercultural and religious matters in the European External Action Service.
These things need to be done now, not some time in the future.
