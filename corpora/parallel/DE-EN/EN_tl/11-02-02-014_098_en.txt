in writing. - I have comments to make on two matters: 1.
Energy policy: The current path that our energy policy is on will take too long to reach the goal.
By means of simplified and accelerated procedures with regard to the development of energy infrastructure, the EU can make important progress in setting its course - although this must under no circumstances be to the detriment of citizens and it must not undermine the Aarhus Convention.
Transparency and traceability in the work are necessary prerequisites.
It goes without saying that SMEs, with their capacity for innovation, must be involved as equal partners.
2.
The financial crisis: The world of the financial markets turns much faster than the Council has reacted up to now.
In order to counter the resulting general uncertainty felt by citizens and in the financial world, swift and decisive action is required.
