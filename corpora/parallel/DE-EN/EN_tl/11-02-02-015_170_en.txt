Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the debate here in this House, which you have followed with interest, has one common denominator in particular and that is the demand being made of you, Baroness Ashton.
Raise your voice.
Move forwards, be a little more courageous and also be a bit louder.
Stand up for those who, in a modern civilised society, are supporting democracy and freedom of expression and of the press.
Tunisia, Egypt and perhaps a few other countries are about to undergo a difficult change.
They need our support in this, and therefore it is wrong for your primary representative in this country to say that no change to the strategy is necessary.
On the contrary, we need the Mediterranean strategy and perhaps the Middle East strategy, or perhaps a rethink on coexistence beyond the Mediterranean, and of course the top priority and something that needs to be done very quickly is the adaptation and preparation of, and support for, elections.
It should not have escaped the notice of the primary representative of the EU in this country that the transitional government in Tunisia is now aiming to enter into four international agreements for the protection of human rights, that all political prisoners have been released, dissidents have returned and democratic elections are being prepared and conducted.
We must support this process, and Parliament wants to hear you speak more forcefully on this issue.
