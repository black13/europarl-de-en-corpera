Mr President, in the most recent referendum in Southern Sudan, the people decided that the old, arbitrary colonial borders should fall.
In July, the world's 193rd state was officially founded.
There were 3.8 million people who voted in favour of an independent state and only 45 000 voted for things to remain as they were: this represents an overwhelming majority utilising the right to self-determination, and it is grounds for great joy.
However, the split alone will not create stability in the country.
Sudan is still a trouble spot, and in the north there is the omnipresent radical Islamism.
In addition to other measures, it is therefore important for administrative structures to be developed, because a new border needs to be managed and also monitored.
This requires an efficient security policy throughout the entire region - in Somalia, Sudan and Southern Sudan.
The High Representative of the EU is called on, together with the international players, to promote security and stability in this region and, above all, to combat radical tendencies and to bravely support Southern Sudan.
