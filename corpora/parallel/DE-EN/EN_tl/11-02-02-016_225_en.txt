in writing. - The fact that, in the referendum, Southern Sudan voted in favour of a split was to be expected.
It was also to be expected that this would by no means put an end to the problems in the region.
For one thing, the South is still unstable and it must first prove itself as an independent state.
This may possibly happen before the projected date in July, because the loss of 25% of the land area and 20% of the population will not hit Northern Sudan nearly as hard as giving up a considerable proportion of the oil revenue.
For that reason, the EU must help the new state to maintain its independence and to protect its sovereignty, because development aid for Southern Sudan may also play an important role with regard to Europe's oil supply in the future.
The EU should therefore take a leaf out of China's book, particularly since Beijing is cleverly linking development aid to the supply of raw materials.
Thus, both sides profit from the Chinese model.
The problem of illegal migration to Europe must not be disregarded either.
An agreement must therefore be concluded with the government of Southern Sudan regarding the readmission of its own nationals who have entered the European Union illegally.
We will then have to watch closely to see whether Southern Sudan is actually prepared to fulfil this agreement.
