Madam President, after many years of dispute between the European Union on the one hand and the Latin American banana producers on the other, an important step has now been taken thanks to the Agreement on Trade in Bananas.
I support this agreement because it also puts an end to the dispute at the World Trade Organisation.
However, the concessions made by the EU and the Latin American banana producers must not cause the general situation of the ACP countries to be forgotten.
Assistance for the ACP countries provided by the EU must be carefully monitored and, where necessary, increased.
The impact assessment called for by the European Parliament is important in this regard and this must be clearly emphasised.
Despite all of the assistance, which is without doubt fundamental and important, there must be no reallocations with the EU budget.
All too often, money made available for particular areas is reallocated and used for other purposes.
This practice must be stopped, whether, as in the current case, it relates to the European Development Fund or other funds, including the agricultural fund, which is frequently under discussion at the moment.
The European Union must remember its responsibilities towards the ACP countries and the outermost regions and be consistent in its actions.
If we now look at this heartening agreement from a global perspective then I have one eye on the Doha negotiations.
The World Economic Forum in Davos seems to have provided some impetus.
The G20 want to conclude the World Trade Organisation negotiations before 2012.
It remains to be seen whether the words will actually be turned into action.
However, it seems as though the Agreement on Trade in Bananas has added a piece to the big Doha puzzle.
