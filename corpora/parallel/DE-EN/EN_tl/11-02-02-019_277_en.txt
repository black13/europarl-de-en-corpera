Madam President, tuberculosis is still very widespread today, particularly in poorer countries.
A third of the world's population is infected and 2.5 million people die from TB each year.
According to estimates by the World Health Organisation, there are 49 new cases and seven deaths per hour in Europe alone.
In the industrialised nations, tuberculosis has experienced a resurgence, particularly as a secondary disease in patients with HIV and AIDS, but also as a result of migration and tourism.
Prevention, diagnosis and treatment can indeed bring the spread of this disease under control.
Humans are the only host of the tuberculosis microbacterium and its eradication would be perfectly possible.
However, there are concerns about the increasing number of resistant bacteria.
There are new vaccinations and, according to one study, administration of vitamin D reduces the treatment time for tuberculosis.
To what extent has the Commission already stepped up its activity in this area?
