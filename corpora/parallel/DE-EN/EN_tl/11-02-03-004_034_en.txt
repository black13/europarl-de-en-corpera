Madam President, development aid is always costly, often unfortunately ineffective and sometimes even harmful, because it all too frequently does not deal with the specific problems of the country in question.
There is rarely any attempt to take a long-term approach and the activities are poorly coordinated.
In my opinion, it is doubtful whether an EU-wide financing instrument for development and human rights can improve the situation, particularly as there is no consistent coordination within the EU.
Giving aid to small African farmers, while at the same time bringing them to the brink of ruin with our subsidised agricultural products, ultimately means that we are throwing billions of euros down the drain.
This will not change to any significant extent as long as we continue supporting large companies in the EU and indirectly in the developing countries.
China's development aid, which the government in Beijing is using to secure raw materials and new markets, is in competition with our traditional development cooperation methods.
In this area too, we will have to come up with some new ideas.
In addition, it is equally important to make development aid dependent on cooperation with regard to the refugee problem, perhaps by introducing readmission agreements.
