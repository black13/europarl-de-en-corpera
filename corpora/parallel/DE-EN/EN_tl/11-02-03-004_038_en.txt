Madam President, the dictators in our neighbouring countries are being toppled and it is a good thing that they are going.
Although our High Representatives in the European Union are not in a position or are not prepared to support and encourage those people who are fighting for democracy, it is good at least to be able to take action and provide help, even if we are not talking.
However, it is very important for us to combine the aid we provide with a requirement to comply with our values, including democracy, the rule of law and core labour standards.
It is essential for the European Union to provide help.
In addition, we must not only help these people, but also ensure that they understand the values which have made us strong.
Given that this is the case, it is clear to me that this aid must ultimately be controlled and managed by a democratic Parliament.
In future, we must not allow the European Union's actions to be controlled by a bureaucratic organisation.
Parliament must be put in a position to fulfil its role as a parliamentary body, which means being able to take decisions.
