Madam President, I believe that it has become very clear during the debate why we in Parliament want these delegated acts.
We do not want micro-management, but we do need to be able to use this instrument in a responsible and well-informed way, so that we can, if necessary, correct what has gone wrong.
If we talk about Parliament's position with external bodies, for example, with human rights organisations which could be affected by this and if we fail to come to an agreement, although I hope that this is not the case, and if individual projects cannot then take place, I believe that there is support and understanding for Parliament's position.
It is not true that Parliament and the concept are not understood.
I would like to say something briefly about the criticism that too much money is being spent by Parliament on human rights and the development of democracy.
I think that the opposite is the case.
If we consider this instrument for human rights and the promotion of democracy, which has only been in existence since 2004, we can see even now that a great deal can be achieved with relatively little money.
We cannot simply look at this as a whole.
Instead we need to focus in detail on what these projects have achieved.
Projects have only had to be discontinued in a few individual cases.
If we really want to see the fundamental values of the EU being put into effect, if we really want people to live in freedom, free from poverty and free from fear, we must promote human rights.
This instrument makes a very good complement to our policy for requiring other states to support human rights.
We are not spending too much money.
On the contrary, we need much clearer financial support.
