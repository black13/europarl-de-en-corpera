Madam President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Florenz for his highly pragmatic approach to this subject and for his stamina.
I would like to start with a question for Mr Potoƒçnik.
You say that we must deal with the Member States in accordance with their ability to collect waste.
It is true that the motto of the European Union is 'United in diversity' but can it really be right that one Member State collects 16 kg of waste per head and another only 1 kg?
Is this not a misinterpretation of diversity?
I am calling on you openly to take a stricter approach on waste with the Member States.
We are busy adopting regulations here in Parliament while the Member States are doing what they want.
This must not happen in future.
I would like to remind you about the interview you gave during the waste crisis in Naples.
Italy was condemned at the time and there is still no proper plan on the table.
You need to be stricter.
It is the function of the Commission, in its capacity as the custodian of the treaties, to remind those Member States which are lagging behind about their obligations.
In this area, we have a rapidly growing market and the future of Europe will depend on how we manage this waste problem.
We need the Member States to implement the regulations properly.
If they are too lax in this respect, then we will not be able to make progress.
I would have liked to have asked you to set realistic targets, in particular with regard to the smallest companies, and to include consumers.
It is clear that everyone must take on their share of the responsibility.
However, we need to remind those responsible, and when it comes to the implementation this is the Member States, what their responsibilities are.
