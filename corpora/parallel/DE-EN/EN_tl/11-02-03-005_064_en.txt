on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, the amount of waste equipment is increasing dramatically.
Millions of tonnes of electric and electronic waste are produced in the EU every year and this represents a genuine hazard for people and the environment.
I am pleased that the report by Mr Florenz recognises this problem and that we were able to introduce some pleasing improvements in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety which had the support of all the groups.
The stricter export regulations for electric and electronic waste are important.
I hope that you, ladies and gentlemen, will support this regulation which, above all, will help to protect the people in those countries which are affected.
However, I still do not agree with the exclusion of solar modules from the directive.
I take a very critical view of the voluntary collection of items by producers.
A few manufacturers use cadmium, which is a toxic substance, in their solar modules.
The fact that modules are frequently removed by do-it-yourself enthusiasts presents an additional risk.
Nanomaterials can also be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process.
Some nanomaterials come with clear instructions stating that they are damaging to health.
Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation.
If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market.
This is why we have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and I would like to ask you to support them.
These are Amendments 101 and 102.
