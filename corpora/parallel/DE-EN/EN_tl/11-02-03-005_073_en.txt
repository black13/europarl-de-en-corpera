Madam President, I would like to address my fellow Member by name, but unfortunately I do not know who he is, because I have never come across him before in the debate on electronic waste.
Perhaps I do not recognise you because you have a new haircut.
However, what answer do you plan to give the citizens when it emerges in five or six years time that our raw materials have run out and have been discarded or are polluting our waters?
You need to explain this.
My second point is as follows.
Please read the directive.
It says nothing at all about taxpayers having to fund the system.
In fact, this is the responsibility of the producers.
This system is now being tightened up and extended, which is the right thing to do.
I would like to hear your response to these two points.
