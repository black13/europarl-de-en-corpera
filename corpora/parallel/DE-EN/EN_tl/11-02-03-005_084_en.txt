rapporteur. - Madam President, Mr Potočnik, I support the final remarks that you made, in particular with regard to resource efficiency.
However, over the next few months the focus of the entire decision-making process will be on you, because a common position will now have to be agreed on.
You will have to negotiate with the Council and come to a decision and I must say to you that the Council has not moved one millimetre over the last seven months, and that was not the fault of the Belgian Presidency.
Some countries are very obstinate and, against the background of the unanimity in this House, I would like to ask the Members who have spoken so passionately today in favour of this report to go home and exert some influence on their governments and to explain that things will not be the same as they have been in the past.
I could mention the names of a few old friends who would really come to grips with this issue.
Therefore, Mr Potočnik, I believe that we will need to have an intense debate over the next few months.
You must continue to be tough with the Council.
It is also important to point out that there is a clear desire for national regulations when it comes to waste policy.
However, that is counterproductive, because the internal market was born a long time ago and we now need to bring it up properly.
It is not the entire internal market, but half of the internal market which is the problem.
I would like to highlight once again that the ratio of 16 kg to 1 kg, as Mr Seeber has clearly stated, shows that we still have a great deal to do.
However, if we can agree on this, then we will be on the right track.
Mr Potočnik, I have no doubt that you know what you have to do.
I would like to emphasise the fact that you are doing an excellent job and we will continue to give you an occasional nudge, perhaps a little roughly, in the right direction.
