Mr President, waste does not respect borders and that applies in particular to electronic and electrical waste.
Therefore, it is essential that the provisions for waste disposal and recycling are harmonised across and within the Member States of the European Union and, most importantly, that the export of waste without provision being made for certified and environmentally sound disposal is stopped.
My final request is for us to investigate the effectiveness of our decisions to ensure that our intentions really do become reality.
