Mr President, I hope that the citizens of Campania will see the resolution that we have adopted today as encouragement for them.
Our aim was not to discredit or run down the region.
We were also not intending to fight any domestic political battles.
The European Union's fair offer to Campania is as follows.
If you develop a complete waste disposal concept which is logical, environmentally sound, efficient and free from corruption, the European Union will provide you with financial support.
Providing that this message has been received, I hope that we will at some point be able to discuss the fact that the crisis in Campania has been finally and permanently resolved.
