in writing. - Last year Tamás Deutsch made some remarks during a radio programme which have led to him being charged under Hungarian law.
The only thing he did was to express his opinion on facts which were in the public domain and which had been published in a newspaper.
The comments were clearly made in his capacity as a Member of the European Parliament, which means that under EU rules he is covered by parliamentary immunity.
The purpose of this immunity is to protect the integrity of the European Parliament as a democratic legislative assembly and to ensure the independence of its Members in the performance of their duties.
The use of legal proceedings to attempt to prevent Members of this House from expressing their opinions on matters of legitimate public interest is not compatible with democracy.
We must safeguard the right of free expression.
For this reason, I fully support this report, which rejects the request to waive the immunity of Tamás Deutsch.
