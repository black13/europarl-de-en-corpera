This motion is primarily about empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts.
The amendments tabled by Parliament impose extensive obligations on the Commission to provide Parliament with information.
This and the possibility of raising objections to the delegated acts or even of revoking them completely, together with the proposed measures for increasing efficiency, have prompted me to vote in favour of the report.
