As in the case of the GÃ¡l/Lochbihler report, this proposed amendment to the regulation on establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation concerns improvements to efficiency by means of the delegated acts adopted by the Commission.
I have voted in favour of this report, because the amendments would increase the European Parliament's powers of control.
