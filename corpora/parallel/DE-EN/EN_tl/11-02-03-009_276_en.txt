The current commitment has brought hardly any improvements.
On the contrary, governments have been made dependent on aid and, what is even worse, millions of euros of development aid often disappear because of corruption or are siphoned off into the bank accounts of third-world dictators.
As a result, development aid is not only ineffective, but sometimes even harmful, because it does not deal with the specific problems of the country in question and, in addition, there is a lack of coordination and control.
In my opinion, it is highly doubtful whether an EU-wide financing instrument for development and human rights can improve this situation.
On the one hand, giving money to small African farmers, while, on the other hand, bringing them to the brink of ruin with our subsidised agricultural products, means that we are throwing European taxpayers' money down the drain.
Because of my doubts concerning the viability of the planned finance instrument, I have abstained.
