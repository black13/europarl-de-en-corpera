An agreement has been reached concerning banana imports into the EU which will no longer put the Latin American supplier countries at a disadvantage when compared with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States.
This brings the banana import rules into line with the World Trade Organisation regulations.
Under the agreement, the EU will gradually lower its import tariffs on bananas from Latin America from EUR 176 per tonne to EUR 114 per tonne by 2017.
I have abstained from voting, because it is possible that this agreement will bring about a relative deterioration in the competitiveness of some countries.
