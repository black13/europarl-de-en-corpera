An agreement has been reached in December 2009 which has brought the long-term dispute over bananas between the EU and the World Trade Organisation to an end.
It consists of three main requirements which the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states and the Latin American countries that supply bananas must meet.
The aim is to close some alleged loopholes.
In addition, the EU undertakes to apply strictly controlled tariffs to banana imports.
I abstained from voting, as some of the points in the report, in particular those concerning tariff agreements, could not be completely resolved.
