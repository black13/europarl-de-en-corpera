in writing. - The Geneva Agreement is intended to put an end to the so-called 'banana war'.
Further conflicts are to be expected, however, because the Latin American countries have demanded a significantly greater reduction in customs duties.
Furthermore, many third countries are attempting to bring their banana production onto the European market duty-free under the guise of 'customer-specific treatment'.
This could result in considerable damage.
Once again, the EU has made some unjustified concessions from which, ultimately, only the multinational companies will profit.
For these reasons, I voted against this report.
