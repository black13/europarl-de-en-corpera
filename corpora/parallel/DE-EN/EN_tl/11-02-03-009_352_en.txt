in writing. - In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive.
However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem.
There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations.
We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams.
Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted.
For this reason, I have abstained from voting on the report.
