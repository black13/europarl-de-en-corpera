in writing. - In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive.
However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem.
There is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulations.
We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams.
Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted.
For this reason, some of the FDP Members of the European Parliament have abstained from voting on the report.
