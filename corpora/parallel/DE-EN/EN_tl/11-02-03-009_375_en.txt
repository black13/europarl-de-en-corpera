The amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment is constantly increasing.
For environmental reasons it is essential that this type of waste is properly disposed of, because it often contains large quantities of toxic substances, including heavy metals, such as mercury, lead and cadmium, and CFCs.
In order to raise awareness of this among the Member States, the business community and individual consumers, the EU has specified collection targets, which the new directive aims to amend.
I have not voted in favour of the report, because, in my opinion, this represents excessive interference in the powers of the individual countries.
