in writing. - In overall terms, the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament supports the waste disposal directive.
However, the subject of photovoltaic modules remains a problem.
There is no understandable reason for excluding the solar industry from the regulations.
We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams.
Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being excluded, particularly as the solar industry is likely to be responsible for a large amount of waste in the near future, when the first solar cells installed on large numbers on European roofs have to be replaced.
Solar cells may contain toxic substances which can be reused.
For this reason, I have abstained from voting on the report.
