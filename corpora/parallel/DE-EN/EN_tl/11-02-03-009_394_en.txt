in writing. - I naturally support the idea of improving the levels of collection of electrical equipment throughout Europe, not least because it will enable us to reuse scarce raw materials more effectively.
I would like to highlight the fact that my home country of Germany is in a particularly good position in this respect and has put in place balanced recycling solutions for businesses and consumers.
This system does not need to be changed to improve the way in which we reuse raw materials.
The Commission also did not want to introduce any changes.
However, the report that we have just voted on unfortunately imposes a number of additional burdens which may have an excessive impact on businesses, including electricians, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being hardest hit.
For this reason, I have not voted in favour of this report.
The obligation to collect equipment, even that which does not form part of a company's product range, which in some circumstances involves separating products that do and do not contain toxic substances and broken and reusable products, will involve additional costs and a great deal of extra bureaucracy.
We must not allow this to happen, in particular to SMEs.
Excluding the smallest companies which have very small premises is not enough.
The approach that has been taken is admirable, but it fails to tackle the problem as a whole and does not follow the 'think small first' principle, laid down in EU policy on medium-sized companies.
