I have voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia, because it expresses the European Parliament's attitude to the events in Tunisia in a clear and balanced way.
It is essential that the transitional government organises elections as soon as possible, so that the country can move from authoritarian rule to stable democratic government.
The resolution also calls on Baroness Ashton to take rapid action and to provide Tunisia with the EU aid it needs.
