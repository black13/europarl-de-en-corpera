in writing. - The European Parliament motion for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia supports the efforts of the Tunisian people to move towards democracy.
It also underlines the fact that the necessary conditions need to be created to enable a parliamentary assembly to be elected.
Such an assembly would then have to draw up a democratic constitution that ensures the separation of powers.
The repressive measures and the disproportionate force employed by the security forces are condemned.
For these reasons, I support the motion for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia.
