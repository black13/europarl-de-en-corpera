Every year EUR 2 billion is spent on treating people with tuberculosis in the European Union.
Alongside HIV and malaria, tuberculosis is one of the most widespread epidemics in the world.
Around one third of the world's population is infected.
It is clear that we are far from eradicating tuberculosis.
As in the case of all diseases, increasing resistance in the form of multi-resistant or even ultra-resistant bacteria and the resulting lack of treatment options are presenting modern medicine with a major challenge.
The standard drugs, which have been used since the 1960s, have no impact on mutated variants.
As a result, other medicines are prescribed which are more expensive and have more powerful side effects.
The subsequent treatment costs can be up to one hundred times higher than those of normal tuberculosis.
If a patient stops taking the standard drugs for the normal form of tuberculosis before the end of the six-month period, the result is not only severe side effects, but also resistance.
In addition, it is only possible to stop the disease spreading by investigating all the people with whom the patient has had contact.
Some countries have not complied with these requirements.
If these well-known basic rules are not followed, research projects costing billions of euros are unlikely to bring about any major changes and new types of resistance will occur.
For this reason, I have abstained from voting.
