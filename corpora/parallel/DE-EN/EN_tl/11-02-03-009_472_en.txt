The European Police College (CEPOL) was established in 2000.
Its purpose is to promote close cooperation between the different police forces within the European Union.
CEPOL helps national bodies to work together to prevent and combat crime.
In addition, it works closely with police services from third countries.
I believe that CEPOL is a useful institution, which is why I have voted in favour of the motion.
