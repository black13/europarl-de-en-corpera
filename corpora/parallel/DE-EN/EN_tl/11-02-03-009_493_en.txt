The financial supervisory authorities may be more useful than many other EU institutions.
However, one body based in one place, instead of three located in three different cities with the accompanying costly duplicate structures, would have been sufficient.
Supervision at a European level should involve, among other things, coordination of the national supervisory bodies.
With the current division of responsibility, this will be difficult.
In addition, an efficient early warning system is needed, together with an appropriate supportive contribution from speculators and a discussion without taboos.
As I believe that the establishment of three European financial supervisory bodies is a waste of money, I support the fact that the report firmly opposes the appointment of the specified candidate as chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority.
