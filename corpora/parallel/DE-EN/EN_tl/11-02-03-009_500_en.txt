If three new EU agencies based in London, Paris and Frankfurt, together with a risk advisory board at the European Central Bank (ECB), are to be established, the result is likely to be confusion regarding the powers of these bodies.
The financial supervisory authorities may be more useful than many other EU institutions, such as the so-called European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.
However, one body would have been sufficient.
The three new financial supervisory authorities only represent part of the overall solution.
In addition, the Member States need to change their attitudes.
The current motto of 'if you do not hurt me, I will not hurt you' which allows Member States to save each other from financial penalties under the deficit procedure has resulted in disaster.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report and against the candidate for the position of chair of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority.
