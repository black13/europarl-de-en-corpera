The waste crisis in Italy, and particularly in the province of Campania, has been going on for years.
No effort is being made to reduce the amount of rubbish being generated or to ensure that the waste which is produced is disposed of properly or even recycled.
Huge mountains of rubbish have built up which are disposed of illegally, for example in the sea, giving rise to negative headlines.
Investigators recently discovered that untreated household waste has been tipped into the Mediterranean all around Naples.
I have not voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, because in my opinion it is primarily a statement of opposition to the right-wing government and does not take an unbiased approach to the problem.
