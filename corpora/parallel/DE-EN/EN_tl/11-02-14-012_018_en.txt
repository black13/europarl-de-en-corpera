Mr President, I take the view that, in the light of what has happened in the Khodorkovsky case, we absolutely should debate the state of the law in Russia.
However, given the Duma elections still to come in the autumn, we have good reason to concern ourselves with the situation in this, our major neighbour in the east of this continent.
Of course, we are all repeatedly confronted at the moment with the question of whether we are actually doing enough in our neighbouring countries to help bring about human and civil rights and freedom.
Many of us have also certainly asked ourselves self-critically whether we actually always debated what was necessary when it came to Egypt and to Tunisia.
I do not want us to allow ourselves such negligence in the east of our own continent and I therefore call for us to deal with the question of 'The Rule of law in Russia' without fail this week - or, more specifically, tomorrow.
