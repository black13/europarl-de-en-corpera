Mr President, I would like to ask for a clarification of the Rules of Procedure.
I do not know whether the European Parliament is able to hold a fundamental debate about the European Arrest Warrant (EAW).
One may be for or against the EAW and its implementation, but whether we here in Parliament are able to discuss it in relation to criminal proceedings that are currently under way is something that I venture is doubtful under the Rules of Procedure.
If that were the case, I would also have another couple of cases to bring up that we could happily discuss.
However, I would urgently advise, at this point, that we do not make legal proceedings currently under way the subject of a fundamental discussion here in the European Parliament.
