Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European Union does not have the best reputation.
This often results from the fact that workers do not feel that the balance between freedom and security is protected or that it needs to be restored in many areas.
This can be seen, for example, in the Services Directive, since it is an important driver of the internal market but also throws a spotlight on the limitations of that market at the same time.
The review is therefore important.
It is a complex task, and one to which Mrs Gebhardt has provided absolutely outstanding answers.
There are still some challenges to be overcome, however.
The Services Directive must not, under any circumstances, undermine the fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location.
We must therefore carefully ensure, through all the monitoring opportunities that have been made available to us, that cross-border services, too, do not violate this principle.
The point of single contact must provide fair access to the market of the country in which the service is to be provided.
However, this is not only for the service providers themselves and the companies, for whom in my home city of Essen, for example, there are six officials - for four towns - who feel responsible.
It is also for the workers.
In that regard, it is absolutely crucial what language these points of single contact speak.
In the Committee on Regional Development, we had a fairly hopeless discussion on this.
In my view, the languages of the neighbouring countries should be used.
