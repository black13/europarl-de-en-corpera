Mr President, you will have observed that there are many, many MEPs wishing to use the catch-the-eye procedure because this subject is so ridiculously important to us.
I come from a country - Austria - where the Services Directive has not yet been implemented.
The reason for this relates to constitutional law - the requisite majorities were needed in order to pass a Federal Constitutional Act, and they are not easy to obtain.
I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, not only because she has shown such commitment to this subject for so long, but also because she attempted, together with the shadow rapporteur, to accommodate both the principles and the practical in this report.
Those principles included emphasising how important it is to exclude social services and health services.
The practical included, for example, the ability to find what you are looking for and obtain the necessary information via the Internet.
The main reason why I wanted to speak was in order to express our disappointment with the fact that, even on implementation of the Services Directive, it has still not proven possible to get a grip on wage and social dumping.
