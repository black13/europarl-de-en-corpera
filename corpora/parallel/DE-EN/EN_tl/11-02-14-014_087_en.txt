Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a European patent regime would probably improve the situation for some areas of business and science.
However, I must say that the hopes placed in this patent are somewhat over-optimistic.
We need to keep a sense of proportion here.
I am opposed to enhanced European cooperation.
We recently dealt with the issue of divorce in the context of enhanced cooperation.
Now, directly following on from this decision, we have the next issue relating to enhanced cooperation on the table.
If we simply wave this approval through, we will be encouraging a situation where soon, enhanced cooperation will be the only mechanism for reaching agreement because it is too difficult to reach agreement at Council level.
This was not the intention of the convention when we discussed enhanced cooperation.
Good governance, something we talk about a lot here, means transparency and clarity among other things.
However, transparency and clarity are not promoted by enhanced cooperation in its multiplicity of forms in a wide variety of areas.
I believe we will be establishing a major problem for the future if we constantly have different subgroups of states coming together to agree on a particular issue.
Of course, it is all very well to say 'The invitation is open to everyone'.
The question is, under what conditions?
I would have thought that this time - unlike in all the preceding years - we actually would have had a chance of reaching agreement if only the negotiations had gone on longer.
I do not believe that enhanced cooperation is the right path for the issue of patents.
For this reason, I do not intend voting in favour of this regulation.
