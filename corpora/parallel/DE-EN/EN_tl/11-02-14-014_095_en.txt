Mr President, we are all aware that multilingualism is a reflection of the cultural and linguistic diversity to be found in the EU and, as such, is extremely important.
However, the dispute over the language used in EU patents has been going on for more than 30 years.
Over the course of these 30 years, European countries have had to cope with high translation costs and, in some cases, competitive disadvantages on the global market.
There is no denying that it is hard to put a figure on intangible fixed assets like trademarks and patents.
However, these are used to secure loans and are also taken into account in ratings.
In this context, the new patent law drawn up through the process of enhanced European cooperation, which is valid at least in parts of the EU, only requires patents to be translated into German, English and French, which will certainly make matters easier in bureaucratic terms.
This is particularly the case because English is used as a universal technical language in some sectors, such as IT and medicine.
Last but not least, the consistent use of the three working languages - German, English and French - would make it genuinely possible to reach a majority of the population.
On a personal note, I am pleased to see that the new regulation also strengthens the position of the German language, which is still the most widely spoken native language within the EU according to a survey from 2006.
