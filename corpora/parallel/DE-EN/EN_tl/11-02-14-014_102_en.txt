Mr President, we have heard a lot of good arguments today.
I would just like to deal with a few important points.
We should support the call made by Mr Lehne and accept the proposal put forward by Commissioner Barnier.
At this point, I would like to draw attention yet again to the successful work of the Belgian Presidency of the Council.
This Presidency has achieved a great deal in other areas too.
The issue at stake here is a procedural decision.
Mr Lehne has already pointed this out.
The question at issue here is not which European language is spoken by how many people worldwide or which is the most aesthetically beautiful, but rather a procedural decision that the Council is anxious to take.
I would agree with the previous speaker from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance when she said that we should exercise care when considering this procedural decision.
However, we are not faced with the desire of a subgroup within the European Council of Ministers to establish a language regime, but rather the wishes of 25 out of 27 Member States.
It is for this reason that I believe that, even if the decision to approve enhanced cooperation is to be made with caution, this is something that the European Parliament can agree to.
