Mr President, the reason we are discussing these proposals from the Commission is that the previous regulation lapsed in 2010.
As I worked on this proposal, I was reminded how, in the mid-1980s, I worked with my predecessor from the Green Party here in Parliament, Mrs von Blottnitz, on the fall-out of the Chernobyl disaster.
One of the biggest problems after the Chernobyl accident was a lack of transparency and the failure of comprehensive democratic controls.
To be honest, I find it astonishing that we now find ourselves having to take an almost defensive line of argument because we cannot consider this issue on the basis of the Euratom regulations alone, but that we also have to consider consumer protection, protection for the population in the event of major accidents in nuclear power plants, based on the rules of the European Treaty, so that we have complete control and a say in the final outcome.
I would like to call once again on Mr Barnier, who is from France, to ensure that things change here.
At the time, France acted as if there was no problem and the radioactive clouds would somehow take a detour around its territory.
This was a shame, as people in France have become aware in retrospect.
Otherwise, I agree with Mrs Hall that we should follow the example of the United States by adopting a very conservative approach to the issue of regulation: limit values are not set for young people and the elderly, for the strong and the weak, but purely on the basis of what children can tolerate, so that the lowest possible limit values are applicable in the event of an accident.
The recommendations in the United States are ten times lower than those published today by the European Commission, based on the advice from Euratom.
I believe that you really should follow the lead provided here by myself and Mrs Hall.
