Mr President, it is a well-known fact that the Chernobyl disaster and the subsequent radioactive contamination of foodstuffs took neighbouring countries unawares in 1986.
Thankfully, the European Union learned lessons from this and set down limit values for similar disasters.
It is known that radioactive contamination can be significant in some foodstuffs for many years, even though it cannot be seen, tasted or smelled.
That is precisely the problem when contaminated foodstuffs, such as forest fruits, from areas that have been exposed to radioactivity for centuries, are not only consumed at local level but also freely sold as safe in otherwise uncontaminated areas.
The consequences of radioactive foodstuffs, which are particularly dangerous for pregnant women, the infirm, small children and the elderly, often take years or even decades to come to light.
Our current level of knowledge would indicate that there are no levels of radiation that can be classified as harmless with any absolute degree of certainty.
Research into the cause of a wide range of new illnesses, such as allergies, is still in its infancy; despite this fact, foodstuffs are still being irradiated.
What is more, no one has considered the question of possible interaction with genetic engineering.
If people in sensitive categories still cannot safely eat large quantities of indigenous mushrooms a full 25 years after Chernobyl, surely the time has come not only to shut down nuclear power stations, but also to put a stop to all nuclear testing.
In the final analysis, all of this is pointless if checks on foodstuffs in and around contaminated regions do not really work.
