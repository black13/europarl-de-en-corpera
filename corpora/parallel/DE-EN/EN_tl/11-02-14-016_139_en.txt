Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Bendtsen because the CIP programme is one of the key pillars for enterprise and for funding in this area.
The JEREMIE and JASMINE programmes, as well as the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs, are extremely important in helping people to get to know the markets.
I would like to thank Mrs Herczog for her backing for the EIB and for the EIF, the European Investment Fund, and for her call for an increase in the available finances.
However, I would call on Commissioner Tajani to ensure that the objectives for 2020 also include a mandatory requirement for a 20% capital base for SMEs.
This is something we already require from the banks, so the same should apply to SMEs.
This is important for both sectors.
I would also suggest that a tax on profits should only be imposed when proceeds are taken out of a company.
In other words, it should be possible to re-invest profits as equity capital.
However, if an entrepreneur or employee takes money out of a company, then this should be taxed in the normal way.
One final point that seems particularly important to me is the possibility of writing off debt of not less than EUR 5 000.
We believe that a depreciation right should be allowed on profits of up to EUR 5 000.
This would provide the best basis for striking a balance between risk capital and equity capital for the orderly financing of loans.
