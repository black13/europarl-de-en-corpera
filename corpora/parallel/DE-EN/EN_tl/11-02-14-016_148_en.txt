Mr President, the European Union is always fulsome in its praise for small and medium-sized enterprises as the driving force behind the economy and as the main source of employment, particularly when employers do not immediately lay off their workers, even in recessionary times.
At the same time, these very enterprises have been overloaded with bureaucratic red tape for decades, also suffering disadvantage when it comes to EU-wide subsidies.
On paper, we encounter one SME initiative after another.
In practice, however, small and medium-sized enterprises find themselves unable to access capital as a result of the provisions of Basel II, and now Basel III.
Innovation is vitally important for the survival of SMEs into the future.
However, innovation also requires money and research.
Of course, it is commendable that SMEs will receive greater attention in the future under the new EU rules on public procurement and that it will be made easier for them to access EU research funding.
However, the fact is that many SMEs may not survive long enough to see these long-discussed measures come to fruition, because they will find themselves choked off by a lack of finance.
