Mr President, it is important that the drafting of the strategy should be an open process, and that a small number of influential players are not allowed to dictate the outcome.
This means that we also need to find solutions for conflicting interests.
It is not possible to reconcile all forms of development for the waterway with the objective of protecting the unique natural heritage of the Danube region.
The point must be to make use of the technical opportunities available to us and to adapt the ships to the river, rather than vice versa.
I am referring here to the Danube as it flows freely through Bavaria.
I believe we should strongly criticise the fact that a communication issued by the Commission does not seek to follow the path of what is technically viable and most environmentally compatible.
Contrary to the recommendations to date, the Commission is now committing itself to a development that will enable type 4B vessels to navigate the river throughout the year by 2015.
This will inevitably lead to conflict, even though this would not be necessary if a consensus were to be reached on how to exploit the existing technical options while, at the same time, protecting the natural amenity.
This prior decision must be withdrawn at all costs.
Finally, I would also call for the EU strategy on Roma inclusion to be linked with the strategy for the Danube region.
This should also be reflected in Parliament's resolution.
