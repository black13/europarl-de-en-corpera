Mr President, Commissioner, the strategy for the Danube region is intended, among other things, to promote long-term cooperation in order to improve the transport network and infrastructure for greater environmental protection.
This will certainly include sewage treatment plants and projects to promote environmental technology and biodiversity.
This is a good thing.
Yet, what I believe is missing under the environmental heading, Commissioner, is the issue of environmental safety in the context of nuclear power.
After all, some of the most controversial nuclear power stations in Europe - Mochovce, Temelin, Belene - are located within the Danube region and, for the most part, the construction methods used there date back to the Soviet period, so that the power stations have some serious and dangerous deficiencies.
Despite the serious international consequences of a laissez-faire nuclear policy, insufficient attention is paid to the adjoining regions of neighbouring states, which are not included in the environmental assessments to the appropriate degree.
Unfortunately, this results in tensions between adjoining states and regions on the subject of environmental policy.
I believe the strategy for the Danube region would provide an excellent basis for resolving these issues.
