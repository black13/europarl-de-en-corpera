Mr President, it really is not that long ago that the rapporteur on the SWIFT agreement stood here in plenary and assured us that internal European transfer data would not be covered by the agreement.
That was not true, however, as we now know.
The reality, in fact, is that only SEPA transaction data are excluded from the agreement, while standard EU transfers and even express transfers via the SWIFTNet FIN are not.
It is thus proving to be the case that the SWIFT agreement will result in a major leaking of data and that one of the major arguments of the advocates of the SWIFT agreement has fallen apart.
Yet what does the European Parliament do now?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing!
There is no outcry, just an attempt to brush this new information under the carpet.
This is in stark contrast to events in the German Parliament.
There has already been a debate in the German Parliament and I also received an email today from the Social Democratic Party of Germany which very clearly argued that the European Parliament must be active in this area.
That is exactly what I want to call on Parliament to do.
I believe it is very important for us to stop this mass data transfer and to re-start the negotiations.
