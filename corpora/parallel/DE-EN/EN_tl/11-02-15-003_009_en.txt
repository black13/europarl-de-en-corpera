Mr President, the first reading should be the exception.
In this case, it was possible because we came to a compromise between the proposals of the Commission, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the most controversial topic.
The fact that we went into the negotiations with a common negotiating mandate from all the groups is the only thing which enabled us to produce this result.
I would like to thank Mr Callanan in particular for the commitment he has shown.
We can be proud of what we have achieved.
The result is identical in many areas to the proposal made by the Industry Committee.
I believe that we have launched an ambitious project which is achievable for industry and which will, in particular, give users the opportunity to buy affordable, modern vehicles with lower CO2 emissions.
This applies specifically to small and medium-sized businesses, tradespeople, retailers and micro-enterprises which use this type of vehicle.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
There is an item in my dossier for the Industry Committee which was not incorporated, but which nevertheless was adopted with a narrow majority.
It concerns the proposal for speed limiters.
This is now a matter for the Member States, which will have to establish their own regulations.
Overall, we are therefore pleased with the compromise.
The Industry Committee is prepared to support the entire package.
