Mr President, today, I am representing Mrs Weisgerber, our shadow rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, who is on maternity leave.
We all send her our very best wishes.
She has done an excellent job on this dossier.
Overall, we are all pleased with the compromise.
It was not as difficult to achieve as in the case of cars, because this is not such an emotional subject.
Nevertheless, we faced major environmental and economic challenges.
From a climate policy perspective, it is important that the load is distributed evenly along all the links in the chain and this link must make its contribution.
However, we also had to ensure that we did not grind so much off this link that we caused it to break.
What do I mean by that?
Of course, the costs involved in measures of this kind for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent a significant challenge for them.
Small businesses will be considering very carefully whether it is worthwhile replacing their old vehicle and investing in a new one.
Therefore, we had to focus less on the technical aspects and more on the economic ones.
In technical terms, we could have achieved a great deal more, but the costs would definitely have been passed on to the SMEs and that would not have produced the desired results.
We will have to wait for a few years to find out whether this regulation is a good one, because that will only be the case if we actually reach the required emission levels.
If we end up imposing fines, then we will not have achieved our objective.
We must keep a very close eye on how the situation develops.
