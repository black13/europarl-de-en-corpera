Mr President, in the discussion about whether or not it is sensible to come to an agreement during the first reading, we should not stick as closely to our principles as some Members have recommended.
This should depend on the dossier.
How are the discussions going?
How controversial are they?
In the case of the regulation of CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles, it is clear that the positions of the institutions were not very far apart.
Therefore, it would not have been worthwhile to start the second reading process, except in the case of an issue which is the subject of heated discussions, in other words, the long-term target.
The European Commission has never explained properly and it is also not clear from the impact assessments how a reduction in emissions from 203 grams today to 135 grams within 10 years - these are the figures just mentioned by Mrs Hedegaard - can be implemented in an economically viable way.
This represents a cut of 34% and goes far beyond our other climate targets.
Parliament's most important job was to bring this target back to reality and to make it feasible in economic terms.
This is what we have done.
I am pleased that Mr Groote took up my argument, because a fleet average of 147 grams is a long way from what the Commission originally proposed, but it is also by far the most ambitious target set anywhere in the world.
We should not try to persuade ourselves that a CO2 limit for light commercial vehicles will save the world's climate.
I would like to thank everyone, including the rapporteurs, for their hard work.
I am pleased that we have achieved a large majority for this compromise.
