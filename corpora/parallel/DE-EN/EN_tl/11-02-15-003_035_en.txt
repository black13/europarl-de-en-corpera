Mr President, Mrs Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, we are not here today to hold a discussion on the climate.
Instead, we simply need to do what is possible.
I welcome the compromise that has been reached.
By restricting emissions to 147 grams per kilometre from 2020, we are setting very clear standards.
This will create incentives for the development of new technologies to increase energy efficiency and combat climate change.
The users of the vehicles will also benefit from these innovations, which will save them fuel and therefore money.
Small vans are primarily used by tradespeople, small and medium-sized companies, farmers and winegrowers.
They generally only travel short distances and are often driven for many years until the company is passed on to the next owner.
Therefore, the costs of these vehicles must remain manageable.
Higher investment costs must be funded on the basis of energy efficiency and energy savings.
The long-term goal of 2020 leaves enough time for transition periods so that research organisations and the industry can develop and manufacture new engines.
The target which we have set for ourselves is realistic, achievable and still efficient.
I hope that it will receive broad support.
