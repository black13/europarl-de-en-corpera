Mr President, Mrs Hedegaard, I cannot conceal the fact that I am one of those people who would much rather have adopted a target of 135 grams today.
However, I believe that this compromise reflects reality and shows that we are prepared to make a serious joint effort to limit and reduce CO2 emissions.
The European Union has recently succeeded in reducing overall CO2 emissions by 9%.
However, emissions in the transport sector have increased by almost 30%.
Purely from this perspective, I believe that the move we are making today is another step in the right direction.
However, we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the fact that the real problems in the transport sector lie elsewhere, given the overall increase of 29%.
In other words, we need to focus heavily on developing public transport.
We must not increase the burdens on small and medium-sized companies.
Instead, we must make things easier for commuters and speed up the construction of railways.
We will achieve much more by moving from individual transport to public transport.
I think we are taking the first step in the right direction because, after all, we are talking about a reduction of 25%.
