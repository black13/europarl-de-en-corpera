Mr President, Mrs Gy≈ëri, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Cancian in particular for his hard work, because this was not a straightforward dossier, but we have reached a good conclusion.
Compromises obviously always have their advantages and disadvantages.
Some people will think that we have gone too far and others that we have not gone far enough.
The process in the Council was not easy and, therefore, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council for enabling us to reach a compromise at the last minute.
I think the scope of the report is correct.
We have said that three countries are not directly affected.
However, because Luxembourg is involved in a cross-border context, there are actually only two countries which the regulations do not affect directly.
In the case of local public transport, it will be easy to include provisions in the requirement specifications for tenders which state that passengers' rights must be respected and reinforced.
Therefore, it is not realistic to criticise us for excluding local transport.
This can be dealt with at a regional level.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will give its overall support to this compromise.
We see passengers' rights as a complete package and we hope that it will be possible in the near future to produce a consolidated version covering the whole area, so that we can soon put in place rights which will benefit the citizens rather than the lawyers.
In my view, there are still a number of problems, particularly with regard to the implementation, where the regulations are not useful to citizens and where they are not clear enough to establish passengers' rights.
Against this background, I would like to thank everyone involved for their hard work.
I hope that we can achieve a large majority in plenary in support of this healthy compromise.
