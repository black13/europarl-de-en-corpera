Mr President, a long procedure has now come to an end, which is good news.
There are some positive aspects to all of this.
One is that the basic rights for people with disabilities include the right to information and the right to access.
Another positive feature is that the damages paid by small and medium-sized businesses have been kept to a reasonable level, which was not originally the case.
It is also good that we have reached an agreement, because otherwise, we would have been stuck in the conciliation procedure and there would have been no regulations at all covering one specific area of transport.
However, I would also like to pick up on some negative points, as we have not been able to produce a genuine European solution.
Although we say that the free movement of people, goods and services is a European principle, we have not reached a European solution in this area, if three countries are not included and other countries do not have bus routes of this length.
The right of people with disabilities to be accompanied, which is something they often need in order to be able to travel, is only guaranteed over long distances.
In addition, the clause on major natural disasters, which does not apply to air travel, because damages had to be paid in the case of the ash cloud, has been applied to buses and coaches.
This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights.
That, of course, is not a good thing.
Therefore, because of this mix of positive and negative features, we abstained from voting during the midnight session in the conciliation procedure and we will do the same today.
