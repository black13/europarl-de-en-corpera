Mr President, despite the EU being a signatory to the relevant convention, the rights of people with reduced mobility are not taken into consideration in this dossier.
I have mentioned this at the beginning of my comments on this report, because I think its most serious failing is the fact that we have always included the restriction 'if possible'.
Unfortunately, I am sufficiently familiar with these situations to be able to say that this 'if possible' generally results in it not being possible to provide an efficient solution for people with reduced mobility.
I was particularly disappointed when a restriction was placed on the formats used to make information available about bus and coach travel.
This has also been toned down, so that people with reduced mobility cannot even find out about where they can get assistance and so on.
There are other problems resulting from the last round of negotiations, which Mr Cancian has really put his heart into, and I would like to thank him for that.
He has made every effort to produce a good result, but his attempts have been blocked by the Council's hard-hearted approach.
Another aspect is the distance of 250 kilometres which has already been mentioned.
I am afraid that longer routes will be divided up and that routes of 500 kilometres will be broken down into two parts, so that there is no risk of having to grant passengers their rights.
This must be taken into consideration during the implementation process.
One good feature was the introduction of an arbitration body, which will be helpful for consumers.
Other positive aspects include the fact that the principle of constant improvement applies and that training will be provided for staff.
However, in other respects, ladies and gentlemen, this is by no means a masterpiece of European legislation.
