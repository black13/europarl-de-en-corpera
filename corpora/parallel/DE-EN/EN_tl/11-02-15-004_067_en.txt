Madam President, improving the rights of passengers on regular bus and coach services is a desirable goal.
However, some points in the proposal go too far.
For example, passengers are entitled to up to two nights in a hotel if the departure of a regular bus service is delayed by more than 90 minutes.
However, road transport is often subject to factors which are outside the control of the individual bus operators, such as traffic jams caused by accidents, poor weather conditions and inadequate snow clearance.
The consequences of this will be costly liability cases where it will not be possible to apply the principle that the party responsible is liable for the damages.
The most recent EU regulation on rail passengers' rights is in a similar position.
Companies now have to pay for delays which they have not caused.
For example, the Austrian federal railway company is liable for the number of hours that trains are delayed, which amounted to a total of 2 800 last year, when they arrive very late from Germany.
We must avoid inappropriate measures like this in future.
