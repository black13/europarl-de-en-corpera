Madam President, it is a good thing that we now have passengers' rights across all means of transport, but these rights cannot conceal the fact that rail transport, which is environmentally friendly, has once again been put at a severe disadvantage.
The railway companies pay track access charges for every kilometre travelled, but the same system does not apply to buses and coaches, which benefits bus companies.
Railways are included in the Emissions Trading System, but buses are not, which again puts buses at an advantage and trains at a disadvantage.
If a train is delayed, 25% of the fare is repaid in compensation after an hour.
In the case of buses, it is two hours.
All these advantages are unacceptable.
This is why we need an integrated approach.
We need passengers' rights across all the different means of transport, but we also need fair basic conditions.
It must not be the case that one passenger only receives compensation after three or five hours, but for another passenger, the period is one hour.
A great deal remains to be done here and this is not a good compromise in this respect.
I do not understand why environmentally friendly rail travel is constantly being put at a disadvantage.
