Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is important, alongside our wide-ranging cooperation in the field of business and in the face of global challenges, as has already been said, that we keep the subject of the rule of law on the agenda in all our discussions with Russia.
In recent weeks, we have discussed the stability of the Mediterranean region on many occasions and we have defined what the concept of stability does not consist of, namely, authoritarian structures.
At the same time, this means that for Russia, stability cannot be based on political influence over the courts or the persecution of journalists and of people who stand up in support of human rights.
Therefore, from my point of view, it is always the right time to discuss this issue.
I hope that we can make it clear to Russia during the course of the practical relationships which we will be entering into in the near future that it is putting its own future at risk if it does not establish the rule of law.
