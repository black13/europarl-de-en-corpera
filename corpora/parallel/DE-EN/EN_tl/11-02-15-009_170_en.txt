Madam President, I have voted in favour of the report, because it represents a significant improvement in the current situation.
We have been able to achieve a balanced solution which protects the rights of bus passengers and guarantees the continuing existence of small and medium-sized operators.
The regulation covers journeys of more than 250 kilometres and gives bus and coach passengers the right to claim compensation if journeys are cancelled, overbooked or delayed by more than two hours.
Bus operators are often small or medium-sized companies which would be brought to the brink of ruin by excessive claims for damages.
This is one successful feature of the regulation which will ensure that compensation payments cannot get out of hand.
As far as the distance of 250 kilometres is concerned, there is no reason why we should not allow the new legislation to come into effect and then see how it can be improved.
