Madam President, the European Parliament has succeeded in putting in place an ambitious, long-term target in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission, which will restrict the CO2 emissions of small vans to a maximum of 147 grams per kilometre by 2020.
This ambitious and yet realistic limit can be achieved by means of innovative environmental technology.
The vehicles will be considerably cleaner, but they will remain affordable for small and medium-sized companies.
This was particularly important for us, because it will not help climate change if the price of new vehicles is so prohibitive that the old vans remain on our roads and, in particular, remain a burden on the environment.
I am pleased that we have voted on this motion today and that it has been adopted with an overwhelming majority.
