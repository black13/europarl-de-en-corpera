I support the conclusion of the agreement between the EU and South Africa to extend bilateral cooperation.
In addition to consolidating the rule of law, important measures will be taken to combat terrorism and terrorist financing and to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction.
The overwhelming support of the European Parliament for the agreement will lead to improvements in working conditions and in the healthcare system and to the reduction of poverty in South Africa.
