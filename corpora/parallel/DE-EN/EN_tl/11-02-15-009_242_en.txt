The recommendation concerns the conclusion of an agreement with Schengen-associated third countries, in this case, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
They are to be involved in implementing, applying and developing the Schengen acquis.
Supplementary regulations are needed in this respect to protect the financial interests of the EU and to give auditing powers to the Court of Auditors.
These additions are sensible, which is why I have voted in favour of concluding the agreement.
