I was pleased to be able to vote in favour of the accession of Liechtenstein to the agreement on the EU asylum system.
This will prevent multiple asylum applications from being made in the EU and in Liechtenstein.
If an asylum application is rejected in Liechtenstein, it will also be rejected in the EU and vice versa.
At the same time as simplifying the procedure, we have also achieved further harmonisation.
