It is of major significance for the common European internal market that the Member States implement the Services Directive quickly and effectively.
It is particularly important for small and medium-sized businesses which want to be able to offer their services across national borders to have a point of single contact that can provide them with essential information and explain the necessary procedures.
More than a year has now passed since the deadline for the Member States to implement the Services Directive.
It does not make much sense for us to continue discussing the numerous amendments.
It would be more useful to investigate the implementation process more closely.
Although some Member States have already taken the necessary measures, others seem to have forgotten about the document that they signed.
Therefore, we must ensure that the directive is implemented immediately and correctly in all 27 Member States, in order to simplify the process of providing services in other countries as quickly as possible.
