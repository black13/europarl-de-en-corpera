I have voted in favour of the report on implementing the Services Directive because I believe it to be very balanced.
It focuses on assessing the practical difficulties and makes specific proposals on resolving them.
I come from a country where the Services Directive has not been implemented in national law.
I believe it is essential that the directive is implemented and it must be accompanied by measures to prevent the introduction of cheap labour and social dumping.
In my opinion, it is also important that the report on implementing the Services Directive highlights the areas which have been deliberately omitted, such as social and healthcare services.
This must be followed down to the last full stop during the implementation process.
