In the EU, the service sector is responsible for around 70% of GDP.
In some countries, such as Austria, where I come from, this sector is an engine of economic growth.
The aim of the directive is to remove unreasonable obstacles to the provision of cross-border services.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular are frequently confronted with bureaucratic barriers and discrimination which prevent them from benefiting fully from the common internal market.
The directive takes into consideration the specific social circumstances of the individual Member States.
Strengthening the control options in the destination country represents an important step forward.
However, we need to put in place quickly a mechanism for imposing effective sanctions on foreign service providers which break the law.
I have voted in favour of Mrs Gebhardt's report, because I hope that the implementation of the Services Directive will provide a new stimulus for the labour market.
