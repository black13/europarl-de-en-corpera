I have abstained today, because I was not able to support the compromise that has been negotiated.
It falls short of what is needed and 147 grams is not a sufficiently ambitious long-term target.
However, I have not voted against the report, because the compromise will be implemented quickly and will enable the necessary innovations to be introduced rapidly.
Strict environmental standards will not harm the industry.
On the contrary, only challenging targets will generate the necessary pressure to innovate and this is the only way in which our industry will remain at the cutting edge.
The watering down of the long-term target in particular demonstrates to me that the automotive industry has not learnt from the legislation on CO2 limits for cars introduced two years ago that it will only be able to sell clean cars in the future.
The car industry does not seem to credit its customers with much common sense.
Instead of research into new technologies, the industry has put all its efforts into combating the proposed regulations.
It has exploited every single line of defence and has shown no inclination to take part in constructive cooperation.
This is disappointing.
In addition, we have once again missed the chance of making it clear that by protecting our industry in this way, we are not doing it any good.
The future is calling, but we are not listening.
Only yesterday, VW presented its 1 litre car at the Detroit Motor Show, which shows just what is possible.
