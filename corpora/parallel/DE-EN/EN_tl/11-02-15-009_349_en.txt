Reducing the CO2 emissions of all forms of transport, including small commercial vehicles, is a desirable objective.
It is important to set limits in order to encourage vehicle manufacturers to take an ambitious approach.
The agreement on the limits is due, among other things, to the negotiating skills of the Belgian Presidency.
This compromise includes the short-term goal of reducing emissions to 175 grams per kilometre by 2014.
In addition, there will be a gradual, step-by-step reduction in order to achieve a long-term target of 147 grams per kilometre by 2020.
These targets are accompanied by measures which provide incentives for the industry to manufacture energy-efficient commercial vehicles.
Achieving these targets will not only benefit the small and medium-sized companies which are the main users of vans and delivery trucks, but also private individuals and, most importantly, the environment.
In future, we will be able to play our part not only at EU level, but also on the world market, if we can produce safe and clean vehicles.
In addition, we must not allow our expertise to be exported to other countries, such as China, as a result of delays in EU policy making.
Instead, we must take this as an opportunity to put in place a sustainable European environment policy, which will have a positive impact not only on Europe as an industrial location, but also on employment.
I welcome this compromise and have therefore supported it.
