In order to be able to achieve a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, manufacturers need to redesign vehicles so that they do not exceed a specific level in future.
The measures which seem technically feasible in the case of cars may not necessarily be achievable for light commercial vehicles.
As it is not really possible to change the shape of the vehicles, the engineers will have to focus on the engine and the mechanical components, which, according to the experts, is a long-winded process.
For this reason, we need to find alternative solutions which will lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles.
There are currently two possible options.
One is to increase the reduction for cars, in order to compensate for the emissions from commercial vehicles.
The other is to fit a speed limiter, which would also result in a significant fall in emissions.
I did not vote in favour of the report because, in my opinion, it offers too few options.
