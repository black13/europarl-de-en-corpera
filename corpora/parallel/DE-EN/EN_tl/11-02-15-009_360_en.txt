I have not voted in favour of Mr Callanan's report, despite the fact that it is well-founded and represents a move in the right direction.
However, I am of the opinion that the CO2 emission limits per kilometre should be much more ambitious.
Therefore, I support the Commission's proposal of 135 grams of CO2 per kilometre.
The combination of emission pools, which manufacturers can create across their entire product range, and a speed limit of 120 km/h, would make this target achievable, although it would require serious efforts to be made.
At the same time, we should not allow any of these deadlines to be postponed for the sake of the environment.
We should stick with 2014.
