Today, I have voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation with regard to unitary patent protection because I believe that the deadlock in the Council as a result of the language arrangements is unjustified.
In my opinion, there is, of course, an important need for discussion.
For me, voting in favour does not mean that I agree in full with the contents of the Commission's initial proposals.
We will give priority to this issue in the Committee on Legal Affairs and will definitely table amendments with a large number of improvements.
I would like to explain that those who believe that today's vote will result in Parliament losing its rights are mistaken.
The legislative procedure is only just beginning.
By voting today, Parliament was simply giving permission for a group of Member States to start the enhanced cooperation procedure, which was only made possible by the Treaty of Lisbon.
The remainder of the procedure will involve a) Parliament being consulted about the language arrangements (the decision in this case must be made by the Council), b) Parliament taking part in deciding on the content of the patent regulation as part of the ordinary legislative procedure, c) Parliament's consent being obtained for the patent jurisdiction.
There will be no change in any of these opportunities for Parliament to participate in the process.
Even those Members of the European Parliament from Member States which are not involved in the enhanced cooperation will not lose their right to vote during the remainder of the procedure, because they are European and not national representatives.
