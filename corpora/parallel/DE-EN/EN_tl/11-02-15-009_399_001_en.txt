In the case of a nuclear accident or any other kind of radiological emergency, it is essential that the proper action is taken.
Preventive measures and aid for those affected are important.
Compensation payments for farmers are vital in order to help producers of agricultural products who have suffered damages through no fault of their own.
Farmers in one Member State who are affected by contamination from an accident of this kind in another Member State must also be compensated.
The effects of nuclear accidents must not be allowed to put the livelihoods of farmers at risk.
I support Mr Belet's report, because we must guarantee protection for farmers from damages caused by external third parties.
