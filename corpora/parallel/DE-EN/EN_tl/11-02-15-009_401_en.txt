Radioactive contamination can represent a problem over a number of years in some foods.
The difficulty arises when contaminated foodstuffs, such as wild produce from the forests in areas that have been exposed to radioactivity for centuries, are not only consumed locally, but are also sold in otherwise uncontaminated areas, where they are believed to be harmless.
Our current level of knowledge indicates that there are no levels of radiation that can be classified as harmless with any absolute degree of certainty.
Research into the cause of a wide range of new forms of illness, such as allergies, is still in its infancy.
Despite this fact, foodstuffs are still being irradiated and no one has considered the question of possible interaction with genetic engineering.
All of the limits are ultimately useless if the checks on foodstuffs in and around contaminated regions are not functioning properly.
I have taken these considerations into account when voting.
