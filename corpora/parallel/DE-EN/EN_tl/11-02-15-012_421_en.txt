Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has only been in existence for a short time.
However, it is now going to be modified for the second time in just a few months because of what is alleged to be an urgent matter.
As a result, the Treaty modification will not follow the democratic process laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
Instead, it will be decided by means of the fast-track procedure.
We have seen how this procedure was used to allow the rescue packages for the banks, amounting to billions of euro, to bypass Parliament.
Now the Council is once again under time pressure and many Heads of Government want the new Treaty modification to be implemented using the supposedly tried and tested fast-track procedure.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left opposes this approach, which is threatening to become a standard process, and is calling for Treaty modifications to be managed using the normal procedure, including the convention, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
