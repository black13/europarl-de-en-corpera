Mr President, on the one hand, it is important that the Member States are in control of the treaties, which is why the modification must take place at this level.
On the other hand, we are faced with the question which is implicit in many of the questions that I have attempted to address.
Are we reflecting carefully on this, are we taking enough time and being allowed enough time to discuss everything in detail?
Or are people's expectations so high and the pressure of the global challenges so great that we need to be quicker and to act more quickly?
For this reason, I do not regard the issue of time as a problem, but we do need to provide answers.
We must focus on that.
