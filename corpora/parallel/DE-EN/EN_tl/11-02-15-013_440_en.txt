Mr President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, asylum policy is a highly topical issue, as we have recently discovered in Lampedusa and in Greece.
It is a subject that concerns the people of Europe.
We should be proud of what we have achieved in Europe, including our common standards, the proper processing of asylum applications and our way of dealing with children and families.
We should be proud of all of this.
Europe is an area which offers help and partnership to people suffering persecution all over the world.
However, the decisive factor is not what we put on paper in Parliament's committees, in the Commission and in the Council, but what actually happens on the ground.
Belgium and Greece have recently been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for not implementing and not adhering to existing legislation.
This makes it clear that the enforcement process is not working.
I would like to ask the Commission to make faster progress, alongside its existing action plans.
We need to be able to put in place and implement the important standards more quickly within the European Union.
In the specific case of Greece, I would like to point out that we have a border that can be secured from both sides.
I am disappointed in the way our partner, Turkey, has behaved in this respect.
We have signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which requires the country to do far less than it would have to if it were a member of the European Union.
Therefore, I think we should expect Turkey to make a greater effort in this area.
No one disputes our sense of solidarity.
We want to provide practical help in the form of the European Refugee Fund and Frontex, both in the case of Greece, where aid is already being provided, and in the case of Lampedusa in Italy.
European solidarity is not being called into question.
It is needed now more than it ever has been.
