Mr President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, we are talking today about the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights.
This is ultimately about Belgium, but it concerns every Member State of the European Union.
Germany has also decided no longer to send asylum seekers back to Greece.
As one of my fellow Members has mentioned, we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum, something which I, as a Liberal, strongly support.
However, this also means that we must give every asylum seeker the chance of a properly organised process.
We must realise that it is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity if we allow the southern countries to bear the entire burden alone.
Because of their geographical position, these countries have been exposed to an increased influx of refugees.
In Lampedusa, this is because of current events in Tunisia.
However, this is also an ongoing situation which the local asylum authorities cannot cope with.
The recent liberalisation with regard to Kosovo also resulted in a huge influx of asylum seekers into Germany just a few weeks ago.
We also had the problem that we could not initially process all the applications properly.
Therefore, if we really want to retain this right to asylum, we must restructure the system to ensure that it offers greater solidarity in future.
Dublin II cannot continue in its current form.
