Mr President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, we definitely do not need walls to resolve the asylum problem.
A proposal was made to erect a wall, which is why I have chosen to speak.
Anyone who says something of this kind has completely failed to understand European values.
For us, this is all about protecting fundamental rights and human rights.
We cannot say about people who have fled from their country and sought asylum in Europe, for whatever reason, and about people who have voluntarily climbed into an overcrowded boat and put their lives at risk: 'We want to send these people back before they have even arrived'.
We need sensible asylum processes for these people which function properly.
We cannot leave the southern European countries, where these people arrive, to cope with the problem alone.
I agree completely with my colleague, Mrs Hirsch, on that point.
From another perspective, it is wrong to say that we want all these people to stay outside Europe and we do not want to take them in.
Demographic change is taking place in Europe and in future, we will need integration and also asylum seekers who want to stay here.
This is not just an issue of humanity, but also of common sense.
For this reason, we need to come up with solutions to this problem quickly.
