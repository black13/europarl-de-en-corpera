Mr President, according to the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights, the asylum system in Greece is inhumane.
This is because it can take up to five years to come to a final decision.
However, the procedures all over Europe take a long time, because lies are being told, papers are being burnt or forged, decisions are ignored and the asylum system is quite simply being exploited and abused.
This is particularly true where there is no real reason for asylum and, after a process lasting years, the applicant suddenly claims the right of residence on humanitarian grounds.
In the light of the failed EU asylum system, we must finally be honest and admit that the EU cannot accept economic migrants from all over the world, particularly when, at the same time, it is spending billions of euro on development aid and support for democracy in the countries where these people come from.
We finally need a clear definition of the right to asylum, which is closely linked to the Geneva Convention, in order to bring an end to economic migration.
It must also include an obligation on the part of the asylum seekers to cooperate in the procedure.
This will remove the legal basis for deception on humanitarian grounds.
