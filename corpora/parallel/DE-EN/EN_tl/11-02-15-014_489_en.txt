Mr President, the last huge influx of refugees, similar to what we are now seeing as a result of the Tunisian revolution, was probably in 1989 following the collapse of communism.
The EU has learnt nothing from its past experience.
It was taken completely by surprise by the stream of refugees.
Now, with the arrival of all those people who do not want to roll up their sleeves and rebuild their own country, Italy is being called on not to send back the Tunisian economic migrants.
However, that is exactly the problem.
As long as these people are not returned to their home country immediately, without repatriation aid, we will constantly be overwhelmed by waves of economic migrants.
Tens of thousands of them are already waiting in the neighbouring countries.
Mass amnesties and generous offers to overlook the fact that the majority of them are merely economic migrants have simply led, in the past, to a new influx of asylum seekers.
If we introduce quotas for asylum procedures, instead of sending the migrants back immediately, we are just creating incentives for similar behaviour in the future.
