Madam President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, we were all pleased, as were the citizens of Europe, about the revolution in Egypt and Tunisia and the fact that values such as freedom and democracy were suddenly on the agenda.
Images from these countries have dominated the news over the last few days.
However, for two or three days, we have also been seeing pictures of the streams of refugees and people in boats on our television screens and in our newspapers.
We must act quickly to ensure that we do not miss this historic moment and that it is not only the pictures of refugees which remain in our memories.
We must remember what these countries have really achieved.
We must explain to the public that although a lot of people are coming here, the majority of them will go back, because they have no right to asylum as we define it.
Of course, we have to ask ourselves the question which is frequently posed about economic migrants.
One thing is clear.
If these young people have no future prospects, they will come back.
Perhaps not the same people, but constant streams of new migrants.
This is why we need to deal with this problem now.
