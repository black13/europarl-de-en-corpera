Madam President, we have had two reports from two committees which recommend applying Solvency II to occupational pension systems.
In my opinion, this simply will not work.
In countries such as France, they have experience of this, but not in other Member States of the European Union.
We should investigate this issue in detail.
We will have the chance, when we consider the White Paper and discuss it in depth, to convince everyone of this, because many people do not have the relevant experience and have not yet come across this in their own countries.
This is a good opportunity for us to do the groundwork.
