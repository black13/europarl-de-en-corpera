Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prosperity of a country is created through the work of its people.
In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid.
People want proper, secure pensions in their old age.
One clear message from the crisis is that only public and state pensions are reliable and stable.
In contrast, occupational and private pension funds have lost millions of euro on the stock exchange.
It is ridiculous to increase the focus on private, capital-based pension systems when providing for people's retirement.
The public has financed the rescue packages for the major banks.
The people are paying for a tough austerity policy which is under the control of the European Union.
Now, they are supposed to turn around national budgets by taking cuts in their pensions and accepting a higher retirement age.
Previous pension reforms are already leading to increasing poverty in old age.
The only solution is to strengthen the reliable public pension systems.
