Madam President, the population pyramid in the EU will soon be turned upside down and the over 55 age group will represent the largest proportion of the population.
Life expectancy will continue to increase and the birth rate will remain low.
Young people will be starting work later and later.
We are all aware of the consequences of this: an ageing population and an increasing number of bottlenecks when it comes to the financing of pensions.
What we need is a family-friendly policy in Europe, such as the introduction of family tax splitting for income tax or equivalent social measures, which take into account the contribution that the family makes to the intergenerational contract by reducing the burden of taxes on families.
In addition, we need to create incentives to keep older people in work for as long as possible.
I would like to give Mr Andor a clear message.
The very popular policy of mass immigration is the wrong way to go about safeguarding our pensions and it also ultimately puts social peace in Europe at risk.
