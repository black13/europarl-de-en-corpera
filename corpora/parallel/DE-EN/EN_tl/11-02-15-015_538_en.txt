Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, pensions throughout Europe must provide enough money for people to live on.
One important requirement is that people have decent jobs, because low paid jobs result in poverty in old age and inadequate pension provision.
When I hear other Members of this House saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age, I want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn, never mind paying for an additional private pension.
This is why the first pillar of the pension system is of particular importance.
The pay-as-you-go system based on the solidarity principle must form the foundation of European pensions and it must provide enough for people to live on.
We cannot simply say that this is a matter for the Member States.
We must send out a clear signal that we need pensions which give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life.
Mr Mann gave a detailed description of the German occupational pension system.
I would like to mention it too, without going into the same level of detail.
In my assessment of the Green Paper, I have come to the same conclusion, which is why we worked on the amendments together in committee.
Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to ensure that, in everything which we do in future, the distinctive features of each country - the things that really work well and are essential for the survival of the pension systems in the Member States - are not disregarded.
