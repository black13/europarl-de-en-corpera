Madam President, Mr Andor, I would like to ask whether it makes sense to respond to this debate and this report with a White Paper.
Should we not instead be attempting to resolve the really urgent problems?
In my view, there are two issues: one is the fact that there is a huge gap between the actual retirement age and the state retirement age.
This means that the anti-discrimination measures really need to be put into effect, in the form of action or monitoring by the Commission to improve the situation, because that will make pensions sustainable.
The other is that the report clearly calls for action to be taken now on the portability of occupational pensions, which means considering a new directive.
This is much more urgent, because workers who move from one company to another lose a lot of money on their pensions, which would give them security in their old age.
This is why we need to take steps in this area.
With the White Paper, we are just wasting time.
