Some of the subjects in the Commission's initiative on this Green Paper seem to me to be particularly important.
I see it as our duty to prevent older citizens in particular, who have helped to build up our current levels of prosperity during their working lives, from ending up in a vulnerable situation in their old age.
At the same time, the report takes proper account of the subsidiarity principle.
The Commission should make a clearer call for equality between men and women.
Women more often have atypical employment contracts than men.
Their pensions are often smaller and, therefore, they are at greater risk of suffering poverty in old age.
Appropriate and secure pension systems represent long-term intergenerational contracts.
Therefore, I would like to encourage the Commission to use the Green Paper to launch initiatives which generate greater public awareness of the solidarity between the generations on the subject of pension provision.
