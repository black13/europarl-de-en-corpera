Madam President, Europe is rightly regarded as having the safest medicines in the world.
With this legislation, which we have been discussing for a long time, for two years I believe, we will further improve levels of safety.
I would like to thank Mrs Matias very much for taking on such a complex report as a new Member of Parliament.
This was a huge task and she has done very well.
It also involved a great deal of teamwork and I would like to thank everyone involved for this.
We have produced some very good results.
However, we must not lose sight of the fact that we can never achieve complete safety by means of regulations.
This is true in every area, not just in the case of medicines.
We have rightly concentrated on the essential issues, on the distinctions between different types of packaging and on traceability in the distribution chain.
By differentiating between prescription and over-the-counter medicines, we are taking the right approach, because we must remember that every piece of legislation and every attempt to make products safer costs money.
Therefore, it is reasonable not to include every pack of aspirins or every over-the-counter medicine automatically right from the start.
Instead, the Commission or the agency must be given the task of monitoring the market and investigating developments.
I believe that we can be proud of what we have achieved.
We have produced a piece of legislation that brings real benefits.
Most patients will probably not be aware that they are the result of EU law and, therefore, we must make this very clear.
