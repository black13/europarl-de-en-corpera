Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Matias.
My thanks go also to Mrs GrossetÃªte, the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
The two of them have done excellent groundwork on this directive during the last parliamentary term.
The falsification of medicines is a growing problem.
The number of cases identified amounted to 7.5 million in 2009, which is many more than in previous years.
These are only those cases that have come to light.
There is a large number of unreported incidents, which is why we can only assume that the problem is a major one.
It is very irritating if lifestyle medicines are found to contain no active ingredients.
However, if essential medicines used to treat cancer, for example, contain no active ingredients, the wrong ingredients or the wrong dosage, this can put patients' lives at risk.
This is why action was urgently needed.
We have taken a reasonable approach.
The subject of data protection is a highly sensitive one and we have found the right balance.
We are acting on the basis of the risks involved and focusing initially on prescription medicines.
There is an opt-out procedure available, if there is reason to assume that there is no risk.
There is also an opt-in process for over-the-counter medicines, if there is reason to assume that they have been falsified.
Overall, this is a very good compromise and I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone involved.
