Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteurs who have done an excellent job.
Initially, we had a very heated discussion on this subject.
However, the MEDI-FAKE action in December 2008 may have had an impact in this area.
During the course of two months, 34 million falsified tablets were seized on the European Union's external borders.
This was a warning which prompted us to speed up our work.
We have now produced results that we can be really satisfied with.
We have guaranteed the traceability of medicines.
Every pharmacist can identify using a scanner whether a product is falsified or genuine.
However, I would like to make one request.
It is true that websites are now being monitored and that they have a logo, although this can also be forged, but in the case of sales over the Internet, we need to do some public relations work to explain the risks of Internet purchases to the citizens of Europe.
I am very pleased that parallel trade has been retained.
It has a worse reputation than it actually deserves and its position has been guaranteed.
I would like to make one final point.
We should perhaps consider, for the safety of citizens and to improve understanding, whether it would be a good idea to deal with the problem of widely differing pack sizes in different countries in order to introduce a standardised solution.
