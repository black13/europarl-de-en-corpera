Mr President, Mr Füle, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank you very much for your clear statement.
I believe that it has been well received.
I think that developments in the fields of democracy and the rule of law are essential requirements for the start of Albania's accession process to the EU.
This includes functioning democratic institutions which are used properly.
The parliament is the place where democratic debates should take place.
This is why the citizens have elected the members of the parliament.
This forum cannot be replaced by events on the streets and particularly not in the way in which Mr Rama attempted to do on 21 January.
I call on the socialist party to take full part in the parliamentary process and to come up with political alternatives in parliament.
It is time to bring an end to the doubts about the election result.
The socialist party should take responsibility for its role as parliamentary opposition.
It should make use of the opportunity to produce specific proposals for the future, including in the parliamentary investigation committee.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) have produced recommendations for improving the basic conditions of elections.
It is also important for the socialists to be involved in this area too.
I have heard that Mr Rama agreed, while he was here in Strasbourg, to take part in the local elections on 8 May.
I welcome his decision.
I hope that his assurance does not involve any conditions or loopholes.
Mr Rama is obviously listening to the good advice given to him by his socialist colleagues and also in the meetings with other groups.
I can assure him that many people in our group are playing an active role on our behalf in Albania and support the inclusive approach referred to by Mr Füle.
This has enabled us to make a joint contribution to ensuring a positive future for Albania.
