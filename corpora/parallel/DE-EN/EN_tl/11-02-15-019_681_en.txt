Mr President, Mr Piebalgs, I have followed this debate and the debate on Albania very closely.
What a difference!
In that debate, efforts were made to maintain a polite, friendly tone across party boundaries.
Here, insinuations have been made which are completely unproven.
There, the aim was to bring the two major parties together.
Here, the objective of one of them is to drive a wedge between the two parties.
There, the desire was for the two parties to come together and work together for the welfare of the people.
Here, it is unfortunately all about one part of Parliament prejudging the situation.
Why are you doing this?
Why have I not heard you state a single fact?
You have just used phrases such as 'It seems to be the case ... ' or 'We have been informed by certain sources ... ' or 'We have heard that ... '.
If that is how you see the situation, why do you not go to the relevant committees in Parliament?
Why do you not go to the Subcommittee on Security and Defence?
Why do you not ask the Commission questions?
Instead, you are pushing for a public debate because you want it to take place for political reasons.
We are opposed to this.
We do not understand why this debate is taking place at the expense of the Bulgarian Government and the Bulgarian people.
If there is something which needs to be discussed, I invite you to do so in the relevant committees.
It goes without saying for us that there must be the rule of law, a functioning justice system and appropriate parliamentary controls, in particular, in the case of sensitive issues like this instrument, all of which are the responsibility of a parliament which has been put in place by this government, which consists of representatives of all the parliamentary parties.
I am grateful to Mrs Malmstr√∂m for saying last week in Sofia that this is an internal matter and to the Commissioner for stating clearly that the Bulgarian Government has taken all the necessary steps.
