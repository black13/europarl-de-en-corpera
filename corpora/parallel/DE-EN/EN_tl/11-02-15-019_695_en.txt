Mr President, I would like to speak to you directly.
I find it regrettable that you do not make use of the blue card when we are all trying to make parliamentary debates more animated.
It would have significantly improved the quality of this debate.
If you are not listening to me, Mr President, then I do not need to continue.
This is simply futile.
This is what one Member of this House for a long time referred to as a karaoke parliament, where attempts to hold debates and to improve their quality are completely disregarded.
