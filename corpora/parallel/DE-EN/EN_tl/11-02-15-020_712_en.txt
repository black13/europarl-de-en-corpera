Mr President, in the 1970s and the early 1980s, the blindness of the World Bank to environmental issues was a major topic for discussion.
The same speeches were made then as are being made here today, together with certain promises by the World Bank.
Moves were made to reform the World Bank, but decades have passed since then.
For a wide variety of reasons, I recently made a visit to a number of countries which are generally referred to as developing countries.
The situation was unacceptable.
What has happened to all the projects?
Where are the solar plants in the tropics?
Where are the sustainable forests in the Amazon or in Vietnam?
Where are the solar panels and wind turbines in Kenya?
There is absolutely nothing there.
The only thing that has happened is that the European system of self-government has been copied exactly.
The people there are governing themselves and they have played into the hands of a few large interested parties, but they have not made any progress.
Then we are surprised when citizens of the developing countries say despairingly: 'I do not want to live in the Caribbean any more.
I want to move to the USA and get into the EU via Martinique'.
We are surprised when the people in the Maghreb countries all want to move here.
The hypocrisy of this debate is totally unbelievable.
We have to understand that millions of people have been radicalised.
They have simply said 'We have had enough!'.
Everyone who has seen the European Parliament motion for a resolution will have to admit that it could not have been that.
We should have spoken out much more loudly.
We should have called on the World Bank much more clearly to take the necessary action.
Why do we have all these committees - the Committee on Development, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and so on - if all they can produce is a scrappy little piece of paper that, in part, contains the conclusions of the debate which took place in the late 1970s?
The whole thing is embarrassing.
