Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Piebalgs in particular.
As a former Commissioner for energy, he naturally knows all about our strategy.
I believe that there is a lot to be done in the field of development cooperation, particularly with regard to technical aid.
Europe must not only make payments to the World Bank; it must also take action.
Europe and the European institutions must play a stronger role in the World Bank and it will be a major challenge to ensure that family businesses can be supported with development aid, that small and medium-sized energy generation enterprises can be promoted, because a lot of small businesses together can achieve economies of scale and produce a corresponding return on investment.
One of the most important issues is, of course, the storage of energy.
This will play a central role in development cooperation.
