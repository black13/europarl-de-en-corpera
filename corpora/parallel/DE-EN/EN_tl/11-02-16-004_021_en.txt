Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in fact now in the last round before accession, insofar as we are to discuss this matter here in the Community institutions, because then there still remains the ratification process in the national parliaments, which will certainly not be easy, either.
However, as I was able, during my time as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to closely observe the previous twelve Member States to join as part of the enlargement process, I can say that Croatia is a country that has done a considerable amount of work over a long period of time in order to fulfil the criteria and, for that reason, the progression to a 'yes' is a positive one.
We should support this for political reasons.
It is also a signal to other countries that may perhaps have to wait a long time until the door to Europe is open rather than, by and large, being closed.
The general political message is important.
However, based on our experiences with other countries, I would say that Croatia needs to work on reforming its judicial and administrative systems in its own interests, too - irrespective of the accession process.
When proceedings remain unresolved for too long or accusations of corruption are made but the proceedings taken against the accused take too long, it damages the overall development of the country.
More work ought to be done in this regard.
