Mr President, overall, developments in Croatia are going in the right direction.
The theory is complete, but it still needs to be proven in practice.
However, there are three areas where significant work still remains to be done.
Firstly, Croatia must work closer with the International Court of Justice in The Hague to speed up progress with regard to human rights and the prosecution of former war criminals.
As stated by Amnesty International in 'Behind a Wall of Silence', there are blatant individual cases of human rights violations that are still be dealt with.
The protection of human rights is a key issue for the EU.
We must not be prepared to compromise where this is concerned, and indeed we are not prepared to compromise where this is concerned.
Secondly, there is the corruption.
It still permeates society, industry and politics.
I welcome the efforts of the Croatian Government to tackle corruption in its own country, but at the same time we must insist that this problem is also rigorously pursued.
Thirdly, Croatia must ensure, in its own interests, that swift progress is now made with regard to the reforms initiated in the judicial system.
