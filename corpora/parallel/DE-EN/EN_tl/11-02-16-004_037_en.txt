Madam President, among the candidate countries, Croatia is known to be the country that has made the greatest amount of progress.
That is not surprising, as culturally and historically it is firmly rooted in Central Europe.
Croatia has proven its readiness to join the EU many times, for example with the settlement of the fishing dispute.
Further efforts are, of course, needed in connection with corruption, but clearly there is no lack of will here, as can be seen by the arrest of the former prime minister, Ivo Sanader.
There has also been some movement with regard to dealing with war crimes.
In this regard, it remains to be seen what role the German arrest warrants issued for high-ranking former members of the Yugoslav secret service will play.
Croatia seems to be prepared to move away from its past, for example by providing support for returning war refugees.
In this regard, it would also be desirable if the EU were to support not only the war refugees, but also the displaced people and to seek a solution to the restitution claims of the Danube Swabians.
