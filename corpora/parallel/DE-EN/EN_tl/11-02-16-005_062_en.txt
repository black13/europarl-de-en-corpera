on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, Mrs Harms mentioned something important yesterday.
Hardly anyone on the outside knows any more what strategy, what stability mechanism, which pact is being proposed, supplemented, brought into force or amended by whom and pursuant to what regulations.
One thing that is clear is that the Europe 2020 Strategy has not so far provided a solution to the problems experienced by the people during the crisis.
Quite the contrary - it continues to pursue the misguided EU policies that were part of the reason for the crisis in the first place.
It continues to count on the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is now intended to be tightened up and strengthened with better sanction mechanisms.
In practice, this means austerity measures to the detriment of citizens.
It means extending working life, in other words pension cuts.
Whether the indexation of wages and salaries is now to be abolished or the basis for negotiation between the social partners is to be restricted or the rules governing working hours made more flexible - all of this means wage restraint and cuts.
It also means the reduction in the formative state intervention in the economic life of society.
In this regard, many people talk about limiting debt.
It makes no difference to me if it is called economic governance, the stability and growth policy, the competitiveness pact or a Commission recommendation on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey.
This antisocial policy is not something that my group and I can support.
However, it does of course make a difference whether parliaments still have some say with regard to this policy.
Yesterday's debate on the amendment procedure for the Treaty gives reason to hope that the Members of this Parliament are united on one point.
We should not allow ourselves to return to the governmental secrecy policy of the 19th century.
Nobody wants that.
Equally, however, we should not allow ourselves to revert back to a two-speed Europe.
