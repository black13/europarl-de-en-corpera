Madam President, it is clear to everyone here in this Chamber that the closer Europe grows together, the closer the agreement on issues relating to economic policy needs to be.
Therefore, an instrument like the European Semester makes sense.
However, it must stop at interfering in tasks that have traditionally been the job of the social partners, such as wage negotiations and negotiating collective agreements.
We really must exercise restraint in this regard.
It does not make any sense for Europe to decide how high wages should be in the individual countries.
We ought to concentrate more on eliminating market obstacles in order to allow the European economy to flourish.
This relates to oligopolies and monopolies, but also to barriers to market access.
It should also not be the case that various sectors are assured of particular profit margins.
More competition is needed here to enable the European economy to develop its potential.
It must also be the task of the European Union to bring our infrastructure up to the state of the art.
I am talking here about energy, transport and communications.
Europe ought to have the necessary resources in this regard, in particular so that we can eliminate the existing bottlenecks between Member States.
We also need to consider what resources we can make available to Europe.
This includes a clear basis for our own resources.
Therefore, I would make a clear appeal to the Council and the Member States at long last to give Europe the resources it needs.
Clearly this also concerns education, as well as the area of research and development, where, as Europe, we have a part to play.
However, the question of money is crucial here, too.
