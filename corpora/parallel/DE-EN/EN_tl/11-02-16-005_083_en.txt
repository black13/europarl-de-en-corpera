Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 Strategy is very important, not only for the development of European social and economic policy, but also for national social and economic policy.
We must take care to ensure that this strategy is not misused at European level to pursue a social clearance policy in the Member States.
I am extremely shocked that, in its Annual Growth Survey, the Commission is proposing pay cuts and a reduction in social protection.
Some previous speakers have already talked about this.
The impact on the people locally will be disastrous.
It is unacceptable for the people, the workers, to bear the costs of budgetary consolidation alone.
I, too, would like to appeal to the Member States to be guided only by the integrated guidelines when they draw up their national reform programmes, as these enable a much better balance between social protection and economic growth.
The Annual Growth Survey once again mentions open-ended contracts, which were previously mentioned in the Agenda for New Skills for New Jobs.
Mr Andor, we debated this once before in November 2010: young people cannot be integrated into the labour market by watering down employee rights.
Experience in Europe has shown that this watering down simply results in a shift to precarious working conditions and does not create new jobs.
We need specific measures in order to help those people who are most at risk and not flagship initiatives that operate alongside each other rather than being integrated with one another.
