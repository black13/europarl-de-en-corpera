Madam President, expectations in relation to the strategy are widely divergent.
While some people are certain that this is all just hot air and that the strategy is not worth the paper it is written on, we see very dramatic and real scenarios that we will have to face - I am thinking about measures to increase the flexibility of the labour markets.
These are bringing hoards of poorly qualified, cheap workers to Central Europe, and the result is wage dumping.
The goal formulated in the strategy for 40% of the younger generation to have a higher education qualification seems particularly na√Øve.
I would like to know what the point of that is.
We already have a situation - I am thinking of Italy - where there are hardly any appropriate jobs for young academics, who have to keep their heads above water by taking low-paid jobs.
Why do we actually need such a high number of academics when there are no suitable jobs for them?
It is true that we need higher qualifications, but we will not achieve that simply by hanging a university degree around the necks of 40% of the population.
That is not the right way to go.
