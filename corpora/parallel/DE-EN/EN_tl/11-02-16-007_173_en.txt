Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report and would like to emphasise two points.
Firstly, when we see that in some countries in Europe too many pensions are being paid out too early, but these countries are getting into difficulties and the others are having to bail them out, that is unfair.
This unfairness cannot, of course, be refinanced via the EU.
We need European coordination in this regard.
The second point that I am very pleased with in this report is the fact that it makes it very clear, according to the principle of subsidiarity, that the Member States themselves are responsible for pension provision.
That is indeed the case.
I therefore consider this report to be a step in the right direction in that, on the one hand, we in Europe are recognising that our citizens want more coordination in the social sphere because they feel unfairly treated and, on the other, we are making it clear where the main responsibility lies, namely with the Member States.
This report represents a step in this direction.
We will do everything possible to ensure that the White Paper continues to push ahead with this.
