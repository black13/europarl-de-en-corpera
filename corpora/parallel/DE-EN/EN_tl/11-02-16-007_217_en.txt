in writing. - I am very pleased that Parliament and the Council were able to agree on a compromise with regard to the problem of falsified medicinal products.
This is particularly important because the falsification of medicinal products has now become a very serious problem, which has widened to include life-saving preparations.
With the measures that have been adopted we have taken an important step in the right direction, without excessive bureaucracy.
First and foremost, new safety features are to be applied to the packaging and the monitoring of distribution channels is to be improved.
In this way, we will achieve greater safety for patients - which, in view of the extent of the falsification of medicinal products, was urgently needed - without imposing excessive burdens on the parties involved.
