in writing. - Demographic change towards an increasingly older society in conjunction with the setbacks in the areas of economic growth, state finances and the financial markets caused by the economic and financial crisis make it necessary to adapt our practices with regard to pensions.
This adaptation is in keeping with the completion of the European internal market and the Europe 2020 goals for employment and the long-term sustainability of public finances.
However, I welcome this proposal above all because it provides for more efficient pension provision that is to be both sustainable and safe.
I am firmly convinced that pension provision should not only enable older EU citizens to live in dignity, but it should also be a reward for their working life as a whole.
If we want the European citizens of tomorrow to be motivated in their work and to be open to cross-border activities, it is important, even today, to offer them the prospect of adequate and sustainable retirement pension provision, harmonised at European level.
Nonetheless, the responsibility for pension provision remains with the Member States, meaning that pension systems primarily fall within the competence of the Member States and therefore the only thing that should be provided by Europe is coordinated guidance for Member States.
In this regard, the principle of solidarity between the generations and that of national solidarity ought to be taken into consideration in particular.
In addition, with regard to subsidiarity, all pension systems should remain 'exportable' for citizens.
