in writing. - I abstained from voting on the European Parliament report on a European pension system.
Although it is, in principle, to be welcomed that the European Union is considering how it can support the efforts of Member States to provide adequate pensions, pensions policy is, and remains, the task of the relevant Member States, in respect of which the EU should only take action with the utmost sensitivity and with consideration for national circumstances.
However, the decisions in question are not favourable for the German occupational pension model in particular.
In my opinion, regulations jeopardising occupational pension systems that have been successfully implemented in many European countries should not be enacted at European level.
Considerable improvements are still needed in this regard.
