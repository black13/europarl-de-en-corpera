in writing. - Within the European Union we are still seeing a considerable decline in prosperity, which will certainly be evident with the loss of the periods of protection for the labour market.
Every country is having to grapple with the demographic changes and the associated lack of financial viability of its pension systems.
Private pensions, which were to provide additional support, have not brought the much talked about relief to the pension systems but have instead placed state pensions under even more pressure.
Against this background, the people in Hungary, for example, have almost been forced to go back to the state system.
In this regard, the unfulfillable promises of returns by pension funds are also problematic, as revealed during the course of the economic and financial crisis.
Interference like that at EU level often brings with it a whole series of problems, for example in connection with the compensatory allowance for pensions, which opened the floodgates to abuse.
The details of pensions are regulated differently in the individual States and they must also remain that way, which is why I strongly reject the report.
