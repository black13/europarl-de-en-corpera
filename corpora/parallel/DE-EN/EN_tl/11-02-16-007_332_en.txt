in writing. - Before long the population pyramid will be turned on its head in the EU: the over 55s will represent the largest proportion of the population, life expectancy will continue to increase, the birth rate will remain low and young people will start their working lives ever later.
We are all aware of the consequences of this: an overageing population and ever more bottlenecks when it comes to the financing of pensions.
What we actually need, in particular, is a more family-friendly policy in the Member States - I am thinking for example of the introduction of family tax splitting into income tax law.
The contribution of families to safeguarding the intergenerational contract should be taken into account in social legislation by means of a gradual reduction in social insurance contributions.
These aspects are not, or are insufficiently, taken into account in the report.
However, the much lauded mass immigration is the wrong way to go about safeguarding our pensions.
At the end of the day, pensions policy should remain within the sphere of competence of the Member States.
Therefore, I have voted against this report.
