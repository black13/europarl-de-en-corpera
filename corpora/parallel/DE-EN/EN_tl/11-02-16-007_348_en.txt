in writing. - I have voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report on the Green Paper on pension systems.
The results of the negotiations are appropriate in the opinion of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and provide the appropriate basis for the subsequent White Paper.
What is important going forward is retention of the German occupational pensions, the length of service and protection against the risk of bankruptcy for existing commitments.
Under no circumstances must occupational pensions be transferred to a compulsory European system.
