in writing. - We expressly support Croatia's swift accession to the European Union.
The people of Croatia have great expectations of this membership.
However, these can only be fulfilled if Croatia is truly ready for accession and all accession criteria are met.
Croatia has already come further in this process than many current EU Member States had come on accession.
The Commission's progress report clearly shows, however, that there is still work to be done in some areas.
This gives reason to hope for a swift conclusion to the accession negotiations - expectations must not be raised by today's decision, however.
Thoroughness is more important to us than speed and reliable implementation is more important than promises.
We must not repeat previous mistakes.
Anything else will not be in the interests of the European Union or Croatia and its people.
We have therefore abstained from voting today.
