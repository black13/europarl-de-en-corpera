in writing. - By supporting the motion for a resolution on the 2010 progress report on Croatia I would like to express my support for the swift acceptance of this country into the EU.
It is not only culturally and historically rooted in Central Europe, it also meets the accession criteria.
Although work still needs to be done in many areas, such as the fight against corruption, in light of the prosecution of the former prime minister, Ivo Sanader, there is no lack of positive will.
Croatia also seems to be prepared to deal with its past, as evidenced, for example, by the support for returning war refugees.
This has also been described in detail in the resolution.
However, by supporting several amendments, I have also expressed my rejection of the politically correct language of the resolution.
In several paragraphs it is absolutely intolerable.
However, so as not to block the Croatian people's path to the EU and to demonstrate our good will, I finally voted in favour of the report.
