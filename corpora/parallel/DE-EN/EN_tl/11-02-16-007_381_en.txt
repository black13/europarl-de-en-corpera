in writing. - Among the candidate countries, Croatia is the country that has made the greatest amount of progress.
Thus, Croatia has proven its readiness to join the EU many times, for example with the settlement of the fishing dispute.
Progress has also been recorded with regard to the fight against corruption, as can be seen by the arrest of the former prime minister, Ivo Sanader.
When it comes to addressing the issue of war crimes, Croatia seems to be moving away from its past, for example by providing support for returning war refugees.
The motion for a resolution contains a few superfluous, overly politically correct platitudes, for example with regard to the protection of transsexuals in paragraph 5.
However, the report is, by and large, acceptable.
It refers to the progress that has been made and seeks a swift accession process.
That is to be welcomed, as, from a cultural and historical point of view, Croatia is firmly rooted in Central Europe.
I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.
