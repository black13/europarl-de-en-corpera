Madam President, as a politician involved in development policy, I always ask myself why it is actually so difficult to learn lessons from past crises and disasters.
It seems to me that the drama of the hunger riots of 2008 has still made too little impression on the minds and hearts of those with political and economic power and also of those who are unscrupulously speculating on the agricultural commodities markets.
The number of starving people worldwide has once again risen above a billion, and it is the poorest people in the world who are most affected by the price rises on the food markets.
They have to spend more than 80% of their money each day on food.
The global promises of 2009 to provide more than USD 20 billion in agricultural aid to the developing countries, including USD 6 billion via the World Bank, for the fight against hunger have not been honoured.
So far only USD 925 million has been paid.
Speculations on the agricultural commodities markets no longer concern foodstuffs but are now almost exclusively concerned with financial market activities and transactions, which have a direct effect on food prices.
I am therefore pleased that the Commission is now starting to abandon its reticence towards this situation.
Nevertheless, the speculation in relation to price developments has not become more transparent, nor has it been controlled or restricted.
However, that is crucial if we are to be able to act effectively here and to bring about changes.
I therefore call on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to give the fight against hunger top priority in all policies, agendas and strategies and also to consider new methods and new approaches, such as food sovereignty, so that ultimately those who work the land have more creative power and influence over the supply of food to their own people in their regions.
