Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, eating and drinking - hardly anything could be more commonplace and self-evident for us.
However, what we take so much for granted is, for many people, becoming a serious challenge that they are barely able to cope with.
Food prices have now risen sharply, which has made the situation even worse for many people.
A package of measures is needed to tackle the multiple causes of the price rise.
In this regard, it is important to prevent price speculation and to establish stocks.
In so doing, the dominant position on the market of some food corporations and chain stores must also be examined.
The developing countries also need greater support from us to develop their agriculture.
That is the only way we will succeed in providing food for the poorest people and improve their economic situation.
In order that we may have no misconceptions about this: appropriate prices for agricultural commodities are not the problem.
On the contrary, they represent the solution to the problem.
Appropriate prices for agricultural commodities - appropriate, as far as I am concerned, means free of speculation - are, in my opinion, the crucial prerequisite for the establishment of agriculture in the developing countries.
Adequate food is a human right and hunger is a crime against humanity.
Supplying the population with high-quality and affordable food within the European Union, but also worldwide, must therefore be a central concern of European agricultural policy.
