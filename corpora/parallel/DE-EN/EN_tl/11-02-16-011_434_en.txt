Madam President, a few days ago one of the largest German newspapers had a picture on the front page of a bread roll with barbed wire around it.
The article was about the fight for bread.
I think that there will hardly be a topic that will occupy us as much during this and the forthcoming decades as the question of the availability of food.
It is therefore good that we are talking about it as the reason for that - namely increasing demand - will not be going away and so prices will also continue to rise.
We must now give political attention to this whole situation.
We must consider how we can produce food and make it available.
Commissioner, the idea of proposing further set-aside areas within the framework of the common agricultural policy by means of screening is the wrong approach.
We need to make the land that we have productive.
However, we should not view all of this in too negative a light.
For years we have complained that food prices are too low.
If we consider, for example, whether EUR 100 for a tonne of wheat really is an appropriate price then we have to say perhaps not.
If we consider what proportion of the price of the final product, for instance bread, is represented by the price of the raw materials then I think that the increase in the prices of the raw materials is not the only reason for rising food prices; other factors are also involved.
Thus, this whole issue is also an opportunity for agriculture to put itself in a better position for the future.
