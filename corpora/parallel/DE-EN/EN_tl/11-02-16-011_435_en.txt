Madam President, food prices have reached new record highs.
The volatility of food prices has increased in recent years for various reasons.
There is, therefore, great cause for concern.
Climate change is causing extreme weather conditions and in some countries whole crops have been destroyed.
In addition, there is increasing speculation on food, the danger of which cannot be overestimated - you only have to look at the financial crisis.
Moreover, there is increasingly often competition between providing food for the poor and running the cars of the rich.
We need to find solutions so that farmers have sufficient incentive to produce food and that only areas that are not used for food production are used for the production of the likes of biofuels.
For me as a Social Democrat it is important that everyone has access to wholesome food at reasonable prices and at the same time that farmers are able to receive a reasonable income for their work.
