Madam President, market fluctuations are important for the proper functioning of markets in order to create incentives for the buying and selling of goods.
For us farmers, commodity futures trading is a basic component of the buying and selling of harvested crops.
It provides an important opportunity to achieve planning certainty through the early setting of prices and quantities.
In contrast to the situation in our prosperous industrialised nations, rising food prices are a particular problem in the poor regions of the world where people have to spend a large proportion of their income on food.
We must not intervene in the markets every time the prices change in an attempt to combat natural fluctuations.
However, without internationally applicable framework legislation for the financial markets, we cannot even start to think about regulating the commodities markets, because if there is too much money in the financial market it will find suitable equivalents, and commodities are currently highly regarded.
Therefore, we should not be surprised if agricultural commodities are now also a sought-after trading objective.
