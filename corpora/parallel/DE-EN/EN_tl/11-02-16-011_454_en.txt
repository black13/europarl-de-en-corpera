In view of current political conflicts, the fact that food prices are at their highest level since records began is a more pressing problem than ever.
At the end of the day, this is a matter of food supply, and in developing countries it is a question of the essential supply of basic foods.
The European Union is called on to speed up the progress of the global fight against poverty and hunger - there are around 1.4 billion people suffering extreme poverty.
Poverty is an issue within European borders, too.
The only means of guaranteeing food supply in Europe is through the European common agricultural policy.
The challenges faced by agriculture are huge and they encourage the tendency to produce 'more from less'.
Higher food prices will not automatically be reflected in higher incomes for farmers; the gap between producer and consumer prices is widening.
The reality of price management is complex: scarce raw materials, higher production costs, high fuel prices, dependency on harvests, exports and the world market - a dense network of causes that have to be disentangled by means of targeted measures.
In order to tackle these causes, measures and agreement across all policy areas are urgently needed.
I call on the Commission to make fundamental progress in strengthening agricultural production in Europe and in the developing countries.
Speculation on our most vital goods is unethical and we must take stronger action in this regard.
