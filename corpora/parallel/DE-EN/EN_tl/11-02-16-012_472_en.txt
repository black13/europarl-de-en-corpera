Mr President, Commissioner, it is only natural for revolutionary events to be accompanied by a great deal of emotion.
However, as Europeans standing on the outside, we should guard against such emotion and keep in view the reality of the situation.
If we now generally rejoice at the bursting out of democracy in Egypt or even in Tunisia, then we are ignoring reality.
The reality is that we have a military regime in Egypt, which - we hope - is only a transitional regime, and in Tunisia there is a regime that is not in a position to keep thousands or tens of thousands of people from emigrating illegally.
Europeans must, of course, be the friends of the peoples and the allies of freedom.
However, with the future in mind we must also act accordingly in relation to regimes and dictatorships that are still firmly in place in other Arab countries.
I believe that we can only do so if we are under no illusions and if we help these peoples to develop what is needed for democracy: the rule of law, a free market economy and the structures that are required for democracy to even be conceivable.
