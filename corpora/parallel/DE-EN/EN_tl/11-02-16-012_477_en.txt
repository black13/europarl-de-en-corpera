Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the course of a revolution is seldom predictable.
That was the case with the American and the French revolutions, as well as the major revolution in Europe in 1989/91.
It is important for us to be clear about one thing: this is and remains the Egyptian revolution.
It is not a European revolution that we would be able to steer.
Instead, what Baroness Ashton is doing there is right, namely to listen and not to try to dictate events there as Europe would wish.
However, one thing is key: there should not only be an election in Egypt in August, the Egyptians must have a genuine election.
It is good that the Muslim Brotherhood has involved itself in the process to amend the constitution, has founded a party and will take part in elections.
However, the secular powers must be equally involved so that the Egyptians will have a genuine election in this revolution for freedom.
I would like to say a few words about adaptation of the instruments.
That is jargon and hardly anyone understands what it means.
What does it mean?
Firstly, it means providing more money to enable the European Investment Bank to do something.
But what else does it mean?
We need a European foundation for democracy to enable us, in future, to work more efficiently, more quickly and more democratically with these civil societies.
