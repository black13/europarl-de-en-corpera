Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Berlin, and the whole world rejoiced with us Berliners when the border in our city fell and the borders opened everywhere in Eastern Europe.
Now, in the case of Egypt, we reacted too late, too cautiously and, above all, too unemotionally.
Where was our joy?
Every other word from us was simply about 'maintaining stability'.
However, freedom is the most important thing for every person in the world.
We Germans in particular know what we are talking about.
What we had in Egypt was not stability; it was oppression.
Freedom and stability can go hand in hand any time.
Therefore, we should not dictate to the Egyptians who they should elect.
Provided the elections proceed in a fair and democratic way, we will have to recognise the result and must not be so arrogant - as we were at the time in Palestine or even in Algeria - as to decide whether or not we will recognise those who are elected.
We must recognise the choice that is made.
