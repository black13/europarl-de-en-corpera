Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are absolutely no grounds for self-righteousness on the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
The fact that changes have now been made to the Hungarian media law is primarily down to those who took action in this regard.
Mr Orbán was not involved in this at the beginning.
I would like to make this very clear: the changes that have now been made are not enough.
We still have a supervisory authority that for nine years has only been composed of members of Fidesz.
That is not compatible with the legislation at EU level.
There is still no source protection.
Therefore, this really is not a democratic media law.
Mrs Kroes, you did not go far enough in my view.
You were clearly more interested in a quiet life and in not disturbing the Hungarian Presidency than in a truly democratic media law.
May I remind you that anti-communist liberal democratic intellectuals like György Konrad, Agnes Heller and Michael Woida called on the European institutions for support.
We have not yet managed to provide this.
I really do believe that this law really needs to be revised to make it democratic.
