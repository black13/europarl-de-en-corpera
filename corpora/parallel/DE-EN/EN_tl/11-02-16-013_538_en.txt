Mr President, Commissioner Kroes, President-in-Office of the Council, I would first like to thank you, Mrs Kroes, for having taken up this debate so promptly and for entering into negotiations with the Hungarian Government.
However, above all I would like to thank the Hungarian Government for keeping the promise it made in all of the hearings and prior discussions and at the start of the debate, namely that if there was a need for amendments to be made, it would also adequately implement these amendments.
Freedom of the press and media pluralism are important fundamental values in the European Union.
The media also have a very special responsibility in our society.
They are to respect personal rights, they must not practice discrimination and, above all, they are obliged to report the truth.
They do not operate in a legal vacuum.
That, too, is major progress in the new media law in Hungary.
The media enjoy very special protection, particularly through the current legal framework of the European Union.
The Commission, as guardian of this legislation, has done its job very well in the past.
The debate that we are having today would not have been necessary if there had been more trust in the work of the Commission as guardian of the legislation, because the fact that the system works can be seen by the results that we have been informed of today, namely that adjustments have been made in the areas in which the law was not completely in line with EU legislation.
That is a major success.
Ideological debates that arise time and again, especially in this context, are in my view completely out of place.
On the contrary, it is clear that the factual and cooperative debating of the contentious issues on the basis of current law in the context of the talks and negotiations that were held has helped to provide clarification and has led to positive results.
I hope that the various political groups will also stop their political games and withdraw the resolutions in question.
