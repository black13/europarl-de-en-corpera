Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, South Korea is indeed a very important market for products from European industry - that has been emphasised and cars have been highlighted - but also for farmers.
I would emphasise that we need it to be a win-win situation.
There is a new generation coming up, which is a good thing.
The agreement with South Korea contains a chapter on sustainable development, which covers labour standards, environmental policy and a monitoring mechanism that is to involve civil society.
That is also good.
The Free Trade Agreement is a step in the right direction, and I would like to thank everyone involved and emphasise that some excellent work has been done.
Nevertheless, I would also call for clear rules for the production chain as a whole, particularly with regard to food.
We should not only consider the end product, and it should not only be the agricultural industry that benefits; farmers should benefit, too.
In the interests of European consumers and our farmers, when trade flows are liberalised it absolutely must be ensured that agricultural products that are imported into the European Union meet our high standards in respect of environmental, animal and consumer protection, including at their point of origin and throughout the production chain.
I will support the position of the Committee on International Trade tomorrow, but where further liberalisation efforts are concerned I would call strongly for the food sector and farmers also to be taken into account.
