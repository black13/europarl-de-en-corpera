Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I still remember very well how - as is happening now in Egypt and Tunisia - the people in Korea, particularly the young people, took to the streets and, in the face of police truncheons and weapon, fought for freedom, democracy and self-determination.
What has happened since then is unbelievable.
It is unbelievable how much has been achieved in Korea in respect of democracy, self-determination and freedom, but also with regard to the economy and now increasingly also the environment.
This makes Korea a good example for many other Asian countries, and it is also a country our ever closer cooperation with which I very much welcome, along with our work to break down customs barriers and to establish fairer trade.
Nevertheless, we are rejecting this agreement today and there are a number of specific reasons for this, some of which have been mentioned by my colleague Mr Jadot.
In addition to what has been said, I would also like to mention the regulation in the area of the financial sector, which we consider to be a step in the wrong direction.
However, there are also fundamental reasons for this.
We are concluding more and more free trade agreements, each one giving rise to another one.
What we need is not a patchwork of more new individual agreements, but just and fair rules for world trade as a whole.
