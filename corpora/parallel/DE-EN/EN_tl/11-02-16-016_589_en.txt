Since I submitted the question, a group of Serbian citizens of Albanian nationality have been given the maximum sentences in a show trial by a special court where they stood accused of crimes in Kosovo.
Should this not have been dealt with by the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) instead of Serbia?
Could you please look into this and find out about the specific case that I have asked about?
