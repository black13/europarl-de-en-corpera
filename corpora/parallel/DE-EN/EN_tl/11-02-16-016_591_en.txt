Mr President, I have another supplementary question for the Council with regard to the Mr Posselt's question.
My colleague has already asked whether the Council can envisage, in this specific case in particular, contacting the government and those responsible on the ground once again.
Therefore, I would again like to ask the Presidency of the Council: Can the Presidency envisage, in this specific case, entering into contact with the people responsible on the ground?
