My question also relates to the Strategy for the Danube Region.
We, of course, want to dramatically improve the quality of the water in the Danube.
Do all Member States plan to draw up an action plan in this regard that will gradually also take into account the sewerage works coming from the tributaries, so that we will also have cleaner tributaries and there will be an improvement in water quality in the Danube right down to the estuary?
Do all the Member States concerned intend to draw up action plans?
