(HU) Minister, thank you very much for your answer.
I would like to encourage the Council to pay attention to the importance of the involvement of people with disabilities.
This issue also has a bearing on the work of Parliament, as regards the ability of the Members to become involved in this process, since it is we who represent the people, so to speak.
I would like to congratulate the Presidency on addressing the issue of disabilities at a high level until the end of the trio.
My question is whether subsequent presidencies also intend to address this, the matter of disabilities, at the same level.
