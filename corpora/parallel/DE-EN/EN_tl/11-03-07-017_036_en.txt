Mr President, you are wrong, Mr Farage.
From me, it is a clear 'Yes' to a financial transaction tax.
In my opinion, this is an area in which the European Union can prove itself.
Yes - we need the European Union precisely for such matters.
The European Parliament can prove itself here, too.
If we all vote in favour tomorrow, then this could represent a decisive new step towards a financial transaction tax.
Politics could then provide the right answer that would once and for all free us from the chains of servitude to the financial sector.
However, the financial transaction tax should not only provide incentives for the financial sector to make long-term investments here that provide added value for the real economy; no, it should also have a social component, and it should also result in the tax burden being clearly shifted away from workers.
To do this will take courage, even in this House, particularly when it comes to laying down the tax rate.
A tax rate of 0.03% or 0.05% is not sufficient.
We should set ourselves a target of at least or up to 0.5%.
So yes - let us make a clear commitment to a Europe-wide financial transaction tax.
I will certainly be voting in favour of Amendment 2 tomorrow.
