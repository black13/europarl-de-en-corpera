Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is actually about innovative financing, but we have already heard something about that.
Innovation does not simply mean inventing new taxes or re-labelling what has always been there, such as national debt.
I would like to concentrate very briefly on what this debate is really about.
It is not about the introduction of Eurobonds - and the CDU/CSU parties will certainly speak out against that - but rather it is about learning the lessons of the crisis in the financial markets, and that means quite simply that speculation must be taxed too.
It also means - and I will state this quite clearly - that if this cannot be done worldwide at the G20, then we must do it at European Union level.
There is no alternative; that is why I am not simply looking for applause now, Mr Bullmann, but for a clear, strong vote by the European Parliament tomorrow.
In this, Commissioner, the Commission must act as our ally against the Member States - particularly against the Member State that we have just heard speaking so loudly about what the City of London thinks.
I will simply say to you, Mr Farage: look at the unemployment figures and look at the economic decline of your country, which has concentrated on financial market products.
If you still built cars - as we do in Bavaria and in Germany - then you would be doing somewhat better now.
That is why the financial transaction tax must be called for and introduced now as a matter of urgency.
It is our duty as Europeans.
