Mr President, taxing speculation - which, in many cases, brings no benefit for the real economy - by means of a financial transaction tax is undoubtedly the right approach.
However, such a tax should not be used as an opportunity to bring in something akin to an EU tax by the back door and to justify fiscal sovereignty for the EU.
Unfortunately, however, this report takes us in precisely that direction.
In my opinion, the EU is not a state - and it should not become one either.
Fiscal sovereignty must remain the responsibility of the Member States.
If Brussels cannot manage its budget, then cuts will have to be made.
There are enough powers already that would be better regulated at a national level instead of at EU level.
Moreover, the jungle of subsidies and EU agencies offers plenty of potential for savings.
The introduction of Eurobonds that is also recommended in the report is, in my opinion, to be decisively rejected.
It goes against all economic sense and is nothing more than a further measure to make the EU into a transfer union.
That is something that I reject.
