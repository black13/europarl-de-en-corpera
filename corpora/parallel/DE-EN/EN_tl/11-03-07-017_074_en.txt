Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the structural crisis - and I do not imagine that we have dealt with that yet by any means - it is essential that we secure a safe financial platform in order to limit speculation or, better still, to ban it entirely.
Innovative financing instruments supplement the policy of cuts that is currently necessary and should be introduced worldwide as a matter of urgency.
If we therefore vote in favour of a financial transaction tax at a rate of 0.05%, then we could have at our disposal potential revenue of nearly EUR 200 billion across the EU or even EUR 650 billion worldwide.
At least equally positive is the potential it provides to regulate the financial markets and increase transparency.
In other words, it is a step in the right direction.
