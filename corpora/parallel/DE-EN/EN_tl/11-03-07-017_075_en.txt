Mr President, if we want to stabilise the financial markets, then a financial transaction tax is unavoidable.
We need it so that we can put a stop once and for all to highly speculative excesses.
The instability of the financial markets is due to short-term investment strategies and gambling on rates using a high proportion of debt capital.
We need to make this kind of speculation unattractive and bring long-term investment strategies to the fore once and for all.
The tax will result in important revenues that we cannot do without in view of the costly EU safety nets.
However, the tax rates also need to be set intelligently.
The tax rate on lower risk securities must be lower than that on higher risk securities.
The financial and banking systems may be organised differently around the world, but we need this financial transaction tax to gain global acceptance.
It will make a substantial contribution to reducing the turbulence on the financial markets and will finally place financial transactions on a firmer footing.
