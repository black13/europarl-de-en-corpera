Mr President, one of the reasons why the renewal of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Mauritania is particularly important is that this agreement will be effective in a particularly sensitive area - North Africa - which is currently once again in the spotlight of world politics.
We know that fisheries agreements are not only intended to provide economic benefits for those involved, but must also be based on ecological principles.
When fisheries represent a third of the budget, as in the case of Mauritania, then their economic significance to the country is only too clear.
On the other hand, however, the EU fleet is also a significant element of the European economy.
Ecological principles are one side of the coin, but the other is that such agreements should naturally also be used to strengthen democratisation and human rights in a country that could, in certain circumstances, find itself facing similar problems to those of other North African countries.
We therefore need to pay particular attention to this.
