Mr President, the report talks of great progress, but it is a cause for concern that despite the General Product Safety Directive, despite the Toy Safety Directive, and despite RAPEX, around 60% of the products reported come from China and the majority of dangerous products thus come from a market that cannot be controlled by the EU.
I hope that the new RAPEX system will help remedy this.
The EU must take a strong position in order to protect consumers and their health.
It is particularly shocking that around a quarter of the dangerous products are products aimed at children: dolls, water pistols, children's cutlery, child seats - according to RAPEX in the past week.
The EU reacts too slowly in such cases.
Only now has the use of Bisphenol in the production of baby bottles been banned, yet its harmful effect has been known for the past year.
I mentioned this in a question to the Commission.
Moreover, the Toy Safety Directive still does not ban carcinogenic products.
Finally, the recall of hazardous products must take place more quickly and more efficiently and there must be clear improvements in traceability back through the production chain.
