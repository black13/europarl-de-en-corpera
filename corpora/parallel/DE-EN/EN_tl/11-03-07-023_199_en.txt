Mr President, Commissioner, we can consider ourselves fortunate today that the epidemic did not take the course we had feared, which was that it would cause many deaths.
Every single death is tragic enough.
I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate.
This debate has reflected the situation in the EU very clearly: national experiences have varied greatly.
We have different health systems.
The structure and provision of healthcare is a national matter, but in the case of an epidemic or a pandemic, we need to work together at European level.
We have seen that we still have a lot of lessons to learn and a lot of catching up to do in many areas here.
As has already been mentioned today more than once, we need, in any event, to regain the confidence of the population.
The handling of the H1N1 situation has shown that there are shortcomings here.
We need better coordination in future.
