Mr President, Commissioner, the topic today is 'Reducing health inequalities'.
It is a highly ambitious task.
In the current situation, I tend to fear that at European level, we are contributing in every area to increasing these differences, these inequalities, yet further in the coming years and decades.
It is not just about actual regression in healthcare provision; it is also about declining social standards, reduced access to education and making education more difficult.
After all, we know that where we find a lower level of education and greater social difficulties, there is greater poverty.
We also know that poverty makes people sick.
I call on the Commission to make it clear - even when it is necessary to consolidate the European budget and the national budgets - that our failure to invest in health, in social services and in education today will cost us in the future in terms of the health system.
