The EU is not in a position to produce the feeds it requires itself and is making itself dependent on third countries.
Only 30% of the protein-rich crops required for animal feeds are produced in the EU.
The effects of this dependence are becoming clear to our farmers, firstly, in enormous price volatility, and secondly, in the lack of traceability among imported products.
I welcome the call for a return to increased promotion of the cultivation of protein crops in EU agriculture.
Europe must embark on a consistent, independent path when it comes to the provision of animal feeds.
However, I would like to see greater honesty and objectivity on the entire subject of feeds; we need new scientific assessments as regards genetically modified organisms and the ban on the use of animal protein.
Agriculture must not fall victim to populism, because it carries out the great work and bears the great responsibility of providing the EU with food.
We must create better framework conditions for farmers.
Better traceability requires an improved labelling system.
It is clear to me that each Member State must decide for itself whether it wishes to grow genetically modified crops; Austrian farmers do not want genetically modified crops in their fields.
In the long term, we can only limit our dependence if agricultural policy focuses more on regional business cycles with sustainable production, short transport paths and a high proportion of self-marketing.
