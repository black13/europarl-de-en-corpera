Madam President, thank you Mr Fernandes for this excellent report.
The key principles of good budgetary management are efficiency, thrift and the responsible deployment of the financial resources entrusted to us.
However, something that arises again and again in all budget negotiations, and which we need to avoid here once again, is greed and the desire to hold on to our old ways.
We need to distinguish between greed and need.
There is little doubt that the job increases outlined in the Treaty of Lisbon and required as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon are something necessary.
Care should be taken to ensure a balance between the jobs in political groups and committees and administrative posts.
As my fellow Member has already observed, it would have been good to have the Secretary-General attend this session to hear what we have to say.
The new departments referred to by Mr Vaughan are not needed in this form if we make sensible use of the synergy effects within this House.
We have plenty of competent people in the various Directorates General and I am sure that we will be able to bring them together in an effective way.
With regard to the House of History, I would agree with Mrs Hohlmeier that it is important that such a project should have a business plan from the start.
We should not regard this as something of a request show in which everyone gets what they want; we need to manage our resources wisely on the basis of a reasonable budget.
Finally, I would add that we should not make the mistake of failing to invest in the future because of a misguided wish to save money.
The investments we make today, for example in IT resources, can save us a lot of money in the coming years, which is why thrift should not be allowed to become an end in itself.
It must make sense and must be reasonable in terms of the future.
