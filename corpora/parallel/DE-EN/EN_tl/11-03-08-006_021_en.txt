Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft produced by Mr Fernandes for the 2012 financial year refers to cost-efficiency and consolidation.
As representatives of the citizens of Europe, we in Parliament must comment on this.
Cost-efficiency is essential.
However, the additional expenditure arising through the accession of Croatia, the establishment of the EEAS and the three new financial authorities have all impacted on the EU budget.
The fact is that new expenditure should not necessarily - and indeed absolutely must not - lead to budgetary increases.
Potential savings can be found in all of the Union's institutions, for example, in personnel and building policy, or in administration.
I would once again suggest that the various agencies should be subjected to an audit and that synergies should be sought with the various Member States.
