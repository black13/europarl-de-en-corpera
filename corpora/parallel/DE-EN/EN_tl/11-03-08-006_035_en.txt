Madam President, I would like to ask Commissioner Lewandowski what the specific procedure is for accessing the euro safety net, in other words, the money put up by the European institutions, in 2012.
Will the Commission make a proposal if a particular state expresses the desire to make use of the safety net?
Does the European Parliament have a full role in making this codecision and is this also to be an issue this week in the context of the widening of the safety net?
Secondly, I have a comment to make on the EUR 1 500 increase in the secretarial allowance.
I would ask all the Members who do not make full use of the secretarial allowance to state publicly how much money they save themselves - after all, this is an area open to abuse.
It may be that there are some Members who do not need to use the secretarial allowance at all because they very rarely attend Parliament.
In such cases, these funds should not be used up in full.
Only those who work particularly hard could use up the entire allowance.
Everyone else should return this money to the taxpayer.
