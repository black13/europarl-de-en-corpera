Madam President, as the rapporteur for the opinion on the report on equality, I concentrated on the labour market.
Unfortunately, the pay differential is still 17% and women are still not always represented in management and supervisory boards.
There is an urgent need for action here.
We can no longer afford to waste the potential of females in society, whatever their age.
We have a good level of education and the state invests in these young women and mothers.
We really do need to make progress here and demand that companies finally put their fine words into action.
To this extent, I welcome the fact that companies really are taking a step in the direction of a voluntary quota.
However, on the other side, any report on equality should not forget that men are also disadvantaged in some respects.
In particular, boys are not always given the opportunity to develop in school.
Deficits exist in the area of housework and childcare and men can become more active here, too.
This is one task we should all adopt for ourselves.
Each of us, whatever our gender, should be given an opportunity to find our niche and live our lives as we see fit.
