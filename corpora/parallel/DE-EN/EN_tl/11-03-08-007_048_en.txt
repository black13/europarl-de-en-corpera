Madam President, one hundred years ago, women demanded the right to vote and stand for election and today, we are still campaigning for equality for women in many areas, particularly in terms of career options, but also in relation to payment for work and social entitlements, particularly in old age.
This is revealed not only by the earnings gap between men and women.
Despite their increasing involvement in the labour market, statistics in all 27 Member States of the European Union show that women are at greater risk of poverty than men.
There are many reasons why poverty is a female issue.
I can only go into some of them because of a lack of time.
The increase in the number of precarious jobs discriminates against women on several counts.
Over 30% of women are employed in part-time work, compared with only 7.4% of men.
Studies show that even in these part-time jobs, women are still paid significantly less than men for the same working hours and the same work.
This reduces the opportunities to integrate in the labour market and pursue a career.
Pension entitlements are reduced, so that poverty is pre-programmed, particularly for those who choose an independent, single life.
However, we believe that a life free from poverty can be achieved by political means by developing social security systems in which pensions and minimum wage levels above the poverty threshold are guaranteed and working hours are generally reduced.
We do not want to wait another hundred years to find out that it is self-evidently the right of women to organise their lives independently of male decisions, despite having child dependents.
