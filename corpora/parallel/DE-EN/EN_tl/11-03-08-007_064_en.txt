Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is one of the signs of the absolute poverty of our society that we still need to discuss the issue of equality between men and women.
Women suffer disadvantage not just in the world of work, but also in society at large.
The list seems endless, which is why I will confine myself to a few keywords: wage levels, working and appointment conditions, precarious employment contracts, pension entitlements, childcare, social security and various forms of violence against women.
There are plenty of women who are better qualified than men and yet we find ourselves discussing equal pay for equal work - incredible.
Something equally incredible is the fact that women are at greater risk of poverty than men; older women and single parents are particularly at risk.
Let me remind you that 2010 was the Year for Combating Poverty.
Poverty is a female issue.
This has serious consequences for society because poverty leads to illness and can consequently result in unemployment.
