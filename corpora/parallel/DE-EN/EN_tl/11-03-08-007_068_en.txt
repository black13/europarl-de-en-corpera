Madam President, the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day provides us with good reason to celebrate, give thanks and fight on.
We are dealing with a report into women and poverty; one of the key reasons for this problem is wage inequality between women and men.
As we have already heard, wage equality has been enshrined in the Treaties of Rome since 1957.
However, the pay differential is still 17.5% throughout Europe and as high as 23% in Germany.
In 2008, this House adopted a report on wage inequality thanks to the excellent work of Mrs Bauer.
This report called on the Commission to instigate legislative initiatives to combat wage inequality.
There has been no action since then.
Furthermore, Commissioner Reding, all you have done is to designate 5 March as European Equal Pay Day, an announcement you made on Friday, 4 March.
Lucky that you remembered to do this before the day had actually passed.
We have no more time for meaningless press releases.
We do not want to hear nice words from you.
We want you finally to take action so that the 100th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome will not be another day on which the pay differential between women and men is more than 0%.
We want equal pay now.
I would like to turn now to the issue of women's quotas and to my fellow Member from England: I would like to know whether he believes that only 3% of women in England and throughout Europe 'know how to do their business'.
Perhaps that explains why there are so few women on supervisory boards?
I do not think that this is the case.
We need a quota.
Mrs Reding, you have said that businesses must commit to appoint women by next year.
Is it your wish that we should have these commitments by next year, or that women should have been appointed by next year?
I hear that you want the second objective I mentioned.
