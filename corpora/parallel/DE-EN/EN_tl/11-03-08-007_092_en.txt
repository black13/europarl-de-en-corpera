Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both here in the Chamber and in the galleries, the campaign for women's rights in the workplace, in the family, in democracy, for economic independence for women and against male violence, female poverty and discrimination against single mothers, lesbians and female migrants, is one that has already gone on for too long.
Today, we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day.
Happily, in the future, we shall also be able to celebrate what has been achieved, while not losing sight of the work still to be done.
Mrs Morin-Chartier has already said that she would not have put much faith in quotas ten years ago, but that she has changed her mind: quotas are essential.
Thank you for that.
Quotas are indeed something that women need if they are to get anywhere.
We have men's quotas in all supervisory boards, in all statutory authorities, in politics and in business.
Male networks operate without any difficulty.
Men are not necessarily in influential positions because of their performance - some are, though it is by no means true of all - but simply because they belong to these boys' networks.
That is why we need quotas and wage equality.
