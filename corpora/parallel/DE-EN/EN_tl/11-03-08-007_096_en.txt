Madam President, Commissioners, the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day should also be an occasion to reflect and take stock.
Today, I would like to express my thanks to the pioneering women who paved the way for us, making it possible for so many women now to play a role in political life and in business.
However, this day should also be a warning to us not to put at risk what has been achieved so far.
Many aspects of the programmes of the various Member States, which are now to be implemented under the cover of budgetary consolidation, are specifically against women, against women's educational opportunities, against women's opportunities to make a fair and living wage, against women's opportunities to play a role in political development.
I am calling particularly on men - and I can see there are several among us now - to work with us in partnership to ensure that our ambitious goals can be achieved, so that International Women's Day really will be a day to celebrate in the future.
