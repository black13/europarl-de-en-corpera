The joint debate is closed.
The vote on the two reports will take place at midday today, 8 March.
This will be followed by celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day.
All the women in the Chamber, in Parliament, in the Commission and in the Council are cordially requested to attend a joint photo call after the ceremony.
I hope that this announcement will be heard by all the ladies and gentlemen in their offices and that they will attend the plenary directly.
