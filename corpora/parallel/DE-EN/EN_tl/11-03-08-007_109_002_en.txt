in writing. - Trying to sell women's quotas as a milestone is simply populism.
What women really need is a genuine freedom of choice in life: They must have the certainty that none of their decisions will be given a lesser value.
An important step in this direction would be to introduce family tax splitting in all Member States so that the establishment of a family does not become a poverty trap.
Support for women's quotas in supervisory boards only comes from women who are already top earners, if at all.
Since Norway introduced the women's quota requirement for the management boards of listed companies, these posts are simply accumulated by a small number of women, who occupy several seats on different management boards.
These women are often disparagingly referred to within business as 'golden skirts', something that is not exactly favourable to the working atmosphere.
We need to begin in the areas where women suffer genuine disadvantage: we need to look at the position of unpaid carers, at part-time employment and at the plight of the many women who work hard to cope with the demands of family and career.
