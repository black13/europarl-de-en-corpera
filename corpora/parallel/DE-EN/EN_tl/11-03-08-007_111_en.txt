As we discuss the report by Mrs Nedelcheva today, the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, it is high time for us finally to follow up our words with deeds.
The disadvantage suffered by women in Europe can only be combated effectively if we introduce binding rules instead of voluntary commitments.
These include mandatory women's quotas on corporate boards, as well as all other levels, the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions, which affect women far more than men, the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them, a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income, statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women, and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe, if any.
Let me conclude by saying this: After 100 years of International Women's Day, we women will no longer be satisfied with simple lip-service.
We want binding statutory regulations and we want final recognition that the work of women makes a decisive contribution to our prosperity.
