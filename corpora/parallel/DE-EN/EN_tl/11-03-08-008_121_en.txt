Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the equality of all human beings is enshrined in the first two articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
This states: 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood'.
What a wonderful sentence.
However, even one hundred years after the first International Women's Day, we still have not achieved this: there is still no sign of true equality between men and women.
Granted, we have achieved at great deal in Europe.
Today, our primary concern is no longer the legal freedom of women.
We have largely achieved this freedom.
I would like to express my gratitude to the feminists, both male and female, for their work in the past.
Today, our main concern is freedom in action, that men should take ownership of the issue of the compatibility of work and family life, and that seeing women at the top in business or politics is something that should become commonplace.
It is fantastic to see how the liberation movements in North Africa look to us, the women of Europe.
They look to us to play a pioneering role.
It is vitally important that we do not lose sight of our goal: the freedom to live our lives according to our own conceptions.
That is when equality will become something we take for granted and when International Women's Day will be transformed from a day of remembrance to a day to celebrate freedom.
