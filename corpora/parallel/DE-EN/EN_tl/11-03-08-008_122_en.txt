Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which we now find ourselves does not really warrant a holiday, but should encourage us to agree once again on the implementation of genuine equality.
This 100th anniversary should be an occasion for us, as women, to look back and take stock.
For me, the results are as follows: equality must be enshrined in constitutions and declarations of human rights as a grand principle.
However, we need laws and regulations to make these principles a reality.
I believe that this also requires the use of quotas.
If we look at the European institutions, we can see that things are no better than at the top in the business world.
There are hardly any women right at the top in management positions.
If we are to achieve this, Mrs Reding, Mr Barroso, then we need genuine tough quota regulations.
I would have welcomed an honest appraisal from you of the lack of equality for women in the European institutions, because then you would have realised the importance of these quotas.
(Applause)
I believe that it is a shame that there is still no place at the table for women, however well qualified they may be, when managerial decisions are made and when strategic policies are planned.
The quota is the instrument whereby we can achieve this.
Mrs Reding, on this, the occasion of the 100th International Women's Day, we call on you: make a genuine commitment to do all you can to promote a real quota for women in management positions - as is already the position in Norway, Spain and France.
I am at a loss to know why this issue has not already been addressed in Mr Barroso's speech.
