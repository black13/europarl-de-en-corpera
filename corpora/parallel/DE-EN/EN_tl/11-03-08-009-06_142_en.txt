Madam President, I can tell Mr Gauz√®s this: yes, we intend withdrawing this draft for an alternative resolution.
I recommended this to my group for a very simple reason: The following amendment, which has been signed by 120 Members from all groups, shows that proposals regarding a financial transaction tax are not the preserve of any one group, whether the socialists, conservatives, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) or the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
The point is that we are making an institutional proposal and issuing an institutional signal that this House is capable of saying on a cross-party basis: 'We want the private sector to pay its share in dealing with the burden of the crisis'.
This is not a socialist demand, or a PPE Group demand; it is our common wish.
If we manage to express this today on an institutional basis, then this will be a major success for the European Parliament.
This is why we are withdrawing this motion.
(Applause)
