Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report examines how the 80% protein deficit in the European Union can be reduced by promoting the cultivation of protein crops in Europe.
The point of the report is not to instigate a debate on the question of zero tolerance, Nor does it aim to make it easier to import genetically modified soya.
I would therefore implore you to vote against paragraphs 3 and 9.
These amendments would lend the report a completely different character.
If these two items are accepted, I shall have to withdraw my name.
