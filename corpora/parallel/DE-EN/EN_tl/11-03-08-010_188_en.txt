Mr President, our primary concern must always be to maintain health and secondly, to restore health.
Education is the key in all Member States.
Healthy nutrition and exercise and a good level of general education are particularly important.
In essence, this is a matter for the Member States.
Europe should promote the sharing of experience in relation to health education in the various areas.
I voted against this report despite its many good ideas.
I am completely opposed to paragraphs 25, 26 and 29.
The important ethical and moral decisions of the Member States, such as reproduction techniques and abortion, have no place here.
To mention abortion in the same sentence as contraception without even considering the right to life does not reflect the will of Christian Europe.
