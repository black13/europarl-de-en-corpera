Mr President, I voted in favour of the HÃ¤usling report.
Protein is essential for healthy animal nutrition.
Europe needs to take action in order to assure a reliable supply of protein.
We must pursue all avenues here, from support for research and cultivation to information and training for farmers in relation to the advantages of established practices and crop rotation.
Let us not lose sight of the proven principle of a circular economy.
The Commission must review the ban on the feeding of animal protein to non-ruminants, while still respecting the ban on cannibalism.
Specifically, it needs to consider the possible use of animal protein for bone meal for pigs and poultry.
These materials must be prepared according to the current stringent regulations for protecting human health and the environment.
Valuable sources of protein are currently being destroyed here simply because we are not able to organise ourselves to deal with these products correctly.
