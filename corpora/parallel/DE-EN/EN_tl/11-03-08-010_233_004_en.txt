Around 60% of the products reported in the RAPEX system come from China.
The majority of dangerous products thus come from a market that is almost impossible for the EU to control.
I hope that the new RAPEX China system will help remedy this.
The EU must take a strong position in order to protect consumers and their health.
The recall of hazardous products must take place more quickly and more efficiently and there must be improvements in traceability back through the production chain.
This report is moving in this direction, which is why I have voted in favour of it.
