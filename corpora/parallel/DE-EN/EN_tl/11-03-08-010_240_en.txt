I voted in favour of the report on the revision of the General Product Safety Directive and market surveillance because I generally support the strengthening of market surveillance in the interests of efficient consumer protection.
I believe it is important to protect children, older people and people with disabilities because the Community has a special responsibility to these groups.
After a ten year gap, it was about time for the directive to be thoroughly revised in order to include new commercial channels, such as online shopping.
