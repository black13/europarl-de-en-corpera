There was a lack of transparency in 2009 and 2010 in the way in which we dealt with the H1N1 strain of influenza, designated by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic.
This is dealt with in the 'Report on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU'.
I welcome this report particularly because it provides for complete transparency in relation to the medicines used in the event of urgent medical intervention and a pandemic.
The Member States acted unilaterally in ordering and deploying vaccines.
The important issue in this context is to evaluate the strategy for stockpiling vaccines and to work towards the joint procurement of the vaccines by the Member States in future.
Improved coordination between the responsible authorities in the Member States and the European agencies is also important.
