There were fewer fatalities from type A/H1N1 influenza in 2009 than from seasonal influenza.
Even though the WHO classified the H1N1 influenza as a minor illness, at the same time, it issued a pandemic warning of level 6, the highest possible level.
In order to meet their obligations to the population, the EU Member States consequently spent billions to combat an influenza outbreak whose potential threat is much less than that of normal influenza.
The media also contributed to the panic.
When a pandemic is announced as dangerous but turns out to be a storm in a teacup, then worryingly, future warnings will no longer be taken seriously.
This clearly demonstrates that the WHO needs to revise its pandemic criteria.
Naturally, good cooperation and joint procurement are advantageous in the event of a pandemic, helping to achieve price reductions.
However, if the authorisation of new medicines is rushed through in order to deal with illusory pandemics, then we are faced with an enormous problem.
The role of the media and the pharmaceuticals companies in fanning the flames of panic has not been considered here.
For this reason, I abstained from voting.
