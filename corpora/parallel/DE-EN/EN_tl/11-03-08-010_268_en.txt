As a result of the constitutional reforms necessitated by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2010, the ruling parties in Austria introduced a kind of standardised nomination procedure for some EU posts.
It would seem that a number of important positions are missing from the list in Article 23c of the Austrian Federal Constitution, according to which decisions on senior appointments should be made known at least to the Austrian President or that the Federal Government should seek consensus with the National Council on the appointments.
Harald Wögerbauer, political director of the Austrian People's Party parliamentary club, is to become a new member of the Executive Committee of the European Court of Auditors.
It would seem that Mr Wögerbauer meets the technical criteria.
However, because the Austrian People's Party would appear to be taking a kind of autonomous line in relation to pending personnel decisions at EU level and this contravenes democratic principles and the continuous calls for greater transparency in EU appointments, I have abstained on this vote.
