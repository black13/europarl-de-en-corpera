I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM Agreement Area.
The combining of the agreed recommendations into a future single Community legislative act will simplify administration and increase efficiency, which is something to be welcomed.
The individual technical adjustments proposed reflect the modern requirements for a responsible fishery policy.
