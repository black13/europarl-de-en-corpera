The introduction of a financial transaction tax is a step in the right direction and would mainly affect hedge funds and similar products, which would seem to be of very little benefit to the real economy.
It is doubtless right for Europe to take the lead here - after all, we would have to wait indefinitely if we were to try to bring the Americans on board too.
However, a financial transaction tax should not be used as an opportunity to introduce an EU tax by the back door.
Unfortunately, however, Mrs Podimata's report takes us in precisely that direction.
Fiscal sovereignty must remain with the Member States.
If Brussels cannot manage on the money it gets, then it needs to tighten its belt.
There are enough powers already that could be better regulated at a national level than at EU level.
The other calls contained in the report, namely for the introduction of Eurobonds and a carbon tax, should be rejected.
On the one hand, Eurobonds are a product that goes against all economic sense, while on the other, fiscally prudent euro area countries are once again unfairly required to pay the price.
The EU would simply become a transfer union.
Also, a carbon tax with dubious objectives would damage Europe's economy and destroy jobs and would thus have a negative impact on most people.
For this reason, the report should be rejected.
