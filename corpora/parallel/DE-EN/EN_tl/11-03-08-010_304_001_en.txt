Until now, the European taxpayer has borne the main financial brunt of the economic crisis.
It is therefore important that other instruments should be used to ensure that the players and speculators in the financial markets shoulder some of the responsibility.
This is only fair.
However, a financial transaction tax should not be used as an excuse for the introduction of direct taxation from Brussels.
This would erode the fiscal sovereignty and general sovereignty of the Member States.
This report reveals tendencies in this direction, which is why I have voted against it.
