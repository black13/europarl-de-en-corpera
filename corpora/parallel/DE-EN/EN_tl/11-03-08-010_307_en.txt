I voted in favour of the report because it is high time for the EU to take the lead and to introduce a financial transaction tax at European level.
I believe that if we take this first step, it will increase the likelihood of achieving the objective of a worldwide financial transaction tax.
The amendment proposed by my group calling for the introduction of a financial transaction tax at EU level without further delay (such as the carrying out of more studies) was passed by a narrow majority.
I would now call on the responsible Commissioner, Mr Å emeta, finally to take action.
The resolution was passed with a broad majority of 529 votes in favour, 127 votes against and 18 abstentions.
This is a strong signal from Parliament that cannot be ignored by the Commission or reinterpreted on flimsy grounds.
I call on President Barroso to take action, to exercise the Commission's right to take the initiative, and to present a draft proposal to us, the legislature.
A total of EUR 200 billion could be collected in this way - funds that are sorely needed and that should be contributed by those who caused the crisis.
We should not turn to the taxpayers to make up for the deficits caused by the financial crisis, but instead should demand that the private sector finally pays its way.
This money should be used both for budgetary consolidation and as a separate source of revenue for the EU budget.
