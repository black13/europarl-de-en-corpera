I have voted in favour of the report by Mrs Podimata on innovative financing at global and European level.
Until now, only the European taxpayer has borne the brunt of the financial and economic crisis in 2007 and subsequent years.
This is the first report to consider a variety of innovative mechanisms designed to ensure that players in the financial markets also carry some of the costs.
The proposal for a financial transaction tax at global level, if possible, is to be welcomed and a similar scheme at EU level should be seriously considered as an alternative.
The great advantage of this tax is not just the potential income from a sector that has had little or no tax levied in the past, but also the simultaneous regulating effect.
It is a well-known fact that the financial sector, which is frequently built on speculation, has become divorced from the real economy.
By taxing the financial sector, we could generate incentives for longer term investments again, thus considering the needs of the real economy.
