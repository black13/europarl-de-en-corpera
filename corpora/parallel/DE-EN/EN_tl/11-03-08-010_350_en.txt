I voted against the report because it once again promotes abortion by the back door.
Human beings are God's creation and we should not set ourselves up as arbiters in questions of life and death.
There is no room for compromise here.
Although I am not in a majority in taking this position, I will not be changing my stance and refuse to sacrifice a single life because of contemporary mores.
I took the same decision in relation to pre-implantation diagnosis.
