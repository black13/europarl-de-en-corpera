The report from Mrs Estrela deals with the issue of reducing health inequalities in the EU.
I welcome this work very much because although the current financial and economic crisis means that we are mainly required to deal with economic and legislative questions, we should never lose sight of issues such as health, education and social security.
It will only be possible to implement the Community's higher objectives, such as the EU 2020 strategy, if we have sustainable systems in the broad area of social security and equal opportunities.
For this reason, I voted in favour of the report.
