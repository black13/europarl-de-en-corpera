Efforts to make tax systems more sustainable, fair and transparent also help promote the establishment of democratic systems.
As a result of globalisation, it has become difficult to tax internationally mobile capital.
Developing countries must be supported to give them enough political room to manoeuvre so that speculation can be prevented and financial stability can be secured.
I welcome joint initiatives to combat tax havens, as well as practices that intensify international dialogue between the relevant countries.
A responsible approach to taxation will necessarily have a lasting positive effect on the development of these countries.
