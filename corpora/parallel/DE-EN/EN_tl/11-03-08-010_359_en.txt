I believe that there is an urgent need for an efficient tax system for developing countries.
The ideas contained in this report are perfectly suitable for this.
In particular, when the new tax systems are being implemented with the support of the EU, care should be taken to ensure that the economic partnership agreements between the EU and the developing countries promote this aim, rather than running counter to it.
Investment policy in the EU must also create a business-friendly environment for investors at home and abroad.
All the measures taken should result in a fundamental improvement in the living conditions of the majority of the population, who are currently cut off from income from raw materials sales and who are often forced into migration.
I have voted in favour of the report, because it takes a comprehensive view of many of the factors involved.
