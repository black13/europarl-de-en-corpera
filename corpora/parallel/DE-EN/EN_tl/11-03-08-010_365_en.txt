I voted for Mrs Joly's report.
The establishment of a fully functioning tax system is the basis for any responsible democracy.
The report calls for support for developing countries as they establish such structures, so as to promote responsibility in these states on a sustainable basis.
After all, development aid alone will not be enough to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
The report also touches briefly on the problem of so-called 'vulture funds', which I believe should be completely banned.
International development aid should not be allowed to become a football for global financial players.
