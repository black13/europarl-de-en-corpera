There is no denying the link between our policies on international trade, development and agriculture.
European agriculture is encountering increasing difficulties when it comes to the export of products to the world market because price levels there are low and production costs in the EU are higher.
This ongoing trend will continue to have a negative effect if support programmes are not put in place for agriculture.
That is why I welcome this own-initiative report, which, among other things, provides for compensation for farmers in the event that the further opening up of the internal market to imports leads to a deficit for farmers.
The agreements with third countries negotiated by the EU are, in themselves, unproblematic.
However, the overall thrust of these agreements makes it difficult to maintain high standards in the EU.
One of the things called for by the own-initiative report presented here therefore is greater coherence in agricultural policy and joint trade policy in the EU.
In this context, I support the call for the Commission to carry out an impact assessment on trade agreements and to publish this before entering into negotiations.
