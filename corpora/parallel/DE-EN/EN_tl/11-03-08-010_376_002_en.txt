In this report, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to take a more forceful role in representing the interests of the European agricultural and consumer sectors in international trade negotiations.
We should not act lightly in abandoning the benchmarks that characterise the EU agricultural sector - the highest quality and social standards in agricultural production and the best quality food for the population - by signing up to a large number of economic agreements.
I am in favour of only opening up the market for agricultural imports if it can be assured that the competitiveness of European agriculture will be maintained.
I believe that no further concessions should be made in the area of agriculture during the negotiations on the Doha round.
I welcome the clear demands set down in this report.
