Worldwide agricultural practice and, in particular, European agricultural policy, are of major importance for food and development policy.
That is why it is so important that international trade in this area should be strengthened and developed.
However, this cannot be achieved by working counter to European agricultural policy but only in close coordination with such policy.
It is also essential that stringent European standards should also be applied to imported products.
Anything else would threaten the strict quality and safety requirements of the European agricultural sector and would therefore have a negative impact on European producers and consumers.
We need and demand free trade in goods.
However, this cannot be achieved without fair competitive conditions as a basic requirement.
