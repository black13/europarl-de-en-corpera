Despite the fact that food prices have been continually increasing for some time now - and apparently the price of some agricultural products is about to rocket as a result of the capriciousness of the weather, rising fuel prices and agricultural speculation - prices in the shops bear no relation to what small farmers get for their hard work.
Moreover, EU producers can scarcely compete on price in the world market because our social, quality, animal protection and environmental standards are so high - the very standards that we are unable or unwilling to check when importing foods.
If we do not want our rural areas to continue to decline and the numbers of farmers to continue to reduce, posing a serious threat to the self-sufficiency of the EU Member States, then it is high time we stopped paying agricultural subsidies to the big agricultural concerns and instead gave the money to those who really need it in order to survive - in other words, to small farmers.
If that is not possible in the centralised EU, then renationalising agricultural subsidies is the only way forward.
The report fails to make a clear commitment to small and medium-sized farmers, many of whom find themselves slaving away for a pittance.
That is why I abstained.
