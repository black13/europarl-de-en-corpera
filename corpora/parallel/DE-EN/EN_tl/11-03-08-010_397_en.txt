I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Papastamkos on EU agriculture and international trade.
As an Austrian, I am well aware of the problems facing our farmers from first-hand experience.
European agriculture is one of the main foundations of the European Union, our shared culture and our living space.
The rapporteur calls on the Commission to represent the EU's agricultural interests more forcefully and proactively.
The EU is the world's leading importer of agricultural products.
It is absolutely essential that we ensure that imported products meet the same high quality standards as the agricultural products originating from within the EU.
