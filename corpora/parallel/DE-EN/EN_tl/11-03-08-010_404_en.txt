The 'EU protein deficit: what solution for a long-standing problem?' report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has come up with a number of excellent solutions for dealing with the protein crop deficit in the EU, such as revising the Blair House Agreement with the USA, which permits protein crops to be imported duty free from the United States.
Other solutions include the introduction of protein crops in crop rotation, or a strengthening of research and consultation, and the expansion of seed development and infrastructures for protein production.
Unfortunately, a majority of members from three groups, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, tabled amendments that go against this clear position adopted by Parliament.
They are calling for imports of protein crops, particularly soya, to be made easier, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are prohibited in the EU.
Unfortunately, these amendments were passed with a narrow majority in a plenary vote in Parliament.
However, I am convinced that calling for increased imports of GM soya is counterproductive to our actual objectives of strengthening the EU's self-sufficiency.
This position does not reflect the wishes of a significant majority of people in Europe, who reject the use of GMOs in agriculture.
I note with regret the voting pattern and have decided, in my capacity as rapporteur, to return the report.
