The EU is hugely dependent on animal feed imports in the livestock sector because it does not produce the feeds it requires itself.
Seventy percent of the protein rich crops required for animal feeds are imported from Brazil, Argentina and the US.
This problem is clearly outlined in the report on this protein deficit and stringent standards are called for in relation to feedstuffs.
Imported goods must also comply with quality, environmental and social standards.
In addition, the raw materials suitable for the production of feed must be used more efficiently.
It is important that our enormous dependence on third countries should be reduced as this is responsible for price volatility and a lack of transparency in terms of production conditions.
This will only succeed if we in the EU take the production of protein crops into our own hands again, as this report proposes.
However, I am clearly opposed to the cultivation of genetically engineered crops in Europe's fields.
