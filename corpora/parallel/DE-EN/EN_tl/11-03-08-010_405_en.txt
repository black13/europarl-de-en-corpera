The production of protein crops has declined dramatically in the European Union in recent years.
As a result, we are now worryingly dependent on imports to a great extent.
For this reason, I would like to thank the rapporteur for calling on the Commission to take steps in the medium to long term to address this problem.
However, as long as the European Union is unable to provide sufficiently for itself, we should also consider changes in relation to our import provisions.
A technical solution for minor traces of GMOs in imported protein products could ensure that the European market has sufficient supplies of soya available.
