Protein crops are an important part of the animal feed industry and are therefore a significant economic factor.
However, the cultivation of protein crops is an issue that has generated little positive interest in Europe.
Over the last 10 years, there has been a decline of up to 30% in such crops, the only exception being soya, where the decline has only been 12%.
Only 3% of arable land in the EU is used in the production of protein crops.
As studies show, this not only leads to significant economic disadvantage because it results in an 80% import quota, but also brings disadvantages in the area of agriculture.
This is because the cultivation of protein crops enriches the soil with nitrogen, subsequently promoting fertility.
The research sector is also suffering under the low level of demand for seed for protein producing crops.
The downward spiral has already begun.
I voted against this report because I fear that it may hamper the cultivation of traditional seed.
