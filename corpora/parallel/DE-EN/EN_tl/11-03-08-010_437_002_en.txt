What women really need is a genuine freedom of choice in life: They must have the certainty that none of their decisions will be given a lesser value.
An important step in this direction would be to introduce family tax splitting in all Member States so that the establishment of a family does not become a poverty trap.
However, establishing women's quotas is the wrong move.
We need to begin in the areas where women suffer genuine disadvantage: we need to look at the position of unpaid carers, at part-time employment, and at the plight of the many women who work hard to cope with the demands of family and career.
This report does not deal with any of these issues, which is why I have voted against it.
