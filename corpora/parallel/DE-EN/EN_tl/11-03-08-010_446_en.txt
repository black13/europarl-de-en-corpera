I have voted in favour of the report by Mrs Nedelcheva on equality between women and men in the European Union.
The equality and equal treatment of the sexes is a fundamental principle for the EU.
However, permanent public discussion about the number of women in business, the continuing major difference in salary levels and the numerous disadvantages suffered by women in the workplace show clearly that we still have a long way to go until the sexes are equal.
The Member States are called on to see the crisis as an opportunity to view their policies from a different perspective and to intensify their efforts in this important area.
