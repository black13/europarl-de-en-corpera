I voted in favour of the report on the face of female poverty in the European Union.
The Commission's Annual Report for 2010 on equality for women and men shows that poverty is one of the areas where gender-specific differences are obvious.
The economic, financial and social crisis has led to the 'feminisation of poverty'.
The successive budgetary cuts and the restructuring of the state sector have particularly threatened jobs in which women are primarily employed.
At the same time, the measures supported by governments to combat the crisis are primarily focused on areas of the economy dominated by men.
The analysis of the phenomenon of the 'feminisation of poverty' called for by the rapporteur is therefore urgently needed, so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken.
