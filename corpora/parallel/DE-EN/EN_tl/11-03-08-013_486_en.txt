Madam President, I am assuming that you will not know the answer, Mr Farage, but I have question for you.
You constantly refer to Belgium as a non-existent nation.
You have said this to Mr Van Rompuy and now you have mentioned something similar to Mr Verhofstadt.
Do you know on what basis the Belgian state was founded?
