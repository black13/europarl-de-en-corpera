Madam President, thank you, in particular, for being so fair as to announce the list of speakers in advance.
Alongside a uniform retirement age, the proposals for fiscal union require sales tax rates and wage policies to be harmonised.
This is a further step towards economic governance and represents a major intrusion into the tax sovereignty of the Member States.
It is made all the worse by the fact that the European Parliament will have nothing to say on these matters and that it was possible to fall back on Article 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are likely to be able to force their proposals through, despite opposition from other countries in the euro area.
On the subject of reinforcing the rescue package, it is clear that speculators will continue to be able to exert pressure on the failing countries in the euro area without bearing any of the resulting risk.
If there is a crisis, the rescue package will be made available.
Profits will be privatised and losses will be borne by the public and circulated throughout the entire euro area.
Mr Barroso, you said that growth must be distributed more fairly.
I would like to ask you: What is the situation with financial liabilities?
The rescue package will result in the burdens being distributed even more unjustly.
In addition, it will cause social problems and wantonly put the prosperity of the net contributors at risk.
