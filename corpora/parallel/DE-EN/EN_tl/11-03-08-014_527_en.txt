Madam President, Mr Füle, there is a Turkish proverb which says: 'People are reflected in their actions.
Words do not mean much'.
However, the supporters of Turkey have allowed themselves to be deceived by positive-sounding, empty words.
The 2010 progress report is, in reality, a fault report.
It shows that Turkey is many things, but it is certainly not ready to join Europe.
Fundamental rights often exist only on paper and there are significant restrictions on freedom of speech.
This has been confirmed by the recent arrest of two journalists.
There have been no changes in the discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, such as the Kurds and the Christians.
Prime Minister Erdoğan hypocritically accuses European countries of Islamophobia, despite the fact that Muslims are free to practice their religion here, in contrast to the Christians in Turkey.
The land dispute over the monastery of Mor Gabriel is one more demonstration of this.
Despite claiming the opposite, the Erdoğan government is pushing forward with the process of Islamification.
We know that this is what is happening.
A recent survey shows how the Turks really see the EU.
They are in favour of joining the EU, but, at the same time, they regard Europeans with a great deal of mistrust.
We should break off the accession negotiations as quickly as possible.
