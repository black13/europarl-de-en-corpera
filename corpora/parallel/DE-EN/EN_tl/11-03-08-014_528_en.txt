Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Füle, your historical comparisons could not be more wrong, Mr Watson.
You should not compare the Justice and Development Party (AKP) with the party which returned Germany to democratic government and the rule of law at the end of the Nazi era.
This is really alarming, particularly as the German party in question was in cooperation and in coalition with the Liberals during the 1950s.
I am in favour of strong links between Turkey and the European Union.
Turkey is strategically important to us, but not at any price.
Firstly, we cannot abolish the conditions for accession, including freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, rights for minorities and freedom of religion.
This has been made clear in the Commission's reports and in the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
Secondly, we must not put the integration capacity of the European Union at risk.
We need to find other methods.
Thirdly, it is Turkey's responsibility to ensure that this process is not obstructed and, at last, to keep the promises that it has made in the context of the Ankara Protocol, for example.
Turkey is in a position to make it clear that integration within the European Union is possible.
However, when Mr Erdoğan says in a speech in Germany that Turks who have German nationality owe their primary loyalty to Turkey, we have a serious problem as far as integration is concerned.
This is the expression of a particular mindset and also a means of establishing it.
Therefore, I am of the opinion that Turkey is not yet ready.
However, we have invited Turkey to work constructively with us in the context of the Berlin Plus agreement and in other areas in order to forge closer links.
The example of Mor Gabriel forms part of this issue.
