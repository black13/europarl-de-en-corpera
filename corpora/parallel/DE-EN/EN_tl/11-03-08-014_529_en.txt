Madam President, around two or three million Germans and British people live in southern Spain, Mr Brok.
What would these people say if the Spanish Government demanded that their children learn Spanish before they learn German or English?
They would, of course, be opposed to it.
You cannot simply say in Germany that people have to learn German first.
Of course, they should learn both languages, but Germany still has a long way to go to establish a genuine integration policy.
