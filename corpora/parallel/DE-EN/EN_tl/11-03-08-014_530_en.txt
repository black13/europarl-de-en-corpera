Madam President, Mr Watson, people who live in Germany and intend to return to their home country will, of course, have their native language as their first language.
However, people who want to take German citizenship and remain in Germany permanently must first learn German, so that they have a chance of doing well at school, getting an education and, therefore, having a successful career and becoming integrated into society.
In this case, the language question takes priority.
We need to distinguish between people who go abroad on holiday for the winter and those who want to remain permanently in another country.
The distinction here concerns integration.
You cannot compare people who go to Majorca on holiday with those who want to take the citizenship of a country and live there permanently.
