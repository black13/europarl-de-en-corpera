Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the honest and, therefore, critical evaluation of the accession negotiations in the current progress report on Turkey.
Many promises have been made since the start of the negotiations, but very little concrete progress has been achieved.
Given the pronounced Islamic nature of the country, all Christian and other non-Muslim faith communities must have equal rights, which means the freedom to practise their own religion without having to suffer discrimination.
As far as I am concerned, this is essential.
Turkey must undertake to bring about a complete separation between state and religion and to accept non-Islamic religions.
The case of the monastery of Mor Gabriel is one example of the problem.
I would like to remind the Member States of the European Union of their obligation to call forcefully on Turkey to uphold universal human rights and, in particular, freedom of religion in all their negotiations with the country.
