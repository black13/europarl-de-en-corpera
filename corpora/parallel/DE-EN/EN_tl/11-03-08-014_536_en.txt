Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that we are negotiating with Turkey about its accession to the EU, not on any other subject, and I am in favour of Turkey joining.
I welcome the reforms that the Turkish Government has initiated over the last year.
However, Turkey must also finally fulfil its obligations and implement the Ankara Protocol, so that progress can be made in the negotiations.
It must not constantly hold the EU or Cyprus responsible for the deadlock, as you, Mr Erdoğan, are so happy to do.
Turkey must finally put an end to the practice of arresting journalists who are critical of the regime.
Ahmet Şık, Nedim Şener and others need protection from the arbitrary nature of the justice system.
These are just some of the requirements for opening chapter 23.
Mr Erdoğan, you need to make a clear statement on this and not speak out against the integration of your fellow countrymen and spread your pan-Turkish world view, as you did in Düsseldorf.
That is what we expect from you.
Of course, the EU must also make a contribution to the success of the negotiations and show that it is ready to accept new members.
Both sides have their homework to do.
However, one thing is clear.
The ball is now in your court and it is your turn to take action.
