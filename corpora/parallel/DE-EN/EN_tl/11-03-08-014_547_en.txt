Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to ask a question.
Unfortunately, it is now a little too late.
As you have seen, Mr Cashman has already left the Chamber.
I have a few important questions which I would have liked to put to Mr Cashman.
I would ask you to ensure that when a Member takes the opportunity to put a question under the blue card procedure, he or she is given the floor immediately.
Otherwise, the Member who is being asked the question may leave the Chamber, as has just happened.
However, perhaps I will have the chance to take the floor under the catch-the-eye procedure and I would like to thank you in advance for this.
