Madam President, the expectation was that visa liberalisation for Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia would encourage tourists and businesspeople to make greater use of this opportunity.
Instead, we have seen an increase in economic migrants.
In this context, information campaigns in these countries are undoubtedly important, so that we can make it clear that a visitor's visa is not the equivalent of asylum or a job in the EU.
The fact that the EU had to exert pressure to close the so-called travel agencies which specialised in emigration to the EU demonstrates the lack of awareness of the problem.
We will have to wait and see how effective the planned early warning system for mass movements relating to the Roma problem will be.
Many people seem to believe that their future does not lie in their home countries in the Balkans, such as Montenegro, but want to make use of their newly acquired freedom of travel to enter the EU illegally.
However, they do not have the right to access Europe's social security systems.
It is important for Montenegro to make greater efforts to introduce EU standards in areas such as justice, combating corruption and protecting minorities, in order to establish a European perspective.
