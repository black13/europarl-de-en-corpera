Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to get right to the heart of the matter, this is all about introducing a uniform, mandatory EU strategy, instead of the 27 individual, differing strategies in the Member States.
Only when we implement a uniform strategy of this kind will it be possible for the Roma and Sinti living in the EU to be treated as equal EU citizens.
What is it all about?
It is about guaranteeing free movement for everyone.
It is about abolishing Roma special schools immediately and, if I can express it like this, ending the apartheid system for Roma in Europe.
It is about equal access to education, healthcare and social services.
We are not doing these people a favour.
We are granting them their legal rights.
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left strongly reject the idea of a separate policy for Roma and Sinti.
We need a policy which takes an integrative approach right from the start and which compensates for the disadvantages suffered by Roma and Sinti, for example, in relation to access to work, the right to settle or the use of EU funding.
There is, though, one thing I would like to add.
None of this will have any effect unless we resolve one problem which involves combating racism and the stigmatisation of Roma and Sinti throughout Europe.
We must see this as one of Europe's central tasks and take ruthless measures to combat discrimination.
We must not tolerate a two-faced approach among the Member States and in the EU as a whole.
We must speak with one voice.
