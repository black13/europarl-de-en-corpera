Madam President, while mainstream society in the EU is ageing quickly, the Roma population is growing rapidly in size.
In Hungary, where the Roma currently make up around 6% to 8% of the population, they will exceed 50% of the working population by 2050.
Of course, this makes it all the worse that the life of the Roma in the EU is characterised, as it always has been, by unemployment, a level of education that is well below average, organised crime and prostitution, as well as a retreat into a parallel society.
This report addresses a few of the problems, but in a one-sided way.
Integration is not a one-way street.
The Roma must make a contribution to all of this.
They must send their children to school and become integrated into the labour market.
Women in Roma communities, which have old-fashioned structures, are often in a particularly poor situation.
Their lack of education and their exclusion from the labour market, which will only become worse unless we act now, will exacerbate even further the integration problems caused by demographic changes.
