Madam President, I must admit that I support your arguments about the time available.
However, I would like to ask you to take one thing into account.
The Members who want to ask questions are not the ones who are responsible for the fact that we are running so late.
My problem is that I put a question to the Council concerning a matter which will now be dealt with as Question No 2.
My question to the Council was identical to this, but Question Time with the Council has now been cancelled, without a replacement.
This is, of course, rather unfortunate, and I would like to ask you to review your otherwise completely logical and understandable approach with regard to this one question.
