Madam President, Mr Oettinger, it is good that you have commissioned the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks to look at this issue again.
I am pleased about this.
However, the question remains: How can we explain to the citizens of Europe that they have to allow something into their houses under EU regulations which represents a health hazard for their children?
You have children and you know how it is.
Things often get broken.
Mr Leichtfried from Austria and I are very concerned about this.
How can we make it clear that this is something dangerous?
We do not seem to be able to learn from past mistakes.
However, you were not responsible for the original decision, so you can show a willingness to learn without losing face.
You could have said that we will withdraw this ban, at least for private households.
Would you be prepared to reconsider your decision?
