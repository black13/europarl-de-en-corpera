Madam President, in answer to the question, I would like to point out that bulbs will be available on the market immediately after the changeover which will not present any potential risk.
The question relates to CFL, or compact fluorescent lamps.
For this reason, we need to consider increasing our public relations activities on the ecodesign directive so that we can inform citizens about LED lights and new-generation halogen bulbs.
These will allow us to achieve both things: our environmental and energy-saving goals under the terms of the regulation, on the one hand, and the prevention of any possible risks, on the other.
I am happy to look into this again in more depth.
Subject: Victims' rights packages
Improving support for victims of crime is an important part of the Stockholm Programme.
In particular, the issues surrounding assistance for the victims of cross-border crime in Europe are of real concern to EU Citizens.
There are few practical procedures in place that offer support or advice to victims and families that have been caught up in the aftermath of crime and serious injury abroad.
I am helping a constituent whose son was a victim of a violent attack whilst on holiday in Crete.
There is a real need for EU action in this area to fulfil the promise of a citizens' Europe.
Commissioner Reding has announced a package of measures in relation to the protection of victims of criminal offences.
In light of this, when does the Commission intend to propose this package for victims of criminal offences?
Could the Commission give more information as to what this legislative proposal will include?
Could the Commission give some detail on the non-legislative measures that are to be included in the package?
