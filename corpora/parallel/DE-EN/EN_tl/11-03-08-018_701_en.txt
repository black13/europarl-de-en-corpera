Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Lange and the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work.
They have been successful in transforming the discovery which we all made during the crisis, namely, that industry is obviously more important than many people thought, into a report, and in ensuring that industrial policy is moved nearer to the top of the European Parliament's agenda.
The fact that this debate is being held in the evening may be a disadvantage.
This subject is so important that we need to talk about it at other times as well.
As some Members have already said, industrial policy is not about the state intervening, but about it establishing the right framework.
The state does not need to decide on the content of industrial policy or to distinguish between good and bad industry.
Instead, it must create the opportunities for industry to develop within a framework.
We must focus on those areas where we can really help in terms of innovation and research.
I think it is very helpful that Mr Tajani has provided us with information which makes it clear that the question of competitiveness is of the utmost importance in many areas of European policy.
In future, it will be very useful to use this as a criterion and to consider whether our political decisions will always, frequently or just often enough help or harm the development of industry in Europe.
I would like us not only to have a report and a topic for further debate, but also to change the way we act after this and to take this subject seriously, because industry is important.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
