Madam President, I have a question for Mr Reul.
This morning, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day.
Against this background, I would like to ask you what opportunities you think are available for women in the industrial policy of the future.
What chances do women have in industry, because I believe that we urgently need their contribution?
Which skills and qualifications would women be best advised to acquire in order to work in industry?
