Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many inspiring contributions.
Mr Tajani, the four key messages which bring us together are clear.
Firstly, we want to ensure that industrial policy lies at the heart of EU policy.
Secondly, we want to link together sustainability and competitiveness and develop them further.
Thirdly, we must not take a dogmatic approach, because this area cannot be regulated by the market alone or by the state alone.
We need practical, sensible measures.
Fourthly, this is just the beginning and not the end of the discussion on modernising industrial policy in the European Union.
We are extending a hand to you, Mr Tajani, but we are also aware that we must take you at your word.
We are expecting concrete legislative proposals and also concrete measures to provide financial support, particularly in the field of research.
Mr Tajani, if we are successful, and if the hand that we are extending to you and the statement that you have made are compatible, perhaps we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that at the end of the wonderful film 'Casablanca', when Humphrey Bogart says to the police captain: 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!'
