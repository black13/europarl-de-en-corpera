Madam President, Mr Oettinger, when we look at the fluctuations in prices on the energy markets over the last few weeks, we can see that not only the political risks presented by many countries, but also the financial markets and many other influencing factors make it impossible to develop a secure strategy for the future.
Therefore, we need to cut the energy cake into as many pieces as possible and it is clear that gas will continue to play a significant role in this respect in future.
Of course, we must focus on the efficient use of gas.
We need more efficiency not only in our production processes, but also in our consumption.
We must ensure that the charges resulting from CO2 emissions are paid by the consumer and not by the producers because otherwise, international competition will be distorted.
It should be of no significance to us whether the gas which produces CO2 is used inside or outside Europe.
Europe is the region with the greatest buying power.
If we import products with a high proportion of CO2 or transport them within Europe, this must not affect our competitiveness.
We also need to consider the importance of pipelines in future.
A pipeline is rather like a marriage.
Both partners have to be joined together for a long period in order to achieve a win-win situation.
