Mr President, this debate here in the European Parliament makes one thing clear, and that is that we are not neutral when it comes to this conflict.
We are on the side of the democratic revolution.
Gaddafi must go and Europe must play an active role in bringing that about.
There is a sharing of the workload here at the international level.
We are discussing a no-fly zone, something for which - as Mr Schulz correctly identified - the backing of the UN Security Council is required.
What do we do if Moscow and Beijing do not grant their assent?
Well, then we would have to close this loophole in international law.
We would have to take on the responsibility of protecting the unarmed population regardless, with the aid of the Arab League and the African Union, but also with the aid of an active role on the part of the European Union.
Military implementation would then be the responsibility of NATO and its partners, but politically and economically, the European Union would continue to also have the key role to play, long after, in such a scenario, NATO and the United Nations had finished playing their major roles.
There is one thing that I would like to say quite clearly, and that is that I was very pleased, Mr Schulz, to hear you say that we need a free trade zone.
This is because, if we do not allow these people's products into the EU, they will continue to come across the Mediterranean in coracles and in their masses to overwhelm Lampedusa.
We certainly do not want that.
Let us, therefore, create the free trade zone, let us allow the products into the EU, so that the people there also have an economic future in their democratised countries.
