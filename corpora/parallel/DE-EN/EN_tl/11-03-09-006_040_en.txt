Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all want to help the people of North Africa to achieve their legitimate objectives.
The people on the ground will choose the way forward, but we must be ready, if they ask us for help, with immediate humanitarian aid.
It is therefore a good thing that ECHO, the Humanitarian Aid department of the European Commission, is already on the ground in Tunisia and Egypt.
However, we are currently experiencing a real stress test in relation to the capacities and skills of the EU and its Member States, given that we have to do everything at once: fly our own citizens out, supply the basic needs of refugees from the neighbouring States and transport them home, deal with the refugees arriving in the EU by sea, and counter the illegitimate claim to power of a dictator.
What are the specific steps needed to de-legitimise Gaddafi?
The first is that we must jointly pull our ambassadors out of Tripoli.
The second is that we must recognise the Transitional National Council as the legitimate body with which we deal in Libya and reach agreement with it over the provision of humanitarian aid.
The third step is that our Member States in the Security Council should jointly table a motion to establish a no-fly zone which can be voted on within a short space of time.
The fourth step is that, if the Security Council is blocked by a veto, we should support the development of regional international law.
In other words, if the African Union, the Arab League and the EU all agree, we should find a joint way within the region to implement the no-fly zone by suitable means.
Of course, over the medium term, we must discuss how we could generate the opportunities for development in these countries, for example, via a free trade zone, so that people can find a future in their own homelands.
