Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have repeatedly had to put up with critical comments from this place.
I would like to take today's debate as an opportunity to clearly state that the European Union and, in particular, you personally and your staff, has and have acted quickly, well and efficiently throughout this crisis.
That has also brought Europe a step closer to the role that we envisage together as co-founders of a global world.
It is right and important to observe that the circumstances are different in each country, particularly in Libya.
In Libya's case, the European Union has taken a timely political stand against genocide and in favour of civil society.
The pressure on the Gaddafi regime has rightly been escalated in conjunction with NATO, the United Nations and others.
Clearly, military action, too, cannot be ruled out where undertaken within the framework of conventions under international law.
Moreover, humanitarian aid - meaning food, medical supplies, a roof over people's heads - must be provided for those forced to flee the war zone.
However, we also need to consider what happens on the first day of the post-Gaddafi era.
In this regard, I would like to refer, once more, to the Union for the Mediterranean Assembly in Rome, which has proposed some important positive steps - firstly, personal security for the citizens; secondly, political security - which includes close cooperation with the interim government; and, thirdly, economic security.
We must do everything in our power to ensure that economic life in these countries can return to normal and that the people find work.
