Mr President, I would just like to deal briefly once again with the issue of the Southern Neighbourhood Policy
and the proposals made by the Commission and Mrs Ashton yesterday.
I think what we are lacking is a realisation of what is still going on, for example, concerning our relations with Saudi Arabia and the negotiations with Syria.
How will you change them?
How will they be changed?
Will you continue with the status quo on these negotiations with Syria, and what will you do with Saudi Arabia?
How will we interact with these countries?
What I see as lacking in your proposal - which I think on the whole is good - is a process for how we will establish criteria for upgrading relations.
How will you do the 'we will pay more': based on what criteria and verified by whom?
I think we need a process like an enlargement process, with a Commission to set criteria and a Commission to verify them.
