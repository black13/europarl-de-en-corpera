Mr President, I find it remarkable that unease now reigns in the majority of the groups in this House in respect of approving the use of a fast-track procedure for the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
This report clearly confirms our expectation as MEPs that any future crisis-management mechanism will not create parallel structures outside the Union and that parliamentary democratic supervision should be maintained at every stage.
It is just that I find myself somewhat lacking in belief in this regard.
Mr Barroso did make clear yesterday that he supports both the goal of social cohesion within the Union and the Community method.
All the speakers agreed with him.
Thus far, however, this has not been made into a motion for a resolution and that, it strikes me, is something lacking.
What there was - or not - was the Merkel-Sarkozy pact.
That awakens my mistrust and a certain degree of scepticism.
For my group, it is clear that we cannot give our approval to any policy that aims to consolidate the budget by means of further cuts in the social sphere.
The European Parliament must first be given a vote on the specific proposals for the Union's future economic and monetary policy and the related mechanisms, as these are what this is about at its core.
That, in turn, is such a fundamental decision that it must not be taken on the basis of 'Europe by decree' but only in accordance with the convention method laid down by the Treaty.
My group is thus unable to vote in favour of what is, in many respects, a positive report.
Ultimately, despite constant assertions to the contrary, this would, of course, set a precedent.
