Mr President, we must not forget, in this debate, that we are dealing with a simplified Treaty revision pursuant to Article 136 and that we, as Parliament - in connection with whatever mechanisms - are supposed to be more heavily involved.
That is the starting point.
A wish list has been put forward in this regard.
I would like to give my specific backing to Mr Brok when he says that the participation of the Commission and of Parliament must be envisaged.
That is why we are having this debate and will not be taking a decision until 24 March, in order to give the Council the chance to actually bring about that participation in reality.
The full inclusion of the Commission throws up questions, as the Commission has failed, in the past, to observe its obligation to act as guardian of the Treaties by failing to instigate proceedings.
The Member States themselves have likewise failed to observe their obligations.
It is therefore imperative that, in this simplified Treaty revision, we take a new step towards completing economic and monetary union.
I also have an idea of how that can be brought about, which is for the Commission to prepare everything - including proposals and drafts - on behalf of the Council, and the Council to then be obliged, much like in the monetary dialogue that we have with the independent European Central Bank, to report to us here and discuss matters with us.
That would be a sensible approach.
