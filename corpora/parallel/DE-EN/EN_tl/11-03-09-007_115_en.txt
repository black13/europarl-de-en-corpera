Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are now three different economic governance packages before us: the Commission's six proposals, the competitiveness pact - currently being negotiated under the leadership of Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso - and the proposals to amend the Treaty and the associated establishment of the European stability mechanism.
It is clear, after this debate, that all of this must take place under parliamentary supervision and on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.
The fact is though, that, under the Treaties, Parliament has different rights in relation to the three different packages.
At the same time, these packages do overlap.
What should we do politically, therefore?
In my view, it is crucial that we link our consent for the Commission's six proposals to having our demands met in the other areas, so that everything becomes one well-balanced package in the interests of the citizens.
