Mr President, what happened today was not a victory for the Brussels camp over the Strasbourg camp, as we also reduced the number of Brussels sittings by one.
The score is therefore Brussels 1 Strasbourg 1.
However, ladies and gentlemen, we voted against the law - the decision to hold the August and October plenary sessions in one week each is illegal, as the Treaty states that there must be monthly plenary sessions.
Equally, this cannot be justified as a cost saving, as the costs - which, by the way, amount to EUR 70 million, which is plenty - do not arise as a result of Strasbourg, but rather because activities are continually being rerouted, contrary to the Treaty, into the shadows of Brussels' bureaucracy.
Were we to concentrate our work in Strasbourg, we would both save money and have an independent democratic face in Europe!
