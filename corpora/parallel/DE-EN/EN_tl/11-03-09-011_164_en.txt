Mr President, I asked to speak on the budget negotiations because I believe that the European Parliament does not always receive fair treatment in this connection.
As MEPs, we, too, need to support economising, but it is also quite simply the case that we must fulfil our responsibilities properly.
The proposed increase in the budget for the European Parliament, which is far below the rate of inflation, is thus not a reasonable one.
It takes no account, for example, of the increase in the number of members of this House by 18, of the fact that we must fund the accession of Croatia, or of the other investments that we have to make.
I assume that, ultimately, a sound compromise will be found on this issue.
