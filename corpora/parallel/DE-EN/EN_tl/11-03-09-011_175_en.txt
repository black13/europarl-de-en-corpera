Mr President, I abstained from voting on the progress report on Turkey, but not because I do not agree with its analysis - despite some reforms, the criticism of press censorship, violations of human rights, the Turkish electoral system and the freedom of religion do speak for themselves.
The reason I abstained from voting was that I believe that the European Parliament must be much clearer in its response.
If Turkey refuses to make crucial reforms, we must bring a halt to negotiations on membership.
It is time that this House called for the cessation of accession negotiations.
