Mr President, though I share Mr Pieper's concerns, I voted in favour of this report, as we have stated quite clearly once again - at the beginning of the report - that, for us, the negotiations are a long process with no predetermined result.
We rejected the motion by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which sought to specify accession, as we did similar motions by the Socialists in previous years.
This House therefore found the right line.
We should take the next step soon, however, and tell Turkey quite honestly, as Mr Pieper said, that as far as we are concerned Turkish accession is simply out of the question as it would overburden Turkey and overstretch the European Union.
A politically integrated Europe including Turkey as a member is not possible.
It is a grand delusion that we must finally step away from.
As for the progress in question, it is in the interests of Turkey itself, a country that is a member of the Council of Europe and NATO and our closest ally.
