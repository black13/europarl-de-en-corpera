Mr President, when it comes to enlargement policy, we need something along the lines of a regulatory framework.
We must, therefore, complete the negotiations with Croatia by June, as planned, and then get the accession process for that country under way in the autumn with our vote.
We want Croatia to be in the European Union by next year or, at the latest, the year after that.
Things have to go on then, too, but how?
We need to integrate the small but difficult remainder of South-Eastern Europe.
First of all, there is Macedonia, and then Montenegro.
This is a signal to all the other States in the region that, if they fulfil the criteria, they too have a place in our ranks.
Unlike Turkey, these are European States to the core, and as such, they naturally have a future within our Community.
Montenegro, in particular, is a small country with a major European tradition.
I look forward already to the negotiations with Montenegro!
