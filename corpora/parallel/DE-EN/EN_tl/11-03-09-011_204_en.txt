Mr President, I consider it to be very important that we should be able to debate this report and also to vote on it today.
It would be best, of course, if crises simply did not occur, but it would be worse if no lessons were learnt from crises when they do occur.
It is precisely because we learnt from the last crisis that we are getting involved in industrial policy in the European Union again, especially as, before the last crisis, there were quite a large number of people who believed that money could be easily earned with money.
Economic and industrial policy, after all, is critical to our prosperity in the European Union.
I therefore believe it is extraordinarily important that we have engaged on this issue.
It is a good thing, of course, to be involved in innovation and future-oriented industrial policy, but I think it is just as important that we have emphasised our traditional industry in this report.
I am very pleased by this and I hope that we will continue to discuss this issue.
