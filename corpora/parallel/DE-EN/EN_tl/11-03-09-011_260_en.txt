The expenditure ceiling for the multiannual financial framework of the European Union budget for 2012 was increased once again.
Particularly in times when citizens have to tighten their belts, the European Union, too, must make savings.
There are plenty of opportunities to make savings, from abandoning one of the seats of Parliament, to reducing the morass of EU agencies, to improving the fight against fraud within the aid programmes.
Labelling it as due to the economic and financial crisis, the European Union has simply put a few plans on hold but not made any real savings, despite selling these acts as major savings.
This is more than unfair towards European citizens and it is just as unfair to justify all the additional costs on the basis of the greater demands under the Treaty of Lisbon.
For these reasons, I voted against the budget report.
