This report includes an increase in the expenditure ceiling for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the European Union's budget in 2012.
As a result of the economic and financial crisis, the citizens in the Member States were urged to accept austerity measures and thus to bear the major part of the impact of the crisis.
The EU, too, should reduce its expenditure.
This begins with the uncontrolled growth of agencies, goes on to the pre-accession aid for Turkey and continues through to the expensive duplicate structures and administration costs as a result of the European External Action Service.
I therefore voted against this report.
