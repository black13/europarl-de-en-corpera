The guidelines for the 2012 budget procedure consist of assorted individual sections drawn together under the headings 'economy' and 'consolidation'.
Many citizens in Europe, like their national governments, have been forced into economy and restricted spending by the consequences of the financial and economic crisis.
In this situation, it is more than justified that the European Parliament should lead by example with its proposed budget for 2012.
In 2012, the EU will be faced with new - and inevitable - expenditure.
This is dependent on the potential accession of Croatia, the newly created European External Action Service and the three financial agencies.
In order to stop the automatic process of increased budgetary demands equating to an increase in the budget, now is the time that potential savings in the EU budget must be identified.
This should include, for example, a business analysis of the Union's agencies and an evaluation of EU bodies' human resources and buildings policies.
