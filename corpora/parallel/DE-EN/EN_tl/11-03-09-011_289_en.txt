Five Member States of the European Union border the Atlantic.
France, Portugal and Spain, in particular, certainly do not see only benefits from this geographical fact, as the Atlantic plays a not insignificant role when it comes to the streams of refugees that now threaten to increase as a result of the crises in the countries of North Africa.
People-smugglers are all too keen to use the Atlantic route, since Spain's border fence was erected in 2005.
In order to prevent a flood of predominantly economic migrants, the EU would be well advised to quickly develop an effective Atlantic strategy that also covers this aspect, even though the remaining two Atlantic States - the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland - bear little to no impact in this regard.
As the resolution hardly, if at all, covers this area, I abstained from the vote.
