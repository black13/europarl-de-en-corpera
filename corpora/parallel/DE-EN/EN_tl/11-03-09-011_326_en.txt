The progress report on the accession negotiations with Turkey was, once again, more than sobering.
Given the circumstances, however, what else could be expected?
Turkey is not a European country - geographically, culturally or historically - and it has a different approach to many issues for these reasons.
All of this being the case, it always astounds me how this House manages to produce such politically correct and positive resolutions on this subject.
The truth is never allowed to be stated and clear words are to be avoided if at all possible.
It is really time to come clean with Turkey.
It must be made clear to the Turks that they are our friends and partners in many areas but that accession to the EU is just not possible.
Rational forces in Turkey have long since recognised that accession to the European Union is not the most worthwhile goal for them.
In light of its location and the manifold connections with the Turkic peoples of the Caucasus and with the Arabs, Turkey is assuming an important strategic position in the Middle East.
The EU should take account of this and recognise Turkey as an important strategic partner beyond its borders.
