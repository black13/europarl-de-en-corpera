The progress report on Turkey very clearly shows up the weaknesses in the process in place hitherto.
Turkey clearly lags behind expectations.
There must also be no accession discounts, as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been calling for.
In this context, also, Mr ErdoÄŸan's appearances in Germany, where he called on the Turks in Germany to un-integrate, must be viewed in a critical light.
Such speeches are not helpful for good cooperation and represent a snub to the efforts of both Germany and the Union.
Furthermore, there is still much to be desired in relation to the freedom of the press and the resolution of the Cyprus issue.
