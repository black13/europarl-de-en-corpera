I voted in favour of the 2010 progress report on Turkey, which turned out to be clearly negative.
According to the report, over the past 5 years, Turkey has made hardly any progress worth mentioning in its process of reform or in meeting the EU's accession criteria.
There are still considerable failings in the fields of human rights, freedom of the press and of opinion, and women's rights.
As a member of the High-Level Contact Group for Relations with the Turkish Cypriot Community in the Northern Part of the Island of Cyprus, I am well aware that the same applies to the unresolved problem of Cyprus.
