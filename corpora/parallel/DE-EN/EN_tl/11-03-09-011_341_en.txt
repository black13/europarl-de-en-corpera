I voted in favour of this report, but I did so only because it very specifically makes clear that there is no progress in the accession negotiations with Turkey.
On the contrary, indeed, essentially what we have is a standstill or even steps backwards in relation to the observance of civil and human rights, freedom of religion, of assembly and of the press, and on the Cyprus issue.
In fact, Turkey's new foreign policy direction, for example, as relates to Iran and Syria, gives rise to doubts about whether Turkey's Prime Minister ErdoÄŸan is really serious when he talks about moving closer to Europe.
Furthermore, it remains unclear how the billions of euro of pre-accession aid paid to Turkey are being spent.
There is only one conclusion from all of this, and that is that the accession negotiations must be halted.
Turkey remains one of the EU's most important partners.
The idea of its full membership, however, is becoming increasingly illusory.
