There is constantly a tension that is not always easily reconcilable between respect for human rights and other national interests (perhaps of a military or economic nature).
Even the United States and the European Union step over this fine line from time to time, as can be seen from the infringement of civil liberties and data protection in the context of the fight against terrorism.
The EU must therefore stand up more strongly and consistently for human rights within and outside the Union.
Outside the Union, I have in mind especially the protection of Christian minorities in Islamic countries and in Asia.
I therefore voted for this motion for a resolution.
