I voted for the motion for a resolution, because the report states quite clearly that since gaining its independence in 2006, Montenegro has made significant progress in internal reforms.
However, we must not be blind to the fact that there are, as always, serious problems with corruption and organised crime, freedom of expression and discrimination.
Nevertheless, at the same time, the report explains that the government of Montenegro is prepared to tackle these problem areas effectively, and has introduced a package of suitable and appropriate measures.
