While the majority society in the EU is rapidly ageing, the Roma are recording a rapid increase in population.
In Hungary, where the Roma currently make up between 6% and 8% of the population, they will exceed 50% of the working population by 2050.
All the worse, therefore, that Roma life in the EU is characterised, as it always has been, by unemployment, a level of education that is greatly below average, organised crime and prostitution, as well as retreat into a parallel society.
The situation of women in often archaic Roma society is particularly dramatic, and their lack of education and, hence, their exclusion from the labour market is so much the greater.
The report before us admittedly addresses some of the problems, however one-sidedly.
Integration is not a one-way street.
The Roma must make their contribution, send their children to school, integrate themselves better into the labour market and put an end to criminal tendencies.
I therefore voted against the report.
