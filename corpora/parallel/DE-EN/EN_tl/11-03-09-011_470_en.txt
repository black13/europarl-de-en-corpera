I voted for the report because I am convinced that an integrated industrial policy for Europe is indispensable, especially in the face of the new challenges brought about by globalisation, and a further development of industrial policy is therefore necessary.
Industrial policy serves as a driver for sustainable employment and the prosperity of society.
A single job in industry creates at least two more jobs.
Europe's position in industrial policy is increasingly being put in doubt as a result of increasing industrialisation in the emerging countries and the growing strength of our largest competitors, like the US and China.
We must therefore develop more ourselves; for that to be the case, we need to make sure to renew our industrial base by taking steps in specific sectors, but also by guaranteeing, in broad terms, the competitiveness of Europe on a global level and the sustainable growth of European industry.
The report also calls for an integrated industrial policy to serve as the foundation for environmental, competition and trade policy, in order to improve resource efficiency.
In addition, the report highlights the importance of a constructive partnership with workers and trade union organisations.
The need to improve coordination between the EU and the Member States is also emphasised in the report.
I consider these measures to be absolutely necessary.
This report makes provision for the further development of industrial policy to be approached with the necessary ambition and prudence.
