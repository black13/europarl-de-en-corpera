In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds.
However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves.
Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects.
This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds.
