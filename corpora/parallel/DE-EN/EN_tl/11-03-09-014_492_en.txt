Mr President, the report before us, on which all groups have worked intensively together, represents a very good basis on which the EU can construct its Iran policy.
The various issues on which we disagree with the Iranian Government are dealt with as a single overall challenge: the nuclear programme and Iran's relations with its neighbours, the catastrophic human rights situation in the country and the difficult economic situation.
Unemployment has risen to enormous proportions; one in four Iranians is living below the poverty line.
Baroness Ashton, you must now draw some conclusions from the report.
We Europeans must not stand by while critics of the regime, trade unionists, women's rights workers and those of different faiths are detained, tortured and murdered.
We must try, plainly harder than before, to put pressure on those responsible for human rights violations, through targeted sanctions, such as restricting entry or freezing their accounts.
The European External Action Service must equally examine which economic sanctions actually hit the target and which of them merely impact upon the Iranian people.
A policy of complete isolation will just lead us up a dead end and also fails to find favour with many Iranians.
Parliament has, with this report, made it unmistakeably clear that democratic change cannot be brought about by external military means.
We must stick to a double-track strategy going forward, under which we try to engage in dialogue while unambiguously insisting on respect for universal rights and compliance with international treaties.
It is in this context that we must understand the demand to open an EU delegation in Tehran now that the European External Action Service has taken over responsibility from the rotating Presidency of the EU for representing the EU in third countries.
