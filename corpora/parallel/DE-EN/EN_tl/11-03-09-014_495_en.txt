Mr President, the Belder report has been considerably improved by the amendments, and my group can agree with a great number of statements.
Unfortunately, for all that they are correct, it primarily contains descriptions of the situation, but the underlying philosophy of a realistic future perspective has not been developed.
The human rights situation in Iran is intolerable.
However, sanctions will not bring about a lasting improvement in this situation.
In order to promote democratisation in Iran, we must do everything we can to make the international situation less tense.
Worsening international relations brings with it the danger that further anti-democratic measures will be taken inside Iran, which will result in weakening the opposition.
A policy of detente would also have to put an end to every form of threatening behaviour.
Negotiations and international relations can only be successful if diplomatic recognition of all partners is a given.
Only in this way can meaningful compromises in the dispute on the nuclear programme be achieved.
I have set out our ideas for a carefully targeted Iran strategy in an alternative motion for a resolution, and on the grounds that I have described, I shall call for the Belder report to be rejected.
