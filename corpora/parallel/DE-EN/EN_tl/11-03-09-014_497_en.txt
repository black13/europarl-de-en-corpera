Mr President, as is well known, it remains open to doubt whether the Iranian nuclear programme is really intended for peaceful purposes.
For this reason, Iran's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency is particularly important.
It is crucial in order to confirm to the international community that Iran is applying nuclear energy for civil purposes.
With regard to Middle East policy, it is up to Mr Ahmadinejad finally to make it clear that Iran poses no threat to Israel and also that it recognises Israel's right to exist within the borders recognised by international law.
Disarmament and the creation of a nuclear-free zone should, in my opinion, be an important goal of the EU's Middle East policy, in order to guarantee peace and security in this region.
Iran is naturally an important player in the Middle East.
With this in mind, I am pleased to gather from Mr Belder's most comprehensive report that there is constructive cooperation with the EU on the question of Afghanistan in order to increase security and stability in this region.
It is only in this way that we can remove the breeding ground from radical Islam or Islamism, which is rearing its ugly head increasingly often in Europe too.
