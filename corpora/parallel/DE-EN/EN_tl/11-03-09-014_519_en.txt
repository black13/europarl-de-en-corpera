Mr President, the green revolution and the latest protests demonstrate quite clearly that there is great potential for civil society in Iran.
This must be supported, for it is the only way that a democratic opening can develop.
Unfortunately, sanctions often hit precisely this young and active civil society.
The holding of Tests of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL tests) has been abandoned, for example.
This test is, however, a prerequisite for study at most Anglo-American universities.
The victims of this abandonment are thus internationally minded students.
The report uncritically proposes further sanctions, such as restrictions on the export of technology for mobile phone and communications networks, yet it is precisely these rapid communications and information technologies that are needed to spread pluralistic ideas.
Ultimately, it will be the third countries China, Russia and India, who will carry on doing business, exporting and securing raw materials for themselves, and who will unfortunately not comply with these sanctions, who will be left laughing.
