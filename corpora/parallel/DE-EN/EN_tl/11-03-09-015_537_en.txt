Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, human rights, liberty and equality are far too important for all of us to allow games to be played with them, for them to be put in the balance against powerful interests, and for commercial interests perhaps to take precedence over these values that are so important.
They deserve our full commitment and it is incredibly important for the international community to help in matters relating to human rights quickly, efficiently and in a targeted way.
The Human Rights Council is on the right track here.
We have seen that the mission to Tunisia made sense and the mission to Egypt made sense.
Libya's loss of its seat on the Human Rights Council was a proper and important signal that things could not go on in this way.
However, it is also the case that missions, resolutions and perhaps other things that happen in this way, have been knocked flat.
You are quite right, Baroness Ashton: it is not enough to decide to do something, we must also take care that it is implemented.
The European Union could still make a greater contribution here than it does at the moment.
However, it is also essential that the United Nations accept that after the Treaty of Lisbon, the position of the European Union has altered.
Baroness Ashton, I should like to ask you to ensure that especially those who have always called themselves our friends and whom we also call our friends, and for whom we show great consideration (particularly when it comes to trade policy), to remember in future that they are our friends and not to leave the European Union in the lurch, as they did in the vote in September.
