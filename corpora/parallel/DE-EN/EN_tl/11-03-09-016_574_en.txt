Mr President, the contrast is striking!
The revolution, the change taking place in the Arab world is fascinating for all of us.
We are trying to help.
We have discussed Libya today.
In recent days and weeks, we have discussed Egypt and Tunisia.
Yet, at the same time, we have a standstill in the peace process.
Against this backdrop, we must say quite clearly here, Baroness Ashton, that you did us a service when you managed to convene a meeting of the Quartet.
To produce movement now, at this period of profound insecurity in the region, and profound insecurity in Israel, was an extremely positive service.
I should like to make this very clear.
You occasionally have to endure criticism from this House, too.
For this reason, some praise is perhaps also in order.
As far as the contents are concerned, I should like to make it clear that I do not believe that Israel is sceptically disposed towards democracy in Arab countries.
It is merely that these changes have not yet come to an end.
When and if there are democracies there, I agree completely with Mr PÃ¶ttering and with you too, Mr Swoboda, then there will clearly be a great opportunity finally to get the Middle East peace process going too.
Settlement building must stop, that is clear in any case, as must the sophistry with which it is defended.
There is a consensus among all groups in this House on that point.
Connected to the uprising in the Arab world, we also have experienced protests against the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip.
The situation in the Palestinian Territories is in no way simple.
Democratisation must succeed here too.
For the time being, we fortunately have a moderate and conservative partner in the West Bank, but that is absolutely not the case in the Gaza Strip.
