Mr President, Mr Tannock referred to the Iranian ships that passed through the Suez Canal.
My question to Baroness Ashton, the High Representative, is: is it certain that Egypt has no possibility at all under international law to deny passage to the ships, whether it wished to or not?
I only wanted to ask whether it was based on international law or whether some political connection is involved here.
