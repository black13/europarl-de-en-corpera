Mr President, Commissioner Hahn, the proposals that are now on the table are like putting a large rucksack on the backs of all those who are already finding things difficult enough and telling them they have to run faster with it on.
How is that supposed to happen?
The proposals for decentralised wage negotiations are unfair, unimaginative and they are a diversionary tactic, because it is so difficult to tax asset and financial speculation and the Heads of State or Government are not succeeding in getting genuine macro-economic coordination off the ground.
In this regard, we in Parliament have already set a very different benchmark this week with our vote on the financial transactions tax.
I would like to remind you all of the principle of the social market economy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
My conception of the social market economy is rather different - it would not include decentralised wage negotiations, quite the opposite, in fact.
Decentralised wage negotiation systems are contrary to a wage policy based on solidarity and rather than leading to the gap between rich and poor getting smaller, they will - on the contrary - result in it getting bigger.
In other words, we should do the opposite.
I would therefore like to expressly repeat what my colleague, Mrs Steinruck, said - we cannot repeat it often enough: we must take more action to tackle the cause of the crisis; make those who caused the crisis pay to a greater extent; and focus on them for the resolution of these problems, including by means of legislative measures.
