Mr President, the concept of disaster prevention, particularly where our Hungarian friends are concerned, clearly deserves a great deal of attention because something went wrong when dealing with the toxic sludge disaster in Hungary last October.
In its report, the Commission found there to be clear failings on the part of the local authorities, which failed to classify the hazardous wastewater and made major errors in connection with construction work on the reservoir.
The Commission also found that the European Waste Catalogue - the Mining Waste Directives - had not been transposed into Hungarian law.
It is therefore important for the individual Member States to incorporate European standards into their legal standards in a binding manner.
In addition to disaster prevention, the proper application of these European standards is also important, as is the exchange of best practice and helping the Member States to help themselves.
Particularly during this Year of Volunteering, it is important and right for the Member States to go some way towards modelling themselves on the example of those Member States that have nationwide voluntary fire brigades, rescue services, etc.
