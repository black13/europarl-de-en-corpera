Mr President, Commissioner Hahn, we are very well aware of the factors that have led to an increase in the number of disasters in recent years: we know about climate change, the explosive industrialisation in developing countries and the growing world population, among other things.
However, it is also the case that many disasters are simply caused by man, and in this regard, we have to say that the 'polluter pays' principle should be applied.
To always immediately call for help from the Union is the wrong way to go.
However, European solidarity is indeed called for, of course, where disasters genuinely occur as a result of force majeure, when genuine natural disasters happen.
In this regard, there is no doubt that our European solidarity should start with prevention - for example, in connection with protective structures to prevent avalanches, flood defences, mapping and monitoring systems.
In addition, we really should have something like a European 'disaster service' that can be deployed if assistance is needed very quickly in order to avoid the severest of consequences.
