Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the volcanic ash of last year showed us in an impressive way where our weaknesses lie.
The question therefore arises as to how we should deal with such situations in the future.
It is, of course, first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane.
Of course, we must also keep in mind how we intend to deal with the financial losses.
My question to the Commission is therefore - Mr Hahn, perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas - what, in specific terms, are we planning?
I would argue that it is particularly important for us to take over the coordination when it comes to test flights and limit values.
That is very important in order for us to know which aeroplanes can take off and when.
I have another comment, Commissioner: it is extremely important - and this has already been referred to many times - to establish the Single European Sky.
What does the Commission intend to do in terms of exerting pressure on the Member States to actually fulfil their obligation in this regard?
After all, they have put their signatures to it.
Another important point, which has already been made several times today, is what happens now with regard to passengers' rights in air transport.
We have Regulation (EC) No 2061 from 2004.
What does the Commission intend to do in this regard?
We are aware of the problem of the financial losses suffered by the various airlines.
I would also like to point out once again that we need alternatives to air transport, and by that I mean the rail system.
I am also one of those who believe that we must link the large cities - Europe's capital cities - together.
In this case, too, the answer is that we need more involvement from Europe, not less.
I would be pleased if the Commission would give its attention to these issues.
