Mr President, Mr Hahn, I am not a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism either, but I believe that it is important for all of us to learn lessons from the ash crisis.
As has already been said today, 'safety first' must, in future, be the guiding concept when it comes to finding a solution.
We need to develop the railways and we need to develop a European rail network.
However, we also need a form of overall coordination for passenger and freight transport, irrespective of whether it is by air, rail or road, in the event of earthquakes, ash clouds, floods or similar disasters.
National contact points, like those we are now setting up in the health sector for cross-border patient care, would seem an almost obvious solution to this - national contact points to which people of all generations can turn.
The fact is that I can also see a certain intergenerational inequality at the moment in air transport.
It is almost impossible these days to obtain information without the Internet.
We should work together to resolve this issue, too.
