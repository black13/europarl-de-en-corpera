on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Daul talked about reality.
Well, it is reality that the Hungarian Government or the Hungarian Parliament has amended the law, and that is a good thing, because I can remember the debate in this Chamber when some people said - including you, Mr Daul - that nothing needed to be amended; everything was fine.
Suddenly, it now needs to be amended.
(Applause from the left)
However, it is also reality - and you can read this, too - that both the media freedom representative of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the representative of the Council of Europe say that these amendments are inadequate.
That is the reality, Mr Daul.
That is the reality.
(Applause from the left)
In our group's meeting yesterday evening, which I chaired, we discussed the law and the amendments and - like the OSCE and the Council of Europe - we came to the conclusion that these amendments are inadequate.
Whatever decision is made today - whether you win, Mr Daul, or whether we win - we will not give up the fight for freedom of the media, Mr Lange.
If you do so, that is your business.
(Applause from the left)
Freedom of the media is an inviolable element of democracy.
We want democracy and we want freedom of the media.
We therefore ask you to vote accordingly today.
We know that there are also some Members in your group who agree with us.
We must fight for freedom of the media - in Hungary and elsewhere, too.
(Applause from the left)
