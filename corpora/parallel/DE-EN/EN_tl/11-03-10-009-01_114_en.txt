Mr President, we have been addressed specifically here.
Of course, we have confidence in Commissioner Kroes's work.
Her examination of the secondary law was exemplary.
We wish the Commissioner examining the primary law had done her work in the same way, as this is where the problem lies.
(Applause from the left)
The reality of the situation includes those things just mentioned by Mr Swoboda, namely that, in the opinion of both the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the amendments are inadequate.
Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Administration and Justice, Mr Navracsics, has himself admitted that this was not a significant amendment of the media law.
I could mention the protection of journalistic sources, which still remains unregulated, or the composition and powers of the media authority.
All of these are matters that still need to be discussed.
I would therefore like to state, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that we will not withdraw the motion for a resolution, but rather request that the vote take place.
