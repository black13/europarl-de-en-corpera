I am convinced that a very broad majority in the European Parliament will uphold the fundamental rights of the media.
These rights are now being called for in a resolution, although the amendments to this law which were adopted this week in the Hungarian Parliament have not been taken into account.
I would therefore have liked all resolutions that were drawn up before this vote in Budapest to be withdrawn in order for them first to be updated and only then to be debated and put to the vote.
Consequently, the vote in the European Parliament no longer had anything to do with freedom of the press, which should have absolutely priority, but was simply a trial of strength between the groups.
