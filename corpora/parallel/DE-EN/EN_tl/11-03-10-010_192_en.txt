I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution.
Although Hungary and the European Commission have reached an agreement on the points put forward by the Commission, I support the call made by my fellow Members for a thorough examination of the text of the law.
The improvements achieved by the Commission are remarkably selective and the concerns expressed by Parliament and by various international organisations, such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe, have been largely disregarded.
The concern about the appointment, composition and powers of the media authority, in particular, is perfectly understandable.
Freedom of the press is too important a part of our democracy for it to be subjected to legally restrictive interpretations.
