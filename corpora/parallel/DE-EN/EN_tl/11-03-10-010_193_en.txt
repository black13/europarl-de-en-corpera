in writing. - I voted against this resolution tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
The motion's authors are not as concerned about freedom of the media in Europe as they are of disparaging a civic government that was elected by an overwhelming majority of its country's people and which has the difficult task of rebuilding a country that suffered badly as a result of mismanagement by the previous socialist government.
Even the European Commission was unable to find any serious violations of the freedom of the media in the Hungarian law, which, incidentally, has already been amended.
Europe's left is very quick to see the speck of sawdust in the eye of non-socialist governments, but stupidly pays no attention to the plank in the eyes of socialist governments.
It is difficult to understand the position of the German Liberals, who, with this resolution, are calling for regulation of the media landscape at European level, whereas the German and European media representatives consider this proposal, in particular, to be a restriction of media freedom and an infringement of subsidiarity.
