In the fight to retain power, Gaddafi is using heavier and heavier artillery (such as the bombing of rebels) and is not afraid of a high death toll.
These measures have been condemned in the strongest possible terms by the outside world, and the European Parliament is calling for a no-fly zone, in order to stop Gaddafi's bombers from attacking civilians, recognition of the Interim Transitional National Council and the pro-democracy movement as legitimate representatives of the Libyan people and the breaking off of all relations with Gaddafi.
It remains to be seen whether the Heads of State or Government will comply with this call.
On account of the possible resettlement and distribution of migrants in Europe, I abstained from the vote.
