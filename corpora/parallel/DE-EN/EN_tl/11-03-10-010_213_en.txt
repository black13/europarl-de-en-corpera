I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution.
As an immediate neighbour and being under an obligation to comply with the principles of international law, which also include the right of peoples to self-determination, it is essential that we provide assistance to the people of North Africa.
The method for doing so should, however, be chosen carefully: the request by the Libyan Interim Transitional National Council to refrain from direct military intervention must be respected also so as not to make the humanitarian situation of civilians even worse.
