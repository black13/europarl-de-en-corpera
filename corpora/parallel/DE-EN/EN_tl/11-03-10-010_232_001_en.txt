I voted in favour of the report by Mr Belder on the EU's approach towards Iran.
I share the concerns of the majority of Europeans with regard to Iran's nuclear programme and the assurances of the Iranian regime that it will only be used for civilian purposes.
That notwithstanding, I am of the opinion that, in its cooperation with third countries in the energy sector, the European Union should only make use of sustainable, green and safe energy sources - in keeping with its climate protection targets.
I also support the opinion of my fellow Member that the EU should devise a broader strategy towards Iran which goes beyond the nuclear issue and also addresses the human rights situation and other important matters.
