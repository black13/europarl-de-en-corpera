I have just voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the priorities of the 16th Session of the UN Human Rights Council.
Our resolution is particularly significant because we have today remembered the suppression of peaceful protests against the violent occupation of Tibet 52 years ago.
The Dalai Lama announced his withdrawal from political life yesterday - this represents an historic loss.
There are few people who are held in such high esteem by their own people and the world at large and who, at the same time, are so well liked as His Holiness.
By withdrawing from political life, the Dalai Lama is in no way relinquishing his responsibility.
He has stated that he continues to be committed to his spiritual role in relation to the concerns of the Tibetan people.
His Holiness will transfer the political powers laid down in the Tibetan constitution to the freely elected government-in-exile.
In this way, he will once again strengthen the democracy of the exiled Tibetan people, who are spread across all of the continents of the world.
On 20 March, a new prime minister and a new parliament will be elected.
I will witness the elections in Switzerland as an observer.
We Europeans must help to further strengthen democracy and human rights for the Tibetan people.
