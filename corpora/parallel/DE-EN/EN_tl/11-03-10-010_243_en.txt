The unrest in Maghreb gives us a very stark reminder that it is not easy to defend human rights and that this often conflicts with economic and/or military interests.
Similarly, measures are taken in the name of combating terrorism that are not compatible with human rights.
In this regard, the EU also needs to take a look at its own behaviour - for example, in the case of the illegal CIA overflights.
Despite these shortcomings, it remains important for the EU in particular to devote itself to the protection of human rights.
Protection of the rights of minorities, particularly the improvement of the situation for Christians and other religious minorities in Muslim countries, must be a particular concern of the European Union, with Christians in particular being subjected to severe persecution and being the main victims of religious violence.
In view of this, I voted in favour.
