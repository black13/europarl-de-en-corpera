I voted in favour of the resolution on the priorities of the 16th Session of the UN Human Rights Council.
I share the opinion that the Human Rights Council could be extremely valuable as a kind of 'early warning system' and preventive mechanism, and I expect the External Action Service to involve itself accordingly in this body.
With regard to the review of the Human Rights Council, I obviously also support the call for an all-inclusive and, above all, transparent process.
