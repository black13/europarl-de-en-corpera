Mr President, a week before he was murdered, I spoke with Shahbaz Bhatti in his office in Islamabad and he was aware of the danger he was in.
However, he was more concerned about his impression that, particularly in recent months, also in connection with the murder of Salman Taseer, the Punjab Governor, many people have shied away from the challenge of the extremists.
Ministers, parliamentarians, journalists, lawyers, even human rights activists, who have always got involved before, no longer have the confidence to stand up against the challenge of these extremists.
I believe we must call on everyone in Pakistan to stand up against this intolerance, otherwise they will be swept aside together or individually.
Sherry Rehman, that courageous politician who put forward amendments to the blasphemy law, is in particular danger.
I therefore call on the Pakistani Parliament to protect her now by finally making the amendments to the blasphemy law that she proposed.
That would clearly signal a united stand against extremism.
