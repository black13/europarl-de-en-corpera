Mr President, Commissioner Hahn, culture and identity must clearly be placed centre stage at global level.
Just this week, Karl Habsburg explained to us how important it is in the search for identity for this cultural heritage not only to be available to the Uyghurs, but also for it to be a global asset.
China should make a concessionary gesture in this regard.
For example, we have recently entered into an agreement with the town of Wenzhou enabling direct investments to be made in dollars in future.
I see an opportunity here for the focus also to be placed on this region and for people in the different cities and regions of China to have equal rights.
International relations can indeed provide a great deal of help here.
