Mr President, first of all I would like to defend the journalist.
I think what has happened deserves to be praised.
Are you aware, Mr Buzek, that there are going to be a dozen more cases?
Would you join us in recommending - as the Hans-Peter Martin's List would like to propose - that these fellow Members resign before they are exposed in the media in order to avoid causing further damage to the great European peace project?
I am therefore asking you to take this request into consideration in the Bureau and also to communicate it to the groups.
