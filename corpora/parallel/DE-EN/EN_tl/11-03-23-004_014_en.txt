Mr President, I would not have asked to take the floor had it not been for the speech before last.
I believe that zero tolerance applies to all Members of this House.
I would therefore like to ask the following question and I ask that a clear answer be given.
Can you, Mr President, or can the Secretary General of this Parliament confirm that Mr Martin is required to repay EUR 168 000 to the European Parliament following a ruling by the European Court of Justice in respect of irregular accounting?
(Applause)
