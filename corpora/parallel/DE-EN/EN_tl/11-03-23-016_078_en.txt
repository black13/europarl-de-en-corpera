Madam President, as an ardent pro-European - as are the great majority of my 500 000 direct voters - I find it very difficult to accept this predicament that you have placed yourself in.
On the one hand, we need stability and have to do something to counter speculation; on the other, the way in which you are doing this once again provides a fairly dramatic illustration of the democracy deficit in the European Union.
This procedure is more reminiscent of emergency legislation than of what we would like to see in a progressive Europe.
Naturally, I therefore emphatically supported Amendment 34, which was put forward by the left and which calls for the ordinary Treaty revision procedure to be applied.
Whenever there is an emergency you always manage to do something that in reality increases the gap between citizens further still.
I would also like to take this opportunity to reject in no uncertain terms the way that Mr Schulz conducts himself in this House with respect to me.
