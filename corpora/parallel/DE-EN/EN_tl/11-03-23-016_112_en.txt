Mr President, in his invitation to the European Council Mr Van Rompuy states that we will begin our working dinner by taking stock of events in Libya and in our southern neighbouring countries.
I hope that nobody chokes on this, but that instead we send out clear messages - and also united messages - concerning our aims to Colonel Gaddafi and to the people of Libya, but also to our own public, which is irritated by the lack of unity in the face of a dictator's hold on power.
It is right to expand our blacklist to include certain people and to freeze the accounts of the national Libyan oil company.
However, I would also like to have seen the EU rather than NATO remembering its own decisions as regards capacity and capability, and being able to implement the arms embargo using its Member States' naval forces.
After all, they are our neighbours.
Had we done so we would have avoided the recent stress involving Turkey at NATO and relieved the burden on our US allies.
I now hope that the planning of the EU's humanitarian missions will concentrate not just on the reception of war refugees on the Egyptian and Tunisian sides of the Libyan border, but that we will actively provide humanitarian aid in parts of Libya that have already been liberated from Colonel Gaddafi's power.
I believe this is necessary in order to make our intentions clear to those in Tripoli.
To the communist Member from Greece I would like to say that I have just heard from Moscow that Stalin is dead.
New directives are on their way from the politburo, but evidently you have not yet received them.
