in writing. - There is no such thing as good or bad debt; the continual rise in national debt must be stemmed.
Unfortunately, the Council has failed to implement the Stability and Growth Pact fully.
However, our citizens cannot be burdened with a further structural crisis.
The existing national debt problem can only be dealt with by demanding strict budgetary discipline.
The procedure adopted by the Member States of applying the 'fast-track procedure' is to be rejected, but as Mr Gualtieri has already said, if we are to come up with a counter-proposal then we must concentrate on the substance.
I would welcome an initiative in which the 143 nuclear power plants in Europe were immediately taken out of the grid and sustainable energy sources were used instead.
To comment briefly on the imminent stress tests at the nuclear energy facilities: since - as is repeatedly emphasised - the detailed safety arrangements at nuclear power plants fall within the competence of the individual Member States, I cannot unreservedly support these stress tests at this early stage in the negotiations.
In view of the events triggered in 1986 by a crisis simulation at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, I would view such tests with great concern unless they were performed by the EU or a comparable institution and only following detailed analysis of the condition and load capacity of the individual reactors.
