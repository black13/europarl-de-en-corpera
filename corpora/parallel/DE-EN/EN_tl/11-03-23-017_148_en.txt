Madam President, just 14 days ago, the Japanese company Toshiba and others that built nuclear power stations wrote in their promotional brochures that they had the safest nuclear power stations in the world - so much for the claim that we in Europe definitely have the safest atomic energy plants.
I believe that this extremely serious and tragic accident in Japan should make it clear how absurd it is to equate nuclear power stations with wind farms, energy efficiency or solar power plants when discussing the fight against climate change.
What is more, this idea of low carbon technology is simply wrong.
One needs to look at the overall risk from all technologies.
My first specific question to you, Mr Oettinger, is as follows: is it not high time for you to include at least one scenario in the Energy Roadmap 2050 that simply shows what we can achieve by combining 100% renewable energy and energy efficiency?
That is the very least that the citizens of Europe can expect.
Let me state, with regard to the stress tests, that we are in favour of such tests, but they must be mandatory and they must be European.
The first bank stress test was manipulated excessively by the national authorities so that a couple of banks would be excluded.
We needed a second round of stress tests to get things right.
The second key element is 'independent expertise'.
Mrs Lauvergeon from Areva and Mr Teyssen from E.ON, the Euratom officials from the Commission, the nuclear experts in Vienna, and indeed the national nuclear watchdogs are all biased.
Even the national authorities will not admit that the safety tests outlined six months ago are no longer correct.
In other words, we need independent experts.
Otherwise you run the risk of hearing only biased opinions.
I have one final word to add.
I would recommend caution, Mr Oettinger, when you point to Mr Sarkozy as the great champion in the struggle for worldwide nuclear safety.
I would be a little more circumspect if I were you.
