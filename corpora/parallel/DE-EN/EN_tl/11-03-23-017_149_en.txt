Madam President, Japan is still under threat of nuclear meltdown.
Radiation from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima is rising dramatically.
This is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power.
That is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy.
Nuclear energy lines the pockets of the power companies, but when an accident occurs it is the people who pay the price.
For this reason, the EU must immediately lay down a requirement for the operators of nuclear power plants to hold mandatory public liability insurance.
Sufficient cover must be provided for all damage to health, property and other assets in all Member States.
The European Union should finally halt the promotion of nuclear energy and terminate the Euratom Treaty.
Billions in taxpayers' money is still being poured into a dangerous, high-risk technology, while safe alternatives like renewable energies remain under-funded.
