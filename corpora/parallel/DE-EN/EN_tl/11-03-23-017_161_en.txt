Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Oettinger for taking such a serious-minded and responsible approach to this issue.
We should consider whether the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA) should be upgraded to the position of European regulator for the 27 Member States.
We should think about whether the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be made legally binding and whether this new regulator should be given the power to order an immediate shutdown if standards are not met.
We should also consider reforming the Euratom Treaties, focusing on the safety and security regulations, as well as the issue of the coverage of the costs for decommissioning and final storage, which needs to be sorted out now.
I believe this to be a sensitive subject.
We must take this opportunity here in Europe to implement a peer review and to institute the latest standards so that the health of the population is not put at further risk.
