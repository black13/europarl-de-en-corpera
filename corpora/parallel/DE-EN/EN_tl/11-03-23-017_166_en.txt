Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my sympathies to all those affected by this devastating situation.
The tragic accident in Japan has led to a nuclear disaster that is now familiar to us all.
Europe has reacted in a relatively swift and united manner, although there is an awareness, which is hopefully shared by all those who support nuclear technology, that radioactivity knows no national borders and that nature does not recognise safety standards, however high they may be set.
We have witnessed Chernobyl - a failed so-called stress test - and now we have Fukushima.
The time has come for those who favour nuclear power to place the wellbeing and health of human beings and the natural environment above all financial interests.
We should consider a Europe-wide phase-out and promote renewable energies.
