on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the clarifications.
We are faced with a problem that is typical of the globalised world in which we live.
The fact is that we, naturally, respect US law.
It is also a fact that we are aware of the difficulties that arise with the global medium of the Internet and law enforcement.
However, the fact that law enforcement agencies are now accessing private databases on a routine basis is something that requires a response from us.
Commissioner, your words struck a chord with me because I share your ideas about how we should proceed, namely that we should regulate this matter in a dedicated future revision of the EU data protection framework, while at the same time taking the opportunity to say that we also wish to regulate and promote the EU-US Data Protection Framework Agreement because we see the need to regulate such data transfers in this global world.
It is therefore important to remain focused on this issue, as I said earlier.
Naturally, it is not our intention that such a process should cast a negative light on the processing of data.
However, it is good to provide a positive example here by drafting good laws, developing the framework agreement and, in particular, better illuminating and regulating the area of law enforcement in relation to access to private data and the criteria for permitting and ending such access.
