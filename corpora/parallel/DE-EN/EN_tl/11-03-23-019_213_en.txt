Mr President, the old saying 'I love treason but I hate a traitor' is something that is proven true over and over again.
Anyone who blows the whistle on wrongdoing is celebrated as a hero by the public and the media, but viewed as a betrayer by the affected institutions.
Thus, as we know, US Private Bradley Manning has gone to prison for passing information to WikiLeaks.
The way in which this explosive information is handled in the land of unlimited opportunity and liberty and the fact that Twitter was compelled to reveal personal data is worse than ominous.
It remains to be seen whether the widely rumoured demands by the US authorities for user data from other Internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon prove true.
The approach taken by the US authorities and the fact that the courts do not view the publication of names, e-mail addresses and banking details as a violation of privacy are certainly symptomatic of overseas data protection provisions, which are obviously still in their infancy.
