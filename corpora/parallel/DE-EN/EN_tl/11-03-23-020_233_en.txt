Mr President, sometimes it is made more difficult for consumers to understand the consequences of their actions, for example, when they download digital content.
Everyone is used to downloading content from the net free of charge.
However, in some cases the charges are concealed from consumers and, therefore, they download a subscription without realising it, despite the fact that they only wanted a one-off service.
What is needed here is a legal right of withdrawal.
Another area which is open to criticism is the combination of distance and door-to-door sales, because it is much easier for people to be taken unawares on their own front doorstep.
On the other hand, we must not impose unnecessary burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises with regard to off-premises contracts.
For example, when consumers invite a tradesman or a hairdresser into their house of their own accord, they have no need of increased protection, because there is no question of them being taken by surprise.
Therefore, we need sensible, wide-ranging protection for consumers, but it is also important for us to take the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises into consideration.
