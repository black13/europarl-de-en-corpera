Mr President, the question of whether or not this is a milestone is one which could be discussed at great length.
It is clear, for example, that the founders of the European Community, such as Altiero Spinelli, whom we have named our group meeting room after today, were able to deal with more fundamental questions in Europe.
However, I am convinced that nowadays progress in Europe takes the form of small, constructive steps.
For this reason, I would like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the discussion and who have made this compromise possible as a result of their contributions to the amendments.
A compromise is always an opportunity to achieve a balance between different interests.
No one will be completely happy, but everyone will be prepared to improve the approach that has been taken even further.
This is why I believe that we are on the right track.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Reding, for her ongoing commitment and for her support and encouragement both today in this debate and in many other meetings.
I hope that we can continue to count on her during the consultations with the Council.
I would like to thank the committee chair, Mr Harbour, for his patience with the rapporteur and the other members of the committee, together with Mr Lehne, the chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
In the case of the Council, I would like Mrs Gy≈ëri, a former Member of this House, to understand in her role as President-in-Office of the Council that the European Parliament may be obliged to amend the proposal which has thankfully been adopted by the Council on 24 January.
In some areas we would like to go further and, therefore, in the next few weeks we will be holding constructive discussions in order to find a positive solution.
Thank you very much.
