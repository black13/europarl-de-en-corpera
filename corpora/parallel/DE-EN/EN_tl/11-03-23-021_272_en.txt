Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs McAvan for tabling this question.
The revision of the Fuel Quality Directive would not only oblige fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced throughout the life cycle of the fuels, for example during transport and during the refining process, and to measure the reduction, but also to cut the emissions per energy unit by 1% each year from 2011 onwards and by a total of 10% by 2020.
However, I believe that it is only possible to measure the reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the fuel if there are corresponding standard values in place.
These must finally be identified and made public.
However, when Mrs McAvan tabled her question, I had the feeling that she would have preferred to have stopped production in this energy sector.
I would like to warn against taking this approach, because the figures and the findings on emissions produced by the extraction of crude oil or of oil from sand or shale vary widely.
Only an hour ago, I was speaking to a representative of the chemical industry who said that there is so much potential for technical development that it could be possible to achieve much better results in this area.
I would like to remind the House that we are constantly talking about independence from energy sources outside the European Union.
This raw material is available to us here in the European Union, so we should include this in our discussions.
However, all of this will only work if there are standard values in place which must be checked.
Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to act quickly.
