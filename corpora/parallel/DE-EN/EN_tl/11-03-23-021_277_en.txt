Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs McAvan for taking the initiative in this case and Mrs Hedegaard for addressing the problem.
We are not happy about the speed at which things are happening, but we know that this matter is in good hands with Mrs Hedegaard.
We would like to support her during the discussions within the Commission and with everyone else involved.
The environmental impact of tar sands is clear.
There is an exhibition outside Parliament which makes it clear that, although we may question some of what is said or some of the figures, we have a serious environmental problem on our hands.
This is indisputable.
Given that we have discussed the effects of biofuels in such detail and even planned to carry out indirect investigations of movements in food cultivation, we must look at this problem, which is so obvious, much more closely.
For this reason, this is an important initiative.
During the debate and during the preparations, I had a sentence running through my head which has been said repeatedly by the German Environment Minister, Norbert RÃ¶ttgen: We have already picked the low-hanging fruit when it comes to fossil fuels.
This becomes clear in the context of this subject and in the light of the exhibition outside Parliament.
Extracting all our additional deposits of fossil fuels will involve a huge amount of work and give rise to new problems.
Therefore, I would like to point out once again this evening that we all have cause to think more carefully about energy efficiency, especially given the events of recent days.
I would like us to exert greater pressure on the Commission and on Mr Oettinger to follow up the 20% target for energy efficiency.
I hope that the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport and the Transport Commissioner will be able to come up with specific measures rather than just empty words over the next few years and that they will not wait to do so until the next parliamentary term.
