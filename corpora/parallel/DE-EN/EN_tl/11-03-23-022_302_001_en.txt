The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) gives 176 developing countries preferential access to the EU market.
Tariff reductions or duty-free access to the internal market enable trade to make a contribution to reducing poverty in these countries.
Therefore, I support the transitional regulation which ensures the legal continuity of the GSP, so that this opportunity remains available to developing countries.
Trade is also an important and efficient tool which gives the countries affected the chance to move closer towards the rule of law and democracy and to develop a well-functioning economy.
Given the importance and the urgency of this issue, I am in favour of an extension and of making rapid progress with the regulation.
