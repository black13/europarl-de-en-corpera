on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their reports.
We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) welcome these agreements.
In this case, 27 agreements which could have been concluded in these areas are being replaced by just one.
For us, technical harmonisation is also an important point.
It increases levels of safety not just for the airlines themselves, but also for the passengers.
The opening up of the market and the cooperation at a European level should be treated in the same way by both sides.
It is important to highlight the fact that the agreement with Canada is a very good example of this, while the agreement with the USA leaves something to be desired.
Another area which leaves something to be desired is the lack of regular checks on the social and environmental aspects of these agreements, which should be a part of all future agreements, because the simplification of the economic aspects should also enable us to use these agreements to influence not only the European market but also the global market.
Importantly, these agreements also bring benefits for passengers, because they can result in the controls being simplified without them being neglected.
Finally, I would like to say that we welcome this agreement, because, as I have already said, 27 agreements are ultimately being replaced by one.
This is a clear indication that we will hopefully soon be dealing with only seven or perhaps even three airspaces, instead of with the current 27, as part of measures to improve air safety and implement the single European sky.
This will make negotiations on these agreements much simpler.
