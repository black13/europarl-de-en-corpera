Madam President, first of all I would like to take this opportunity to thank all three rapporteurs very much for their hard work.
These agreements are very important for air travel and, therefore, for the European Union.
However, I would also like to take the opportunity to refer once again to the framework agreement of 20 November 2010.
I hope that the European Parliament will be informed in an appropriate way and in good time by the Commission about negotiations on future agreements in the interests of good interinstitutional cooperation and an effective flow of information.
We know that the negotiations on these and on other agreements are of the highest quality, but it is important for us to be aware of the strengths and weak points of the agreements after they come into force, so that we can make a better contribution.
This will make it easier to guarantee Parliament's support for the agreements.
