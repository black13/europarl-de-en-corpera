Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my opinion on three areas of Mrs Balzani's report.
The first is that the report on the 2012 budget is based on the assumption of enhanced economic governance involving the EU, the European Semester mechanism and the Europe 2020 objectives to boost growth and employment.
In next year's budget there will be support in particular for two headline targets in the strategy: improving education and promoting social inclusion, which for me are two key aspects with regard to Europe's future viability.
Secondly, the report emphasises the need to improve synergies between European and national public investments in order to achieve the EU's political objectives more effectively.
We need to encourage more coordination, greater consistency and a focus on sensible, shared objectives in order to make it more likely that the headline targets can be achieved successfully.
My third point concerns climate change and energy targets.
In the light of the disaster in Japan, we need to do everything possible to speed up the introduction of renewable energy sources.
An active climate policy and the creation of green jobs will not only help us to achieve our climate targets, but will also make a positive contribution to social policy.
Last but not least I would like to remind the House that the EU budget is not permitted to show a public deficit, which is why it is essential that it is implemented properly, and that it makes up only 2% of total public spending.
