Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 budget is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation in the 27 Member States.
For this reason, we will certainly not be able to afford to do everything that we would like to do.
I believe that the report tabled by Mrs Balzani is a workable compromise.
However, I also have a few critical remarks to make.
In my opinion, more money does not necessarily mean more solidarity and more Europe.
What is important is to improve the quality of what we get in return for the money spent and above all to ensure that the objectives we set ourselves are actually achieved rather than the money merely being paid out regardless.
We must always examine the question of our potential new own resources with a critical eye, too.
These own resources must not lead to the additional burdening of citizens or of businesses that need to be, and should be, able to compete with the rest of the world.
I also think it is important for us not always to emphasise the fact that the EU budget amounts to only 2% because, at the end of the day, many States cofinance the corresponding European funds, thus, of course, making a considerably larger volume of funds available on the basis of EU programmes.
I think it is particularly important for us to make progress in terms of research, education, sustainability and strengthening economic growth.
In light of this, I think it is also important for large-scale projects such as ITER - and in this regard I would like to thank Mrs Jensen for her comment - to be fully and clearly financed and clearly managed, because otherwise the Americans, who are currently implementing the same project, will be appreciably ahead of us, and we Europeans should not always take second place.
