Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just one comment.
Yesterday, I was denied the opportunity to respond directly to Mr Schulz.
I have sent you all an email - initially in German, but the English and French versions will follow - in which I make a statement in this regard, and I will also duly reject the accusation.
