Mr President, I would like to make three comments, if I may, with regard to the general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget.
Firstly, I think it is good that we are debating the 2012 budget at an early stage, because - secondly - we do not want another calamity like we had between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission with regard to the 2011 budget.
Thirdly, I am particularly proud of the fact that the European budget does not need to go into borrowing.
I believe that should also continue to be the case.
