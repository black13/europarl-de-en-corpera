Mr President, I think the approach being taken to harmonise our fragmented European consumer law, which poses a barrier to trade, is a sound one and the right way to go.
It is also important for consumers to be able to develop a sense of European law, in other words for it to be possible for them to be confident when they do business or when they buy or acquire something anywhere in the European Union.
That will bring certainty not only for consumers, but also for producers.
I am particularly pleased about the improvements in the information requirements for door-to-door selling and for distance contracts.
In future debates - and I am therefore very pleased that this report has been referred back to committee once again - we should ensure that, when we talk about producers, we do not just consider the large corporations but also the small family businesses, and we should not overburden them with legal subtleties.
