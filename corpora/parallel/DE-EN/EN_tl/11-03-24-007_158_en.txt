Mr President, I believe that we can all learn lessons from the situation in Japan.
These lessons relate in particular to nuclear power stations.
I call on the Council urgently to table proposals in this regard.
What the Commission has so far presented provides an incentive for the European Council Atomic Questions Working Group finally to address the demands made by the European Parliament.
We need an intensive debate on this issue, and I believe that the time has now come for this to happen.
