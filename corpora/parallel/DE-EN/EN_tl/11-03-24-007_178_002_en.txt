in writing. - Trade is an important and efficient instrument for combating poverty in developing countries.
The transitional regulation on a scheme of generalised tariff preferences legally enshrines preferential access to the EU market for 176 developing countries.
I supported the regulation, which ensures legal continuity, so that opportunities for trade remain available to developing countries.
Moreover, it is the EU's moral duty to support these countries in the development of democracy and the rule of law by enabling fair trade.
