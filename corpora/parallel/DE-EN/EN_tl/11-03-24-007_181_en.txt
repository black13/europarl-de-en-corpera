in writing. - As long ago as 1964, some developing countries were already calling loudly for trade preferences in order to improve their economic situation.
In 1968, after an agreement was reached, a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) was introduced.
The European Economic Community introduced the GSP in 1971 and other nations like the United States followed suit.
The temporary granting of trade preferences sought to achieve the following goals: an increase in developing countries' export proceeds by diversification of the exported products, promotion of industrialisation and an acceleration of economic growth in the developing countries.
Furthermore, the GSP was intended to ensure that the products supported originated in developing countries.
To date, the GSP represents one of the most important EU instruments in the area of trade and it is monitored by the European Commission.
As the current scheme expires on 31 December of this year, the Commission already presented a new proposal back in May 2010.
No amendments are proposed for the new regulation, although the rapporteur definitely believes that a redrafting of the schemes is necessary.
I am abstaining from the vote because there do not seem to be any new, tangible proposals for the new regulation.
