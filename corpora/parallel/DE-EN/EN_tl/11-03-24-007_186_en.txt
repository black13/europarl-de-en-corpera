in writing. - I have voted against this report.
As the rapporteur himself states, the system in its current form has more than a few shortcomings.
Although the Commission was called on to table a proposal for a new regulation which would, on the one hand, address the inadequacies of the legal framework and, on the other, take account of the institutional changes since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, ensuring among other things that Parliament is given greater powers of scrutiny than it has under the procedure that is currently applied, the draft that has been tabled contains an unnecessary extension of the current unsatisfactory situation.
In the parliamentary report, the rapporteur also discusses some of his proposals for improvements which could or should be included in the future proposal for a new regulation.
The Commission should take these proposals on board and table a new, improved regulation without delay.
