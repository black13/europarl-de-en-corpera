in writing. - It makes perfect sense for air transport agreements with the United States to now be concluded at European level instead of separately with individual Member States as they were previously.
This will allow European airlines to fly to all destinations within the United States.
What I am not happy about, however, is the one-sided nature of this Agreement, in which the EU, on the one hand, is making numerous concessions, while the United States, on the other, is insisting on restrictions on foreign ownership, for example.
The EU must put itself in a stronger position in relation the United States in this regard.
