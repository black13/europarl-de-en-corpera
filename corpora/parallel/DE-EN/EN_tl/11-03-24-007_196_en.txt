in writing. - Air transport has increased in general and therefore the aviation markets of the EU and the United States have also grown.
For a long time, the Member States have negotiated with the United States on an individual basis and concluded bilateral agreements.
The shift to EU level enables European airlines to fly to any destination in the United States from any point in the EU.
As a precondition for this, some reforms had to be carried out both in the United States and in the European Union.
The new Agreement is intended to open the way to future opportunities in terms of additional investment and market access and improve cooperation between the regulatory authorities.
However, the agreement is one-sided if existing restrictions on foreign ownership and control in the United States continue to remain.
Thus, with this new agreement, the EU is allowing itself once again to be deceived by the United States, and that is something that I cannot support.
