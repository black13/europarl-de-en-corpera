in writing. - This Agreement serves as a model for current and future negotiations with other States.
It will remove all restrictions on routes, prices, or the number of weekly flights between the two parties to the agreement.
According to predictions, the potential savings as a result of cheaper flight prices amount to EUR 72 million, which would benefit consumers directly.
The Aagreement will have further indirect benefits for our citizens as a result of the creation of new jobs.
I therefore voted in favour of the Agreement.
