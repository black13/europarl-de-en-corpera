in writing. - I voted in favour of the report on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
As thoroughly explained in the report, due to the many advantages for both contractual parties and after 20 years of negotiations, it is time that we made a targeted effort to push for the conclusion of a free trade agreement.
Above all, however, I support the main points of focus for the negotiations stated in the report, which take account of developments in the area of climate change and the obligation in terms of human rights.
