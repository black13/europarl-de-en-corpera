in writing. - The current euro crisis underlines the central importance of a correct and economical budgetary policy.
The increase in funds on grounds that this is required for the Europe 2020 Strategy is something I reject, as for one thing the strategy is unachievable and for another it has inappropriate goals: for example the massive increase in the number of academics, when we actually have a shortage of specialist staff.
Instead, we should utilise the numerous potential opportunities for savings, whether in relation to the decentralised agencies, the two locations of the European Parliament or the pre-accession aid for Turkey.
I therefore voted against this report on the 2012 budget.
