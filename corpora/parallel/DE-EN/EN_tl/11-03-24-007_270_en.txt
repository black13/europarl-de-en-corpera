in writing. - The report on the 2012 budget refers to the Europe 2020 Strategy, which once again contains lofty goals that no one expects to meet.
The fact is that the precarious budgetary situation of some Member States that have lived it up in the past has become a financial millstone around the necks of the other Member States in connection with the rescue package.
It then often only needs something trivial to tighten the noose.
These fundamental requirements make it all the more important not only for the 2012 budget to be correctly executed - in which regard we must not overlook the fact that budgetary control still leaves a great deal to be desired - but also for us to manage our resources in an economical way.
The reference here to 'adequate financing' of the Europe 2020 Strategy, when billions from the EU budget are still mysteriously disappearing and available opportunities for potential savings, for example in relation to the jungle of EU agencies or the locations for Parliament, are not utilised, represents a waste of European taxpayers' money.
On the basis of this conviction, I voted against the report.
