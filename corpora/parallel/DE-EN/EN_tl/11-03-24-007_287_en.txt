in writing. - Although overall it would be good if a residence permit and a work permit could be issued together, the following questions remain unanswered and the following remarks are necessary:
1.
Application of the Posting of Workers Directive must take priority and the principle of the application of the social legislation of the country of employment must always be regarded as fundamental.
2.
No worker must be employed as legal 'cheap' labour under this measure, as this is damaging to our labour market and it is socially unjust.
3.
The countries must carry out more checks in these areas.
