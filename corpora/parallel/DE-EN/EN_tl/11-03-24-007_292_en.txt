in writing. - The entry and residence of third-country nationals are an issue, but in the past the rights in relation to these have been extended more and more.
Thus, it is now the case that the autochthonous population quite rightly feels increasingly disadvantaged as a result of the access of third-country nationals to social services, specifically in the area of social housing.
In the area of economic migration, it is mainly well educated and badly needed workers that move to other States.
Whereas in the United States, for example, they do not burden the social system, and in some States they also have to leave once their job comes to an end, through the increasing level of equality with the resident population that they have been afforded in recent years, they constitute an ever greater burden for those States with traditionally well-developed social systems if they remain in the country permanently after losing their jobs and if, as a result of them bringing any family they have to join them, all the relatives have to be supported, too.
This proposal is another step in this direction and therefore is to be rejected in the strongest possible terms.
