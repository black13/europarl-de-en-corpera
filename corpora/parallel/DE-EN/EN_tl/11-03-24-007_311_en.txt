in writing. - Facilitation of cross-border trade by means of uniform rules and at the same time a strengthening of consumer rights, above all in connection with purchasing goods in another Member State, are the reasons why I expressly welcome the 'new' Consumer Protection Directive.
The current uncertainty that still remains with regard to the applicable consumer rights deters companies from offering their goods across borders and consumers from ordering these goods, as there is a lack of clarity over what happens in the possible event of withdrawal.
A European single market expressly requires the removal of such barriers.
The uniform definitions proposed in this report, which among other things harmonise the withdrawal right and rules relating to unfair contract terms in contracts, will create legal certainty and thus increase the appeal of cross-border trade for companies, which will ultimately benefit consumers.
Chapter V was not adopted and therefore consumer protection will be applied throughout Europe according to the highest criteria.
Referral back to committee is therefore necessary in order to negotiate with the Commission once again.
