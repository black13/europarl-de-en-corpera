in writing. - In today's vote on the text of the directive on consumer rights, some members of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament abstained.
The compromise adopted undoubtedly contains many improvements on the original draft from the European Commission.
For example, we have succeeded in ensuring that small businesses are not affected by most of the new rules or burdened with additional bureaucracy.
However, the text adopted today also contains rules that would heavily burden companies without increasing consumer protection.
Article 5, for example, will mean that a company will have to provide very extensive pre-contractual information even when goods are purchased in store.
This will hardly benefit consumers, as they can assess the product directly in the shop.
Article 22a places companies under obligation, in the case of distance contracts, to supply their goods to customers in any Member State.
Such an obligation contradicts the freedom of contract and exposes small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to considerable legal and financial risks.
Furthermore, the FDP was unable to succeed in its core demand for the complete deletion of Chapters IV and V of the directive.
The FDP calls for these provisions to be amended during the trilogue negotiations with the Council and Commission.
