in writing. - This report concerns the bringing together of four different directives on consumer protection and thus contains the acquis communautaire since 2004.
In some areas there are simplifications and additions.
It is important that any higher standards of protection in the Member States are able to be retained.
On the other hand, the bringing together of the directives results in more extensive harmonisation.
Therefore, I have abstained from voting.
