in writing. - I am pleased with today's decision on consumer protection.
We have taken an important decision for Europe's citizens, enterprises and the single market.
It is heartening that it was possible to find a sensible approach for a partial standardisation of the multitude of European systems of law.
Nevertheless, from an Austrian viewpoint there are a few problematic points which now urgently need to be discussed and clarified in the trilogue negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission: (1) The 'procurement element' must be included in the text.
Procurement element means, for example, that if someone asks a beautician to come to his or her house in order to utilise the beautician's services (in other words the person procures the business connection him- or herself), the right of withdrawal should no longer apply.
(2) We need to ensure that no additional burdens for SMEs arise, provided that adequate consumer protection is ensured.
Ultimately, additional financial and administrative burdens on SMEs would be passed on to customers.
(3) Chapters IV and V (liability and unfair terms) should be deleted, because even after lengthy negotiations it was not possible to achieve the desired full harmonisation.
Deletion would avoid a standstill and open up the way for new possibilities in the trilogue negotiations.
(4) With regard to the welcome rule on Internet scams, a few adjustments still need to be made in order to ensure a balance between consumer protection and the burdening of businesses.
