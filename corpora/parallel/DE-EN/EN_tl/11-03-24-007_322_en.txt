in writing. - I voted in favour of the compromise package on consumer rights negotiated between the groups, because it was possible to introduce some improvements to the directive compared with the Commission's proposal.
It is important that the basis of the directive is once again minimum harmonisation and services like those in the health or social sphere are removed from the directive.
There was also an improvement in the area of distance selling, where the withdrawal period for consumers has up to now been a week, but under the European Parliament's amendments two weeks would now be provided for.
Purchases at trade fairs are now also classed as direct selling.
In Austria, a purchase at a trade fair has up to now been treated, from a legal point of view, in the same way as a purchase in a shop.
However, some important points still need to be improved.
The highest priority in this regard is Chapter V of the directive, with which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is completely dissatisfied.
We must prevent the list of unfair contract terms from being exhaustive - the Member States should not be prevented from extended their level of consumer protection.
Many consumers in Member States with a long tradition of consumer protection would otherwise find their protection worsening.
I have therefore also voted for referral back to committee, so that these essential points can also be resolved and improved.
