in writing. - Despite financial crises, the EU has indulged, and continues to do so, in the creation of additional authorities - for every issue and every problem a new agency is set up.
Between 2005 and 2009, the budget for the EU agencies more than doubled and the number of employees rose by 65%.
The added value they provide is highly questionable, however.
The results leave something to be desired and the monitoring of them is inadequate.
On average, taxpayers have to pay EUR 579 million per year for the EU agencies.
I am very much against the establishment of new agencies.
It is unacceptable for taxpayers to finance the officials of the Member States with very cushy jobs in pointless agencies.
I therefore voted against the report on establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency.
The Commission has more than enough trained officials to take on this task.
