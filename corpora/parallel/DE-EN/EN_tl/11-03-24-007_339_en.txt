in writing. - The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was founded back in 2004.
Its job is to ensure network and information security within the EU.
It is also tasked with developing a culture of network and information security among citizens, consumers, businesses and public organisations in the European Union.
In the context of exercises, as recently carried out against cyber crime, it must be possible to guarantee security in the event an emergency situation.
However, the extent to which this is actually feasible in practice is not absolutely clear in my view.
I did not vote in favour of the report, as there is a danger that additional costs will be incurred by citizens without there being any tangible benefits.
