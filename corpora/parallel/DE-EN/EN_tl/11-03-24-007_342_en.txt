in writing. - In 2004, the European Network and Information Security Agency was set up for a period of five years.
Its 57 members of staff are concerned with the development of network and information security for citizens, consumers and businesses, and also for public organisations in the European Union.
Its tasks included both risk analyses and preventative measures.
On account of the continual and constantly faster pace of development of information and communications technologies and their fundamental importance for society and industry, it has been found that there is a need for this agency in future, too.
However, for some time I have been calling for a business-based review of the EU agencies.
There are already initiatives in place for the review of the system as a whole and I will not vote in favour of extending this agency until a review of this kind has been completed.
