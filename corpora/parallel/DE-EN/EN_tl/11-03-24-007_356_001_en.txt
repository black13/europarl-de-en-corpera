in writing. - The devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan and the Pacific region on 11 March 2011 resulted in the deaths or disappearance of thousands of people as well as considerable material damage, destroying the livelihoods of many people.
This subsequently led to an extremely serious nuclear accident in the Fukushima nuclear power station.
According to the statement given by the Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, the country is facing its most serious crisis in 65 years, since the Second World War.
In this motion for a resolution, the European Parliament expresses its solidarity with the Japanese people and presents its sincere condolences to the victims of the disaster.
I have therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution and very much hope that the situation in Japan can be brought under control and that there will be a global rethink with regard to nuclear energy.
