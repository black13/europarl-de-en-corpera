Mr President, I support the proposal by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), as it makes perfect sense to discuss this.
I would just ask - in agreement with the coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Schwab - that we do not vote on the resolution this week, but wait until May to do so, because we have not yet had time to discuss this among the groups.
Thus, I would say 'yes' to the inclusion of this item on the agenda, 'yes' to a resolution, but I would like the vote on the resolution to wait until May.
