Mr President, I would like very briefly to speak in favour of this.
Given that the agenda for Wednesday afternoon is so tight, I would ask that the Council and the Commission make their statements very, very brief and that the Vice-Presidents in the Chair make sure that speakers stick very precisely to their speaking time.
Otherwise, we will have chaos.
I ask for the support of the Vice-Presidents in this.
