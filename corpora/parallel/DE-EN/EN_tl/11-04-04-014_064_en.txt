Mr President, despite the influx of people from North Africa, the rapporteur clearly fears that there are too few refugees in the EU, as she calls for the definition of the family to be extended.
It is apparently irrelevant whether the family members came together before or after fleeing from their country.
New partners and adoptive children are also to be included in the new definition.
Special protection is to be afforded to refugees with problems in relation to their gender identity, whatever the rapporteur means by that.
Such wordings leave the door wide open to abuse.
It is also naive to believe that asylum seekers can expect the same high level of social provision in any Member State.
The European Union is made up of States with very different standards of living.
The same applies to the concept of safe country of origin.
If it is a democratic state based on the rule of law, it must also be classed as safe.
Finally, as Tunisia and Egypt are heading in the right direction, they should probably also be classed as safe third countries.
