Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, for his work on this report and, on behalf of my group, I wish him every success in the undoubtedly difficult negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately not present at this debate.
However, I would like to mention two aspects.
The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) are not helpful to the rapporteur, but undermine the negotiating position of Parliament defined in the Committee on International Trade.
The amendments seek to make life easier for arms exporters.
Therefore, my group will not support these amendments.
Secondly, I would like to state that my group has considerable problems with the use of the dual-use list to block the access of developing countries in particular to high technology.
This relates, in particular, to restrictions on the export of high-performance computers.
We have seen the potential for the political abuse of the dual-use list, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries.
