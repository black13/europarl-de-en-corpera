Mr President, nuclear fuels, chemicals and computer programmes can be used for peaceful purposes, but they can also be used for military purposes.
Some Member States have been supplying Libya with weapons and even with torture equipment for years.
The most recent arms export report - more like a list of sins - clearly shows that Italy, Malta and Germany supplied the most weapons to Gaddafi.
France, on the other hand, was the front-runner with regard to supplies to the Arab region.
Others - like my country, Austria - abide by the restrictions.
We must combat this imbalance.
All Member States and the entire weapons industry in the EU must observe strict controls and transparency provisions.
However, the system must also be kept up-to-date.
Particularly with regard to software, IT and smart phones, it needs to be considered whether these will not be of benefit to democratic movements, as we have recently seen in the Arab region, of course.
We therefore need more discriminating analyses with regard to the potential uses and the dubiousness of the recipients.
