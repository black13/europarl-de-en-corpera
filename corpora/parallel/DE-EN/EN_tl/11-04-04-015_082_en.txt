Mr President, when it comes to the export authorisation for dual-use items, we are probably all agreed that we need uniform rules in the European Union so that the Member States do not all follow different practices, which would lead to distortions of competition and achieve precisely the opposite of what we actually want.
Of course, it sounds logical when we say that exports should be authorised and approved in advance.
We want more transparency and we want this to be monitored so that we can learn from it.
In this regard, I would like to express my support for Mrs KÃ¶stinger, who said that we obviously need a system that is bearable for our small and medium-sized enterprises and one with which they can cope.
The world market is not only for large concerns, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises.
That would also be my appeal to the rapporteur, namely, to ensure that the conditions and requirements laid down are also bearable for, and capable of being implemented by, our small and medium-sized enterprises.
