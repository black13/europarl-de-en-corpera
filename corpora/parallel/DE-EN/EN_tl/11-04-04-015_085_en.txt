Mr President, I wanted to use the last two minutes to appeal to the Council.
However, there are only empty seats where the Council is supposed to be.
I am not sure whether it is sensible to conduct debates without the Council.
I think it would be appropriate to inform the Council that, if it wants something from the European Parliament, it ought to come here and listen to the relevant debate in this House.
I know that this matter concerns a large branch of industry.
It concerns a lot of items and it concerns jobs, particularly jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises which produce high technology and which are incredibly important.
For them, it is extremely important that there are uniform regulations in the European Union and that we do not have a situation where - as Mr Fjellner mentioned - one country meets its obligations, but another does not, and, in the end, the ones that lose out are those that abide by the rules.
That should not be the case.
It is therefore important for us to find a solution quickly and also for the Council to accept that not everything is as it perceives it to be.
This is also important.
With this realisation, we will quickly reach a solution in the interests of European industry, European jobs and the protection of human rights and the preservation of security and of freedom from injury outside the European Union.
This report is intended to facilitate this.
