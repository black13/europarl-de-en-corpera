Mr President, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Simpson.
In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we know that, if our Chair prepares a report, we will not actually have anything to say against it.
He always takes a great number of things into account, and the only thing we can say is: excellent Brian, we can support that.
In this case, it has been variously said that it is a technical report.
That sounds so boring.
I do not find it at all boring.
Although it is technical, it describes tourism, which really is a very important economic objective for us in Europe.
It has already been mentioned that 40% of people worldwide travel to Europe.
Thus, Europe is an important region for tourism, and therefore it is, of course, vital to know why these people travel to Europe.
If, with our new competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, we now want to develop a new European framework, we must be familiar with the data and also be able to exchange this data in a harmonised way.
That is the purpose of this report, and it also shows the new developments, for example, in terms of same-day visits or bicycle tourism.
We also want to include our industrial heritage.
All of this must be included in future so that we will really know how to set our objectives.
Therefore, thank you very much - it is a good report and I believe we are able to support it.
