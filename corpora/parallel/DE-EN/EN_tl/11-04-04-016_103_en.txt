Mr President, it would be nice if questions regarding the reasons for success as a tourist destination - in other words, why one destination is in demand whereas others are seeing a fall in visitor numbers - could be answered using informative statistics.
However, that is a wish that will probably not be fulfilled.
Too many uncertain factors, such as particular weather conditions, turn tourism predictions into a game of chance.
It is not even possible to say with certainty whether the opening of new flight connections is increasing the number of overnight stays or whether, on the contrary, new flight connections are a result of increasing demand on the part of travellers.
However, the limited availability and comparability of tourism data is also a problem from the point of view of town planning.
At the end of the day, if a potential increase in visitor numbers is forthcoming, it is important to organise this in such a way as to avoid it having a negative impact on the local population.
Flexible working hours and safety influence tourism just as much as social changes.
The decisive factors, however, will probably ultimately be the global economy and perhaps the price of oil.
Even the best European tourism statistics can do little to change these.
