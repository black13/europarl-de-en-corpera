Mr President, I am not certain under which Rule I should now take the floor.
In an earlier debate, I complained about the fact that the Council is not present.
However, we should not only complain, but also speak out if something is good.
I simply wanted to point to the way that the Commissioner has acted today and the fact that her speeches have been brief, succinct and competent in terms of content - many of her colleagues would do well to follow her example of how to behave here in this House.
