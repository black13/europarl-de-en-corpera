Mr President, it has been very clear in the debate that violence against women is not a trivial offence; it is quite clearly a violation of human rights.
It has already been said that even children are sometimes indirect victims of violence against women.
They can even be direct victims of violence against women, because the main cause of still births and miscarriages is certainly the effects of violence against women.
It is not only a question of domestic violence; there is also forced prostitution, honour killings - where there can actually be no question of honour - human trafficking, genital mutilation and much more besides.
The trigger for this report, for which I am very grateful to Mrs Svensson, was, in this case, not only the fact that it was noticed in the context of the report on equality that equality is also put at serious risk as a result of violence against women, but also the fact that, through the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have the opportunity to enact a directive and to establish a common legal framework in Europe.
That is urgently needed for us to make significant progress here, because this is a cross-border European problem that we must combat.
