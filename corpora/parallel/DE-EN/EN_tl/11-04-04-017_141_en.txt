Mr President, violence against women takes many forms, and it remains an international problem with which the international community has still not managed to get to grips.
The use of violence compromises the health, dignity, security and autonomy of its victims.
As a consequence, the women concerned are restricted in their opportunities to participate in social life and work.
Moreover, we just need to consider the costs to see that violence against women is also a social problem, for example, in areas of health and justice.
Women are at most risk within their own four walls.
The commonest cause of injuries in women is domestic violence.
Violence against women, whatever form it takes, is not a trivial offence.
The EU must also sign the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.
