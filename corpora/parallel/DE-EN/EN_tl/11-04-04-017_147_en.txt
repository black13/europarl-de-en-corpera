Mr President, Commissioner, when it comes to equality issues, the European Union was, and is, at the forefront; it is also at the forefront in the fight against violence against women.
In addition to the horrific nature of the matter, violence against women is also expensive.
The report states that the annual cost of this violence is EUR 33 billion.
That should take the wind out of the sails of those who say that the catalogue of measures that has now been established will clearly have a cost, too.
This catalogue of measures is necessary, however.
Training of police officers, judges, medical personnel - all of this is contained in the report, and I would also like to duly thank the rapporteur for that.
However, I do see one small fly in the ointment and I would like to highlight this.
Particular attention should also be paid to violence in the workplace.
It is important to provide more specific wording on this issue, too.
