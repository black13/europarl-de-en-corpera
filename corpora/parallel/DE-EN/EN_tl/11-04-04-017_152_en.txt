It can happen anywhere: on the street, on the underground, in someone's own home - women and children cannot feel 100% safe from attack anywhere.
The deadening pseudo-morality found in society should give us pause for thought.
The early stages of actual violence, such as intrusiveness, obscene remarks and harassment meted out by many migrants to western women on a daily basis are increasingly regarded as normal.
The disregard for women has reached peak levels when a German judge refers to the husband's right of procreation as a decisive factor in her judgment in a Muslim divorce case.
By permitting migration, the EU has imported problems from every country of the world, including honour killings, forced marriages and domestic violence in patriarchal family structures.
Culture, religion and tradition must not be used to justify acts of violence.
That is the only way to break the spiral of violence.
The statistics provide no information on the extent to which the recorded increase in reported cases of domestic violence is related to the increased willingness of the victims to stand up for themselves or what proportion of these are immigrants.
It is a fact in any case that a large number of migrants are registered in women's refuges.
It is also a fact that we need to put a stop to the pseudo-do-gooder mentality that treats crimes committed with a religious or cultural motive with leniency.
