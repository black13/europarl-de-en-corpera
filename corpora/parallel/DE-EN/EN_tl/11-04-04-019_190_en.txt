Madam President, I would like to address three points.
Firstly, we should make it clear that we are indeed able to provide assistance to refugees from North Africa, particularly from Tunisia, and that we also want to do so.
I therefore also welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to activate Directive 2001/55/EC for giving temporary protection and I would, at the same time, call for all Member States to actually utilise this, not only Italy, but also France and Germany - above all, the countries that are actually in a position to invest.
Secondly, we expect a clear statement from the Commission to the effect that any agreements entered into with dictators like Ben Ali or Gaddafi concerning the prevention of migration - that is how I would describe them - are null and void.
Genuine partnerships with third countries, like Mrs Malmstr√∂m mentioned, are probably not comparable with Italy's idea of buying the readiness to take back refugees with EUR 150 million.
Instead of showing solidarity in respect of the prevention of refugees, we should be showing practical solidarity with North African States like Tunisia, to which 150 000 people have fled.
Thirdly, we need to understand how fragile the ground is on which the EU refugee prevention instruments are standing.
Frontex and Dublin II - we need a rethink where these are concerned.
We need liberal asylum and migration legislation in Europe and a different development policy that is genuinely sustainable.
