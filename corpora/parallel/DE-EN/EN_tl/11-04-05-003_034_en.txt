Madam President, the people of Europe are becoming more and more anxious.
There are two topics that are particular cause for concern.
The first is that we continue to take an inconsistent line in dealing with the economic crisis and the difficulties of the euro.
It is also a fact that the Council and the Commission are lagging behind events.
We need to be realistic: we need a debt haircut, at least in Greece and probably also in Portugal.
There is no escaping this.
The longer we take to address this issue, the more it will cost, not just in financial terms, but also in terms of the general credibility of the European project.
Events in Greece will serve to arouse emotions.
We were part of a special delegation to the country: the underlying attitude is that the EU is responsible for the problems in Greece because of a lack of clear communication and because the necessary steps, which are already obvious, are not being taken.
The second topic is nuclear power.
The so-called stress tests being prepared will only make sense and credibility in a cohesive Europe will only be restored if these stress tests are performed according to stringent criteria and not according to the weak criteria of the IAO, if genuinely independent experts are consulted and if the events and the entire process is presented to the public in an appropriate and understandable way.
