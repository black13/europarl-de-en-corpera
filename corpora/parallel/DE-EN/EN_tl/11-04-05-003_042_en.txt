Madam President, as we know, three explosive issues were discussed at the meeting of the European Council in which the EU decisions were, in my view, characterised by incorrigibility and a failure to grasp reality.
On the one hand, the EUR 700 billion rescue package will soon be exhausted and may also drag the EU's net contributors into ruin.
Instead of admitting the failure of the stability mechanism in the interests of efficient crisis management, the EU has simply multiplied the risk for everyone.
On the other hand, it is open to question whether an opposition formed by former Gaddafi ministers is really interested in democracy.
I am very unnerved by the fact that the military commander of the Libyan rebels has been identified as a long-serving CIA agent.
Finally, the nuclear power plant stress tests, which are to be carried out on a voluntary basis without consequences, are further evidence of how divorced Brussels has become from reality.
However, the Commission really missed the boat when it reactivated a twenty-year-old regulation without adjusting the limits for radioactive foodstuffs.
