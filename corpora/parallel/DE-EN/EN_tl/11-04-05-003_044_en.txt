Madam President, the Council and Commission are quite right when they suggest that the public budgets in Europe need to be consolidated.
However, if we look at how this works and how it will continue to work in the future, then it is evident that the wrong people are being affected.
Schools are being closed, teachers are losing their jobs, researchers are finding themselves out on the street and public investments are being cut or left to stagnate.
I would like to ask Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso: Is this your intention?
Of course you will say that this is not what you want and that other areas are to be cut back.
My question then is: Where are the cuts to be made?
My key question is as follows: If you believe that the cuts should be made elsewhere, then why is it that the draft that you propose for decision making in the 'six-pack' for economic governance makes no distinction as to whether a country purchases tanks or weapons of war or invests in an ailing national economy, or whether it makes an investment in the future?
Or perhaps whether it invests in a modern energy supply system and in the education and training of its children?
Romano Prodi once famously said that these drafts are stupid.
His words are still true because this distinction between good and bad investments cannot be made.
Our only choice is to improve these drafts, because Europe cannot be governed sensibly if such distinctions are beyond us.
My last question is: Where is the income to be found that will enable us to move forward out of the crisis?
After all, we cannot just save our way out of the problem.
Mr Barroso, we await your proposal on the financial transaction tax in Europe, something that this House has backed with a large majority.
Give Europe a chance and avoid wasting any more time with pious words.
