Madam President, the EU is a master of procrastination.
For decades, Gaddafi was treated as a serious partner, for decades the dangers of nuclear power were swept under the carpet and now we are pumping money into a safety net that is obviously not working.
Why can people not see that the euro crisis cannot be resolved with the safety net?
First Greece and now Portugal has been downgraded by US rating agencies and the rescue package now only benefits banks and speculators who are gambling on bankrupt euro Member States.
That is why I say it is time to end the safety net and to draw a line under the plans for Eurobonds.
If the bankrupt states remain in the euro area, this will mark the beginning of the end for the euro.
For this reason we would be better advised to use the billions earmarked for the rescue packages to stem the stream of refugees from North Africa with sustainable local projects or to secure genuine independence from nuclear energy.
This would certainly represent a better investment than simply squandering the money in the casinos of the international rating agencies.
