Nature is a stronger force than man can harness.
In view of the history of Chernobyl, we can only hope that the stress tests will be approached with greater caution than the limits imposed last week.
It is time to put an end to nuclear power.
So, let us finally concentrate on the renewable energies.
For example, the NorGer undersea electricity cable project could replace 60 nuclear power plants.
