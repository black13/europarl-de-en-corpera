Mr President, I would like to make a personal observation at the end of this debate.
I am speaking not just for myself, but on behalf of many of my colleagues who were here the whole time and who followed this debate.
In all my time here at the European Parliament I have rarely felt as badly treated as today in the interplay between you and Mr Barroso.
I want to be very clear on this.
Mr Barroso, you have told us: 'The initiatives open to me, which have the support of the vast majority in this house, fail because the Member States reject them.'
Let me offer you a word of advice: place your initiatives on the table in the form of draft legislation.
That way you will get a majority in this House and the Council will no longer have any hiding space.
(Applause)
I would ask you to please stop hiding behind the Council.
To you, Mr Van Rompuy, I would say this: you tell us that you have succeeded in reaching compromises between socialists, liberals, conservatives and Christian democrats at Council level.
The Council is made up of sovereign ministers of state and prime ministers.
Here we witness a President of the Council trying to turn the Treaty of Lisbon in the opposite direction.
The result of the Treaty of Lisbon is that the Council of Heads of State or Government is drawing more and more power to itself, while at the same time saying: 'our decisions are made on a unanimous basis.'
This was not what the Treaty of Lisbon was about.
Lisbon wanted majority decision-making to be the norm within the EU.
You are misinterpreting the Treaty of Lisbon.
(Applause)
For this reason it is high time for the European Parliament to take the matter in hand itself and to defend the Community method.
(Applause)
