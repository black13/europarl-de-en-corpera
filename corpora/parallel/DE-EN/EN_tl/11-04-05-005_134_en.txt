Mr President, life and work have changed radically in rural areas through the transformation of society, changes in social structure and dramatic demographic change.
If it is our aim to keep women of all generations on the land or to encourage them to choose a rural lifestyle, then their needs and requirements must be taken into greater consideration in development policy.
We should bear in mind that the realities for women in rural areas have changed in recent years and are very highly differentiated.
Women themselves have played a part in initiating and shaping this change, both as individuals and in women's political groupings.
I believe that our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, has correctly highlighted this fact, which is why I believe this report is extremely important.
After all, if we want to develop rural areas, we cannot simply concentrate on building up infrastructure and creating an environment for tourism, but also need to ensure that families settle there again, something that involves both women and men in equal measure.
