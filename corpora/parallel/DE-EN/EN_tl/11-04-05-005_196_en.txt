in writing. - I voted in favour of this report.
As the report highlights, the current stream of migrants is causing huge tensions between the countries of origin, the recipient countries and the transit countries, as well as within the recipient countries themselves.
As a preventive measure, Mr Provera proposes getting to the root cause of migration and addressing the lack of democratic and economic stability in the recipient countries in European foreign policy.
The European Parliament has produced various reports in the area of development policy that called on the Commission and Baroness Ashton in particular, to include the human rights situation in all its negotiations and only to provide support and facilitate trade in this context.
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate this demand.
