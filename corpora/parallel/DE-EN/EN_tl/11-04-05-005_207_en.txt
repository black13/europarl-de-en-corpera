in writing. - This report deserves whole-hearted support because it draws attention to the special role of women in agricultural business and in rural areas, while at the same time offering solutions for current challenges.
These solutions will help make the working life and day-to-day situation for women in rural areas more attractive.
One strand of this solution is supporting affordable, easy access to support services and facilities such as kindergartens, out-patient clinics, and so on, as well as the requisite infrastructure.
There is also a proposal to use EU funding to improve the quality of life in rural communities.
Another essential element is greater access to schools, higher level vocational and academic training, and an improvement of social conditions for women in rural areas.
This will not only benefit women in rural areas, but also enrich these areas, sustainably developing them as an integrated place in which to work and live.
