in writing. - This report represents a move by the European Parliament to improve living and working conditions for women in rural areas and to create opportunities for their development.
At the centre of report's proposals is the further expansion of rural infrastructure to offer women new prospects and employment opportunities.
The issue of work/family compatibility is something that also affects those in the agricultural business.
Like the rapporteur, I am convinced that a campaign of active support for rural areas is the only way to prevent women from moving to the cities.
This also requires needs-based childcare facilities and an infrastructure tailored to families in the agricultural sector, as well as access to the Internet and other communication technology.
In order to be able to implement important measures in rural areas in the future, we will require sufficient financial means for agriculture and for the development of rural areas.
I support the call in the report, emphasising the importance of not cutting the agricultural share of the EU budget as part of the forthcoming talks on the future EU financial framework.
