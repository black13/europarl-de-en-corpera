in writing. - The role of women is still a subordinate one in the agricultural sector.
According to this report, we need to cater more closely to the needs of women, particularly in non-urban areas.
Opportunities should be made available for further education and training, as well as better access to childcare.
Women farmers are contributing more and more to the diversification and adaptation of businesses, leading to a significant rise in multifunctionalism in the agricultural sector.
In order to be able to maintain the attractiveness of farming as a source of employment and a lifestyle, women should be given the chance to influence decisions in committees and associations.
Likewise, it is essential the position of women in agriculture should be made more secure in order to offer them an incentive to stay in the sector.
I have voted in favour of this report, as we must stop the decline in farming by every means available to us.
