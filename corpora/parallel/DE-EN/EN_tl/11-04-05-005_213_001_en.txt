in writing. - In many ways, women are the backbone of our agricultural sector.
The role of women is becoming increasingly important the more we try to establish the right conditions for a sustainable, ecologically responsible agricultural industry based on small holdings.
That is why it is important for society to give greater recognition and respect to the work of women in the agricultural sector.
In addition, more must be done in future to cater to the specific needs of women in the agricultural sector in order to attract the younger generations to the industry.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
