in writing. - I voted in favour of this report.
There is a continued need for an active support policy in rural areas aimed at offering women better prospects and better work opportunities.
Qualified female farmers need broadly-based training and must be able to operate and think in an entrepreneurial way.
This requires optimum infrastructure in rural areas when it comes to education, further training, schools and childcare, as well as unrestricted access to modern information technology.
In addition, women's networks and access for women entrepreneurs to credit and investment opportunities must be expanded.
