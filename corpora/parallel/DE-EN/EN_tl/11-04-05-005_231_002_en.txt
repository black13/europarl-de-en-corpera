in writing. - Nuclear reactors in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria cannot be modernised at an economically viable cost to ensure that they meet the required minimum safety standards.
As part of their accession negotiations, these three countries have undertaken to shut down and decommission the nuclear reactors within an agreed timetable.
In order to press ahead with an efficient shutdown, we need a clear financial framework and controls for the correct use of the funds provided.
I support Mr Marinescu's report because the safety of Europe's citizens must be our top priority.
