in writing. - Upgrades to some nuclear reactors in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria to ensure that they meet the required minimum safety standard are either impossible or come at an economically unreasonable cost.
Under the terms of EU accession negotiations, these Central and Eastern European States were provided with funding to help with the decommissioning of outdated reactors.
Around EUR 1 300 million had been paid out to Lithuania (Ignalina), Slovakia (Bohunice V1) and Bulgaria (Kozloduy) up to 2009.
The EU is committed to further payments until the end of 2013.
During the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis, Slovakia considered reactivating the decommissioned Bohunice power plant in order to make up for the energy deficit caused by the lack of gas supplies from Russia.
Japan has shown us how easily a nuclear power plant can get out of control.
This makes it all the more important that outdated reactors should be shut down, while at the same time building up alternative sources of energy to prevent reactivation by the back door.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
