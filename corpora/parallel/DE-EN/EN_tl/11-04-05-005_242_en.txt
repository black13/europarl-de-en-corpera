in writing. - I voted in favour of the report on the decommissioning of the three nuclear reactors in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.
Because these nuclear reactors do not meet even the minimum safety standards, their dismantling was one of the conditions agreed to by the three countries during accession negotiations and the European Union undertook to cover part of the dismantling costs.
In this context, it is particularly good news to know that the closure of the Ignalina plant in Lithuania means that the country's only nuclear power plant has been taken offline.
