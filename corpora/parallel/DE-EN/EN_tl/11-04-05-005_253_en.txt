in writing. - The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to protect workers who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis.
The Czech Republic has applied for support for 634 redundancies.
It is only right and proper that we should offer personal support to workers who have been made redundant as a result of globalisation and the economic crisis, aiding their reintegration into the labour market.
I therefore voted in favour of this.
