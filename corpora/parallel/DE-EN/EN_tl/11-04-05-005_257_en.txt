in writing. - I can only endorse the amendment tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament requiring that a company be evaluated as a whole when awarding funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF).
I have made such calls many times in the Committee on Budgets.
However, I found myself unable to vote in favour of the report as a whole.
Czech company Unilever ÄŒR spol.sr.o, which is active in the retail sector, has made 634 workers redundant and has sought support measures for all those who have lost their jobs (the individual measures are normally only needed for some of the redundant workforce to help reintegrate them into the labour market).
As emphasised in every report in which Parliament approves EGF funding, claims on the structural funds should not be used in place of measures for which businesses themselves are responsible according to the collective agreements.
