in writing. - The export of dual-use items and technology is very carefully regulated within the EU.
This term particularly relates to items and technology that can also be put to military use.
In order to prevent abuses in the export sector, there are four types of export authorisations: the Community General Export Authorisations, National General Export Authorisations, Global Export Authorisations and Individual Export Authorisations.
Each of these applies within the EU.
In addition, there are also international export control regimes to which the EU subscribes and in which the Commission attempts to improve the standing of the EU.
These include the Australia Group, of which the Commission is a full member and which includes each of the 27 Member States and the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Australia, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, in which the Commission has observer status, and which includes the EU 27, the US and Russia, the Wassenaar Arrangement, in which the Commission has no status, but which includes all EU Member States except Cyprus as full members, and the Missile Technology Control Regime, in which the Commission also has no status and of which only 19 Member States are full members.
I have voted accordingly, so as not to go against the principle of subsidiarity.
