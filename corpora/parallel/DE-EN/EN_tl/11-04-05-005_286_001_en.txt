in writing. - The report draws attention to a number of serious cases of violence against women.
I am referring to sexual abuse, physical violence within the family, enforced prostitution, forced marriage and female circumcision.
Unfortunately, all of these terrible things can also take place in our society here in the EU.
The report picks up on this fact, but fails to get to the root of the problem, which often lies in parallel societies, archaic Islamic structures or organised gangs of traffickers.
We need to work on this area.
Therefore, I have abstained from voting.
