in writing. - I voted in favour of this report because violence against women is a worldwide problem which the global community has not yet managed to tackle.
Violence against women is found at all levels of society and is not specific to any particular culture, level of education, age or income.
Women are at greatest risk in their own homes - domestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women, more common than traffic accidents and cancer put together.
The victims suffer an extreme negative impact on their health, self-esteem and safety and can no longer participate in public life or in the labour market as they would wish.
The perpetrators of such violence cause life-long suffering to these women and their children, as well as representing a social problem because the follow-up costs in the areas of health and justice amount to several billion euros.
Accordingly, the perpetrators need to be held responsible for their actions and should be subjected to public prosecutions.
Violence against women must finally be brought out into the open and put to a stop.
