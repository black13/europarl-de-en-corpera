on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I see that our fellow Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) are still at lunch.
Mr President, I am glad to see you smiling at me - you were a little intemperate in your remarks about me earlier on, but you have obviously calmed down a little over the lunch break.
Commissioner Oettinger, someone I believe you know well, has said that there would be stress tests - oh, there he is - I did not notice him there.
Mr Oettinger, it is nice to see you.
Mr Oettinger, a well-schooled disciple of Mrs Merkel, is now also opposed to nuclear power.
He was a supporter of atomic energy, but Fukushima has been a road to Damascus for him and, like a latter-day Saul, he, along with several others, has seen a bright light in the sky.
At least he has revealed that, in his opinion, there were a couple of nuclear power plants that would not pass the stress tests.
I found this very interesting.
If you suspect, Mr Oettinger, that there are stress tests that will not produce the desired result because the systems to be tested may not survive the test, then why does the Commission not intervene straight away to close these plants?
If the stress tests are anything like what happened with the banks, namely that we realise after the event firstly that the stress tests were not clear enough and secondly that the results did not reflect the actual situation, then the issue of nuclear power would be far more dangerous than the banks.
My specific question is therefore: How can it be that you are aware that certain systems will not survive the stress tests and yet do nothing about it?
