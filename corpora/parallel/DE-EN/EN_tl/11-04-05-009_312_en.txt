on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr Barroso, within the last week the Commission has set down limits based on a regulation that is always triggered whenever problems arise with radioactivity that affect food imports, in this case from Japan.
Surprisingly, the limits that you have imposed for products from Japan in this case are much higher than those applied to the same products even in Japan itself.
They are also higher than the limits set for foodstuffs in such cases by the United States, for example, a country where nuclear power is extensively used.
These limits are also higher than those that applied for the European Union and for the countries from which we imported goods following the Chernobyl disaster and that still apply to caesium in some cases.
Why should this be?
Why have we set such high limits?
