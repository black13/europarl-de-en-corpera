on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr Barroso, if I have understood you correctly, this would mean that fish affected by the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl and imported from Norway are required to meet more stringent limits than imported radioactive fish caught in the waters around Japan?
I believe this is wrong and irresponsible and would like to know whether or not you are prepared to correct these limits, which are extremely high by international standards.
