on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - My question is similar to that of Mr Schulz.
For this reason I intend to focus on a particular aspect.
Naturally you will understand that, in the light of our experiences with the bank stress tests, we have become more sensitive about stress tests, including those relating to nuclear power.
My question relates to Euratom.
I do not wish to sit as judge and jury on the huge sums of money that Euratom swallows up on research.
In my personal opinion, this research funding is being spent on a technology riddled with risk.
I do not believe these risks are subject to adequate common controls, nor do I believe that there is sufficient scope for joint decision-making on this issue.
After all, nuclear power does not respect national borders.
That is precisely where the problem lies.
Is it not the case that decisions on nuclear power should be taken on a joint basis because radiation recognises no boundaries?
