on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr Barroso, what would you think of the idea of establishing a European institution for promoting renewable energies, for the environmentally sensitive provision of energy and for energy savings within the framework of the EU Treaty?
Do you think this proposal would be worthy of your support as it could rid us of the risks of nuclear power more quickly?
