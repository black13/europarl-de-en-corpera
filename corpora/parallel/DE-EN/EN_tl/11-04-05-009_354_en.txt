As we all know, democracy means rule by the people, a principle that we took very seriously in Austria in 1978.
We held a plebiscite on nuclear power and the clear result was that the country should remain a nuclear-free zone.
This led us to pass the Act for a non-nuclear Austria, which is now enshrined in our Constitution.
But what is happening at EU level?
There are plans to carry out stress tests for nuclear power plants and to publish the results.
However these plans are not mandatory and do not include any specific obligation to deal with deficiencies.
For this reason, I clearly support the Austrian shutdown campaign.
I would also like to see this campaign spread to the rest of Europe.
We are all well aware that this is no easy matter because nuclear power remains in essence the responsibility of the Member States.
For this reason, President Barroso, I would ask you the following question: Will you press for uniform, mandatory European standards and will you finally ensure that the EU environmental standards, in particular the environmental impact assessments, are implemented correctly, and that sanctions are taken against those who break the rules?
