Madam President, thank you, Mrs Flašíková, for taking my question.
You are obviously very familiar with this report and will certainly be aware that it also requires the Member States to pay penalties if they are found not to be in compliance or if strategies are not adhered to.
How do you stand on the fact that a Member State would also be liable to pay a penalty if the obligatory primary school attendance requirement is not met?
Primary school attendance is mandatory in all countries.
Thus, if Roma children fail to attend primary school, is the relevant country liable to penalties?
Do you not think that the parents have some responsibility in ensuring that their children go to school?
