on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that we are now to have a general strategy for the Roma, but I am afraid that that not everything in the garden is rosy.
That is because the overall proposals that the Commission has placed on the table are far behind the many years of discussions with representatives of the Roma, some of which were held in this House.
For years, representatives of the Roma community, both with and without a framework strategy, have been pointing out the need for targeted measures and clear, specific requirements.
We do not even have clear sanctions should this strategy not be adhered to.
Although there have been some proposals in this direction, no actual sanctions exist, so that the system is more full of holes than a Swiss cheese.
The strategy on the Roma must take account of all the significant areas.
This is what was agreed.
However, what does the Commission have to offer other than the four key points?
There is no provision in the structures for the participation and inclusion of the Roma communities in all the decisions that relate to them.
There are no structures for the specific implementation of targets.
There is no gender perspective.
Something that also really irritates me and that I believe to be a scandal is the fact that you are unwilling to undertake any explicit action to combat discrimination against the Roma community.
You complain that the EU structural funds for the Roma are not used.
I would like to ask you quite openly: Is it not the case that discrimination against the Roma is also one of the reasons why the community has not made use of such EU funds to date?
I think so.
We, as members of the GUE/NGL Group, are highly critical of this communication.
We do not believe it to be adequate and I expect the appropriate amendments to be made.
