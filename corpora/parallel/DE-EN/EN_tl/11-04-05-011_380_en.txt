on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, the House's budget for 2012 is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation.
That is why I see it as a positive development that we have agreed in the basic guidelines that Parliament's budget is to be drawn up carefully within the framework of only modest increases and that adjustments should not exceed the inflation rate.
I believe the target mentioned by Mr Fernandes, in relation to youth employment is very important because in our last budget we were very concerned that more money should be provided for youth than was previously the case because it is young people in particular who are affected by unemployment or who need special support, including from Europe.
That is why I believe the additional EUR 100 million is a very positive approach.
As the rapporteur on buildings, I would particularly like to point out that I believe it is extremely important for us to maintain a high level of efficiency in relation to the financing of our buildings and to monitor the financial situation with care.
In this context I believe it is right that financial resources that cannot be spent on Parliament's budget over the course of the year should be used as prudently as possible to avoid interest payments.
In this regard it is also necessary to ensure that the monies are not spent in a mad rush at the end of the year, but rather that they are used to pay off buildings more quickly and more economically.
In relation to the House of European History, we shall ensure that the operating plan is carefully examined once again and that the construction costs are closely monitored so that, crucially, an orderly budget can also be presented after the building is complete following notification in accordance with Article 179(3).
