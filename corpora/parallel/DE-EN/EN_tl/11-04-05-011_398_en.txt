Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we should highlight the fact that, in the light of the continuing structural crisis in our Member States, the European Parliament is taking a cautious approach to its budgetary plans for 2012.
The tasks facing all the institutions are continually on the increase due to the expansion of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon and new activities, and expenditure is rising accordingly.
Nonetheless, cost-efficiency is the golden rule.
It is therefore only logical for Parliament to follow a strategy of consolidation in the area of personnel, reducing expenditure on the day-to-day running of the House, missions and business trips.
I particularly support the proposal of the Secretary-General that the House's environmental policy should continue.
I would emphasise that in this draft budget the European Parliament recognises the importance of a constant, consistent supply of information to Europe's citizens.
The idea of the House of European History is supported in many quarters.
For this reason it is to be welcomed that the budgetary authority has now been informed about the project.
Here too I would offer a reminder that costs need to be reduced significantly and that complete transparency is required on all points.
