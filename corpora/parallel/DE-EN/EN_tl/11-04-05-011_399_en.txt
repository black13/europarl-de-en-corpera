Madam President, I believe that the budget poses us a challenge every year, requiring us to be thrifty with resources on the one hand, while also using these resources efficiently on the other.
I think that we in this House can certainly achieve a great deal when it comes to efficiency.
It would be a very positive step if we were to establish our own points where Members of the House and staff could submit their suggestions for improvements, thereby promoting efficiency in Parliament.
On the other hand, since the Treaty of Lisbon, we have had ministers with specific remits who have sufficient resources in their Member States, their own specialist personnel, cabinets and financial resources, which they could have used to help explain European policy more clearly to our citizens.
For our part, we in the European Parliament are responsible for making the public aware of the daily decisions taken in the interest of the people of Europe.
Parliament must also be given adequate resources for its new competences in the areas of energy, world trade and foreign policy, as well as the areas of competition, the environment and social affairs, which affect us all.
I am also very much in favour of fiscal consolidation, as this would naturally allow us to make the requisite savings.
Anyone who believes that Economy Class is adequate to his needs on short-haul flights should naturally fly Economy.
There is no doubt about that.
Or, for example, if someone does not use every last penny of their secretarial allowance, that is all right too.
It is up to each of us to decide how much work we have and to what extent we wish to communicate with the citizens of Europe.
This should remain something that the Members of this House should decide for themselves, because it is naturally also extremely important that we should explain the benefits effectively.
