Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when I listen to the debate on the House of European History, it seems to me that there are only two types of Members in this House: the budget specialists, who attend this debate and who are largely critical of this project, and everybody else, who seem to find the whole thing to be just fine.
The worst thing here is that when it comes to the issue of the House of European History there are so many cooks that people have actually lost sight of the point of the whole exercise.
Thus, the Daily Telegraph today reported that documents have come into its possession indicating that the cost of this project has risen to the astronomical figure of GBP 137 million.
I can only invite the Daily Telegraph to forward these documents to the Committee on Budgets and to let us see from it some of the transparency that the press demands from the Members of this House.
I would welcome an opportunity to examine the evidence.
Does this project make sense?
Naturally it makes sense to foster an awareness of what the European Union and European integration have meant for people's lives.
Should a parliament operate a museum?
No, definitely not.
That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have followed two guiding principles on this project.
The first is: we demand that the project should have a business plan.
The second is: we want clarity on the follow-up costs, that is, how this project is to be funded going forward.
We might add a third principle: we should avoid any duplications or overlaps between the Infocentre and the House of European History.
