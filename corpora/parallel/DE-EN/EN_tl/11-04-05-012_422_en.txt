on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Šemeta, We know that 80% of the EU budget is administered in a shared management arrangement, which means that money is administered and spent in the Member States, which is exactly where the errors, irregularities and fraud occur.
The annual report on the protection of the European Union's financial interests is a bit like the Member States' list of sins, which is why I would like to thank Mr Cătălin Sorin and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their hard work.
I found the Commission's report on the protection of the European Union's financial interests contains one remarkable sentence - on page 11 in the German version.
It reads: 'For the Objective 2 programmes, the very high irregularity rates of the UK and the Netherlands, which mainly benefit from this type of programmes, may have influenced the overall rate.'
The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are two of the countries that have proposed cutting the European budget.
From my position I can only call on them to make sure that European taxpayers' money is spent correctly and to combat the level of irregularities in their countries.
I would be very interested to hear whether you have anything else to add in this context, Commissioner.
