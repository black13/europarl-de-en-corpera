Madam President, errors are made through carelessness or ignorance.
However, fraud is not something that just simply happens, but requires a high level of criminal activity.
Those who seek financial gain from the Brussels juggernaut by making false claims are sometimes seen as latter-day Robin Hoods rather than as criminals.
However, this does not just inflict damage on the EU, but also misuses the taxes paid by our citizens.
We must give new strength to the weak mechanisms for combating fraud.
I am thinking of significant financial penalties, as well as exclusion from subsidy schemes as a consequence.
In the final analysis, what we need is greater transparency and clear areas of responsibility when there is reason to suspect fraud and negligence.
We cannot allow the institutions, in particular the European Parliament and OLAF, to impede one another's investigations.
Finally, a word about our major headaches: cohesion policy, pre-accession aid and agencies.
We need to rethink our strategy here and to take decisive action to establish order.
