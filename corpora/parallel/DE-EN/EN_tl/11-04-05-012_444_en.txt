Madam President, let me start by saying that subsidy fraud and the abuse of financial aid are problems that have significantly declined in recent years.
Despite all the progress made in terms of transparency and controls, public perception remains critical.
This critical attitude is justified when we consider the way that some Member States have dealt with improperly apportioned grant payments.
The fact that only a fraction of this money has been returned to the European budget represents a blow against all taxpayers.
The Commission must recover this money immediately.
An even better solution would be to pay out a correspondingly smaller level of subsidies to the relevant Member States in the next financial year and to continue to do so until the improperly distributed funds have been returned to Brussels.
However, we are equally uneasy when very few irregularities are reported, according to the principle: if I report nothing then I do not need to worry about recovery and the money will remain in my country.
As demanded in the report, I also call on Spain, France and other countries to place their cards on the table, while also calling on the Commission to further strengthen its controls.
