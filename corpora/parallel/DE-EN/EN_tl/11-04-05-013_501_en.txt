Thank you, Mr Potočnik, for your very good and precise answer.
I have two brief additional questions.
Firstly, does the Commission check that the individual Member States really do apply the same criteria and carry out measurements with equal stringency, or are there differences here?
Secondly, do you have any specific proposals for reducing air pollution - in the cities at least?
