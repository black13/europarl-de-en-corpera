on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clear legal regulations for political parties in Europe are an important factor in shaping European society, developing European political debate and helping make the European elections truly European, with European campaigns and arguments rather than the national campaigns and arguments mainly encountered at present.
For this reason I would like to thank Mrs Giannakou most sincerely for her report.
We worked together very closely on this.
We did not agree on all the points to begin with.
However, we are happy to sign up to the final result.
I would like to point out a couple of areas that were particularly important to us during the debate.
One of them is the fact that we believe that parties who wish to participate in the democratic process must also be democratic in their structures.
This applies in particular to the election of party organs, the selection of candidates and the drawing up of lists and has now been included in paragraph 5.
I believe this represents enormous progress.
The same goes for a series of other points which I do not intend to mention here.
I would like to refer briefly to the most important point: the requirement that a party should already have one member in the European Parliament.
This was originally required in order to receive recognition and funding.
This condition now only applies to the funding issue.
This was very important to us because recognition and funding must be very clearly separated.
Recognition means that there must be free competition so that new parties with new issues and new faces can be formed in Europe.
This should not be subject to excessive constraints.
However, when it comes to the question of funding, this can, of course, be linked to a certain minimum level of electoral success.
Accordingly, we can also agree to this, even if we would have liked to have worked this point out more clearly, which is why we intend to table an amendment.
