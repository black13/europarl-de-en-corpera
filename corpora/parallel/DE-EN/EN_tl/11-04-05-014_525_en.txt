on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is taking a serious-minded and practical approach to the issue of the democratisation of European decision-making processes.
As Mrs Giannakou's report shows, this approach also involves the further development of European parties, which, although they have been an everyday political reality in Europe for many years, until now have not been equal partners and players in terms of their democratic influence on EU policy.
We need political parties at EU level too that are firmly rooted in the societies they represent and that can play a strong role in the elections to the European Parliament and in establishing European openness, based on internal democratic structures and regulations.
With regard to this particular report, I must say that I would have liked the rapporteur to have shown a great deal more courage by using the Parliament's right of initiative to take a truly significant step in developing the political system and the party system in the European Union.
This is a step that many citizens have been waiting for and that will encourage them to get involved.
The interlocking European and national decision-making levels and the relations between the political parties could have been addressed more clearly as a common factor that is transparent and open to influence.
The European Parliament should now decisively call on the Commission and Council to take the initiative in this regard.
I would expect constructive cooperation from the Commission and Council.
