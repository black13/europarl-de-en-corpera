on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, once again we find a whole package of fisheries policies on the agenda.
In my capacity as coordinator, I am pleased to see that we have reached a compromise with the Council and Commission on two regulations.
I refer to the Grelier report on technical measures and the Ferreira report on the second financial instrument.
We shall also be able to vote in favour of the fisheries agreement with the Union of the Comoros, although I do not wish to hide the fact that I would like to see a fundamental realignment of the partnership agreements within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy.
However, there are real problems between the institutions in relation to Greenland, where Parliament's powers are not respected.
I am gradually losing patience with the fact that the level of cooperation between the institutions is still so poor.
This is something that I have raised time and time again already.
I am raising the issue again today.
The problem with the management plans must be resolved as a matter of urgency.
I would appeal to the Hungarian Presidency of the Council to actively press for a solution.
The fact that there is no representative from the Council here today is a clear sign of the Council's lack of respect for Parliament.
I find this incredible.
One final remark about the Grelier report.
I am aware that some of my fellow Members are frustrated because it was not possible to incorporate the amendments they wanted.
However, I find it very regrettable that our fishermen are forced to work with out-of-date technical measures.
The fault in this case lies with the Council, which has been unable to agree to a new regulation.
As a Parliament we have a great deal of responsibility, which is why we need to act responsibly and extend the existing regulation without amendments.
