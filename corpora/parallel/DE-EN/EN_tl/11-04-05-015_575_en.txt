Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that Parliament is finally to vote on this issue and would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work.
The amendment to the Council regulation on the financial measures in the Community is one of the main tools we need in order to implement the common fisheries policy.
This is true in particular for the areas of international fishery relations, data collection and scientific studies.
The control systems of the common fisheries policy and their implementation are particularly important.
The rapporteur has made every effort to convince his fellow Members of the need to increase the co-financing rate to a maximum of 75%.
We have been unable to acquiesce to his wishes.
The existing regulations have proven themselves in practice and already allow for some exceptions.
The Member States already make use of the opportunity to avail of co-financing and there is no need for any further incentives.
It is important that the amendment to the regulation should clear the way for a coherent legal framework.
