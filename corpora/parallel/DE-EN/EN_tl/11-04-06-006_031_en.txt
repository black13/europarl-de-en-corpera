Mr President, many thanks for the information you have given us, Mr Barnier.
The Treaty of Lisbon has now been in force for two years and, for the first time, we have a sustainable social market economy as the European social model.
This may enable us to make the quantum leap to economic and social union in Europe.
The concept of the internal market must be based on this principle.
The internal market has been in existence for 20 years, but it is not yet complete.
We have a Europe 2020 strategy, which we cannot put into practice without the backing of the internal market, and we are discussing the financial perspective until 2020, which, if it does not provide more funding for political initiatives on competitiveness, growth, employment and social solidarity, will not allow us to implement the Europe 2020 concept and to meet its targets in full.
The euro is making the internal market into a home market.
The internal market is essential for growth and employment.
Everything which strengthens the internal market also increases Europe's competitiveness and, therefore, its independence.
For this reason, I am very pleased that we are taking this initiative, because it is the most important move that the European Union can make.
This is all about allowing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access to capital.
We must make sure that the financial support provided to SMEs does not only take the form of credit and the promotion of loans.
We also need to look at other approaches.
It is important for us to support venture capital funds, project bonds and e-commerce, combat piracy more effectively, create a common consolidated corporate tax base, regulate public procurement and put in place the four freedoms: the free movement of people, goods, services and capital.
We all have a lot to do.
Thank you for this initiative, Mr Barnier.
