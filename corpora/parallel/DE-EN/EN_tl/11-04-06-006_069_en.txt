Mr President, Mrs Gy≈ëri, Mr Barnier, the internal market lies right at the heart of the European Union and, following several years of chaos, we must establish a new regulatory framework for citizens, workers, consumers and businesses.
The magic word in all these measures is inclusion - the inclusion of civil society, social dialogue and the active application of the horizontal social clause in accordance with the principles of the social market economy.
What I believe is missing, which represents a genuine shortcoming of the internal market, is a proposal for the cross-border transfer of the place of business of public limited companies.
The current situation leads to negative competition between the systems.
That is not a good thing for businesses or for their employees.
Mr Barnier, we have seen that you are very hard-working and that you are prepared to present a wide range of proposals.
Please come to grips with this subject as well.
