Mr President, the aim of the proposal is to establish a new protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement in the fisheries sector between the European Community and the Union of the Comoros.
The proposed resolution will determine the fishing opportunities for European Union fishing vessels, depending on the surplus fish stocks available, and the financial contribution required in return for the access rights and the support for the fishery sector.
In principle, I welcome this agreement.
Controlled fishing is always better than uncontrolled fishing.
However, we must make proper use of this agreement and constantly assess its performance.
For me, the simple, na√Øve question is that even if there are currently surplus fish stocks, we must ensure that this situation remains unchanged in the years to come.
