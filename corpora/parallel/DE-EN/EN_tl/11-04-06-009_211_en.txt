Natural disasters are no longer a rarity in Europe.
The most recent events, such as the floods in 2010 in Poland, Slovakia, Romania, the Czech Republic and Hungary, show that the Solidarity Fund is essential.
This fund is not used to compensate private individuals for damage to property, but primarily to rebuild infrastructure.
Therefore, it can be regarded as an appropriate refinancing instrument.
In particular, in countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, there have been large-scale disasters and the direct damages exceed the usual threshold of 0.6% of Gross National Income.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of this proposal.
