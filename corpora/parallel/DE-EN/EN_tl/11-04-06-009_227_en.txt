Following the heavy rainfall in August 2010, which caused rivers to burst their banks and forced people to leave their homes, the Czech Republic applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund in October 2010.
The threshold of 0.6% of Gross National Income was not exceeded, but the majority of the population suffered as a result and the economy of the region was on the brink of collapse.
Important areas such as tourism and industry were severely damaged.
This assistance will cover part of the cost of the immediate measures needed to rebuild damaged infrastructure.
Therefore, I support this proposal.
