The EU fishing fleet is in operation throughout the world.
A bilateral relationship has been in place between what is now known as the EU and the Union of the Comoros since 1988.
The current revision of the 2006 Partnership Agreement in the fisheries sector as part of the process of extending it has also resulted in the basic principles of a sustainable fisheries policy and the responsible use of fishery resources in the Comoros fishing zone being included in the agreement.
This is not only a welcome development, but also a necessity, if the EU and its common fisheries policy are to remain credible.
In this context, the rapporteur's call for more information and more control on the part of Parliament must be strongly supported.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report.
