As the rules for resolving disputes are based on a diplomatic approach and have led to a situation where disputes can easily be blocked, the new settlement mechanism for trade disputes deserves our support.
This mechanism is modelled on the most recent agreements concluded by the EU and on the World Trade Organisation understanding.
Draft agreements with Jordan, Morocco and Egypt are already in place, which also cover trade in agricultural products.
I welcome the decision by the European Parliament to support these agreements.
