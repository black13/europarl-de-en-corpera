The participation of Ukraine in European Union programmes represents an important step both for Ukraine and for the EU.
This will help to promote the exchange of scientific knowledge and research.
The student programmes will be expanded and there will be financial, economic and social benefits for both sides.
The geographical position of Ukraine is an important factor and also represents a major advantage for the EU, because it will enable the EU to improve its contacts with other Eastern European states.
For this reason, I am in favour of this project.
