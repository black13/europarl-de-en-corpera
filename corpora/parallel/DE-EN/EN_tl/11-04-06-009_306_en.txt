In the efforts to create a common European asylum system, the focus is on the rights of asylum seekers.
However, this ignores the fact that the majority of these people are not genuine asylum seekers but economic migrants, who have no right to asylum under the Geneva Convention and who have taken up the authorities' time by providing incorrect information and employing a range of delaying tactics, giving rise to costs of billions of euro.
In the other direction, very little progress is being made with regard to repatriation.
In the light of the flood of refugees from the overpopulated regions of the world, most of whom are motivated by economic considerations, who are importing the problems and conflicts of areas all over the world into Europe and who are not required to cooperate in the process, we must oppose unequivocally the introduction of stricter unilateral standards of protection which will attract asylum seekers and economic migrants like a magnet and only exacerbate the problem.
