in writing. - I have voted against the report.
It concerns the implementation of a well-organised, common and rapid asylum procedure in Europe based on uniform legal standards.
However, the amendments tabled by the greens and the socialists will ensure that foreigners can live in the EU with almost no means available for exercising control over them.
As a result, we will be doing a disservice to the genuine asylum seekers who are applying for asylum because their lives are at risk or on political, religious or ethical grounds, as we will be grouping them together with all the other migrants.
That is not my idea of asylum policy.
Asylum policy should be an act of humanity and solidarity.
If we provide these people with a service, then they must offer something in return, for example, by acknowledging and respecting the structures of their host country.
