Meaningful statistics which provide answers to questions concerning the reason for successes and trends in the tourist industry could help to prevent many mistaken investments.
Many cities have been wondering for years why their expectations concerning tourism remained unfulfilled after they were chosen to be the European Capital of Culture.
However, the limited availability and comparability of tourism data is also a problem from the point of view of town planning.
At the end of the day, if there is the potential for an increase in visitor numbers, it is important to organise things in such a way that this does not have a negative impact on the local population.
Too many uncertain factors, differing expectations and intangible attractions, such as specific weather conditions, have turned tourism forecasts into a game of chance.
Flexible working hours and safety have an influence on tourism, in the same way as social changes do.
The decisive factors will probably ultimately be the global economy and the price of oil.
Even the best European tourism statistics cannot change these, which is why I have abstained from voting.
