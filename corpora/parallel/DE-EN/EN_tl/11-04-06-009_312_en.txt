The Treaty of Lisbon has increased the EU's responsibility for tourism.
It goes without saying that statistics provide fundamental information and allow interesting conclusions to be drawn not only at an EU level, but also at a national and regional level.
In my region, which is home to the German-speaking community in Belgium, tourism is not only an important area of competence, but also a crucial economic factor.
For this reason, these statistics represent a significant element of policy making.
However, it is also clear that the different levels - regional, national and cross-border - must work together to define the regions of Europe more accurately as a tourism location, particularly in border areas.
