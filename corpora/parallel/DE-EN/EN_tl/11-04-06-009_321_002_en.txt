The regulation is an important instrument for implementing the common fisheries policy.
The control activities are playing a growing role in supporting sustainability and the continued existence of the fisheries sector.
It is important that the Member States and their supervisory authorities enforce control measures in their waters to ensure that we have fisheries which comply with the rules and respect stocks.
In addition, aquaculture is increasing in importance, which justifies the introduction of options for collecting, managing and using environmental as well as socio-economic data.
I welcome the revision of the regulation, because it will guarantee that the measures referred to will be put in place.
