The European Parliament is under an obligation to spend taxpayers' money in an appropriate and responsible way.
In a time of economic crisis, it is particularly important to make economical use of taxpayers' money.
Therefore, it is highly regrettable that Parliament is not prepared to commit to saving money, for example, by travelling economy class on flights shorter than four hours.
As Parliament has once again missed the opportunity of demonstrating to the citizens of Europe its clear commitment to making savings, behaving responsibly with taxpayers' money and giving up its privileges, I have voted against the report.
