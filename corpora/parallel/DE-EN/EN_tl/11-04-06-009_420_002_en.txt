It is important for us to strengthen the internal market, in particular, during an economic crisis, when the impact of the crisis is being felt.
We need to return to a secure labour market.
This can be guaranteed primarily with the support of small and medium-sized businesses, which are one of the main engines within the national economies.
As the rapporteur has spoken out in favour of increased supervision and assessment of internal market policies, I have not voted for the report.
It is not clear how this can be achieved and what consequences it would have for the individual states.
