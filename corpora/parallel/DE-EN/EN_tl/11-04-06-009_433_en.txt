This report concerns the 19 initiatives proposed by the Commission which will put European citizens at the heart of the internal market and, at the same time, will work towards a sustainable social market economy.
I particularly welcome this report, among other things, because it will benefit European citizens, especially those who live in border regions.
The proposed measures will make the everyday lives of citizens and businesses in border regions easier.
The report supports the initiative to recognise professional qualifications and the 'Youth on the Move' initiative.
In addition, tax obstacles will be identified and eliminated and decisive measures will be taken to prevent double taxation.
Furthermore, the report calls for fair working conditions for all Europeans and also full portability of pension rights.
These measures will make citizens the centre point of the internal market.
Their specific needs will be matched by specific measures.
