Mr President, there have recently been demonstrations in Germany in which 250 000 people called for an immediate exit from nuclear power and a changeover to 100% renewable energy.
Both of these things are possible.
After Chernobyl and Fukushima, it is clear that nuclear power will always involve a residual risk.
Therefore, it must be mandatory for the nuclear safety standards throughout Europe to be based on the best available technologies.
Despite the adoption of the Council Directive concerning the nuclear safety of nuclear installations in 2009, the existing safety standards remain in place in the Member States.
Therefore, we urgently need a revision of this directive with the involvement of Parliament under the codecision procedure which is not based on the Euratom Treaty.
I want to see an initiative involving as many of the groups in Parliament as possible which will call on the Council and the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive to this effect.
I believe that we need a nuclear exit scenario covering the whole of Europe.
