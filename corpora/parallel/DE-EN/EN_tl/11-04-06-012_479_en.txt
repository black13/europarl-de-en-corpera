Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events in Japan have shown us that the only totally safe nuclear power plant is the one that was never built or the one that was shut down.
These are the only ones that are completely safe.
Since the events in Japan, we know that all other claims are untrue.
The citizens of Europe know that and this is why they want to see a strong response from us.
The only response that we can give is that our vision is to develop a Europe which is totally based on renewable energy.
We can gradually begin to put this vision into practice by a combination of energy efficiency in homes, transport, industry and electricity generation, a wide range of renewable energies and the use of natural gas as a transition fuel.
Mr Oettinger, you are in the process of drawing up the Energy Roadmap 2050.
Our question to you is: Are you prepared to work with us on a vision of this kind?
Are you convinced that the Energy Roadmap 2050 should be used as the basis for a discussion not only with experts but also with the citizens of Europe about a different future for energy in Europe?
