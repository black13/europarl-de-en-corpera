Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the joint resolution.
We are sending two specific messages to those in positions of responsibility in the Member States and to the population of Europe.
We need common rules to protect us from nuclear accidents throughout the whole of Europe.
The time for a parochial approach to nuclear safety has long since gone.
Two older power stations in Germany, 180 km from Strasbourg, have been temporarily shut down and disconnected from the grid.
Around 100 km away from here in Fessenheim is a reactor which, as far as we know, is no safer than the two power plants in Germany that have been disconnected from the grid as a result of events in Japan.
This example clearly shows that we need common criteria at a very high level.
We have the legal basis in place and the question of how far we go with the existing legal basis will always be a political one.
We need to go much further than we have in the past.
The second message is that regardless of the decisions made in the Member States, and some will disconnect power stations from the grid more quickly than others, we should not be replacing the lost energy with additional gas imports, for example, from Russia.
Paragraphs 21 and 22 show the direction in which we want to go.
We want more renewable energy and more energy efficiency.
Mr Oettinger, before the events at Fukushima, you produced an energy efficiency action plan.
That was an important step forward and it now needs to be put into practice even more urgently.
Personally, I agree with the majority of this House that we need binding targets.
We no longer want to use fossil fuels.
We want jobs in trade and industry.
Energy efficiency is cost-effective and so we urgently need to make progress in this area.
