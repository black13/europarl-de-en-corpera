Mr President, Mr Reul, you know that I have always supported higher levels of safety in the nuclear industry.
When it came to the Nuclear Safety Directive which we adopted two years ago, I had very little success.
A large majority of this House was against the highest safety standards.
The subject of a new feeling of mutual trust presents us with another major problem.
Parliament has no contribution to make to this debate.
If there is any doubt, the decisions on nuclear safety and stress tests will be made by the Council and by Euratom.
Parliament will be excluded from the process.
We are generally able to express our opinion, but whether this will have any consequences or not is in the lap of the gods.
If you are now saying that we will take action against the old Euratom Treaty in future and ensure that there is consultation and transparency in all the areas relating to safety, we will perhaps be able to come to a better understanding.
