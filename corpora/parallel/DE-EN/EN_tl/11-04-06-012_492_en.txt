Mr President, Mrs Harms, I did not fully understand your question, because it was not a question.
However, that is not a bad thing, because I have made an effort and will continue making an effort to take up this opportunity.
You know that we have totally opposing positions on this subject.
It would send out an important signal, regardless of the question of powers, if we could agree on the issue of increased safety with a large majority.
The resolution covers a number of areas, many more than those we have already adopted and many more than I was prepared to go along with.
That is true and you are absolutely right.
However, if we can manage to agree on more safety and more Europe, we will be sending out a signal to the Member States.
If we do this tomorrow on the basis of a dispute, because we have different positions when it comes to the issue of whether or not we should exit from nuclear power, then it will probably not have a major impact.
This is all that I am asking for, no more and no less.
