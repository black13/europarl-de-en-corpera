Mr President, Mr Reul, I wanted to ask you whether your personal position has changed at all.
The sweater that I am wearing today is 30 years old.
In those days, we were demonstrating against nuclear power.
The so-called experts told us that there was a risk of an accident once every ten thousand years.
The Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Mr Schnellhuber, recently said in an interview with Die Zeit that this is true.
If you divide ten thousand years by the 400 nuclear power plants in the world, the result is 25 years.
Therefore, we can expect a reactor accident to happen every 25 years.
First Chernobyl, then Fukushima.
Where next?
Have you changed your position on this point?
Do you still believe that nuclear power stations are safe or do you share my opinion that Zwentendorf is the only safe nuclear power station in the world?
