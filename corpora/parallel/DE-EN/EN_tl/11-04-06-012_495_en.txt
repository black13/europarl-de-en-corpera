Mr President, of course my opinion has changed, but not fundamentally.
Is it so bad not to change your views about something?
However, my opinion has changed a great deal and I hope you have noticed that.
I have explained that I will vote in favour of this resolution if it stays as it is.
That is a major change in comparison to my previous views.
You may see that as being satisfactory or as unsatisfactory.
I stand by what I have said.
It would be good if we could adopt this resolution unanimously.
