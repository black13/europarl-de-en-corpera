Mr President, you have heard what the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has said.
Now I am speaking as Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the differences could not be greater.
The fact that we need the highest safety levels for all nuclear power plants goes without saying.
We all agree on that.
Mr Oettinger, your stress test is an important first step, but it does not go nearly far enough.
I also believe that we need to rethink our approach and come up with a new one which goes into greater depth and is far more fundamental.
This is why, in addition to the highest safety standards in the EU, we also need an exit scenario from a risky technology, which we cannot justify using on the densely populated continent of Europe.
Mr Reul, you and others will simply have to go along with this.
Your colleagues in Berlin have made much more progress than you have here in Strasbourg and in Brussels.
They have probably reached the turning point, while you are still stuck with your old ideas.
I hope that we can come up with a formulation, a scenario and a strategy for exiting from nuclear power.
Mr Oettinger, the road map which you are producing in June of this year would be a wonderful opportunity to achieve this.
After the stress tests, you must also give us your idea of how we can get out of nuclear technology.
(Applause)
