Mr President, Mrs Jordan Cizelj, there is a power station in Kr≈°ko in your country, which is viewed rather critically, among other things, because it is located in an earthquake zone.
Are you prepared at least to ensure that it is one of the first power stations to be investigated using strict and, hopefully, objective stress tests, so that we can make sure that the citizens are at no immediate risk from this power station, although it is in an earthquake zone, and that improvements can be made for as long as the power station remains in existence?
