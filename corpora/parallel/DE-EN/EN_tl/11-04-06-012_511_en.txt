Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Austria and we are all worried about Kr≈°ko.
I hope that the assurances made by Mrs Jordan Cizelj will be followed up.
I would like to express my concern for and sympathy with the people of Japan who have suffered a great deal and who are coping with these events with calm stoicism.
However, we should try to draw some positive conclusions from the disaster.
The only positive aspect is that we must reconsider our position and begin to learn lessons in Europe from the catastrophe.
One short-term lesson is the need to bring about a huge improvement in safety standards in European reactors.
Another lesson is that we must establish a European civil protection body.
Europe must allow its safety and rescue teams to work together across national borders.
The long-term lesson involves the need to draw up a common exit scenario, because events have clearly shown that nuclear technology as it currently stands is too dangerous and that is unlikely to change in future.
The consequences are too long-lasting.
You can see from my remarks that the divide runs right across all the groups, including the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
However, overall, I believe that we should take to heart the fact that the famous safety standards promised us by everyone simply cannot be guaranteed.
Therefore, the stress tests must cover an accumulation of different risks.
If we only investigate individual risks, we will never have a realistic scenario.
In this context, realistic means that it is very difficult, for example, to predict a tsunami, even if it is unlikely to happen here in Europe, but we do have earthquake zones here.
(Applause)
