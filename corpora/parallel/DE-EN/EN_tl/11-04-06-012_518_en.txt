Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear disaster in Japan has shown us one thing.
Nature is stronger and more powerful than mankind.
For this reason, it is high time for us finally to disconnect from the grid the old nuclear power stations and those that are at risk of earthquakes and, in the long-term, to get out of nuclear power.
We need stress tests, Mr Oettinger!
We do not want a second Chernobyl.
We need limits for food from Japan.
I have one question for the Commission.
Do you really want to irradiate the people of Europe?
You should withdraw this implementing regulation immediately and preferably today.
We must invest in and make use of alternative energies.
They do exist.
They are safe, environmentally friendly and less harmful to people.
One more point: they create new jobs.
In Austria, we had the Zwentendorf nuclear power plant that was never connected to the grid.
Now it is a solar power station.
