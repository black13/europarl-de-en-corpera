Mr President, the jasmine revolution which started in Tunisia is unfortunately not taking such a peaceful path in Yemen, Syria and Bahrain.
A dialogue between the government and the opposition is definitely the best way of agreeing on an active solution to social and economic problems, which is what is wanted by the people, and a move towards more democratic participation.
Whether agreements of this kind will then be kept is another question altogether.
After all, the wave of protests was triggered by broken promises of political reform.
The people have been put off with promises for too long and now action is needed.
The dual strategy of violently suppressing opposition demonstrations and, at the same time, promising a few small reforms without introducing any real political change could lead to an escalation of the situation in all three countries, as we are aware.
The ongoing unrest in Syria gives rise to the concern that arms bought by the government could be sold on to terrorist organisations, such as Hezbollah.
In my opinion, the EU should play the role of impartial mediator in these conflicts.
