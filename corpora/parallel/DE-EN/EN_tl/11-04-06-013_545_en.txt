Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, spring has arrived in the Mediterranean, but in the Gulf and in Syria, winter still reigns.
The images of violence which we are seeing are horrifying.
Several hundred people have been killed and Amnesty International and the United Nations have produced alarming reports.
The calls which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are making are clear.
We want a special session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to be held as quickly as possible.
The Council of Europe and the Member States of the European Union which are represented on the UN Human Rights Council should take up this call.
The UN Council is always very quick to act when it comes to taking one side in the Middle East conflict.
It is now time for it to face the real challenge presented by these extreme violations of human rights.
We need reform, we need a move to democracy, and we need an arms embargo.
All of these things have already been mentioned here.
I watched the speech made by President Assad of Syria live.
This is a medieval-style dictatorship which uses western PR agencies to present its representatives as pseudo-modernising influences in glossy magazines.
The agencies and the magazines should be asking themselves whether this is really the right thing to do.
Now to Yemen.
This is where there is, in my opinion, the greatest danger: the risk of a split between north and south, an active al-Qaeda cell and the danger of a failed state.
We already have a failed state of this kind in the case of Somalia and our Atalanta mission is in operation in the Gulf of Aden.
Europe has a direct interest in the area and we need to hear more than what the representative of the Council has said here today.
