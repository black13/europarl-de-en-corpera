Mr President, I believe that many of the young people who live in these countries long for democracy, modernisation and freedom.
We need to take this fact into account.
We must try to win friends in these countries and not make blanket judgments.
Instead, we must identify those individuals who do not follow the rules of a modern society.
For this reason, we should try to organise exchange programmes for small and medium-sized businesses, for teachers, university professors and journalists.
Our job is to make friends in these countries.
I hope that we will soon be taking action of this kind.
