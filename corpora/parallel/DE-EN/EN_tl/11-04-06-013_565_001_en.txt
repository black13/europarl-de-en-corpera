As well as the Islamic faith, Syria, Bahrain and Yemen have one thing in common: an authoritarian regime, regardless of whether the ruler is a king, a president or the Assad clan.
In Western terms, they are undoubtedly undemocratic systems.
Growing revolutionary tendencies like those in Egypt or Tunisia are being nipped in the bud and democracy and human rights are being disregarded.
In Yemen, for example, 37% of under-age girls undergo forced marriages.
This puts Yemen in second place in the world, exceeded only by Somalia.
The governments of these three countries must demonstrate that they are working for and not against their people.
For decades, the EU has supported and paid court to countries like this, while this was to its economic and geopolitical advantage.
The EU should fight more strongly for democracy and human rights and combat the process of radical Islamification in these countries.
