Mr President, Mr Vigenin, you have spoken here as the rapporteur and not as an ordinary speaker.
Are you aware that the country has introduced massive reforms and made huge progress?
The instability comes from the European Union's actions.
The EU and the Council were prevented from acting by the blackmailing tactics of Greece, which have been clearly addressed by the Hungarian Presidency.
Did you know that or do you really believe what you said?
