Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Füle, I was one of the first or perhaps the first rapporteur on Macedonia in this House and I am watching with regret how the situation has and has not developed.
After this, I became rapporteur for Croatia and there, it is possible to see a clear difference.
Croatia had problems with its neighbours, including Slovenia, but Croatia worked to solve the problems.
If Macedonia does not make enough effort to resolve its difficulties, although I do not want to blame just one side, then at least that is Macedonia's problem.
Let us be honest.
You cannot give the country a greater sense of identity by erecting a statue of Alexander the Great in every square or by calling the airport after Alexander the Great.
You must have an interest in resolving the problems.
Why is this interest important?
Mr Füle referred to the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which represented major progress.
However, the less effort the country and the government make to implement domestic reforms and to find a solution together with Greece, the more the Albanian population of the country will say: 'What are we doing in this country when we really have no option of joining the European Union?'
This is why it is so urgent for Macedonia to work together with Greece to resolve the problem.
