Mr President, like Mr Swoboda, I would like to compare Croatia and Macedonia.
Both countries have an exemplary record as far as minorities are concerned.
The minorities in both countries are all represented in the government, which is not the case in most EU Member States.
However, there is one difference.
In Croatia, the opposition has largely taken a constructive approach.
In Macedonia, the socialist opposition has used brutal blocking tactics.
I regret the fact that some Members of this House have today turned themselves into the tools of the socialist opposition during the election campaign.
