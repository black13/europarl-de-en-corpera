Mr President, in a deeply divided country like Côte d'Ivoire, can a lasting peace be brought about by violent means and can the winner of the presidential election be legitimised?
This seems extremely doubtful, especially as the real causes of the conflict have not been resolved.
The country was destabilised as a result of economic problems brought about largely by the structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank.
The sanctions which were rapidly imposed with the aim of weakening the Gbagbo government have exacerbated the situation and given rise to a humanitarian crisis in Côte d'Ivoire.
The legitimacy of both claimants to the presidency is in dispute.
The armies of both sides are responsible for massacring the civilian population.
Once again, the West has taken sides and now the United Nations (UN) is waging war alongside French troops to try to ensure the victory of one side in the conflict.
Will European powers once again be deciding the fate of African people as they did in colonial times, but this time with the support of the UN?
What has happened to the principles of international law?
Is this the concept on which the UN was founded?
Instead of aiming for peaceful solutions to conflicts, the UN seems to be supporting civil wars or taking sides in them.
Whose interest is this in?
