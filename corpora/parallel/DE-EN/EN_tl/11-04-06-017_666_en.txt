Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my surprise that Baroness Ashton is once again not here.
However, I am pleased that she is being represented by my friend, Mr Németh.
I would like to see him, Mr Füle or another person permanently coordinating the foreign policy of the European Union and not someone who is hardly ever here in the European Parliament.
On the matter itself, I would like to make it quite clear that Côte d'Ivoire, of course, has many problems which need to be resolved.
However, President Ouattara was clearly the winner of the election and he is the person who has democratic legitimacy.
This is the view of the African Union and of many other bodies.
Therefore, we should be grateful that the United Nations (UN) and, above all, the UN Secretary-General and President Sarkozy, have prevented a massacre from occurring like those in other African states, such as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
For this reason, we should not quibble over this.
Of course, this does not resolve the problems.
However, when Mr Putin starts to criticise the UN and to say that the UN Secretary-General has gone beyond his mandate, this destabilises the UN at a time when it is urgently needed.
The African Union should also not express its opinions so loudly, because it has completely failed to help in this crisis.
The African Union should have helped to bring about democracy in Côte d'Ivoire.
We Europeans have made many mistakes in the past and we are continuing to do so.
However, in this case, the mistakes are someone else's responsibility.
