Madam President, Mr FÃ¼le, Mr Siwiec, thank you for devoting yourself to this subject.
Parliament's almost unanimous opinion is that Neighbourhood Policy has not produced the expected results.
I agree with that.
However, I do not agree with the analysis of the causes.
The results do not meet our expectations because we have not focused on the interests which we have in common with our neighbours.
Instead, we have concentrated on our own interests and on our ideas of how neighbouring countries should develop.
Quite obviously, what we need is a different approach.
We need a policy which makes cooperation between both sides a central principle and which respects the sovereign right of the citizens in the partner countries to shape their future without outside interference.
The content of the policy must focus on our common European challenges and transform partnership policy into a permanent tool for genuine cooperative discussions and for identifying solutions to joint problems.
We will not make any progress in our Neighbourhood Policy unless we change our views and develop new political approaches.
