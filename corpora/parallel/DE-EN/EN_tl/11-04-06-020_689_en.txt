Madam President, I would like to say something very briefly in response to my fellow Member's objection about the costs, despite the fact that he has disappeared again.
The two rapporteurs, who produced very good reports and whom I would like to thank very much, indicate relatively clearly what the costs would be if we did not have a Neighbourhood Policy.
They would be much higher in terms of human costs, if we look at the refugee crisis in the south, but also, of course, in terms of economic and social costs, if we look at all our neighbouring countries in the south and east.
I would like to say a few words about the Eastern Partnership.
Other Members will be speaking about the Southern Partnership.
It is true that the situation in Belarus is bad, but we must make every effort to contact unofficial bodies, individual citizens, young people and students to encourage genuinely positive and democratic development from the inside out.
In response to Mr Schulz, who earlier said that Belarus and Ukraine were in the same situation, I would like to explain that the differences between them are very great.
In Ukraine, we should look at the problems, but also at what is going well and at the positive changes.
A brief comment on the Southern Caucasus, because it is important for us to focus on this area, too.
The developments in Azerbaijan, where bloggers and demonstrators are being imprisoned, are alarming.
It is shameful for a country like Azerbaijan and for its President to do things of this kind.
We are concerned about a possible new conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
I would like to ask Mr FÃ¼le to keep a very close eye on this region and to help the region to emerge from the mess it is in and from this conflict situation.
