Mr President, I think it is difficult to go into detail on this right now in view of the time available.
However, I have a large number of reports from NGOs that I am happy to make available.
I believe that the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also familiar with these.
These reports talk of how development aid is supported locally by the EIB in African and Asian countries and also make some criticisms of this.
I am happy to make the reports available, but I cannot answer the question in detail right now.
