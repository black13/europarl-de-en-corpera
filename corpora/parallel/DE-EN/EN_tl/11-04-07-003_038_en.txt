Mr President, Mr Maystadt, this debate is of great importance for the economies of our Member States.
It has shown that those countries that have a healthy balance between large concerns and small and medium-sized enterprises have come out of the crisis best.
Looking at Germany, we have a situation in which 70% of the economy consists of SMEs, and this is enabling us to provide appropriate numbers of jobs and training places.
We need to pass on the message to the various banks in the Member States that this makes it easier to make investments, that small and medium-sized enterprises can be expanded, and that the European Investment Bank provides support for this.
This is very important if we are to return our economies to growth and be competitive vis-Ã -vis America and South-East Asia in the marketplace.
I therefore consider this initiative by the European Investment Bank to be of the greatest importance.
However, it also needs to be effective in bringing about growth, to bring us out of the economic and financial crisis.
