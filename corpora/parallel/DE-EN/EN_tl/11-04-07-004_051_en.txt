Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, the proposal for a directive on vaccination against bluetongue is a very important step towards eradicating this dangerous animal disease.
It is a disease that affects ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats.
It can result in the animals dying.
The new inactivated vaccines enable the risk of infection to be excluded, so that this vaccine can also be successfully used in areas where the disease has not yet occurred.
This will allow the Member States to use the vaccinations more effectively, significantly reducing the burden on the agricultural sector as a result of this disease.
The new vaccines allow the disease to be combated on a genuinely broad front once and for all, and I hope that the Member States and farmers will take this opportunity.
It provides greater safety, and it is unquestionably a major improvement in animal health.
The more we contain the spread of bluetongue using the new vaccines, the greater the opportunities to export farm animals for the benefit of the economy.
In order that the directive may enter into force and the new vaccines may be made available, it is, in fact, important that we take a decision quickly.
On Monday, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sent out a clear signal by unanimously adopting the report, and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will follow its lead in today's plenary vote.
I support the rapporteur's call to leave the correlation tables in the report.
After all, we cannot take decisions in Europe without the Member States providing information on how they are implemented.
We also need this transparency - and I say this to the Council very clearly - in order to strengthen the credibility of the EU.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and constructive cooperation.
Many thanks!
The report will have our support.
