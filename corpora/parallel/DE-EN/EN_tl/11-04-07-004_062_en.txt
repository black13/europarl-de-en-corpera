Mr President, bluetongue is an animal epidemic affecting ruminants that has already caused great damage throughout the livestock and production sector.
Since the break-out of epidemics in a number of Member States in 2000, considerable economic damage has been caused.
As always, whenever economic losses occur, the financial damage affects those at the bottom of the production chain most.
In particular, the flourishing trade in breeding cattle collapsed.
Despite vaccination, exports were completely paralysed in some countries.
In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers had their livelihoods threatened.
We must take the time now to take preventive action.
The disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge at any time.
We need to learn from experience and be able to offer assistance quickly.
What was true ten years ago no longer applies.
The old directive on measures to combat bluetongue from 2000 needs to be improved and updated.
The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers.
The rules of that time were designed for the use of live attenuated vaccines, which were the only vaccines available at the time the directive was adopted 10 years ago.
Today's vaccines are more advanced.
We need to take account of this fact.
I welcome the rapid action on the part of the Commission and of Parliament and advocate the rapid implementation of the new directive.
As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle.
Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of breeders and farmers.
Many thanks to the rapporteur.
