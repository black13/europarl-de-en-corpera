Mr President, improving the vaccination arrangements for bluetongue is an extremely important matter.
The new inactivated vaccines allow producers, for the first time, to exclude the risk of infection with this potentially highly dangerous disease, because the vaccines can now also be used in areas in which bluetongue has not previously been found.
In view of this, we must repeatedly emphasise that agriculture - including exports of breeding animals - is an important factor in all the countries of Europe.
Farmers therefore need to be able to take advantage of the latest knowledge in animal health, which has been used to develop these vaccines.
There are two things that we now particularly need.
Firstly, we need a rapid solution concerning practice in the European Union.
Secondly, in my view, we just as urgently need an obligation for the measures introduced in the Member States to be notified; in other words, an obligation on the Member States to report to the Commission.
