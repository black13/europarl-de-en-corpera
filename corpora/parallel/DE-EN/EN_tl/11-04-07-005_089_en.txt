Mr President, one of the reasons the internal market was established was so as to provide European consumers with better protection.
Consumers have a right to be able to buy healthy, fairly produced products throughout the European Union.
Opening up the market - in other words, a controlled import quota - must therefore be subject to at least three requirements being met.
Firstly, there must be clear control of the quantity of imports permitted.
This relates mainly to the quantitative aspect.
Secondly, the quality of the products must also be controlled.
This also relates to production standards.
Thirdly, the impact on farmers in the European Union needs to be taken into consideration.
Business that harms third parties - and here, this generally means business that favours industry to the detriment of agriculture - must be prevented.
I therefore ask the Commission to subject the agreement with Morocco to further careful scrutiny and not to sign it until it has undergone a further review.
