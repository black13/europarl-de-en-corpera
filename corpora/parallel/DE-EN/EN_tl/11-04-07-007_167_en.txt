Madam President, I am always pleased when new members join the European Union, which is why I also voted in favour of this motion.
However, I would like to see all issues being placed clearly on the table during the accession negotiations and being discussed and dealt with beforehand.
Problems that are not dealt with out of misplaced amicability do not go away.
It is often a harder, more protracted process to resolve them subsequently and the result is mutual disappointment.
Let me reiterate: I am always pleased when a new member joins the EU, but every member has not just rights but also responsibilities.
