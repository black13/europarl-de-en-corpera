Madam President, I also voted in favour of this report and of this resolution - in favour of Macedonia.
However, if we are being honest about this, then there is one detail that must be mentioned.
We cannot tell people and ethnic groups in other countries to rename their language because other countries do not like what they call it.
That is laid down in international law, and as Europeans we must be sure that we remain honest about this.
I was consequently very annoyed that unfortunately, one amendment was passed that I voted against, which stated that Macedonian should not be allowed to be called Macedonian.
Macedonia is a country with great prospects in Europe mainly because it also has great economic prospects in the Balkans, a region that has genuine difficulties, is prospering economically, and is conducting the negotiations with Ã©lan - which is very positive.
In view of this positive attitude, I would like to thank all the Members who voted for this resolution, as well as all those who worked with the parliament there as part of the European Parliament delegation.
We should make these prospects clear to the people there who want to be part of Europe.
Let us work together to that end.
