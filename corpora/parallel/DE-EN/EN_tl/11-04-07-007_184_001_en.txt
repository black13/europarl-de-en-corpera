Bluetongue is a horrible animal epidemic affecting ruminants that has caused great damage throughout the livestock sector.
The economic damage and the losses resulting from the trade coming to a standstill are hitting the farming sector hard.
In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers have found their livelihoods threatened.
It is now important to implement supporting measures and revise the old regulation before the next epidemic breaks out.
The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers.
I welcome the rapid action at EU level and advocate the fast implementation of the new directive.
As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle.
Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of those that keep animals.
