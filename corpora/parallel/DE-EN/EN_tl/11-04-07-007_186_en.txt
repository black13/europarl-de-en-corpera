Animal epidemics can still destroy the livelihoods of farmers.
One of these is bluetongue, of which there have been repeated epidemics in Northern Europe since 2000 and which can cause particularly great damage.
Cattle and sheep are particularly badly affected by the disease, which is caused by a virus transmitted by the gnat, a type of midge.
An illness has also been observed in goats, but the course of the disease is far less dramatic in these than in the case of other species.
The possibility of vaccination was first permitted in 2000, but was subject to strict rules since untreated animals could also have been infected by the viruses through the vaccine.
However, now there is a new vaccination method that does not pose this risk, allowing more flexible forms of vaccination to be carried out.
I voted in favour of the report because I consider it right and proper to protect our livestock from epidemic diseases.
The flexibility called for will allow farmers to protect their animals.
