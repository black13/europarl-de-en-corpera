This resolution cannot cover every aspect of the debate on nuclear energy in detail.
However, I remain convinced that it must be our aim to progressively phase out this source of energy and to use renewable energy to a greater extent.
Amendment 10 also proposed that in the case of nuclear power stations in border areas, the local and regional bodies must be involved in the decisions on both sides of the border.
This amendment was not adopted.
While some aspects of the resolution are indeed positive, Amendment 10 was decisive for me.
That is why I decided no longer to support this resolution and to abstain.
