In principle, I support this resolution because it calls for a first step towards phasing out nuclear power throughout the European Union.
Where the substance of the resolution is concerned, however, I would comment that - as so often with resolutions of this type - it is a case of too little, too slowly.
In the end, the principle of the lowest common denominator prevails, which certainly cannot be satisfactory in the long term.
The only correct solution would be to phase out nuclear energy completely throughout the European Union, and to do so as quickly as possible.
I will do everything I can to work towards this.
