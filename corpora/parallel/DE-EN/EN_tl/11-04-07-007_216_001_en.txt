It is high time for a rethink as regards the use of nuclear energy in Europe.
We must now start to take action, close down dangerous reactors and, in the medium term, find a way to phase out nuclear energy completely.
We need to reject once and for all the misplaced belief that man has the dangers posed by nuclear energy under control.
I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.
