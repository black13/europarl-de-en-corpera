First of all, I would like to make it clear that the possible accession of Iceland to the Union is subject to the consent of the Icelandic people.
The decision must be left to the people and must not be influenced further by the EU.
As far as the progress report is concerned, Iceland stands up to international comparison in numerous areas and in others, even leads the field: I am thinking here of areas such as per capita income, education, research and development, and the safeguarding of human rights.
I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.
