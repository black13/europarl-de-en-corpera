Iceland is already cooperating closely with the European Union as a member of the European Economic Area, of the Schengen Agreements and the Dublin Regulation.
Iceland is also achieving very good results where the protection of human rights is concerned.
There is a high level of investment in areas such as education, research and development, which makes Iceland well-placed internationally in these areas.
However, the consent of the Icelandic population is required before we can talk about the accession of Iceland to the EU.
It would be advisable to stop any propaganda by the EU aimed at convincing the Icelanders of the benefits of accession.
In economic terms, an OECD report from May 2010 says that Iceland has succeeded in consolidating its economy and, despite the financial crisis, its per capita income still leads the world.
The project therefore has my support.
