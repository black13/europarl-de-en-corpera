On 9 April 2001, Macedonia was the first country in the Western Balkans to enter into a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
The status of reforms since 2001 can be judged positively in many respects.
Where the judiciary is concerned, legal provisions have been passed to ensure both independence from political pressure and efficiency.
The improvements to the transparency of the court system, particularly as regards dealing with the backlog of cases in most courts, are also to be welcomed.
The country can already be seen to be making progress towards the transition to a functioning market economy, although there is still a long way to go.
Only the dispute with Greece over its name is blocking Macedonia's accession to the EU, and it is to be hoped that this can be resolved in the near future.
However, I abstained from voting because some aspects of the report are very unbalanced.
