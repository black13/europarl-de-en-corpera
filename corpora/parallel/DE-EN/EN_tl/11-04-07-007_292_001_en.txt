The serious human rights abuses and acts of violence committed by the defeated President Gbagbo must be condemned by the EU in the strongest possible terms.
If humanitarian law continues to be broken, specific sanctions must be imposed.
However, it is also important that violent crimes on both sides are punished; in other words, also those of which the new President Ouattara has been accused.
For the victims of violent assaults, it is of little concern who ordered the violence.
In this respect, I consider the resolution too one-sided.
