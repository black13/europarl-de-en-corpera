Following the election results in CÃ´te d'Ivoire, President Gbagbo - who had been democratically voted out - was not prepared to accept his removal from office.
Neither attempts at negotiation nor international criticism were successful, resulting in a crisis involving incidents of violent conflict.
It is important to maintain international pressure, for example, by condemning the human rights abuses and crimes against humanitarian law in the strongest possible terms and by imposing sanctions.
Efforts in respect of abducted civilians, who include EU citizens, are equally important.
However, this resolution looks only at the atrocities committed by the troops of the defeated President Gbagbo, and not at the charges made against the troops of the newly elected President Ouattara.
Where acts of violence are concerned, it should make no difference who committed them.
