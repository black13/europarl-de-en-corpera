The European Neighbourhood Policy is an instrument for ensuring stability and promoting peaceful and democratic structures, as well as for deepening bilateral relations with the countries surrounding the EU.
In the countries of the South Caucasus, in particular, there is much to do, especially since the region is repeatedly the subject of conflict.
What the European Neighbourhood Policy is not, and nor should it be, is a preliminary stage of enlargement policy.
I feel that this is not made clear, and consequently, I cannot support the motion.
