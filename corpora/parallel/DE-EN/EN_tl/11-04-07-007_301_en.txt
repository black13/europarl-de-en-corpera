Originally, the three countries of the South Caucasus were excluded from the European Neighbourhood Policy and were only included in the action radius of the Neighbourhood Policy.
Action Plans to deepen bilateral relations are an important instrument of the European Neighbourhood Policy which are brokered individually for each country, since in practice, every country follows its own path.
The region of the South Caucasus, in particular, is characterised by a series of conflicts, the final solution of which is judged even by experts to be extremely difficult in some cases.
In this context, it is important to repeatedly make it clear that the EU's Neighbourhood Policy does not automatically lead towards accession (as in the enlargement process).
Rather, it is concerned with security policy aspects and increasing stability.
This is not expressed sufficiently in the resolution, which is why I did not vote in favour.
