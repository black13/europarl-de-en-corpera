For some years, the EU has focused in its neighbourhood policy on economic liberalisation, hoping that this will have positive political side-effects.
The dynamism of economic reforms has long been undermined by authoritarian regimes by means of increased state repression.
Whether the European Neighbourhood Policy can really contribute to greater stability is questionable in view of the escalation of events in Libya.
In the Maghreb countries, it seems that the hopes of the Barcelona Process may be fulfilled in part, albeit with side-effects that the EU had not anticipated and for which it was not prepared - even though they are commonly associated with processes of transformation.
The Barcelona Process in itself is a good thing, and I also took this into consideration when voting.
