In warlike conflicts, it is often the women and children who are the real victims.
It has long been known that rape and torture are frequent occurrences.
The situation is no different in Libya and Egypt, according to reports from foreign journalists concerned.
In Egypt, female demonstrators were arrested and subjected to virginity tests, which were also documented.
In Libya, soldiers carried out rapes and torture.
A further aggravating factor is that the women who told their stories must now expect severe reprisals, such as being accused of defamation.
Once again, a severe abuse of human rights is taking place here about which something should be done, including by the Western powers.
I voted in favour of the resolution because the EU must not close its eyes to these atrocities either and it is only right to demand of the governments in Egypt and Libya that these cases are investigated without exception and the perpetrators held accountable, in order that the countries may continue along the path towards democracy and freedom.
