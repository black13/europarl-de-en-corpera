Mr President, I do not know how often Mr Verhofstadt is here.
I wanted to ask him whether he should not perhaps come more often, since he would then see that the sessions here are always very attractive.
It is just that unfortunately, there are some people who do not come, but that is something that can be changed.
The sessions are extremely attractive.
