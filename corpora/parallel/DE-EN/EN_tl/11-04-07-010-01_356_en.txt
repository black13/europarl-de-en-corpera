Mr President, as an artist, Ai Weiwei has given faces to the child victims of the Sichuan earthquake.
As a civil rights activist, he has given a face to Charter 08.
He is now giving a face to those people who have disappeared into the gaols and prisons of China - thousands of them anonymous.
A hundred of them are known to us and here in this House, we must give a voice to these people who stand up for human rights but who have been temporarily silenced.
I therefore say quite clearly that of course, these human rights debates and the dialogue are necessary.
I understand those who say they have no desire to keep talking to a brick wall.
If we stop talking to this brick wall, however, then the dictators will have got what they wanted.
There was a great reformer, Zhou Enlai.
Zhou Enlai was no democrat, but he was a Chinese patriot and he opened up his country.
What we need is a democratic Zhou Enlai to arrange for a democratic opening up of his country.
If the country fails to implement democratic reforms, it will end up in the same sort of crises as it suffered in the 1930s.
It is in the Chinese interest to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights and we must therefore support these initiatives as well.
