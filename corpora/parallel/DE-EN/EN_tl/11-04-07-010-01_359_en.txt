Mr President, I think that what the Chinese are doing here is a deliberate political provocation, or to put it another way, a political test.
It is intended to test the strength, the resolve and the credibility of democratic countries.
It is an attack on human rights.
It is true that there must be dialogue, but precisely for that reason we must make it clear to the People's Republic of China that further economic cooperation must go hand in hand with further democratisation of their country.
We therefore demand the release of Ai Weiwei.
By the way, whenever dictators want to avoid being accused of political trials, they always play the tax evasion or economic crimes card.
It was the case in the former GDR, it is the case in Russia, and unfortunately, it is also the case in the People's Republic of China.
That is why I emphatically endorse this resolution.
