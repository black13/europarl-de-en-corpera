Mr President, I would first like to agree with Mr Verhofstadt.
It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates, which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values, always take place on Thursday afternoons when most people have already left.
I would like that noted in the record once more.
It is something that we must change.
Right now, however, we are talking about China and there we are more or less powerless, as has already been said.
Mrs Lichtenberger spoke of a brick wall.
Mr Posselt, I do not believe by the way that it is really in the Chinese interest - as you said - to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights.
It is apparently not in the interest of the Chinese Government, although it is undoubtedly in the interest of the Chinese people.
We are talking today about many people: Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo have already been mentioned.
We have frequently debated in the past how we can bring about a human rights breakthrough.
It is not just a matter of instructing Baroness Ashton to speak out against the human rights abuses in China at every opportunity.
All our foreign ministers and representatives must do so, and we need to stick together.
I think that is the only way that we can actually have a small influence on China.
Otherwise, as a strong economic power, China will play us off against each other and we will achieve nothing whatsoever.
That would be a very bad thing, especially for the people concerned.
