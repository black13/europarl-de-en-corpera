Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, obviously it is not enough that the suppression of Tibetan culture within China has been increasing more and more since the 2008 Olympic Games.
Since then, things have, in fact, only got worse.
There has not been a single step forward.
Now pressure is also being exerted abroad to make it as difficult as possible, or downright impossible, for Tibetans to exercise even their right to vote for a parliament in exile.
We have seen for some years already how enormous pressure is being exerted on Nepal - whether this concerns accepting refugees or matters such as voting rights for Tibetans.
However, we should be pleased that such things are guaranteed.
The European Union should learn from this.
The Chinese leadership is exerting pressure on its sister party, even on Nepal as a whole, in order that action is taken against the Tibetans - and Nepal caves in.
We must concentrate our efforts to counter this, and that includes the withdrawal of any aid.
