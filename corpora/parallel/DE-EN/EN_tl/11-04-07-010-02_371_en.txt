Mr President, on 20 March, around 80 000 exiled Tibetans worldwide participated in the direct election of a new prime minister and the members of the government.
Members of the European Parliament, including members of the European Parliament Tibet Intergroup, attended as election observers.
My experience in Switzerland was the same as that of my fellow Members in other countries: the elections were conducted fairly, in secret and absolutely in accordance with democratic rules.
The only exception was in Nepal, where security forces - under pressure from the Chinese Government - prevented tens of thousands of Tibetans from taking part in the elections.
In so doing, they continued the deliberate measures taken last year, when ballot boxes were confiscated and voting sites shut down.
Yet Nepal is not a vassal state.
The government in Kathmandu must prove that it can liberate itself from Chinese influence.
Basic rights include freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and, not least, electoral freedom.
Commissioner, the European External Action Service must insist vigorously that these human rights are upheld.
