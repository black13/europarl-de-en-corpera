Mr President, back when I was a child, I received letters from what was then Rhodesia.
Three of my grandfather's sisters were Catholic nuns in the then Rhodesia and in South Africa.
They never wrote of the people of Rhodesia having to go hungry.
What we hear from this country today is simply intolerable.
Rhodesia, and later Zimbabwe, were the bread basket of southern Africa.
Mr Mugabe - a communist socialist dictator - has managed to turn this bread basket into a famine zone.
I would like to thank all the fellow Members who have put this matter back on the agenda.
It is intolerable that this dictator, Mr Mugabe, has been allowed to terrorise the people of Zimbabwe for so long.
I believe that the key to ending this lies in southern Africa.
I regret to say that for as long as South Africa fails to put this dictator in his place, he will continue to terrorise his people.
