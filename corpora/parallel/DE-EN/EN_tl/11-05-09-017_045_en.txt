(The speaker directs a blue card question to Mr Cadec under Rule 149 of the Rules of Procedure) Mr President, I have a question for Mr Cadec regarding his opening remarks, namely, with regard to the supposed single seat of the European Parliament.
Mr Cadec, you might perhaps have noticed that Parliament sometimes meets in Brussels too, that committees have their meetings in Brussels, or that administration is, to a certain extent, carried out in Luxembourg.
I merely wanted to make you aware of the fact that this situation is perhaps not quite as you imagine it to be.
