Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many companies in the European Union, the continual rise in fuel prices represents an additional burden.
European fishermen in particular are suffering as a result of this price rise because they cannot simply compensate for the additional costs by increasing their catch or by charging better prices.
The current political situation in North Africa and the Middle East has exacerbated the problem.
We therefore need to investigate the effects of the rise in fuel prices on the economy and employment in the EU.
Which sectors are particularly at risk and what sort of support could be provided without it distorting competition?
We therefore call on the Commission to look into this.
It is important that we support the European fishing industry, among other things, in order not to increase our dependence on imports from third countries.
We are on the verge of reforming the common fisheries policy and therefore, we are under a particular obligation to be cautious and not to act prematurely with regard to this matter either.
