Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European fisheries are in a state of deep crisis, as my fellow Members have said.
Fishermen in all European seas complain about the painful drop in income, which may be severe enough to threaten their existence.
Yet, why is the income of our fishermen decreasing?
As far as I can see, there are three reasons for this.
Firstly, there is the decline in fish stocks; secondly, the general fall in prices in precisely the area where fish stocks are healthy and supply is too high; and thirdly - and this is what we are concerned about today - operating costs are higher as a result of rising crude oil prices.
We politicians need to step in here.
We must do what we can to help.
I would stress that we can only do what we can.
The motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) promises more than we can deliver.
It demands an increase of 100% in the de minimis aid ceiling from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000, which is to be used to fund fuel subsidies.
However, fuel subsidies are something that many Member States really cannot afford.
Therefore, most fishermen would not be helped by this at all.
Moreover, the other two problems would still remain: firstly, overfishing would actually increase and, secondly, it would not solve the problem of market prices.
Where financial support for fisheries is concerned, I can see a much greater problem.
The Member States do not use the resources of the European Fisheries Fund, although the European Union pays 50%.
Something urgently needs to change in this regard in the interests of our fishermen.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us work together to produce a differentiated text by Thursday and jointly come up with a sensible, sustainable and less showy fisheries policy.
