Madam President, Europe will only be able to defend its leading role as the largest economic area in the world if it takes the lead in the development and use of new technologies.
Broadband technology is undoubtedly an important part of this.
Our new radio spectrum policy must ensure large transmission capacities and high transmission speeds.
Overarching frequency planning and management at European level is, without doubt, less appropriate for achieving this goal, as the Commission itself also stresses that this can be carried out well and efficiently in the individual Member States.
A coordinating role would certainly be desirable, however.
Despite the high costs, the provision of optical fibre networks should, in my opinion, be encouraged.
The European Union is currently lagging behind its competitors, the United States and China.
That is probably a consequence of irresolute policy and too much bureaucracy.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur, Mr HÃ¶kmark, that we absolutely must stick to the timetable that has been set for freeing up the spectrum.
