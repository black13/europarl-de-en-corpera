Mr President, in north-west Pakistan, what had not already been destroyed in some regions by war and terrorism was swept away by the floods in 2010.
In addition to the commitment of EUR 415 million in emergency aid, the EU now wants to lift duties on a number of products.
Pakistan will now soon attain the long-wished for status of a developing country with special tariff preferences.
However, the EU should not be under any illusions that granting trade preferences could put an end to the advance of fundamental Islamists and terrorists in the nuclear state of Pakistan.
The United States has failed to do this despite billions being provided in military aid.
The West has therefore paid dearly for the loyalty of a small and, moreover, diminishing part of the political leadership in Pakistan.
The elimination of Bin Laden by the United States has also raised a number of difficult questions.
Even if Pakistan was aware of the whereabouts of the al-Qaeda leader, who was the subject of an international arrest warrant, and therefore would have been called on to extradite him, it does not change the fact that the targeted killing was a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty.
The West must not throw its own principles, such as the rule of law, overboard.
Terrorists, dictators and mass murderers must be brought before a court and not eliminated by means of targeted killings.
