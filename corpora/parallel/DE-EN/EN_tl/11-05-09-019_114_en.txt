Mr President, Commissioner, we all firmly believe that we must help the people in Pakistan, but the instrument that you are proposing, Commissioner, is the wrong one, for three reasons.
The first is that there is absolutely no proof that trade facilitation will benefit the people affected by the floods.
On the contrary, we can even see that the textile industry in Pakistan is based in other regions and, in recent years, has even experienced growth.
Thus, this sector is not really affected at all.
How we intend to help the people affected by the floods by means of trade facilitation is beyond me.
Secondly, I cannot understand how we can now grant these facilitations to a country that plainly does not meet the GSP+ conditions in terms of social and environmental standards and send a signal to other countries, like Bangladesh, which do meet these conditions, that essentially tells them that their efforts are not wanted and it is also possible to achieve this status by other means.
My third argument, Commissioner, is that this is not an approach based on solidarity, because the burden in Europe is borne in a one-sided manner by certain sectors and certain countries only.
If we want to do something, then we should do so in a spirit of solidarity with all countries and with the involvement of everyone, and that means we need direct aid for the flood victims.
That would be the right approach to take.
