Madam President, Commissioner, I really do think it is important that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we decide on the structure of the negotiations together, because this Treaty gives Parliament a new role in trade relations.
If we once again consider the fact that India is clearly a market of the future, we must also feed this back into a clear position adopted by Parliament: In our view, industrial development in the European Union - linked to jobs - is of key importance.
We therefore need to make it clear that the interests of jobs in industry in Europe must take priority in the trade agreements.
For that reason, although an agreement has to be asymmetrical, at the end of the day, the tariffs must be zero.
It is not acceptable for us to have tariffs of 100% in mechanical engineering and the automotive sector and, in the end, perhaps negotiate 50%.
As long as we do not have any zero tariffs, it will encourage investments outside Europe.
Therefore, Commissioner, we need to clearly define our priority areas and they lie in industry.
We also need a level playing field to be established with regard to social standards, and it is also necessary for clear obligations to be imposed on India in relation to workers' rights.
