Madam President, Commissioner, there are so many issues involved in this agreement that you have to concentrate somewhat in order to pick out the most important ones.
In my opinion, there are two things that are immensely important, both of which could be subsumed under the heading of 'fairness'.
The first is fairness for our producers and for our industry.
That has been mentioned several times already.
We must not allow certain restrictions, which may perhaps make sense at the start, to remain in place permanently.
Right at the start of this agreement, we must establish how long something should apply and under what circumstances regulations will subsequently be discontinued.
After all, India will obviously continue to develop and we need to take account of that.
In this regard, I share the views expressed by my fellow Members.
It is also a question of fairness for the people, both in the European Union and also in India.
That is also extremely important.
An agreement such as this must also contain elements that do not necessarily relate only to trade - these have also been mentioned already: sustainability, human rights, social, environmental and labour standards - these things are also unbelievably important.
Above all, these aspects must be laid down in such a way that there are consequences if they are not complied with.
I do not at all mean this to sound schoolmasterish towards our Indian friends.
When it comes to human rights, I can imagine that India has better law relating to the press, for example, than some Member States of the European Union.
In other words, we need to view from the opposite side, too.
However, these requirements must be binding for both sides, they must be met and, if they are not met, it must have consequences for both sides on account of social dumping.
