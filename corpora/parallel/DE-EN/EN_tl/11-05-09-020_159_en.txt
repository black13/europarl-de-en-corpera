Madam President, in this connection, I would like to point out that I understand what you are saying very well and that you do a splendid job as President.
However, your predecessor did not act fairly in allowing many Members to overrun by half a minute or 20 seconds - the Commissioner also spoke for seven minutes and 36 seconds instead of three minutes.
It is surely not fair to keep to the time now when the speaking time is only one minute anyway.
However, I understand what you are saying and I thank you for your understanding.
