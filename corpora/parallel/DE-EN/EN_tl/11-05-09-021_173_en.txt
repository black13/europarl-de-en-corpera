Madam President, Commissioner, just one topic should be the focus of attention when the summit is held between the European Union and Japan at the end of this month: the disaster that has devastated the people of Japan as a result of earthquakes, the tsunami and continuing radioactive contamination, and the concrete role that can be played by the EU, its Member States and individual citizens in helping to deal with the resulting problems in the short, medium and long term.
That is why I once again wish to express my deepest sympathies to the Japanese people.
We must immediately extend offers of partnership and help in dealing with this disaster - particularly in view of the debate we have just held on Pakistan.
The summit must produce concrete decisions, particularly in relation to cooperation in clearing contaminated areas and joint research and development in the area of renewable energy.
The possible development of our trade relations and economic cooperation through a corresponding agreement should not be simply a response to the nuclear accident.
For this reason, negotiations should not begin too hastily, but should be examined with due care, paying particular attention to the different traditions and lifestyle.
In view of the size and strength of the two economies, particular care is required when agreeing a comprehensive, bilateral trade agreement.
Many issues have been raised, including intellectual property rights and public procurement, and the investment capital has reduced the scope for political action on both sides.
That is why long-term impact assessments are required in relation to the relevant chapters and aspects of any economic and trade policy cooperation agreed in the future between the 27 EU Member States and Japan.
For this reason, the European Parliament, as a codecision-making authority, as well as the public at large, must also be consulted.
