Madam President, in 2009 between them, the EU and Japan produced more than one quarter of the world's economic output and accounted for over 20% of world trade, which is why a well-conceived free trade agreement with Japan is of central importance for the EU.
There are synergy effects that can be exploited, as well as shared challenges, such as competition with China and secure access to raw materials.
However, bilateral safeguard clauses are also important in this agreement.
I am thinking of sensitive economic sectors such as the automotive, electronics, aerospace and mechanical engineering industries.
I am certain that Japan can and will be a fair and reliable partner.
The bottom line is that however important Japan may be as a trading partner, European citizens must be protected from any risk from radioactive contaminated products.
