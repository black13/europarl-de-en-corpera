Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, this may seem an unusual way to open a speech in the European Parliament, but I must admit that I am not sure that this is the right time to conclude a trade agreement with Japan - or indeed whether such an agreement is advisable at all.
There are three reasons for my uncertainty.
The first question is whether we are actually undermining our attempt to establish a multilateral agreement by agreeing a large number of external trade agreements with highly significant trading partners.
Are we not in danger of concentrating too much on concluding individual agreements, which may prevent us from pursuing a multilateral system with appropriate and sufficient vigour?
Secondly, so far, I have not got the feeling that Japan is really meeting us half way in terms of market protectionism and non-tariff trade barriers.
The wheels should already have been set in motion, otherwise the entire agreement is in danger of being too one-sided.
My third question is: what are the consequences?
I do not intend to judge whether this is good or bad for us in the final analysis.
However, I would like to know in advance how the social consequences are to be assessed, and how things look in terms of the environment or labour market.
These are issues that I do not believe have been entirely clarified.
Surely these questions should have been better assessed and researched in advance.
As some of my fellow Members have pointed out, if these points were to be clarified, the Commission would be well advised to consult the European Parliament when issuing a mandate.
This would avoid many of the difficulties encountered with other trade agreements because we were not consulted.
I would welcome such a procedure for all future trade agreements.
