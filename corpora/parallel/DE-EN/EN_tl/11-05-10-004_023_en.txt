rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has expressed a very positive opinion to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
We were very pleased with how the funds had been implemented by the Commission services.
We have no criticisms to make, either as regards the way in which the funds were spent or as regards the level of expenditure.
On the contrary, we have nothing but praise for the prompt and positive use of the funds in the LIFE programme.
The Commission has succeeded in spending the additional funding that we granted and in doing so usefully.
The agencies in our area - the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Chemicals Agency (ECA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - have also managed their money responsibly.
In contrast to the competent committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises the European Medicines Agency in its report and even wishes to refuse discharge for this agency.
I think that is going too far, to put it politely.
If I were being less polite I might say that the Committee on Budgetary Control is interfering in matters outside its sphere of competence.
It should please stop doing so.
I can only ask Parliament and plenary to improve matters in this respect.
