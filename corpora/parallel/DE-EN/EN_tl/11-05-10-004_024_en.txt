rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - Madam President, unlike the previous committee, the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not able to express a purely positive opinion.
We nonetheless welcomed the fact that substantial resources were provided for the trans-European transport networks and that in 2009 the Galileo programme finally had a very good year, which was regrettably not the case in previous years.
We were also able to state that the coordinators are doing a good job in the case of the trans-European networks, because they are also making a great contribution to the overall financing of these major projects.
As we see it, there is room for improvement in other areas that this Parliament considers important - such as road safety.
In this area only 73% of the funds have been committed.
In our opinion, this programme in particular could do more work and better work with less funding.
Finally, I would like to mention that we would like to see greater coordination between transport and cohesion policy.
We cannot have priorities being specified in one committee and these then being ignored in other committees.
Such coordination is, however, taking place at the moment in the reviews that we are carrying out.
We hope that we will be able to report better news on this for 2010.
