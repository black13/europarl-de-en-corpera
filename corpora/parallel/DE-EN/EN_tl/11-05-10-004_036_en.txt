Madam President, perhaps you would allow me briefly to make a very general appeal to my fellow Members with regard to the discharge procedure.
Budgetary control - and thus also the discharge procedure - is undoubtedly an essential element of parliamentary work, but in my opinion this discharge procedure has no teeth whatsoever.
Even if discharge is refused, there is no real possibility of binding sanctions; the only thing that can be done is for the president of the European Parliament to bring Treaty infringement proceedings at the European Court of Justice.
In the event that discharge were to be refused for the European Parliament, we would end up with the absurd situation of the presidency of Parliament initiating infringement proceedings against itself.
There can be no doubt that reform is needed here.
Moreover, the fact that the legal basis of the discharge process was geared mainly towards the Commission yet we tend to grant discharge reciprocally with other institutions creates a certain amount of legal uncertainty that we should be preventing.
What remains in practice are other political levers that we can use.
That is not sufficient for this discharge procedure.
I, along with my fellow Members, would therefore like us to work towards reforming the discharge process.
