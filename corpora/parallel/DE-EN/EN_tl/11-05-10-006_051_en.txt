Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European agencies are permanently in the crossfire of criticism.
Yet on the other hand, we rely on them when problems arise almost overnight; for example, if increased FRONTEX personnel are required in the Mediterranean or if dioxin is found in animal feed.
For this reason I would ask all my fellow Members to apply a sense of proportion and political foresight to these discharges.
We need to evaluate the operational efficiency of the agencies objectively if we are to get away from opinions and assumptions and get a clear overview of what the agencies are actually achieving.
I have been working to achieve this for some time.
