Mr President, honourable members of the Council and Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment on the agencies that I dealt with as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
First, however, let me say one thing about the permanent debate on Strasbourg versus Brussels.
I am a definite advocate of Strasbourg and I believe that if there is any doubt then we should move the entire parliament to Strasbourg, not to Brussels.
Strasbourg is a symbol of European unity that must not be abandoned.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety we looked at six agencies that have achieved outstanding results in terms of the intensity and quality of their work.
The error rate has reduced noticeably.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity to praise the staff of these agencies.
A total of 104 new jobs were created at the European Chemicals Agency, which mainly supervises our REACH projects.
In the case of the European Food Safety Authority, or EFSA, it should be noted that we need to achieve more precise monitoring and greater transparency.
In the case of the European Centre for Disease Control, or ECDC, we found that the funds had not been fully utilised.
Not all its tasks have yet been discharged.
The European Environment Agency reliably provides data and figures that are very important for our work, for the way we shape the future.
However, I would like us to establish more precisely what overall cost savings the Union will achieve as a result of environmental improvements and to present these figures.
The European Medicines Agency is still clearly having difficulty getting things off the ground, despite having been in existence for some years now.
We found some accounting errors and inadequate coordination between financial services and scientific services here.
Overall, however, I consider the work of the agencies to be very positive.
