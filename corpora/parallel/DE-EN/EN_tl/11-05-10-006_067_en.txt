Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner once again on behalf of Parliament for his excellent cooperation.
You have now raised certain points once again.
We should take these as a starting point for our continued work.
However, I would also ask you to pass on our thanks to your colleagues, because we had a very intense exchange with many individuals - I should particularly like to mention Mr Ciolo≈ü and Mr Hahn - and both were very cooperative.
Please would you pass this message on to them once again.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Becsey, for his clear words.
He spoke very clearly; we may not like what he said, but at least he was clear in what he said and we are grateful for that.
I consider it only right that you are here.
I do not think there is particular cause to mention it.
Nonetheless, it is good that you are here.
I have saved my final thanks for the President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, with whom Parliament always enjoys genuinely open and positive cooperation.
We very much appreciate that.
Our work would not be possible without your background work.
Our discharge is based mainly on your contributions.
We would like to see you playing a greater role in the future assessment of the performance audit, Mr Caldeira.
The future of the European Union depends not just on the funds being spent legally and correctly, but also and above all on their being spent usefully; in other words, effectively and efficiently.
That will form part of the performance audit under Article 318 of the Treaty of Lisbon.
As Parliament, we would like to see an annual debate on the performance audit of the Commission and we would like you to be invited here to debate it with us as a representative of the European Court of Auditors.
My sincere thanks to my fellow Members and to everyone involved.
