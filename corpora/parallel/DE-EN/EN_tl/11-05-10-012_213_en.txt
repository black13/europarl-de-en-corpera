The European Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for 2009 are legal and regular, and the revision of a multiannual work programme carried out in 2010 as well as the start of an initiative to review its budget procedure convince me that the Community Fisheries Control Agency is implementing the recommendations it has received.
In terms of what it is doing, the Agency - which was established in 2005 - is performing important - even essential - work, after the failure to achieve any of the aims agreed in 2002 and the fact that the common fisheries policy is considered to have been a failure to date.
The Agency will be indispensable in the immediate future in view of the appalling fact that 88% of fish stocks in the EU are being overfished.
