in writing. - I voted in favour of the discharge in view of the fact that the European Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts presented for 2009 were legal and regular.
The European Environment Agency has performed important work in recent years in providing independent, reliable information and data in the area of the environment, which is a major concern of a large proportion of Europe's citizens, as evidenced by the annual reports of the Committee on Petitions.
I also welcome the report's request that the European Court of Auditors undertake performance audits on the Agency.
