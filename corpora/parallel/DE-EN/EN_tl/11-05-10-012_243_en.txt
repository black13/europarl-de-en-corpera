in writing. - In the case of the European Food Safety Authority I have not gone along with the rapporteur's recommendation to grant discharge 'on the basis of the data available'; the obvious deficiencies in budget management are simply too serious.
The Internal Audit Service (IAS) has made 48 recommendations on grant management, 27 of which even fall into the 'critical' category.
In addition, there are concerns regarding possible conflicts of interest and lack of transparency.
