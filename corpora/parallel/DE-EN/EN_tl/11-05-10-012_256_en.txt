in writing. - The funding of the European Maritime Safety Agency was also cut in 2009, by 3.8%.
The Agency's tasks, which include environmental disasters at sea, are of particular importance in view of the state of EU waters.
I voted in favour of discharge since the deficiencies listed mainly concerned procurement and staff selection procedures, while the European Court of Auditors gave a positive verdict on the annual accounts for 2009.
However, these deficiencies must be remedied in 2010 and the 'very important' Internal Audit Service (IAS) recommendations must all be implemented if discharge is to be warranted in 2010.
