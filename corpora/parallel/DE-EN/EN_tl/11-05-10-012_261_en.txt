The deficiencies listed by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) are too numerous and too serious.
To name but one: after a re-examination of procurement by the European Network and Information Security Agency more weaknesses were found in this area.
The 18 recommendations by the IAS to improve the Agency's services must be implemented comprehensively and without delay.
Since the Agency has refused a full five of the 18 recommendations, however, it seems that even the will required for this is lacking.
