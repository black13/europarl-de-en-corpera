in writing. - I abstained from voting on the discharge of the Euratom Supply Agency, which has the task of ensuring the European Union is provided with fissile materials (including any stores).
According to this report, there are currently inconsistencies as regards the present organisation of the Agency and its legal form.
This raises the issue of whether the Agency needs to be maintained in its current form and with its current organisation.
I would have liked to have seen this matter clarified, particularly in view of the current Europe-wide rethink on nuclear power.
