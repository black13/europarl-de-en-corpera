in writing. - I abstained from voting on this discharge.
The report lists a series of deficiencies, but at the same time it refers to assurances by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions that it will effectively remedy these.
While this is to be welcomed, in view of the quality of the deficiencies (shortcomings in recruitment procedures were found as far back as 2006, the provisional accounts submitted to the European Court of Auditors contained serious errors resulting from weaknesses in the financial organisation) it is not possible to vote in favour of discharge.
Qualified personnel should subject the Foundation in Dublin to a detailed audit, and we should vote on discharge only after the necessary changes resulting from this have been made.
