I voted against the waiver of Bruno Gollnisch's immunity because the explanatory statement given by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which recommended the waiver to plenary, was entirely arbitrary.
If Mr Gollnisch is charged over a press release written by the political office of the Front National, then of course this activity should be seen as falling within the scope of his EU mandate.
The argument that this took place as part of his activities as a regional councillor is not decisive because the EU mandate cannot be seen as a part-time occupation or similar.
Had Mr Gollnisch made the same statement in a part-session of the European Parliament or in one of his committees, would the same argument be being made?
The content of the press release serving as a basis for extradition is moreover 100% covered by freedom of expression.
If politically unpopular statements are now to form a basis for extraditions then it shows once again what the European Parliament thinks of real democracy.
