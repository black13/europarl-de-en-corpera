in writing. - I voted in favour of the report because millions of citizens of the European Internal Market need effective legal means of asserting their claims against other citizens or against enterprises.
People who exercise their right to live, work and travel within the EU should not in future be allowed to fall victim to unscrupulous profiteers and other debtors who evade their responsibilities simply by moving their assets to another country.
In such cases creditors are often refused enforcement of the judgment in the Internal Market, as a result of which citizens or small enterprises lose money and time because they are referred to courts of other Member States once court proceedings have already been initiated.
Moreover, to guarantee effective enforcement the courts must be able to order the disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets within the context of measures to provide interim legal protection.
The current legal provisions in the European Union, which allow the reciprocal recognition of national court rulings and cross-border claims, are not sufficient.
Citizens and enterprises also need to have the right to have such rulings enforced effectively.
This report signifies an important step against swindlers and in favour of the citizens and enterprises of the European Internal Market.
