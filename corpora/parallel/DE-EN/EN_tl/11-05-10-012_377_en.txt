in writing. - I have neither granted nor refused discharge for the Commission.
The reason for this is that, on the one hand, the European Court of Auditors was once again unable to issue a positive statement for the Commission in 2009; on the other, the report makes it sufficiently clear that this is mainly due to the inadequate cooperation of the Member States as recipients of funding.
Granting discharge to a deficient system does nothing to help this situation.
Controls must be ensured before funds are handed out.
