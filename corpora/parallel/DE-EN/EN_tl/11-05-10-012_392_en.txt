in writing. - As regards paragraph 129 of the report on the '2009 discharge: EU general budget - European Parliament', which concerns the 'voluntary pension fund', I wish to state that I am categorically voting against this because it involves using taxpayers' money to finance pension funds for Members of the European Parliament (paragraph 129(i)).
There is no reason not to raise the retirement age for the Scheme from 60 to 63 (paragraph 129(ii)).
It is a good thing for the managers of the Fund to be called upon to adopt a more prudent and balanced investment strategy (paragraph 129(iii)).
As a matter of principle I am in favour of phasing out the present pension scheme.
