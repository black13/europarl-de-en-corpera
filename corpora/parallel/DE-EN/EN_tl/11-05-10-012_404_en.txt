in writing. - I voted in favour of postponing the decision on the Council discharge for 2009.
In the light of the new situation created by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon the continuing refusal of the Council to be subjected to a discharge procedure - thereby taking accountability into account - is unacceptable.
The Council's expenditure needs to be monitored just as much as that of the other Union bodies if due account is to be taken of the European Transparency Initiative.
