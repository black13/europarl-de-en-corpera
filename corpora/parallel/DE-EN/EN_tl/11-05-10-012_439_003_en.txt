in writing. - The European Union is known throughout the world for providing assistance where assistance is needed.
The EU proved this once again by rapidly making aid payments following the dramatic floods and their repercussions in Pakistan in 2010.
As a next step, the Commission intended giving Pakistan a lift economically and guaranteeing that duties will be suspended on textiles and ethanol.
This approach seems to be highly controversial.
The fact is, however, that this initiative first has to be given the green light at World Trade Organisation (WTO) level.
Only then should Parliament become active and make a decision.
