in addition to promising over EUR 415 million in immediate aid, the EU is also responding to the flood disaster in Pakistan by means of exceptional trade measures to boost Pakistan's exports.
The European Commission proposed a package of 75 tariff lines relating to Pakistan's main export sectors in the areas worst affected by the floods.
Pakistan's trade with the Union consists mainly of textiles and clothing products, which according to information from the Commission accounted for 73.7% of Pakistani exports to the Union in 2009.
In the EU's assessment, granting these trade preferences should only cause limited adverse effects on the Internal Market and should not affect negatively the least developed members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Notwithstanding this, it must be expected that the unilateral suspension of duties will lead to infringement proceedings at the WTO.
If Pakistan is allowed to join the ranks of those countries that enjoy preferential tariff rates - in other words, if it is to be included in the so-called 'GSP+' list - then the matter could be said to have resolved itself.
Uncoordinated hasty reactions are hardly helpful.
The textile and clothing industry in particular is in a time of crisis in a number of Member States as a result of transformation.
Negative effects of the trade preferences cannot therefore be ruled out, which is why I rejected the report.
