in writing. - Nobody is disputing that developing countries - such as Pakistan, which has been repeatedly devastated by floods - must be supported.
Nonetheless, the EU must ensure that its partner countries in such trade agreements also meet certain requirements, particularly if duties are to be suspended.
We cannot allow such suspension of duties to damage our domestic textiles industry - with the EU having not the slightest concern over whether these products are produced using child labour or whether the funds received go directly towards supporting terrorism.
Wide-ranging duty exemptions must therefore be linked to an absolute obligation to respect human rights.
I am thinking, for example, of Christian minorities and women's rights.
The blasphemy law in that country is particularly worrying: anyone who insults Mohammed is sentenced to death.
Fundamentalism is widespread in Pakistan across all levels of society - all the more so since the death of Osama Bin Laden - including among the students at the famous International Islamic University.
The argument that the trade preferences promote prosperity and combat radicalism therefore does not hold water.
The EU must not simply grant trade preferences where this ignores important matters of basic law.
I therefore voted against the report.
