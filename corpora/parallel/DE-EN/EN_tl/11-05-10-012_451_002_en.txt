in writing. - Since the Treaty of Lisbon the Commission has had the exclusive power to negotiate and conclude bilateral investment agreements with third countries.
There are more than 1 000 agreements in existence and negotiations led by Member States are currently under way for around 200 more.
In order that this transfer of competence does not result in a hard landing for the EU, the Member States should continue to be able to guarantee legal certainty for investors during a transitional period.
Parliament sent a strong signal in the first reading and advocates a solid, secure phase for the transfer of powers.
