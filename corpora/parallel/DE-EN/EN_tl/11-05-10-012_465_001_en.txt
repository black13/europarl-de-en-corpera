in writing. - Supporting macro-financial assistance for Georgia, which was hit hard by the economic crisis, is something to be endorsed.
The money promised by the EU is linked to clear conditions and will reach the right areas.
This financial assistance, together with the funding from the IMF, will help stabilise the national budget and will have a positive effect on relations between the EU and Georgia.
