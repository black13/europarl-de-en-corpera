Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to get to the point here.
We do not need a new rule on the temporary or any other reintroduction of border controls, either now or in the future.
We need to grasp that freedom of movement - and that is, after all, the message of the European Union - is something that you cannot simply displace or circumvent at will.
It is a citizens' right that you cannot simply relativise.
Do you want to know what honestly annoys me?
We hear a lot said about solidarity.
Who is talking about solidarity with the countries of Africa who are currently having to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees and will continue to do so - without great debate?
Is anyone talking about solidarity with the people who are fleeing war and coming here to Europe?
We need to show these people a bit of respect.
To be frank, I do not want to discuss any changes to Schengen or any rules whatsoever; I simply want us to deal sensibly with migration once and for all.
We will not achieve this by using Frontex as a means of deporting people; we will achieve it by having a democratic and humanitarian asylum law.
That is what we should be talking about in Europe and it must apply throughout Europe.
That is what we should fight for.
That is our real task.
