Madam President, the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe.
On the one hand, borders are being torn down, while on the other you are trying to build barriers yet again.
I find it impossible to accept that two Member States and two gentlemen looking to make a name for themselves have managed to bring the issue of the reintroduction of border controls back to the debating chamber.
There is no going back on this matter and we cannot allow ourselves to be put under pressure by this single-issue discussion.
The refugee problem cannot be automatically resolved by returning to a regime of border controls.
Pardon me.
These people have risked their lives in making their way to Europe and they will also succeed in bypassing border crossings.
The only ones who stand to gain from the reintroduction of border controls would be the human traffickers because the refugees would have to find new ways to cross the borders, providing the human traffickers with a new source of income.
I cannot accept the fact that we are seriously contemplating this matter and I would call on the Commission not to compromise here.
