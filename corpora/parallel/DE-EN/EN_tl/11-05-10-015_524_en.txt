Madam President, apparently only about 3 000 of the Tunisian refugees apprehended in Lampedusa are genuine asylum-seekers, while 20 000 or more are economic migrants.
As long as the European Union refuses to admit that it cannot accommodate all economic migrants from every conceivable quarter, hundreds of thousands more will make their way here.
If steps are taken such as mass amnesties for illegal immigrants or if the Schengen Agreement is violated through the use of tourist visas, as was recently the case, then this will inevitably result in many thousands more refugees.
This puts the entire Schengen system at risk.
Greece, Italy and Malta are obviously not in a position to secure their external borders and newcomers to the Schengen Group often relax their efforts after accession.
The EU's external borders are riddled with more holes than a Swiss cheese and are also being undermined internally.
Temporary controls are not enough.
The EU must develop Frontex into a genuine border protection agency.
If none of these measures produce results, then inevitably one or other country will come up with the idea of withdrawing from the Schengen Agreement.
