Madam President, open borders are an important symbol for Europe.
I would like to draw your attention to another problem.
I come from Northern Germany, which is why the German-Danish border is of particular importance for me.
The right-wing populist Danish People's Party is trying to force the Danish Government to reintroduce border controls.
What is the reason for this?
It is a fear of people from Romania and Bulgaria.
This is scandalous.
The right-wing populists are rapidly growing in numbers and represent a real danger for Europe.
Of course we must have protections against untrammelled criminality and our security authorities have already found effective alternatives to passport controls.
It makes me very sad that one of our major European achievements is to be put at risk.
The EU success in promoting peace and freedom is without historical parallel but is now under high-level attack.
I would call on the Danish Government not to allow itself to be dictated to by the right-wing populists.
