Madam President, Mr Schulz has left us, but I am pleased that he and Mrs Rodust have made it clear that it was not Social Democrat policy that border controls should be reintroduced.
However, two years ago, during the election campaign for the European Parliament, the key demand of the Danish Social Democrats was that the borders should be closed again.
I am not talking about the right-wing populists.
Mr JÃ¸rgensen and party leader Mrs Thorning-Schmidt both argued for this.
You are absolutely right, this is populism.
An important question for the Commission is therefore as follows: Can a country reintroduce border controls and still remain in the Schengen Union with access to the information system, etc., or is this an either-or situation?
The question is important for the Danish debate, which is why I ask that a clear answer be given.
