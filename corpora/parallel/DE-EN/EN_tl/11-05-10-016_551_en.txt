on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved in this process because tomorrow, after the vote, a long period of hard work will finally come to a conclusion.
This is a good day for Europe, for the European Parliament as an institution, and for the Commission because we have succeeded in getting a common transparency register off the ground.
This an important step along the way, but more work needs to be done.
I would like to address two points.
The first is that the register is not really mandatory.
This needs to be stated openly at this point.
I have a question for the Commissioner in this regard: the Commission has always claimed that the appropriate legal framework for this does not exist.
Is the Commission ready to establish such a legal framework, so that we will have a mandatory register after the revision?
I was very pleased by the statement from the Council indicating that it does not foresee any difficulty in joining our register, as Mr Weber has just pointed out.
I am hopeful that the Council will follow through on this, because the register will really only be complete if all three institutions of the European Union have a common register and if this register is also mandatory.
As a group, we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register; we intend supporting this amendment.
As far as the various national lobby groups are concerned, it has been clearly stated that these will not be included in the register.
I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their willingness to compromise on this matter.
It really would have been a black mark for such an agreement if national lobby groups were treated in the same way as industry lobbyists or other professional associations.
