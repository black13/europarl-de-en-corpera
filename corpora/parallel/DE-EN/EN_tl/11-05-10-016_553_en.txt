Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Duff for bringing up the issue of the legislative footprint.
Do you believe that a legislative footprint, the extent of which still has to be defined, might also restrict the work of the European Parliament?
Also: how far-reaching do you expect the impact of the legislative footprint to be?
