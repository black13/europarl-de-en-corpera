Mr President, we are all aware that not just the European Parliament, but also the European Union as a whole is suffering from a huge credibility problem.
I am sure this is something Mr HÃ¤fner will not want to hear, however, although Parliament has finally reached agreement on this transparency register, no doubt bowing to pressure because of the recent lobbying scandal, in my opinion, this register will lack teeth.
I believe that a voluntary register is simply a sham and will not offer greater transparency or bring us to a point where the Council of Ministers will be prepared to get involved, so we do not even have all the key legislative bodies on board.
Even if the Council were to come on board, a whole host of loopholes would still exist.
Apparently there are hundreds of expert groups who work on the official papers published by the Commission, however the identity of the members of these advisory bodies that meet behind closed doors remains a closely-guarded secret.
In my opinion, we need a record not only of all work undertaken for business or for international concerns, but also all paid lobbying for interest groups such as professional organisations and trade unions.
Our citizens have a right to expect genuine transparency here, too.
