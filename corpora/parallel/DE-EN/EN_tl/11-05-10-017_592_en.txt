on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is always good to take stock of activities, which is why I am grateful to the Commission for having explained so clearly everything that Europe has done since the disaster, both immediately, in the medium to long term, and right up to the present.
Irrespective of how we view the problem, it is worthwhile pointing out that these damage limitation measures could never have taken place on this scale without the involvement of the European Union.
I also find it very helpful to know that the Commission did not just provide immediate direct aid, but on behalf of Europe as a whole has also dealt intensively with the question of what conclusions are to be drawn from the disaster in terms of civil protection measures, information exchange systems, as well as research and related studies.
I am not entirely convinced that it is absolutely necessary to come up with new studies.
It may be that we need to evaluate the material already available to us to see whether it is sufficient for our needs.
I believe that this will become clear during the course of a differentiated debate.
Sometimes having access to a huge amount of information is no guarantee that meaningful progress will be made.
I would like to express my thanks and to say that the Commission and Europe as a whole can be pleased with what they have achieved in this case.
They have demonstrated that these institutions are not just a talking shop, but also a source of practical aid.
