Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Leinen.
He referred to stress tests.
What I would like to know is: the stress tests must have a consequence.
Do you think it would be possible to establish a permanent European regulator for this area who would be responsible for dealing with these issues and who would have the power to remove dangerous nuclear power stations from the grid?
