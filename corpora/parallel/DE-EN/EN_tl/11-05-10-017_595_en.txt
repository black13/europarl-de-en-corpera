Mr President, I would like to thank Mr RÃ¼big for his question.
The aim must be to establish a European competence for monitoring nuclear power stations.
If an issue has an impact that goes beyond national borders, then this involves a European dimension, which also requires a European competence.
Mr Oettinger, we do not yet have this competence, however you must do all you can to ensure that we are given the basis to monitor nuclear plants independently and objectively from a European perspective, enabling us to draw our own conclusions when weaknesses are pinpointed.
If the stress test shows that a power plant is unsafe, then it must be shut down or, if possible, upgraded.
