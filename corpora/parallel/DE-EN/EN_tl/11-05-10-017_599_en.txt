on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, following the disaster of Chernobyl 25 years ago, new investigations by the Society for Radiation Protection show that to date 1.4 million people have died from the long-term consequences of the nuclear meltdown.
Even in Germany we feared for the safety of our children, as they were exposed to radioactive rain clouds and contaminated foodstuffs.
The EU must now take the right steps in responding to the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters.
The fears that the promised stress tests for all nuclear power plants would simply provide an excuse for the continued operation of reactors have unfortunately proven to be well-founded in the light of the stress criteria announced.
Other nuclear facilities will not be examined.
Any threats that could cost the nuclear industry too dearly, such as human error or plane crashes, are simply ignored, despite the fact that these are key when assessing the safety of the population.
We are calling for extensive, binding stress tests carried out by independent experts.
However this can only be the first step on the way to a Europe-wide nuclear exit scenario.
