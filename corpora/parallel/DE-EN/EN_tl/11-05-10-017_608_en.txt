Mr President, Mr Oettinger, like Fukushima, Chernobyl showed that, despite all the rules we may set down, the residual risk from human error needs to be measured and that, in this context, we must identify more clearly where the limits of nuclear energy lie, because obviously even the strictest regulations cannot eliminate this residual risk as a result of human error.
My second point relates to the lack of available information because of the Soviet system that existed at the time.
This socialist system lies behind the misinformation and lack of information at the time, as well as the paucity of data available to us today.
The Soviet centralist model is largely responsible for this misinformation.
This energy source and the associated residual risk are only acceptable - even on a temporary basis - if they are associated with the necessary degree of openness.
Thirdly, we must recognise that many people - including some from my own constituency - are still helping to alleviate the consequences of the disaster by inviting children into their homes, as well as many other initiatives.
The consequences of this catastrophe can still be seen in a generation that had not even been conceived at the time.
Accordingly, we can only take this residual risk into account to a limited extent and should understand that nuclear energy can only be a stop-gap technology.
Finally, Commissioner, I wish to encourage you in relation to the stress tests.
We need European criteria and inspection standards that are not solely open to the arbitrary will of individual states.
These stress tests must establish a situation whereby no data can be provided that cannot be verified subsequently.
That is why I would urge you not to allow yourself to be manipulated by members of the Council of Ministers, but rather to set down clear, common, verifiable standards, so that these stress tests fulfil their purpose.
