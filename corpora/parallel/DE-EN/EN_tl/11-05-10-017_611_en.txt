Mr President,
(Mr Mann begins to speak without a microphone.)
....
1986 and the nuclear meltdown of an outdated nuclear power plant.
Fearing the danger from radiation, we stayed at home as much as possible for weeks on end, only venturing outside when absolutely necessary.
A nuclear emergency was declared on 11 March of this year in the Fukushima nuclear power plant.
Even in a high-tech country like Japan, the promised safety levels could not be even remotely achieved.
The responsible politicians need to distance themselves from over-hasty solutions.
Sustainability involves compulsory stringent stress tests that examine the impact on nuclear power plants of natural disasters, as well as accidents, terrorist attacks and human error.
My country stands accused of 'typical German angst' - quite unfairly in this case.
We need to take the fears of our citizens seriously.
Everything needs to be on the table, from different timetables and decommissioning scenarios to qualified moratoriums - without false time pressures, polemics or ideologies.
The work of the German Ethics Commission should be a shining model for Europe.
Workers in nuclear power plants need special protection.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants to expand the legal basis for the directive on disposal to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
This would also include those workers who deal with radioactive waste and spent fuel rods.
Stringent criteria must apply in the areas of training and occupational safety and thorough investigations are required.
On a final note, Mr President: we must never compromise on safety issues.
This is true for the EU and for our neighbours, who must be persuaded of the importance of joint decision-making.
