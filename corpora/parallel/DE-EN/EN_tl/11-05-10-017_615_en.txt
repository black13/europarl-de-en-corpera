Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, even 25 years down the road, Chernobyl continues to be a cause for concern.
Fukushima will also be a source of anxiety for years to come.
The debate surrounding these major accidents is a sign that nuclear technology has inherent risks that it may not be possible to control.
This is leading to a rethink in energy policy.
However, it is also evident that unilateral action by individual countries is a mistake.
We need international strategies, or at least EU-wide strategies when it comes to safety.
That is why I fully support the Commissioner for Energy, who has made a number of important proposals in this direction.
I would call on everyone here to work together to produce common principles so that the existing nuclear reactors really are safe, so that power failures are not allowed to happen and so that earthquake safety and other risks can be better estimated.
We should then take a pro-active approach in bringing these principles to the attention of the international bodies.
