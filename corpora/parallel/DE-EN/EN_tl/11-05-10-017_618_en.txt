Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all well aware of the direct impact of Chernobyl.
I have a question because, after all, our citizens expect us to learn lessons from such events.
There is little doubt that the Commission is aware of the consequences of Chernobyl and now Fukushima for the population of Europe, whether in terms of health risks or the financial consequences.
What steps are being taken to protect the people of Europe in the event of a new accident?
After all, undeniable risks exist here in Europe too - for example in connection with the Isar I power plant, which is the same type as Fukushima and which is in the flight path of Munich airport, or Kr≈°ko, which is located in an area prone to earthquakes.
