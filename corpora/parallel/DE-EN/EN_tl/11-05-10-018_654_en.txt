Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your dedication in this matter.
I would like to emphasise this in the strongest terms.
I would just like to ask the following question: either yesterday or today the United Nations requested a ceasefire so that humanitarian needs could be tended to.
Is humanitarian aid actually reaching the majority of Libya's population and what percentage of the country or population do you estimate is inaccessible to the aid agencies?
