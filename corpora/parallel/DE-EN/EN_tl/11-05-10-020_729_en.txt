Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to express my thanks for the detailed answer to my parliamentary question of 8 February on the stress tests as they related to the Irish banks.
We have made something clear today: credibility engenders trust.
Also, a serious, upright and determined approach will help us overcome the crisis in credibility.
It is for this reason that I am forced to say that I do not believe the last stress test was adequately evaluated.
The consequences are unknown.
Despite the logical conclusions that you have outlined today, I am still not clear about the consequences of the forthcoming test.
For this reason I have three questions.
My first is this: Commissioner, how can you guarantee this time that a long-term view will be taken, rather than the short-term focus applied last time with the Irish banks?
Secondly, is the European public debt crisis deteriorating before our very eyes, as Mr Giegold describes?
This deterioration will only be tested in the banks' trading books in the current stress tests.
However the titles held by the banks until final maturity are listed in the banking book.
Yet the banking book will not be included in the stress test.
How can you justify this distinction?
Thirdly, will this not yet again give rise to a feeling that the long-term survival of the banks is guaranteed because our main problem, the state debt crisis, is not adequately being evaluated?
