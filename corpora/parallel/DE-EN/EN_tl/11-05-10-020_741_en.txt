Thank you very much, Mr Barnier.
Our discussions have gone on a little too long.
It is very much to your credit that you have responded to each speaker.
However, perhaps in future, for educational reasons, we should agree that the final statement by the Commissioner will only respond to those speakers still actually in the Chamber.
This would save us a little time.
The last debate has actually taken us right to the limit of the time we have available to us.
The debate is closed.
