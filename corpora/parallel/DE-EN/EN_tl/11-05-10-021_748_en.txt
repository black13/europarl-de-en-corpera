author. - Mr President, Mr Barnier, it is not just in the banking sector that we have regulations that do not work, but also in the environmental area.
Although we have a regulation covering the shipping of waste dating back to 2006, this does not work because there is an increasing trend towards shipping hazardous waste beyond the EU's borders, in particular to developing countries where the proper disposal of these hazardous substances cannot be guaranteed.
This cavalier approach to disposal leads to environmental and health problems in these countries that can cause many fatalities in extreme cases.
In addition, here in the European Union, we are discarding valuable resources.
Part of the 2020 strategy includes a strategy on resources and waste is one of our resources.
We should make every effort to improve our research activities in this area so that valuable materials can be segregated at the end of the product lifecycle.
In a speech on 7 April of this year, your colleague, Commissioner Potočnik, announced that, despite the Commission having avoided this issue and done nothing for many years, he intended presenting a communication in the autumn of this year in which he would tackle the problem, in particular with regard to implementation of existing regulations and an improved inspection system, as well as a broadening of the scientific base.
Commissioner, I would like to know whether this communication is already being prepared by the Commission services.
In other speeches, Commissioner Potočnik also referred to a new agency.
Although we already have a large number of official bodies, he is obviously thinking of a way to strengthen the control of the Member States' authorities in this area.
I would like to know how things stand in this area, because at present it would seem that we are unable to resolve this problem.
What steps does the Commission intend to pursue in this area?
