author. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, illegal waste exports and the illegal disposal of waste pose an increasing threat to the health and environment of millions of people in developing countries.
The volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the EU.
Because of the high cost of recycling and disposing of waste, there is an enormous temptation to ship this waste to countries with less stringent environmental controls and lower disposal costs.
I am pleased to find that this problem is accepted by all sides of the House and hope that Parliament will take a concerted approach to this issue.
The legal loopholes that permit these hazardous exports must be closed.
The existing regulations on the shipment of toxic waste to developing countries must be tightened up and enforced.
We need a legislative proposal for environmental inspections, something that Parliament already called for in 2008, so that ships can be inspected effectively by the authorities in the local ports.
This must also be linked with the possibility of impounding ships in ports throughout the EU if there are grounds to suspect breaches of the law.
We propose that this should be reinforced in a joint resolution by all sides of the House.
The entry of waste into the EU must also be better controlled.
Off the coast of Calabria, just a few miles away from the port of Cetraro, there is a sunken vessel known for carrying highly toxic waste.
It is assumed that many other toxic waste transporters have been sunk just off the coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea.
This example illustrates the need for transparency in the shipment of waste and for reliable official inspections.
