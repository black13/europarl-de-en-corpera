Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the course of this debate, you will hear not only praise, but also criticism.
To be honest, it is clear that EU foreign policy has failed in some areas, including in the Arab world, in Afghanistan, in finding a resolution to the Palestinian problem and in the conflicts among our eastern neighbours.
The question that I would like to ask is: What is the reason for this?
With 27 different nations making decisions, how can we reach a consensus within the EU and within the common foreign and security policy?
It is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interests.
However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past.
The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests.
The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms.
The Members of this House almost cheered when the UN Security Council decided to take military intervention in Libya.
Today, I think all of us are at a loss when it comes to events there.
What are we doing for the people of Gaza or Darfur?
How can we give the 1.4 billion people living on one dollar a day the right to a life of dignity?
My group is particularly concerned with this question.
The revolutions in the Arab countries have one important demand in common.
They are all calling for justice and fairness, both in the distribution of wealth within society and in democratic participation in political decision making, including international relations.
The EU must respond to this demand.
In order to achieve this objective, we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally.
