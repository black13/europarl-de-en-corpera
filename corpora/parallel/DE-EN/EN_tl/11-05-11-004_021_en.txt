Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in the discussion on European foreign policy and Europe's position in the world, we are agreed that there is a need for improvement because of a variety of different circumstances.
However, we could follow the example of a similar area of policy which already functions extremely well, in other words, external trade policy.
The European Union has sole responsibility for external trade policy.
It is the only player and the only representative of the Member States.
It is not constantly being denounced on the basis of national vanity.
We may disagree in other areas, but here we are strong and united.
It is time for us to use our strength to ensure that the people living in our partner countries can benefit from the values that have helped us: human rights, social security, justice and freedom.
This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that we should and, indeed, must follow up to make the world a freer, fairer and more social place in future.
