Madam President, Mr Le Hyaric, I see things in exactly the same way as you do.
The unity between Hamas and Fatah really is an historical step forward.
It may now perhaps be possible to make progress in the process of reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
Baroness Ashton has made it very clear that the second flotilla will be a completely unnecessary provocation which could harm this process.
Would you and your group now distance yourself from your support for this flotilla in the same way as happened yesterday here in Parliament with the substantial involvement of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left?
