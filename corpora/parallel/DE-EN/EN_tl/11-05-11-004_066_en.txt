Mr President, I share the opinion of my fellow Members with regard to the unfortunate and inconsistent approach taken by individual governments to the challenges currently facing us.
I also join with Baroness Ashton in calling for the debate to be extended to include the national governments.
I would specifically like to ask what benefit government A or government B hopes to gain from pressing ahead unilaterally or from blocking a decision.
What is the benefit?
It must be greater than the impact that we can have by taking united action in the Union.
I believe that some governments would find it difficult to explain their actions.
However, I am confident that we are in the painful process of learning from our mistakes.
The financial crisis and the debt crisis have, to a certain extent, had a beneficial impact by creating a greater sense of cooperation, in particular, as far as the common foreign and security policy is concerned.
Other speakers have referred to pooling and sharing.
On 8 April, the EU Military Staff submitted 300 projects from the Member States in this area.
I would like to know what you now plan to do with these projects.
Are there plans to use this initiative to launch the permanent structured cooperation which has not yet been put into operation?
Will you ensure that the European Defence Agency and the EU Military Staff have central responsibility for implementing this initiative?
Mr BÃ¼tikofer listed four priorities for the next year which I largely support.
On several occasions, the European Parliament has called for a White Paper to be drawn up on the security and defence policy.
What is your opinion on this?
Are you prepared to bring together the existing units within your service that are working on these questions to make one department which could be called the operational headquarters?
