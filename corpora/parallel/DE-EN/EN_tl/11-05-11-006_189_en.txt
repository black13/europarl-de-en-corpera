Mr President, in my opinion, this report is attempting to solve two major problems.
Firstly, the aim is to promote innovation.
This means that the process of including new fibre names in the standard list of names must be made more transparent and must involve less red tape.
Secondly, origin labelling must be improved.
Here, we can honestly say that this point has not yet been finally and satisfactorily resolved.
I would like to make it very clear that this is not the fault of the rapporteur.
This was simply due to the widely differing opinions held by members of the Council which the Commission could not reconcile.
I hope that we will continue to work on this issue, because origin labelling is becoming increasingly important.
It is one of the rights of consumers.
I would like to see a discussion on this point in the near future in the European Parliament and I would like the Commission to submit a proposal.
