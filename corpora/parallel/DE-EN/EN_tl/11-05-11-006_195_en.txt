Mr President, radio frequencies are a very scarce and valuable resource in our modern society.
Therefore, it makes sense to coordinate the use of these frequencies efficiently throughout Europe.
Broader access to the radio spectrum is important not only for businesses, but also for the citizens of the European Union.
For this reason, we should take particular care to ensure that this policy is developed in line with economic, social and cultural interests.
In particular, we must not allow this regulation to put at risk the direct wireless transmission used in Germany in regional theatres, at rock concerts and in churches.
I would also like to ask the Commission to sit down with the Member States and work closely with them in this area and not to interfere in their national powers.
