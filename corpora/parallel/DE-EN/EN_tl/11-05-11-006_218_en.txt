Mr President, the forests are our future and our cultural landscape.
They are carefully managed to provide services for us and for the environment, including producing oxygen, storing carbon and offering a habitat for plants and animals.
The people who manage our woodlands are paid little or nothing for providing these hidden functions which many people take for granted.
This makes it all the more important for us to take into consideration the economic aspects of our forests.
These include the timber industry and, increasingly, the production of biomass, not only for heating, but also for electricity generation.
In future, we must strengthen and make greater use of the economic aspects of woodlands and we must take national and personal responsibility for this.
We are expecting the Commission to produce a White Paper which reflects this comprehensive approach and puts the focus on it to ensure that our forests have a future and that we are all prepared to invest in this future.
If I plant a grain of corn, I am thinking only of today, but if I plant a tree, I am looking to the future.
