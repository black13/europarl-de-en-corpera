Consumers' awareness of the goods they buy is constantly growing.
For the majority of people, the origin of the products plays a very important role in their decisions about what they want to spend their money on.
In the textile sector, there is a need for a great deal more information in this area so that consumers know where the jumpers, jackets and trousers, etc. that they are buying come from and which materials they are made of.
As things currently stand, the labelling requirements are highly inadequate.
We need clearer labels to indicate where animal products are used to make a garment, in particular, in the case of fur and fur trim.
I voted in favour of the report because it deals with providing detailed information that is urgently needed by citizens, who have the right to know where their textiles come from and what materials they are made of.
