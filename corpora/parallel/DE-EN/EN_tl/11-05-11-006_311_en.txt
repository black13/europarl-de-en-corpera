I have voted in favour of the report on naming and labelling textile products.
The proposed revision of EU legislation primarily concerns technical issues which do not have a major political impact.
However, the resulting simplification of the processes will help to promote innovation within the industry.
The compromise reached by several groups in the European Parliament also takes into consideration existing problems involving counterfeit products in the European textile sector and calls for transparent and coherent trade regulations to ensure protection for consumers.
