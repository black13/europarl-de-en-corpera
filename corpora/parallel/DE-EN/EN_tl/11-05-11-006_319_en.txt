In order to stimulate the economies of the countries in the Western Balkans, they have been given privileged access to the European market.
This applies to almost all goods produced in countries participating in or linked to the EU's Stabilisation and Association process.
The trade preferences were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010 and cover the following countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo.
The preferences remain in place for goods from Albania, Croatia, Macedonia and Montenegro.
If these trade preferences were to come to an end now, this would jeopardise further economic growth in these countries.
I have not voted in favour of the report because, as has already been explained, some points in the new regulation are not clearly worded.
