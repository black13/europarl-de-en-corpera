The modern information society and the scarcity of frequency bands make strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of the spectrum essential.
Of course, this relates to mobile and wireless broadband communications, radio and television broadcasting and also radio communications at concerts or in theatres.
In addition to the issue of the frequencies, this concerns cultural diversity and also involves taking into consideration which technical options are and are not available and affordable.
Affordability is a concern, for example, for cultural organisations without a great deal of money which do not always have the funding to buy new equipment.
The goals of introducing complete broadband coverage of the EU by 2013 and universal high-speed Internet access by 2020 are praiseworthy, but perhaps not entirely realistic.
In addition, the proposal gives no consideration to the specific problems in border areas where greater coordination is needed.
