Not only the European Parliament but also the European Union as a whole is suffering from a huge credibility problem.
Although Parliament has finally reached an agreement on the transparency register, no doubt bowing to the pressure of the recent lobbying scandal, this register will be powerless.
It will be necessary to record not only all work undertaken for businesses or for international companies, but also all paid lobbying for interest groups, such as professional organisations and trade unions.
Citizens have a right to transparency because it is their mandatory contributions which keep the statutory lobby groups in existence.
Complete disclosure should include not only salaries, but also fees, invitations to dinner, etc.
As these measures are a step in the right direction, I have voted for the report.
