Transparency is an important component of democracy and a requirement for the participation of citizens, which makes it an essential means of gaining their trust.
In addition, the accountability which results from transparency requirements is an important instrument for preventing all kinds of abuse.
This draft agreement concerning the establishment of a transparency register takes all the essential requirements into consideration, which means that I was able to give the agreement as a whole my support.
The next step must be to follow up the objectives of this new register and to combat any new difficulties which arise immediately and effectively in the spirit of the original agreement.
