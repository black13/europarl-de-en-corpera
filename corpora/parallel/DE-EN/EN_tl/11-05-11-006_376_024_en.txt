The most important revelation to emerge from the financial and economic crisis was that we have an extremely greedy system.
The financial sector was not only focusing on short-term profits, but was also undermining efforts to introduce sustainable growth.
The report contains important lessons for us to learn from the financial crisis with regard to risk, boards of directors, supervisory bodies, shareholders and remuneration.
I have therefore voted in favour of this report.
