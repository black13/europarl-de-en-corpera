The European forestry industry is more sustainable than almost any other sector of the economy.
For generations, the owners of European forests have complied with the strictest legislation on forests and nature conservation.
However, the report submitted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety relating to the Green Paper on forest protection and information introduces a rising tide of regulation, without acknowledging the importance of the forests as a job creator and an economic engine.
The report calls for excessive sustainability criteria to be applied to forest management within the EU, without taking into consideration regional factors and the powers of the individual countries.
The main points which exceed the authority of national forestry policy and weaken the forests in economic terms are the provisions concerning timber supplies within Europe.
Also, the concept of 'sustainability' has still not been defined.
Another point which I am opposed to is the implication that woody biomass is not sustainable.
I believe that we should highlight the variety of protective and useful functions provided by the forests and not take a one-sided approach.
The EU should make a greater effort to ensure that sustainable forest management is put into practice in Europe and that we act as a model for other countries.
