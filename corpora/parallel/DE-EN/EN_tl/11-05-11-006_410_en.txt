The forests and the forestry industry are already making a significant contribution to the production of local raw materials.
The forests are also a recreational area for many of the citizens of Europe and play an important role in preventing climate change.
Hardly any other area has such closely interlinked environmental, economic and social functions.
However, there are some enormous challenges facing our forests.
One of the most important of these is climate change.
It is the job of the Member States, with the support of the European Commission, to protect and develop our forests for future generations so that they can continue making a contribution in future to our natural habitats, our society and our economy.
This includes ensuring that the forests play a permanent and growing role in combating climate change and safeguarding the economic basis of the forestry and timber industries, so that we have an adequate future supply of wood.
