I have voted against paragraph 36 (split 2) and against paragraph 37, because issues of environmental planning come under regional or national authority, which means that decisions in these areas must be made by regional or national parliaments.
In my opinion, any intervention on an EU level would be an intervention in subsidiarity and would therefore go too far.
