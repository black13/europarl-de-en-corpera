I am a supporter of the common European foreign and defence policy, where the word 'European' is of the greatest importance.
Europe must free itself from the USA with regard not only to its economy, but also its foreign policy.
It must become more autonomous in order to be seen throughout the world as a strong and independent player.
However, we have not yet identified any signs of movements in this direction.
On the contrary, this report supports and safeguards the links with the USA, in particular, via NATO.
Some people even believe that these links should be strengthened.
This would have a highly counterproductive impact on the future of the EU and would make it difficult to agree on a common European approach or attitude to important issues, as the crisis in Libya has demonstrated.
For this reason, I have voted against this report.
