I voted in favour of this report.
In order to strengthen the EU's influence at a global level and, therefore, indirectly, the influence of the individual Member States, we need the insight and the determination to ensure increased cooperation and coordination between the different levels.
We must not put unnecessary obstacles in the path of the European External Action Service (EEAS) to enable it to live up to its founding principles.
I have also voted in favour of the amendment, which, at the same time, calls on Baroness Ashton to make full use of her powers.
We need the active involvement of both sides to ensure that the EEAS is a success.
As a member of the Committee on Budgets and an advocate of the greatest possible transparency, I have, of course, also voted in favour of the amendment calling for separate budget lines for each mission.
