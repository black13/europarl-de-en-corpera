Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I also very much regret the fact that the negotiations have failed, in particular, because we will now have to wait for years until we have rules governing, for example, nanotechnology in foods and products from third countries which are currently unknown in Europe.
It seems that by including cloned animals in this legislation, we have fallen into a trap.
I must say that the way we have debated this issue has not been dignified.
The discussions went on all night with each side going to and fro and neither wanting to give in.
Then, in the end, the negotiations failed, which is very unfortunate.
I would like to make one point.
We are talking here about a number of subjects and about legislation.
We used the same strategy for genetic engineering.
We did not want genetic engineering and we significantly raised the limits and the requirements.
What was the end result?
The technology developed to such an extent that it was even able to meet these high standards.
We are currently discussing the fact that we do not want cloned animals because the animal welfare requirements are not being fulfilled, which gives rise to risks.
I have spoken to the scientists and I predict that the technology will develop to such an extent that it will no longer be possible to apply a general ban on cloning animals.
However, I believe that these scientific developments are highly questionable.
We must look more closely at the basic principles that we need to lay down in order to put in place proper regulations.
We should not attempt to slow down or even prevent certain developments by means of legislation.
