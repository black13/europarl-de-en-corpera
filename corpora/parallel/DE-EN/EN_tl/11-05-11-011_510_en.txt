Madam President, Mr Dalli, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Dalli for his efforts in the area of prevention.
I hoped and expected that we would see this level of commitment from him with regard to cloned materials.
We have had several hours of intensive discussions and I see myself as a representative of the people of Europe who clearly support the position that Parliament has taken and want to see progress in this area.
Together with 500 million Europeans, we want clear labelling as the minimum solution.
In reality, we would like a ban on cloned animals and on products from cloned animals, regardless of which generation they come from.
We hoped for your support, Mr Dalli.
We did not understand why the Council was not on our side, because the Council is made up of elected representatives of the Member States.
However, they were obviously serving the needs of the market and not those of the people.
We hope that in future, you will put the people at the centre of your decision-making processes and not the market.
