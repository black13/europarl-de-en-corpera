Madam President, consumer protection policy is a central element of overall European policy.
If we do not manage to provide consistent protection for consumers, then we will have totally failed in this respect.
It is important to explain that it is not just the majority of consumers who do not want cloning, it is also the majority of farmers.
I believe that some Member States have deliberately sabotaged the negotiations.
They have decided to protect the agriculture industry and defend its interests.
All the talk of an imminent trade war, which has been mentioned several times today, was simply a pretext.
For reasons of European animal welfare policy alone, we should be taking measures against cloning, Mr Dalli, and we hope that you will draw up a regulation as quickly as possible.
There is a need for action.
We are calling on you not to wait for months, but to come to grips with this issue straight away.
The ban on cloning is simply one step in the process.
We must insist on a regulation being introduced which covers the descendants of cloned animals, otherwise the whole thing will be fundamentally ineffective.
