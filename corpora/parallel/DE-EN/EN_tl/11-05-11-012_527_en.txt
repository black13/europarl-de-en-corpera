Mr President, it does not happen every day in Parliament that Members of six different political groups table a joint question which leads to a debate.
Today, we have a case of this kind and it is no coincidence that it concerns the role of small and medium-sized businesses.
This is a commonly held and broad-based concern.
One of the questions we are asking is: What is the Commission doing to further strengthen the particularly successful financial instruments in future for small and medium-sized companies?
One of these successful instruments is the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP).
What will happen to CIP when the common strategic framework for research and innovation is developed?
What opportunities will there be for small and medium-sized enterprises in this context?
It will definitely not be possible to make the concept of innovation so broad and far-reaching that it covers all the relevant activities and all small and medium-sized businesses.
However, we must not make the mistake of only promoting the competitiveness of those small and medium-sized firms which have been identified as being particularly innovative.
Therefore, I believe that it is very important for the right decisions to be made in the common strategic framework.
I would also like to mention specifically that this also concerns the issue of the criteria on which simplification and the reduction of red tape are based.
CIP is already much less bureaucratic than the Seventh Framework Programme.
It would not be sensible to apply the standards of the Seventh Framework Programme in the case of small and medium-sized companies.
We need to find a practical way of continuing the measures which have been good for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, in programmes such as CIP, so that these activities do not fall by the wayside during the course of a reorganisation.
