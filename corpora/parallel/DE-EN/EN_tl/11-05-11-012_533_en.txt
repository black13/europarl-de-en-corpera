Mr President, Mr Rehn, the joint question on the review of the Small Business Act shows that there is still a great deal to be done to ensure that medium-sized companies in Europe have freedom to act, particularly on a national level.
However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union.
Most recently, a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions came into force in March, which will make an important contribution to improving payment practice in Europe.
Now the Member States have two years to implement the new directive.
I would like to call for this timeframe to be shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would not present a significant problem.
Instead of delaying implementation for two years, it could be completed, where possible, within one year.
The Member States have not yet been able to agree on the statute for a European private company.
Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency is following up this issue and making it one of the focal points of its work.
This form of company in particular could enable small and medium-sized enterprises to save a great deal of money.
I am thinking, in particular, of accounting, establishing a company and ongoing legal advice.
Therefore, I would like to say again how pleased I am that the Hungarian Presidency is focusing on this area.
The issue just mentioned by Mrs Riera Madurell is also important, and that is public procurement.
Here, we can still achieve a great deal for small and medium-sized enterprises.
There are many bureaucratic regulations in this area and it is often particularly difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to take part in the public procurement process.
We need greater transparency and we must also try to make the most of the opportunities presented by the modern media and, in particular, the Internet.
