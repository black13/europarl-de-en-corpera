Mr President, one particularly positive feature of the Small Business Act is the provision which makes it easier to establish companies in terms of both time and cost.
I also welcome the obligation on the public sector to pay invoices within 30 days.
However, some bureaucratic obstacles remain in place, for example, as far as cash flow is concerned.
We need to evaluate to what extent the Basel criteria could cause a serious credit crunch for small and medium-sized enterprises.
As far as the cross-border area is concerned, we should finally get the European private company under way.
From the perspective of the cost-benefit factor, this form of company could, in future, be more important than the European company.
I am thinking in this respect of subsidiaries and transfers of registered offices throughout Europe.
Finally, I would just like to say that we need to follow up on the measures to give small and medium-sized businesses access to China and other markets in Asia.
