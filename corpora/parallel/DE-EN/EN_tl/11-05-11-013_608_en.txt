Mr President, in contrast to my fellow Members who have overrun their time, in a similar way to the budget overrun, I will attempt to be brief.
Among the many clever analyses and responses, there is one question which has not been asked.
That is the question of what the citizens of the net contributors would say.
Tax rates of 50% with a high standard of living and high levels of social services are not a coincidence.
This means that the citizens are working hard and earning a great deal.
Solidarity, which has often been referred to today, also involves solidarity with the citizens in our own home countries.
The case of Sweden has been mentioned.
The EU did not intervene here with financial aid.
Instead, restructuring has taken place, cuts have been made in social services and public services have been reduced.
In other words, a strict fiscal policy has been introduced.
We must explain this to the countries which are obviously the subject of today's debate.
Without a strict fiscal policy and major efforts on their own part, this will not work.
