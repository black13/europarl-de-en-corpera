One thing is clear to all of us.
The effects of the economic and financial crisis can still be felt everywhere and it involves numerous issues.
It goes without saying that the EU must respond to the crisis.
I have a few thoughts on the stress tests which were carried out on the banks.
A total of 91 major European banks were tested and 7 failed.
I have one major criticism in this area, which is that the consequences of a country going bankrupt were not evaluated and this remains a possibility when we look at Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
The most recent stress tests focused on the hard capital ratios, but the liquidity criteria should also have been included.
It is obvious that these results must be published in order to achieve the required level of transparency.
