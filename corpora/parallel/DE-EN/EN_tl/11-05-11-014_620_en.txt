Mr President, Mrs Rapti, yes, that is possible, because, of course, an overlap has emerged in the meantime between the actual areas of work.
By the way, I did not make this up myself.
It was brought to light in the Commission study, which refers to the overlaps.
In addition, surveys of all of those who make use of the agency's work also contain many references to the overlaps.
This is where the information comes from.
I will be happy to make these documents available to you.
