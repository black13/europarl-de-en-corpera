Mr President, the EU has four agencies in the field of employment, working conditions and vocational training; namely, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the European Training Foundation (ETF), the European Agency for Safety and Health (OSHA) and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), with an annual budget of around EUR 15 million to EUR 20 million.
I have looked at the websites of these four agencies.
The focus is on activities such as a photo competition on the subject of risk prevention, a competition for practical solutions, whatever they might be, and the joint organisation of the European Day of Solidarity between Generations.
These are all earthshaking activities, none of which seem to have any concrete output.
The areas covered by the agencies overlap.
There are overlaps between the agencies and also with the Directorates-General of the Commission, with departments in Parliament and with national bodies.
Obviously, this situation cannot continue.
We must prevent duplication of effort by merging the agencies.
Inefficient agencies must be closed, because the taxpayers will definitely not understand why millions of euro are being wasted on photo competitions within this proliferation of agencies.
