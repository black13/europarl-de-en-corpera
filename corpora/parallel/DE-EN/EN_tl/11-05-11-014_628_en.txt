Mr President, it is very significant that the Member who asked the question has left the room during the discussion.
The arguments and questions put by some of the previous speakers once again demonstrate a highly revealing populist mindset.
We are in the midst of a crisis and, as usual, savings are being made in areas which affect the workers.
I think that this is a very one-sided approach.
I would like to look briefly at the European Training Foundation (ETF).
It is important because of its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the EU's partner countries.
It enables the European social model to be exported to acceding countries and provides help with developing education, vocational training and further education programmes and with creating secure jobs.
Two weeks ago, I was in Belgrade and, in meetings with education and training providers, I was once again assured of the importance of the agency.
The same thing happened in meetings in Turkey.
The ETF plays a very important role in helping the acceding countries to enter the EU labour market.
If we take a more far-sighted approach, the Arab spring is also very important.
We do not want large numbers of refugees to come to Europe, so we must offer people support in their home countries.
We must provide education and help the countries to develop training programmes and facilities.
