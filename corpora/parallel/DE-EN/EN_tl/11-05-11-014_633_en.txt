Mr President, if you had explained when Mrs Rapti took the floor what the consequences would be, we could have made more progress.
Mrs Rapti, this approach has brought about exactly the situation that we now find ourselves in and the problem of the agencies working inefficiently, which we urgently need to resolve.
If we want to retain the agencies, we need to change them.
I can only ask you to join us in our efforts.
We cannot simply leave things as they are because the agencies are so inefficient and because they are wasting money rather than making money every day.
I would like to mention once again that the funding for the four agencies we are talking about amounts to EUR 90 million.
That is a lot of money.
I am not sure whether the services that the agencies provide are really worth EUR 90 million.
That is the point I would like to emphasise.
We owe this to our citizens and our taxpayers.
I have to justify myself every day to German taxpayers and explain that we are getting value for money.
I believe that there is plenty of room for improvement.
