Mr President, when we look at the development of agencies in Europe, it gradually becomes clear that we are suffering from 'agencyitis'.
There are no other areas where four agencies are working in parallel.
Elsewhere, the job is done by one agency.
When we consider the situation as a whole, it seems as if each country essentially wants its own agency.
If you will pardon me for saying so, we cannot allow this to happen.
We should not only be discussing whether a merger should take place.
We should also be considering which tasks the Commission itself can take responsibility for and whether an agency is needed at all.
This means that we should gradually move to thinking about which agencies we can close down.
I would like to ask the previous speaker, who took the floor twice: Where are the specific efficiency measurements?
How many jobs have the agencies actually created?
Where is the turnover which justifies ongoing funding of EUR 90 million per year?
When I have the answers to these questions, I will be able to support the continuing existence of these agencies.
Otherwise, I would like to see them closed.
