Mr President, we are facing major societal challenges: the economic crisis, the ageing population, the scarcity of resources and the need to maintain our international competitiveness.
This makes it all the more important for us to promote innovation, which can counteract these problems by providing creative ideas and solutions.
This is not just about introducing technical innovations, but also socio-political innovations.
For example, in order to deal with the problem of the ageing population, we need so-called classic innovations, on the one hand, such as new drugs, and, on the other, we should be thinking about innovative models for society, pensions and healthcare systems.
We need to create an environment today which promotes the innovations of tomorrow, including investment in research and development, protection for intellectual property, in particular, using patent legislation, and the encouragement of creative skills, starting in school classrooms.
Finally, I would like to mention a particular problem relating to the use of resources.
Innovations should ultimately ensure that products last longer.
This will be of benefit to consumers and the environment.
Unfortunately, there are also innovations which have the opposite effect.
Products are developed with deliberate weak points which shorten their useful life and increase consumption, such as laptops and smart phones.
The Innovation Union must help to combat this.
