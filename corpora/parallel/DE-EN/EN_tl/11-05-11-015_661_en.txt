Mr President, the major challenges faced by the Innovation Union include the ageing population and maintaining healthcare systems.
In order to ensure that the systems are sustainable and stable, they must be considered and discussed in their full context.
It will only be possible to find successful solutions by looking at the interrelationships between the systems.
By 2050, the ratio of EU citizens of working age to those over the age of 65 will fall from 4:1 to 2:1.
As a result, spending on pensions and healthcare is certain to rise.
However, focusing only on pension legislation and increasing patients' contributions will not allow us to achieve our objectives.
Successful solutions will also have to consider the failings of our education and labour market policies.
It will be essential to invest in training and to change the direction of our training policy in order to counteract a situation in which a growing number of jobs in highly specialised industries cannot be filled, while an equivalent number of low-skilled people of working age are relying on benefits.
As part of our labour market policy, we will have to coordinate our family and equality policies, instead of seeing them as contradictory.
