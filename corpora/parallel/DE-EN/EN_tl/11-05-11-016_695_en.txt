Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission is obviously taking notice of this subject.
I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint.
It is not the case, as Mr Őry emphasised previously in this discussion, that we know too little about what domestic workers in Europe do.
On the contrary, we know so much that there is an urgent need for regulation.
Between 5% and 9% of all employees work in private households.
This is the worst paid group of employees in Europe, with the fewest rights and the largest proportion of illegal workers.
Action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the European Commission.
The situation we currently find ourselves in will not be improved by the free movement of workers.
For this reason, the initiative in this International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention is very welcome and deserves our support.
I would like to comment on four points.
Firstly, there are gaps in the definitions in the ILO Convention.
If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place.
Secondly, there is an urgent need for mandatory employment contracts in this area.
Thirdly, we must have not only sensible, generally binding minimum wage regulations, but also equal employment rights.
Fourthly, these workers must be covered by a statutory social security obligation, in particular, given that this is a minimum wage sector.
I am pleased that Mrs Berès has called in her statement for a campaign to introduce standard working conditions.
This is a good thing.
We must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is outlawed by society and is no longer tolerated.
