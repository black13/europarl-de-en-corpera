Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, in Germany, domestic workers are not covered by employment protection legislation.
They are also not included in the European framework directive.
The reason for this is that the state is not allowed to monitor compliance with regulations in private residences.
There are similar obstacles in other Member States.
A total of 15 of them have not included domestic workers in their employment protection laws.
However, these workers do deserve special protection.
I am therefore in favour of adopting the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention, but I do not think it would be sensible to incorporate large parts of the convention into EU law.
This would prevent the national parliaments from making independent decisions on the ratification of individual ILO conventions.
Nevertheless, I would like to thank the ILO working groups for their excellent work.
There are still a few problems, for example, in the definitions.
Article 1 should cover not only domestic work, but also household services.
The article concerning rest periods is also problematic.
Every employee must be given one rest day per week, but this does not have to be in the same week.
The Member States must come to individual agreements on the time periods, because a certain amount of flexibility is needed.
The ban on payments in kind which are directly related to work, such as uniforms, tools or protective equipment, seems to me to be incomprehensible.
I suspect that what is meant is that they must not be deducted from pay.
In other words, we need a ban on deducting payments in kind from wages.
Once these inconsistencies have been resolved, I believe that we should sign the ILO Convention on domestic workers.
Thank you very much, Mrs Ber√®s, for your initiative, and thanks to all of those who have said that they want to attempt to make progress on behalf of people who, as we all know, deserve protection.
