Madam President, I would like to refer once again to Mr Andor's speech.
He asked very cautiously whether the European Commission has powers and responsibilities in this area.
I believe that it has more responsibility, in particular, with regard to freedom of movement.
Posted workers immediately come to mind.
One example of this is Berlin, where the unions have set up an advisory centre for posted workers.
The largest group of workers who contact this centre, not only from Berlin but from throughout Germany, are nurses who are employed as domestic workers, sometimes in appalling and highly precarious working conditions.
This is one way of circumventing minimum working conditions.
Some of these people even have bogus self-employed status.
This is why we have tabled this amendment.
The majority of these people are workers from other EU Member States and from third countries.
This demonstrates that the Commission certainly does have a responsibility to take action and to introduce minimum standards in this area.
