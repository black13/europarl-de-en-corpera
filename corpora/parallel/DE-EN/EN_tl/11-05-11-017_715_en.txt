Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very serious issue.
It is of great importance not only for animal husbandry in future, but also primarily for human health.
We must not forget this.
This is ultimately not a problem for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
However, as has once again become clear, we do not have enough data.
Only 10 Member States have provided information and that is too few.
We need to deal with this subject rather more quickly and we need accurate controls.
We are paying too little attention to one factor in this context and that is intensive farming, both in large-scale buildings and in certain regions.
We need to look at this and we can do something to prevent it.
By restructuring our agricultural policy, we can make sure that the focus is on good animal welfare, that animals live in conditions suitable for their species, and that the animals are strong and robust, on the principle that prevention is better than cure.
What we also need, and this is a job for the Commission, is a long-term plan to reduce the use of antibiotics in agriculture.
The main impact of antibiotic resistance is on workers in the agriculture industry, in other words, farmers and their employees.
These people already have huge problems in this area.
Another cause for concern is the suspicion that antibiotic resistance is being transferred directly via foodstuffs.
We need to look carefully at this in the interests of the health of the European population.
There is an urgent need for action here.
It is important to make it clear that 50% of all antibiotics are used in animal husbandry, which is far too much.
Therefore, we must ensure that this figure is reduced in the long-term interests of agriculture and of public health.
