Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, we must do everything we can to counteract the spread of antibiotic resistance.
We are in complete agreement on this.
This involves the responsible use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry.
The European Union must take determined action.
We must not allow 25 000 people to go on dying from infections caused by resistant bacteria every year in the European Union alone.
Antibiotics must not be used routinely or preventively.
We must ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly in all the Member States.
It is of the utmost importance that every possible effort is made to keep livestock healthy from the rearing stage onwards, until they are fully grown.
Ensuring that animals are healthy is the best means of avoiding infection and the use of antibiotics.
The way the animals are fed is decisive in this respect, but the husbandry is also important.
We should also be open to the use of alternative methods, such as homeopathy and phytotherapy, in livestock husbandry.
We need more research and more information in Europe about these alternative approaches.
