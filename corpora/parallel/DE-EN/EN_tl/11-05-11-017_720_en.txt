Madam President, I am very grateful to the author of the question, the chair of our committee, for putting this subject on the agenda.
The use of antibiotics in animals involves closely linked advantages and disadvantages.
The medicines which help animals to remain healthy can, if used improperly, represent a major risk for people.
Therefore, we need to take a coordinated, integrated and, above all, scientific approach, because we will have to continue using antibiotics to treat animals in future.
At the same time, we must also reduce the risks for people.
This report meets precisely these requirements.
I hope that the Commission will take up Parliament's suggestions, wishes and demands.
Most importantly, as many previous speakers have said, we need an analysis of the current situation by all the Member States in the interest of animals, of European agriculture and, in particular, of the citizens of the European Union.
