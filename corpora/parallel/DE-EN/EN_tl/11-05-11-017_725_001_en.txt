We are absorbing antibiotics in our food, which is resulting in increased resistance.
This is one area of medical progress which is gradually being ruined and we have known about this for a long time.
Mr De Castro referred to the measures that have already been taken.
I support the proposals made in the resolution.
There are two aspects of this which I would like to focus on.
Regulations alone are not enough.
In the dioxin scandal, we have seen how easily they can be undermined, if individual 'black sheep' behave in a very negligent way.
Of course, we must have regulations and we need to introduce monitoring systems, but that is not the entire solution.
In the medium and long term, the solution is to make the use of antibiotics largely superfluous.
We can achieve this firstly by investing in research and networking expert knowledge, secondly, by passing this knowledge on to farmers and vets and thirdly, by providing information to consumers.
We must make clever use of market forces, because it is consumers who decide in the long term how their food is produced.
