Mr President, let us get back on topic.
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to thank everyone who worked on this report.
In the committee, all the groups pursued the unanimous objective of making education and training possible for every young person in Europe and supporting their entry into a career, while no young person should fall by the wayside.
I did not base my opinion for the committee on the Commission report, as I found it too unspecific.
It was important to me for very specific tasks, too, to be listed in the report.
In some cases, I was unable to support the positions taken in the report.
In the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, one important aspect is the transition from school to career.
It is a core interface.
This transition must take place without time spent waiting around.
We also found it important that young people's entry into their careers should not be associated with social dumping and that it must not take place under conditions of dumping.
We felt that the role of traineeships was important.
They are important and they are necessary, but their abuse must be avoided and forbidden.
We would like to see an initiative for a European qualifications framework laying down minimum standards for traineeships.
I will close with a request of Parliament and the Commission to ensure that the Youth in Action programme does not suffer financial cuts or even abolition in favour of the Youth on the Move programme.
The work of youth associations is important for social engagement and helps young people progress, both in terms of substance and personally.
That is also a major advantage for later working life.
