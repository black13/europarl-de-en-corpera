Mr President, Commissioner, in reality, we are holding a debate this morning about the significance of culture in the various policy areas - in foreign policy, in economic policy, in education policy and in social policy - and we all know that all of us benefit from culture being taken more seriously.
The breaking out of democracy in the Arab countries would not be possible without this culturally-based desire for opening up, for cultural diversity, democracy and freedom of the press.
Creative industries are an important part of economic policy.
In my home country, Germany, there are more jobs in the creative sector than in the automotive sector.
That is something we must take note of.
The result is that this is also an important part of the Europe 2020 strategy.
The point I want to make, however, is that, if we want to bolster the creative industries, we have work to do, in particular, on digital development.
We know that it is precisely the producers of creative content that form the base of the value chain for the cultural sector.
On the one hand, therefore, we have a major interest in cultural diversity, bolstering creative people and easy access to creative content online.
Yet, at the same time, we want artists to be fairly paid, something that is not always the case in today's digital world.
We therefore need to amend contract law in order to strengthen the bargaining position of our artists.
We need to develop new social models in order to find a fair balance between easy access for users and proper payment for those who create new content.
I have one last point to make.
It would be of major symbolic value and a major historic success for Europe if Sarajevo were to be a European Capital of Culture for 2014.
