This report shone the spotlight on an occupational category that is all too often neglected.
What would European culture be without creative artists?
While developing the creative industries economically, we must not forget those who work in this sector.
As the shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the social situation and the conditions in which creative artists in Europe live are particularly important.
Unfortunately, many of the 5 million people who make their livelihoods from the creative sector live in precarious conditions.
Second and third jobs are not rare, as one job is often not enough to live on.
A lack of health and pension insurance is on the agenda.
Contracts are mostly uncertain, and many creative workers are scarcely able to plan more than a couple of months in advance.
Moreover, a fair level of social security protection, with adequate insurance against unemployment, sickness and for old age, must be standard practice also for those working in the creative sector.
I am very pleased to see that the rapporteur followed the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this regard and included it in the report.
It is now time for the Commission and the Member States to remedy these social deficiencies and to promise the many creative minds of Europe that creative artists in Europe need not live as an underclass.
