Madam President, today, we have with us the National Executive of the Sudeten German Homeland Association, including the Sudeten German Youth, which is energetically pursuing cross-border collaboration with the Czech Youth.
In this regard, this report is of truly inestimable significance, as it covers three points: firstly, the networking of the universities, especially in the Euroregions and border regions; secondly, vocational training - as it is not just academic education that we need; and thirdly, and above all, the question of language skills.
I want to state quite clearly that I love the language of Shakespeare, but I do think it is a pity if our young people converse in but one language.
It is precisely the learning of the language of our neighbours and the learning of the smaller languages that we ought to be promoting in particular in this framework.
The truth is that you only really get to know the culture of your neighbours when you start to experience day-to-day life in their language.
In this connection, we have a lot of work to do, but also major opportunities.
