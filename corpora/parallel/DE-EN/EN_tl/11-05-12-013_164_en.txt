Madam President, the rising global market prices for oil are not the only cause of the crisis in the fisheries sector, as the fuels are generally already exempt from tax and as the rising global market prices affect every fisherman in the world - in the European Union and beyond.
As a second point, the raising of the de minimis thresholds should be seized as an opportunity to also help fishermen to be able to work - and fish - in a more environmentally sound and sustainable way.
Thirdly, simply making the fuel cheaper will not achieve this aim.
Put simply, I expect the Member States, too, to produce innovative and useful solutions in this regard.
