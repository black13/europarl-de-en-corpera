Madam President, unfortunately, I never had an opportunity to speak in the debate yesterday, although I was present.
I would like, however, to give my backing, in particular, to those speakers who stressed that innovation and research should and must take place in the agricultural sector, too.
Agriculture is no 'old economy' - it is modern and it is also an environment where activity, research and innovation take place.
European agriculture faces at least three major challenges; namely, ensuring the feeding of the population, sustaining the environment and producing energy.
These at times widely divergent aims require systematic scientific permeation both now and in the future.
