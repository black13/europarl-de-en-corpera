Madam President, I will set out my views on domestic employment.
First of all, I agree with those who say that those employed in this sector - and they are mostly women, of course - are entitled to fair pay and fair social services.
I also very much agree with those who say that, in this sector in particular, many unbelievable things happen and there is much injustice.
I do ask, however, that attention be paid to red tape when implementing justified demands.
In Germany, for example, the reality is that I, as someone who is covered by this legislation given my employment of domestic staff, need to call on the assistance of a tax advisor quite simply because there is so much red tape and the statutory stipulations are so complicated.
This takes its toll on the nerves, takes time and costs money.
Those who eschew the red tape mostly then pay their staff cash, thereby contributing - sometimes inadvertently - to illegal employment.
That is why I am calling for attention to be paid to the amount of red tape involved.
