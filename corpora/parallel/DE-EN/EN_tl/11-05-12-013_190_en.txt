Madam President, as a skilled farmer, I would like to add another couple of comments about these issues.
The first is that it is right that it must be our aim to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock production, in particular.
'As little as possible' should be the cornerstone of our action in this regard.
My second point is that we need an analysis of the status quo, in other words, an analysis of the data covering what is actually happening on the ground in the Member States of the European Union.
Obviously, all Member States need to take part in such an analysis.
My third point is that we need further scientific studies in order to analyse the dangers and also in order to be able to counter those dangers effectively.
Fourthly, what we do not need is ideological bogeymen.
Ideology cannot replace science.
