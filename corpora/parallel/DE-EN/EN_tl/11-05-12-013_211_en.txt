The effects of the global economic crisis were drastic for young people, in particular, right around the world, but also within the EU.
Youth unemployment within the EU has reached a high of 21%.
This is compounded by the fact that 15% of these young people dropped out of school and thus lack any qualifications for the labour market.
The EU has a target of reducing this rate to 10% by 2020 and increasing the proportion of people with a qualification from a university or technical college from 31% to 40%.
In order to be able to achieve these targets, there must be EU-wide recognition of education and training courses and qualifications.
This is also the only way that greater mobility of our young people can be achieved, something which is also intended to help them become acquainted with new cultures and societies so that they also have the option of making a success of themselves beyond their home country in years to come.
For that reason, barriers that are still in place need to be removed and procedures simplified, while existing programmes need to be expanded and promoted.
I abstained in the vote, as I believe that there has been no discussion of how to bring about mutual recognition of qualifications obtained through qualitatively differing methods of education and training.
This especially applies to the skilled trades, for which there is no uniform standard across Europe against which qualifications can be measured.
