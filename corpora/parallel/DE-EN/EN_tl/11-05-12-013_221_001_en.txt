The first three years of a child's life are crucial for the development of the brain and for language learning.
Language acquisition is the basis of logical thinking and contextual understanding.
Without a certain level of language acquisition, further learning is scarcely possible, as the language deficits can only be overcome with great difficulty with increasing age.
The report observes that most immigrant children in the EU are educated without adequate linguistic knowledge.
At the same time, it declares that migrant families (and minorities such as the Roma) make much less use of the early years education offered than other families.
We cannot allow it to be the case that the level of our schools continues to fall and fall because so many pupils quite simply cannot understand the teaching.
Every child - migrant or not - must have mastered the national language by the time they enter school to a degree that enables them to follow the teaching taking place there.
The report offers no meaningful attempts to solve this problem.
Instead, it leans towards complete nannying of the parents and a state takeover of child-rearing.
I therefore voted against this report.
