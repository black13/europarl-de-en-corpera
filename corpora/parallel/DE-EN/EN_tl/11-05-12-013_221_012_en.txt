I voted in favour of this report.
The rapporteur correctly placed the needs of the child at the heart of this report.
It is not surprising that the report should conclude that a single European solution is not possible.
All the same, we do need a 'framework' at EU level in order to be able to coordinate early years learning with other EU-level programmes such as lifelong learning.
