The motion for a resolution by the UK socialist MEP, Mary Honeyball, seeks to reduce the role of the mother and father of a child to that of equal partners in the State education system.
Verbatim, the report states (in paragraph 14) that '[The European Parliament] stresses that parents, both mothers and fathers, are equal partners in ECEC [early childhood education and care]; (...)'.
This wording expresses deep mistrust of the family and the globally recognised right of parents to care for and bring up their children.
This is in direct contrast to the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which states that 'The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them' (Article 6(2)).
This report is a manifestation of the EU's anti-family agenda and seeks to meddle in the social competences of the Member States.
Moreover, the motion recommends the introduction of a compulsory year of nursery schooling before the start of schooling proper, as well as developing and improving early years educational establishments In so doing, the report confirms the EU's 'Barcelona objectives' which, as once upon a time in the Soviet Union, provide quotas for the state takeover of children's upbringing.
The well-being of the child is not central to this motion.
The freedom of choice of parents in relation to bringing up their children is to be undermined.
I therefore voted against this report.
