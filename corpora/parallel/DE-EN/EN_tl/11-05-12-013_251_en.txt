In the past, innovation has primarily been envisaged in the field of research.
It should not be forgotten, though, that innovation can come from any EU citizen.
These concepts - which often start out simply as ideas - should be supported at EU level by means of easier access to funding, simplified authorisation procedures and cheap and straightforward patents, amongst other things.
That will enable the citizens themselves to exercise influence and help shape a sustainable society.
Moreover, innovations of this kind, where the focus absolutely should remain on research, would help to maintain high living standards in Europe.
The report received my vote because allowing individual citizens to play a part in shaping society represents a positive step.
Furthermore, the signs of the electronic era point more and more towards personal innovation, which is very much worth noting.
