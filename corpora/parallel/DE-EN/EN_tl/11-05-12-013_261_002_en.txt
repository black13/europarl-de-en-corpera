The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations and acts on behalf of social justice, human rights and workers' rights.
The main function of the organisation is to establish international labour and social standards.
For the ILO, 2010 was the year of domestic workers.
Minimum standards have therefore now been established, as domestic workers form the largest unregulated sector in the world.
