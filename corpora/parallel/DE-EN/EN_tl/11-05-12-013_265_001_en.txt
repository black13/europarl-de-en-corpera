For a long time, antibiotics were seen as a wonder drug that cured infectious diseases.
In most European countries, antibiotics are the most-used class of drugs after analgesics.
Around 50% of the antibiotics prescribed in Europe are used in veterinary medicine.
If antibiotics were not used, animal diseases and epizootics could quickly spread and become epidemics, causing enormous economic damage.
Unfortunately, the uncontrolled use of antibiotics in both human and veterinary medicine comes at a very high cost.
The excessive use of antibiotics leads to resistance and adaptation among pathogens.
Many of the well-known antibiotics have today become either ineffective or unreliable.
I therefore strongly endorse the resolution of this House that expressly calls on the Commission and the Member States to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance amongst animals in a responsible way.
