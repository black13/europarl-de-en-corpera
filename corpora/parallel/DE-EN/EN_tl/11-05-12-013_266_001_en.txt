Antibiotics are naturally occurring metabolic products of fungi or bacteria that are used to counter bacterial infections.
Amongst other uses, they are fed to animals on a preventative basis.
Resistance means the loss of an antibiotic's ability to kill bacteria or inhibit their growth.
In order to prevent this, it is necessary to follow medical instructions.
Resistant animal germs can be passed on to humans, however, and represent a major health risk - the result may even be antibiotic resistance in humans.
It was therefore only right to vote in favour of this report in order to finally promote livestock production that manages without antimicrobial substances.
