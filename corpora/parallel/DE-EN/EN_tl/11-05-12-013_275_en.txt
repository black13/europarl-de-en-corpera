It is doubtful, given the multiplicity of wrong turns taken by the EU, whether information and communications technologies are enough to create a European identity.
Just as unconducive to this European identity is the EU's democratic deficit and the unidirectional understanding of democracy among the Brussels elites, who simply let the populace keep voting until it gives the 'right' result.
When it comes to direct democracy, the European Union could learn much from Switzerland, which stands up for democratic decisions even when the rest of the politically correct mainstream world criticises it to the hilt.
It is doubtful whether, as it is so eloquently put in the report, an 'energetic, growing cultural sector' represents an 'important driver of economic and social innovation'.
Rather, a trend can be perceived whereby migration and migrants are being increasingly placed at the heart of support for culture while native culture and tradition are pushed to one side.
Yet the much-discussed topic of integration must not take the form of doing without Christmas, Easter, St. Nicholas' Day and similar traditions in the name of adaptation to Muslim immigrants in our nurseries and schools - to do so would mean the loss of our cultural identity.
We need to go back to paying more attention to ensuring that our customs, traditions and moral values are upheld, and respected by others.
As this report fails to offer any reversal of the trend, I decided to abstain.
