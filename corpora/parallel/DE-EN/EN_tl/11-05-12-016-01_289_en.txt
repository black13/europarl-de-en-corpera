Mr President, in February, I went to Sri Lanka with the Delegation for Relations with South Asia.
Whilst there, we witnessed the enormous efforts to overcome the consequences of a 25-year civil war.
The European Union, the United Nations and NGOs are providing help, from the clearing of landmines by the HALO Trust through to the resettlement of the Tamils in their former home.
We call on the government there to respond positively to the recommendations of the UN's panel of experts, which highlighted war crimes and crimes against humanity on the parts of both the Sinhalese and the LTTE.
It is encouraging that the government has set up a commission to deal with reconciliation, establish legal jurisdiction, solve language problems and deal with former front-line soldiers.
The consistent willingness to cooperate, the will to integrate minorities and the assurance of maintaining international legal norms form the basis for the development of a country that, without violence and terror, has a real future.
We emphatically call on the EU's High Representative to support efforts of this kind.
