Mr President, in the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Hitler and Stalin laid down their spheres of interest in Central Europe, and the consequences, for the Baltic States, in particular, were devastating.
Just as they did in Belarus, the Soviets soon planned the deportation of the leading sections of society in the Baltic States, and the first mass deportations took place during the night of 13 to 14 June.
Without prior warning and without charge, people were taken from their homes.
In 2002, the Estonian Parliament declared the deportations to be a crime against humanity.
In Estonia, 14 June is a national day of commemoration.
The day is one of remembrance and mourning, but it is also a sign of appreciation of the current democratic and independent Estonia.
In Europe and around the world, 14 June draws attention to the often forgotten suffering of small states and peoples, particularly in the former Soviet Union.
