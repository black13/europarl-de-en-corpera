Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I read the first proposal from the Commission, I was very sceptical about the way it dealt with this matter.
However, what the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and my predecessor, Mrs Joly, have now presented is something that we are able to accept and also support.
In most countries, environmental economic data - whether or not they relate to these three modules - are already collected on a voluntary basis.
We need a clear overview of the results that are achieved in the individual Member States with regard to air emissions, environmental taxes and material flows.
That is very important.
It can give us a better understanding of the relationship between the environment and the economy.
We can also examine how sustainable economic development in Europe is progressing and how we can refine our environmental policy.
That is a very important point that we should include here.
I would like to issue a word of warning, however: in our soapbox speeches, we are always talking about reducing bureaucracy.
I would like to appeal to the Commission not to create additional bureaucracy in this area.
That would be the wrong approach.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission whether it is planning to create new positions within the Commission for the collection of the data, or whether it will manage with its existing staff, because I think it is very important that the collection of this data does not result in new burdens.
Only once we have the first implementation report in 2013 can and should we decide what other modules should be included, because we need to see how this new system develops and what impact it has on legislation.
I was very shocked when I discovered that this was not intended to be debated here in Parliament today.
That would have been a big mistake, because, as the rapporteur said, this is the start of something completely new.
