We have been elected as Members of the European Parliament.
If you only see yourself as a UK parliamentarian, you will perhaps only be able to answer my question from a UK perspective.
With regard to statistics, you talked of Sovietisation.
Is this really how you see it?
Do statistics mean Sovietisation to you?
Are you not in favour of specific figures on living standards and inflation - even if this relates to the control of the banks - being provided by means of statistics, and citizens and decision makers also having access to such information that will then enable appropriate decisions to be taken?
Or, as far as you are concerned, does that also fall within the realm of Sovietisation in the United Kingdom?
