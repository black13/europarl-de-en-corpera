Mr President, when it comes to statistics, there is always a lot of debate and disagreement.
Above all, they must not be decoded, because data protection is also clearly justified.
On the other hand, we need transparency and comparability.
I think that is important.
We therefore need to collect the data in a fully automated manner using random samples, so that they are then comparable.
We are aware of imaging processes, for example, that will also play a major role in this regard in future.
Accordingly, automation of the process will simplify our political decision making in future.
