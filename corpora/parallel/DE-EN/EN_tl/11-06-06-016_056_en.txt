Madam President, if we want to preserve our environment for future generations, we must not consider economic and environmental aspects separately.
It therefore makes sense to supplement economic accounts with environmental factors, and the basis of any sound balance sheet is adequate and reliable data.
However, when the EU calls for key data from the Member States, it should not baulk at sensitive issues.
I am thinking here of nuclear policy, genetic engineering, adequate origin labelling of foodstuffs and, not least, an investigation with regard to the recent EHEC cucumber scandal.
Interactions between the economy and the environment are clearly evident here.
Here, too, it is clear where - unfortunately - the weight lies in the EU, namely with big business and the lobbyists.
