Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not so much about individual people; it is, first and foremost, about a selection process.
Surprisingly, anyone who searches for information on the selection process for the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Internet will essentially only discover that the United States and Europe share the two leading positions.
That means that the economically strongest nations, as a minority, share control of the global economy among themselves, so to speak.
That is feudalism and has nothing to do with democracy, and that is why we cannot accept this.
In our view, Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepping down presents a major opportunity to make fundamental changes at this point to the nomination and selection process and to make it an open, transparent and, above all, merit- and qualification-based selection process, as some NGOs have been calling for recently.
This should also include a combination of majority votes from the members of the IMF and a majority of voting shares in the IMF.
Up to now, only the voting shares in the IMF have been taken into account, which ensures a structural majority for the economically strong nations.
This sort of reform and change to the selection process would correspond to the reform of the IMF, which would also correspond to the changes in global economic relations and would give the developing countries a chance to bring their experience with the IMF to bear in the further development of the IMF.
In closing, I would just like to say that the IMF must be placed under an obligation to work in the interests of reducing global imbalances and poverty.
