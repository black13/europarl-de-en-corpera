Madam President, I think it is important that Mrs Lagarde is appointed to this leading role.
In France, she has proven that she understands the economy, that she also promotes small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, and that she has regard for those who actually work and make a contribution.
It is surely also a principle of the International Monetary Fund to work to improve people's standard of living.
Redistribution is only possible if there is actually something produced to be redistributed.
Therefore, the reform of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is an absolutely priority.
We must ensure that those countries with financial problems receive the necessary instruction and that the appropriate knowledge is passed on with regard to the way that we are trying hard to solve these problems in the European Union.
