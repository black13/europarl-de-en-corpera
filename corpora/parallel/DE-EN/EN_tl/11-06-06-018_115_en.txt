Madam President, the review of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) should be based on the advantages and disadvantages that the projects bring for citizens.
I am thinking, for example, of the INDECT project, which was funded by the FP7.
The intended benefit of combating terrorism has to be weighed against citizens' freedom and data protection.
With any project, we must therefore ask the question: who will profit from it and whose rights will be inadmissibly curtailed?
That also applies to the funding of research in the field of genetic engineering.
The ones who profit from this are the large food manufacturers, the lobbyists, but certainly not our citizens.
Yes, we must invest to a greater extent in research and development, but we also need better evaluation of the projects, which, at the end of day, are funded by taxpayers.
