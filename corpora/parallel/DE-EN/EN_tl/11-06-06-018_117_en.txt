Madam President, the Seventh Framework Programme for research is not just about research in general; it is also about a specific field of research that ought to be of particular concern to all of us following the Fukushima disaster.
It is also about funds from the Euratom programme.
As we all know, it is the nuclear lobby that has succeeded in recent years in promoting nuclear power as a climate-friendly alternative.
It is particularly strong in some EU Member States.
We are also well aware that some Member States have gone in for nuclear power in such a way that it would not be easy for them to switch to alternatives.
What is the use of productive reactors if they buckle under water masses or in the event of earthquakes?
What is the use of the most productive nuclear power station if a minor fault is enough to make not only the immediate surroundings, but the whole region uninhabitable for decades?
It is therefore important for us to focus more strongly on nuclear safety and to push ahead with the development of alternatives.
Now that the Euratom research programme is shortly to be extended to 2012 and 2013, Fukushima ought to be taken as an opportunity for a rethink.
