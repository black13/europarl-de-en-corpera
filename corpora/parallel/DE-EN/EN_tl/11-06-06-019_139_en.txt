(The speaker directs a blue-card question to Mr Fjellner under Rule 149(8))
Mr Fjellner has represented all this in a very positive light and he said that we should not allow this process to drag on.
In this context, my question is this: How can he have a positive view of the fact that in Canada, an area one eighth of the size of Austria is destroyed each year in connection with the exploitation of these tar sands and the entire livelihoods of the First Nations communities are being taken away?
Does he really view this in such an incredibly positive light and is it not also part of Europe's responsibility to impose appropriate conditions in this regard?
