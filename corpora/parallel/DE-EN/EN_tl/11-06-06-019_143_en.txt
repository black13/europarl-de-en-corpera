Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations with Canada are being conducted with a country that has a strong economy and a highly developed legal system.
It is therefore all the more incomprehensible that the Commission wants to integrate, if not conceal, an investment agreement in this agreement to give undertakings a direct right to take legal action before a special arbitration court.
Why ever should an ordinary court not decide on compensation in cases of doubt?
Which courts do you, as the Commission, not have any trust in whatsoever?
Is it the Canadian courts or those in the European Union?
Do you not see that, with this part of the agreement, you would be discriminating against the local undertakings?
As has already been mentioned by a few Members, my group is also strongly opposed to the Commission's approach of using the agreement to force the liberalisation of services by means of a 'negative list'.
This turns on its head the approach that has been taken up to now where the contracting partners define the areas that they actively want to open.
We want to retain public services.
I would also ask the Commission to provide an explanation for its rejection of Canada's social and employment policy proposals, which ought to be seen in a positive light for the sustainability chapter.
The European Parliament is also calling for the protection of workers, payment of overtime, minimum wages and rejection of social dumping.
