Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I had actually intended to address several points in my speech.
I am not going to do that now as I would like to say something else.
I simply do not understand the Commission.
It is supposed to be the guardian of European law, including the legislation that we have adopted, but when it comes to the trade agreement with Canada, it says that it is important that some people make a lot of money, but it is not important for European law to remain law.
I do not understand how the Commission can say that we do not need to discuss the import ban on seal products in connection with these matters.
We are talking about partners here and partners have mutual respect for each other's values, views and interests and do not haul the other partner before a WTO court on account of that partner's values.
As far as I am concerned, that is not what trading partners are about.
It is evident that if there is no mutual respect and the parties do not share each other's views, then these parties will not be able to work well together in the area of trade.
If Canada does not stop its action against the import ban on seal products before the conclusion of this kind of agreement, then, in my opinion, we should not agree to this trade agreement.
As I said, good partners do not haul each other before WTO courts on account of their convictions.
Good partners work together.
