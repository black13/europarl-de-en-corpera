Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on conducting these negotiations so intensively.
At the end of the day, this is about trade relations, and I believe that environmental and social issues clearly also need to be regulated in separate agreements.
Kyoto is a good example of this, where the intention was to improve standards at an international level.
Therefore, we should be specific in our negotiations here.
Just as energy policy and the generation of energy is a matter for the Member States in Europe, we must also concede that it should be the Canadians and Canadian democracy that decide how energy is produced there and what environmental impact is ultimately to be taken into account.
We ought to strive to ensure that a research programme is set up in this regard to help to enable these resources to be used in a way that is as environmentally friendly and sustainable as possible.
Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, perhaps you could provide some impetus here to get a tar sands research programme put in place alongside this trade agreement.
