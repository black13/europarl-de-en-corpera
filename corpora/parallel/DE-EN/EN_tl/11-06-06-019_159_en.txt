Madam President, Canada is - I would like to say this at the outset - a wonderful country.
Wonderful people, wonderful achievements - an important partner for the EU.
However, we must be able to ask questions of a good partner.
Many fellow Members are wrong to simply reduce this matter to sand and seals today.
The tar sands represent just one example of incredible environmental destruction.
Anyone who has seen Canada knows that environmental destruction is taking place there on a scale to match Brazil.
This environmental destruction also has an impact on the indigenous people, the First Nations.
Their environment is being destroyed.
Anyone who knows a bit about Canada, has visited British Columbia and knows how international corporations have used their influence here to make the indigenous peoples give up their ancestral areas and allow these areas to be bought up, cannot simply ignore this.
We talk a great deal about clear language and about protection of minorities in countries adjacent to the EU.
However, it is also important for us to speak out with regard to the protection of the minorities that are the aboriginal peoples of Canada.
