The European Union and Canada have had good, solid trade relations for many years.
Canada is even one of the EU's oldest trading partners.
In the mid-1970s, the EU signed the first economic and trade agreement with Canada.
Further agreements followed in the livestock sector and with regard to wines and spirits.
The EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA) could be very advantageous for both trading partners.
However, there are still a few things that need to be taken into consideration and discussed.
Clearly, the aim of the agreement must be fair competition.
This can only be achieved if not only the tariff barriers but also the non-tariff and technical barriers to trade are removed.
The principle of reciprocity must be respected, because that is the only way to achieve a balanced outcome of the negotiations.
That also applies to elements that are specific to the country or culture of the individual partners.
Discussions of tricky subjects like extraction from tar sands and the associated environmental impact, ILO standards, as well as the recognition of technical standards and the traceability of food products, must also continue on equal terms in order to reach a consensus.
Of particular interest to me are the negotiations in the dairy sector and access to the Canadian market as well as origin labelling of Canadian slaughter cattle.
Can the Commission provide more information in these areas?
What outcome can we expect in this regard?
