Madam President, I would like to make a few comments with regard to the European integration of Serbia, if I may.
For far too long, the former Yugoslavian states have, in my opinion, received unequal treatment.
For example, Slovenia was able to join the EU without a problem in 2004, even though criticisms are still made regarding the residual Communist power structures in politics, the media and industry.
Moreover, Bulgaria and Romania would not be in the Union if we had applied the same stringent criteria to them that we are now applying to Croatia.
Double standards are also applied with regard to war crimes and restitution.
Brussels could not care less about Turkey's Armenian genocide.
In contrast, Croatia and Serbia must first haul their war criminals before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague before the Copenhagen criteria can even come into play.
While the unlawful regulations of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) and Beneš do not constitute grounds for blocking EU accession, the Serbian restitution policy certainly has to comply with EU stipulations.
Serbia, which is characterised by a Christian tradition, has proven its good intentions again and again.
One barrier has been broken down with the extradition of Mladič, but Kosovo must not become the next one.
As soon as the outstanding reforms are complete, there should, in my view, be nothing more to stand in the way of Serbia's accession to the EU.
