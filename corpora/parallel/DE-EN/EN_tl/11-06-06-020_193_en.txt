Madam President, whistleblowers are people who no longer wish to keep quiet about illegal acts or deplorable states of affairs, but want to expose them, mostly in the public interest.
Whistleblowers are also mostly providing added value.
For example, in 2005, they returned a total of around USD 10 billion to the US Treasury through repayments.
Clear laws relating to the process of whistleblowing are essential in the fight against corruption.
In the European Union, Articles 22a and 22b of the Staff Regulations form the legal basis for whistleblowing, but unfortunately in a very fragmented way, leaving many gaps.
Fundamental elements are missing.
For example, we need a clear definition of whistleblowing, we need whistleblowers to have a right to be heard, we need independent points of contact that can provide information on rights, obligations and options, and not least we also need precise handling deadlines for the competent EU institutions.
The positive aspect here is that the EU Staff Regulations are about to be reformed.
The Commission is to send Parliament a first draft of this in the autumn.
I think this presents a unique opportunity to make improvements here.
I would ask my fellow Members to support this and to work to bring about a reform.
