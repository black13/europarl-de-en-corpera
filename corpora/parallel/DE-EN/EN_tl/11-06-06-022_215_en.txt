Thank you, Mrs Niebler.
The problem gradually became clear to me, too.
We have a minor Internet problem.
I do not have the correct list of speakers, either.
The display board is also still showing the Klinz report.
That is presumably why some Members were a little irritated.
Thus, we are now debating the report by Mrs Niebler on guaranteeing independent impact assessments.
