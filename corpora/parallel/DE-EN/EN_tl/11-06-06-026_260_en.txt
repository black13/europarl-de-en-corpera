I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training and would like to emphasise how important it is to promote lifelong learning through initiatives and Europe-wide programmes in order to make it possible for workers to have a better future.
These days, workers are at the mercy of frequent and risky employment transitions.
There are many types of transition: from training, redundancy, internships or precarious employment into full-time employment.
The report contains some important points, including increasing the quota of women in work, recognition of informal learning and promotion of languages with the goal of providing mobility programmes.
I am particularly pleased that the focus has been placed on education and training for young people, which is something that I will actively support in the flagship initiatives that follow.
The transition from educational institution to working life must be as smooth as possible and, in particular, tailored to individual needs, because it must also be possible for young people with inadequate training to gain the skills necessary to be able to work in skilled jobs and to earn a good living.
Social background must not determine a person's educational opportunities.
Young people must be given help and support in securing entry to the world of work.
However, the cost of a modern labour market policy must not be borne by our workers.
