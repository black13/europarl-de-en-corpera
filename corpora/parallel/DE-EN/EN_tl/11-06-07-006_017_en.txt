Mr President, the EHEC epidemic is making apparent the flaws in the system of industrial food production in the liberalised Internal Market of the EU.
When profits take priority over the protection of health, then food quality and food safety suffers.
So far, at least 22 people have died in Germany as a result of the EHEC pathogen and there have been more than 1 500 cases of infection.
In more than 600 patients, the dangerous haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was diagnosed, which can also result in neurological disorders.
After more than two weeks, the source of this life-threatening epidemic is still unclear.
If we had regional production of foodstuffs, it would be easier to determine the source of infection and the effects of the epidemic would be more limited.
As a result of the long transport routes and the anonymous production conditions, it is very difficult to trace the origin of the food.
However, traceability with regard to the origin of the food is essential when it comes to food safety.
Consumers have a right to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from.
The Federal Government in Germany completely failed in connection with the EHEC epidemic.
In the confusion between regional and federal competences, management of the crisis fell by the wayside.
The monitoring authorities were not prepared for this situation.
We need a radical rethink in agricultural policy.
Our food must be safe.
However, agricultural producers should also be protected against incalculable financial risks.
The policy for promoting agriculture and rural areas must consistently aim at a clear decentralisation of the food production and marketing structures.
