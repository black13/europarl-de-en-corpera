Mr President, EHEC is not a new problem, but it is clear that Europe is still inadequately prepared for a crisis like this.
It takes too long for clear guidelines to be issued.
Three weeks is definitely too long.
Consumer protection, we are all agreed, always takes absolute priority over financial interests.
However, it needs to be made clear who is to issue a warning and when, who is subsequently to take over responsibility for the warnings, and when the European Commission is to get involved.
In Germany, the responsibility lies with 16 federal states and two ministries, which is too finely distributed for a European crisis.
Europe must be involved here at an earlier stage.
I do not believe that we have learnt the right lessons from the crises of the 1990s.
That is something that we now need to rectify as a matter of urgency.
When it comes to food, we need transparency and clear traceability with regard to manufacture.
We need clear country of origin labelling.
However, we also need a European reaction force to coordinate the scientific and medical work and to establish control plans.
(Applause)
