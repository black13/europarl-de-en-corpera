Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, farmers can be compensated, but human life cannot be recovered.
Indeed, our sympathy goes out to all those who have died or are lying in a hospital bed.
This situation is dramatic and it is also unacceptable.
It is unacceptable that three weeks after the outbreak of this crisis, we still do not know exactly where the pathogen that caused the crisis originated.
That really should not happen in Europe.
There are several lessons we need to learn from this.
Firstly, we need to look for the source and examine whether improper practices are still present in the food production sector or in the food supply chain.
We have legislation that has been in place for 20 years, and the standards and codes of practices in the European Union are quite stringent, but it is clear that we are still vulnerable when it comes to foodstuffs.
There still seem to be gaps and shortcomings and we need to learn from this once again.
I also think that the communication on this matter has been chaotic.
Facts about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way.
We clearly need more Europe.
That has already been said by other Members here.
When any regional or national authority issues a warning for the whole of Europe, it can only be a disaster.
In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public.
