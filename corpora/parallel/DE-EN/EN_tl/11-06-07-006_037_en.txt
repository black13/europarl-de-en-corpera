Mr President, Commissioner, I come from the region of Europe where the outbreak of the EHEC pathogen is at its raging worst.
This aggressive bacteria seems unstoppable.
Between mid-May and noon yesterday, 1 733 people were infected, while 23 patients died a torturous death.
The situation in the clinics is extremely fraught.
Intensive care beds are running out, and blood plasma is needed urgently.
No end is in sight.
The people of my home area fear new cases every day.
For me, it is a question of courage and a sense of responsibility to warn about every even potential carrier of this bacterium.
Various foodstuffs have been analysed, but it has not been found.
My understanding of high grade foodstuffs is that they are healthy and that they are placed on the market subject to monitoring.
I am presuming that glaring errors have been made in this regard, and once again, we are finding out that there are loopholes.
However, to claim, in this situation, that the cause is known, without having well-founded laboratory research to back it up, is negligent in the extreme.
In all the understandable panic, there must not, under any circumstances, be a witch-hunt, as that would drive many hard-working farmers throughout Europe to the wall.
It therefore needs to be clear to everyone that we in the European Union need to show solidarity with one another and stand ready to provide mutual assistance in the event of emergencies.
In other words, all the medical experts must sit down together, and economic assistance needs to be provided to those who innocently find themselves facing financial disaster.
