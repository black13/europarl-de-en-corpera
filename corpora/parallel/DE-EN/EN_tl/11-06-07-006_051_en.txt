Mr President, EHEC is the term of the last week.
First of all, our sympathy, clearly, goes to the victims.
In the interests of public health, the authorities have the obligation to provide them with information.
The well-being of the people must come first.
In the United States, they have an early-warning system to that end.
The fact is that there have been over 2 000 infections and more than 20 people have died.
People have to be told where this bacterium is.
It was on Spanish cucumbers, where it certainly should not have been, as a faecal bacterium has absolutely no place on a foodstuff.
When it comes to economic compensation, those responsible must pay, certainly not everyone else.
Finally, I would like to observe that the Council was absent for the whole of the debate on this issue.
