Mr President, Mr Kohlíček, it could be that I have misunderstood you.
There is something that I would like to clear up.
It is relatively clear, after all, that this is a tame compromise, that heavy goods vehicles will continue to hold the advantage on the roads, and that the charging level overall is far too low.
However, you did start by saying that this directive could now potentially lead to a level playing field between road and rail transport.
I do not believe that such a level playing field will result.
It could be that I have misunderstood you in this regard.
I would ask you to clarify this.
