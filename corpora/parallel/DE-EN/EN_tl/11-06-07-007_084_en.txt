Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the White Paper, Commissioner Kallas sets out various possibilities for the future of transport.
For instance, he describes how there is a need for incentive systems in order to give transport a more environmentally friendly form, and he also states that new sources of funding are needed, including, for example, in order to be able to work according to the 'polluter pays' principle.
The Eurovignette Directive that we are debating today is one way that both of these points really can be achieved.
This was a major Belgian effort, I believe we can say, begun under the Belgian Presidency of the Council with three important Belgians involved and, above all, because of the rapporteur, who succeeded in opening a door to the new routes.
As it happens, I would have wished Belgium's major effort greater success than what we now have.
What we actually managed to achieve is a small and weak compromise.
Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent - 15% of infrastructure costs and 15% of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks - it is really far too little.
All national transport policy representatives say that we need considerable resources in order to be able to sustain our infrastructure networks.
It is self-evident that the resources collected in this area should also be able to be invested there.
That is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfied.
The fact is that, in this connection, we have nonetheless taken a step in a direction in which we will be able to move further at a later date.
That is also the reason why we intend to vote in favour of this compromise.
It was a tough struggle, though.
It very definitely could have been the case that we ended up with nothing at all on the table, since a few Member States would have preferred to have nothing at all.
This is therefore a success, and it will have our backing in the vote today.
(Applause)
