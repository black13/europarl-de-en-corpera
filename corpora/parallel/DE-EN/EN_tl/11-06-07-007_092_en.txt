Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, transport in Europe is too cheap.
Only environmentally friendly transport is too expensive.
All of this is brought about by policy choices, and this directive will not change that.
We have unfair competition.
The tax privileges that heavy goods vehicles enjoy are not being curtailed.
Every lorry causes 60 000 times as much damage as a car but, of course, it is not charged 60 000 times as much.
We have had a mandatory rail toll within the European Union for decades.
Every locomotive - whether it transports passengers or goods - must pay a rail toll for every kilometre it travels.
On the roads, the toll is voluntary.
It is capped.
It mostly applies only on motorways and only to vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more.
On the railways, there is no limit.
That is unfair, and it hinders the environmentally friendly railways while relieving the environmentally unfriendly roads.
We know that we need a change in mobility in order to protect the climate.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance want to protect the climate and secure mobility for the future, and that is why we need fair competition.
This Eurovignette is only a tiny step forward towards that goal.
