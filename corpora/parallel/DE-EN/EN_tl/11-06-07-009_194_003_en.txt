In times of increasing globalisation in which the volume of traffic is also rising massively, it is exactly those Member States with sensitive regions such as in the area crossing the Alps that have an interest in charging road users for certain external costs according to the 'polluter pays' principle.
At the same time, this should also give rise to an instrument to better manage traffic demand.
This report takes a pragmatic approach in order to reconcile the numerous and varying wishes.
In this context, however, we must not overlook the various initiatives to pave the way for so-called giga- or megaliners, which are associated with high infrastructure costs.
It is also the case that, hitherto, lip service alone has been paid to moving freight traffic from road to rail.
We should also not forget these factors, including when it comes to the idea in the proposal of earmarking the revenue from infrastructure charges.
As far as the incentives for fleet renewal are concerned, we must also consider that we must not unilaterally burden our local carriers and fleet-owners with strict environmental and safety regulations, only for the low-cost competitors to come riding over the border in foul scrap vehicles.
However, since this report makes very reasonable arguments in this regard, I voted in favour.
