Mr President, allow me to begin with a smile as I congratulate all the Members for having survived the fire alarm and managing to take our places, safe and sound, back in the Chamber.
As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it.
We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news.
We are all aware that it is a joint European challenge facing us to find an answer to this drama and this misery for refugees.
On behalf of the PPE Group, I would like to ask the President of the Commission to give us an appraisal of whether the Commission - and, above all, Frontex - has enough resources, whether we, the European Union, have enough capabilities to respond on the ground, and whether we have enough statutory bases to enable Europe to act together in the Mediterranean region.
I would also be interested to hear what form the discussions with the countries of origin (Tunisia and Egypt, for example) take and whether we Europeans are making headway in this area.
