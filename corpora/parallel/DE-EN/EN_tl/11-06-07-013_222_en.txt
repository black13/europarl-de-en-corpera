Mr President, my thanks for your assessments of the situation.
Given that you state that we currently need more resources for Frontex, I would be interested to hear whether you are not also of the opinion that the Member States have hitherto been too unwilling to provide the resources to make Frontex strong.
We did have the toolbox already.
Was it the case that there was too little willingness on the part of the Member States to support Frontex accordingly?
