Mr Barroso, I have just one brief question.
I am pleased that the G8 summit and the e-G8 forum that preceded it discussed the Internet.
There are also concerns about why those with power are concerning themselves with the Internet.
We are aware of how sensitive this area is.
Is there any more you can tell us in this connection?
Is this a one-off, or will there be further discussion?
Will you be putting this on the agenda again?
