Mr President, my apologies for the delay in my arrival.
I waited until the end as a result.
Mr Barroso, I have a question to ask you that relates to the grave situation in which we, in the European Union, find ourselves.
2008 was the year of a deep crisis in banking.
In 2009, this banking crisis led to a deep economic crisis in the real economy.
The assumption of the costs of banking deficits by the public purses ultimately led, in 2010, to a deep crisis in national budgets.
This deep crisis of the national budgets is being accompanied by an orgy of cuts, which is leading to dramatic situations in several Member States of the European Union, in part as a result of measures demanded by the European Union.
There is a risk that, following the banking crisis, the economic crisis and the crisis in the national budgets, 2011 and 2012 will be the years of social crisis in Europe.
I would therefore ask you, Mr Barroso, is the Commission prepared to discuss with us how we can improve the underfunding of the social welfare net - social security systems - in the Member States of the European Union, in particular, in those Member States hardest hit by the budgetary crisis?
Moreover, are you prepared to have a definitive discussion with us about Eurobonds in order to obtain the resources that we need to be able to invest in the economy to facilitate growth and jobs in the hardest hit Member States?
