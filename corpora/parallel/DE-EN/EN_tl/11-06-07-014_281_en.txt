Madam President, we all look at this region of the world with great concern and we are well aware that the risk of a civil war is far from banished.
The ultimate fragility of the peace process that has been set in motion is demonstrated by current events in Abyei.
The conflict that has broken out is dramatic.
The Northern army has occupied Abyei and 15 000 people have taken flight.
I believe that we, the European Union, must help in a very tangible way as we did before and that this must take the form of getting food and humanitarian aid for the refugees moving as soon as possible and preparing the emergency humanitarian aid for the refugees.
Even without this escalation of the conflict, in South Sudan, over 40% of the population are already dependent on food aid.
South Sudan will be one of the poorest countries on earth, and if we want the Millennium Development Goals to also take effect here, it is urgently necessary that the funding made available by the Council - EUR 200 million - should actually be spent on food security, education and health in this part of the world.
My group advocates the immediate withdrawal of the armed units of the North and the South from Abyei, adherence to the comprehensive peace agreement and recognition of the demilitarised zone.
With a view to the extension of the UN mandate, which has been discussed, we are calling for the risks and problems, such as those that came to light in connection with the MONUC mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to be taken into account and evaluated.
We are disappointed that no really strong call for debt cancellation and for an examination of foreign debts made it into this resolution.
I find that regrettable.
