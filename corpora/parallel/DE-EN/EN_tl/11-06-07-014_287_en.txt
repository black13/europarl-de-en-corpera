Madam President, in February, many people, including in this House, were full of both hope and concern about the future of Sudan.
There were differing views on the continuing risk of violent clashes.
It was clear that the people of Sudan faced major problems and need support.
Now, the situation in Sudan is making the headlines again.
The cause of the most recent events is the unresolved issues linked to the forthcoming independence of the South, and these problems cannot be resolved through guns.
I therefore welcome the recent agreement between the North and South Sudan, brokered by the African Union, on a demilitarised zone along the future border between the two states.
A 7 000 strong UN force modelled on MONUC could cause more harm than good, however.
If we just look at the Congo, we can see what MONUC troops can get up to.
Aid for Sudan must be impartial and not tied to any one interest group.
It must put the interests of the people of the South and of the North at its heart, and this applies to both material and diplomatic aid.
In order to prevent further fuelling of the conflict, all supplying of weapons must be halted.
We are calling for an end to all civil/military collaboration and to the military training mission.
