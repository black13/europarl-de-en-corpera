Madam President, the Northern army forced out 15 000 supporters of South Sudan from the city, and then suddenly, they definitely want to hold a referendum in Abyei in double-quick time in the shadow of an army, when previously they had been unable to even agree with the South about who was entitled to vote.
This is a truly grotesque undertaking.
It is not only the differing views on property and belonging that made Abyei the bone of contention of a civil war that lasted for decades; there are also the differing religions, namely the Muslim North versus the Christian and nature-based religions of the South Sudanese, who were forced together by the haphazard borders drawn up by the former colonial powers.
When considering the most recent escalations, this should not be forgotten.
It would never have been possible to push the referendum through while the status of the voters of Abyei remained unresolved.
Similarly, we must not forget the equally disputed regions of Blue Nile and South Kordofan with the Nuba mountains.
In my opinion, to do so would be gross negligence and it must not be allowed to happen.
