Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Bulgaria and Romania were included in the full application of the Schengen acquis.
Think about it - the abolition of controls on the internal borders and the creation of freedom of movement are some of the most important achievements and values of the European Union.
For that reason, I find the blocking tactics of a number of Member States - including my home country of Germany - totally incomprehensible.
The arguments used concern the fear of uncontrollable floods of refugees and how corruption must be countered.
Given the opinions that have been presented, I cannot understand these arguments.
A dangerous game is being played with Bulgaria and Romania here.
For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen.
Like the other Members on the Committee, we were extremely alienated by the Council's impossible behaviour towards Parliament and by how, at the beginning, it even refused to allow us to review the documents.
Overall, the opinion on the table is a positive one.
We expect that Schengen area accession will become a reality and that we will not have to wait until September.
To close, I would like to quote the Bucharest-based journalist, Sabina Fati.
She stated, 'The Romanians are euphoric citizens.
They look upon Western Europe as a place whose standards they absolutely want to achieve.
To turn your backs on them now could lead many of them to become eurosceptics'.
That is not something that we want in either Romania or Bulgaria.
