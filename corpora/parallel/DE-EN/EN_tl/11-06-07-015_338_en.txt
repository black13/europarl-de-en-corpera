Mr President, Mrs Gy≈ëri, Commissioner, we are all aware that both of these countries - Romania and Bulgaria - have invested a great deal in securing the external borders of the European Union.
They meet the Schengen standards.
Objective reviews have all come to the same conclusion, namely, that the prerequisites for accession to the Schengen area have been met.
Our rapporteur also performed a review on the ground.
He carried out an objective evaluation and reached the same conclusion.
That is why we will not only be voting in favour of the report but we will also be giving our consent for both these countries to join the Schengen area.
The Schengen area is also an area of confidence, however.
That means that not everything is completed with a single, one-off action but that confidence must be built over the long run; investment in security must be ensured over the long term.
The same applies to all States, I would point out, and not just to Romania and Bulgaria.
I hope that this confidence remains secure over the long term so that we are able to maintain this freedom of travel, this freedom of movement within the European Union as a major public good over the long term.
I am distressed by something that I heard today, however, although it is something that I am unable to verify, namely, that police wages in Romania are to be cut by around a third.
We all know that it is a prerequisite for incorruptibility, for reputable work by the police, that they must be well paid.
I therefore hope that my information is inaccurate and that the police, who are performing a service in the interests of these countries and of the security of the entire European Union, will continue to be well paid in the future, too, so that they are not susceptible to bribery.
