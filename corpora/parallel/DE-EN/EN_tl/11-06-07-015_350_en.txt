Mr President, Commissioner, the Schengen Agreement, as we know, must not promote mass immigration into the social systems and the freedom of travel must not lead to an increase in crime and illegal immigration.
The fight against organised crime and the improvement of border protection must finally be more valued in the European Union.
If Italy and its border police's security system reportedly lags far behind the ordinary Schengen standard, it is to be feared that newcomers like Romania and Bulgaria could soon also slacken in their efforts.
The overhasty accession to Schengen for these countries should therefore be rejected, as the main beneficiaries of this could be organised crime from eastern Europe and even from the Caucasus region.
I believe that, in combating asylum problems, Denmark has set itself up as a trailblazer for EU-wide rules.
That is probably why the Commission has reacted so strongly to the announcement of stronger border controls to fight rising criminality.
We should make clear that, although Schengen requires open internal borders, that is only the case where the external borders are truly secure.
