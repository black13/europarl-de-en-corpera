If you believe this report, everything is shipshape and Bristol fashion and Romania and Bulgaria have demonstrated that they are sufficiently prepared to implement all of the Schengen rules.
However, those of us who are familiar with the Europol report OCTA 2011 on the subject of organised crime will be asking ourselves whether the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is deaf and blind, and why on earth we indulge ourselves in Europol at all if we simply ignore its warnings.
Europol reports that Romania and Bulgaria are transit routes for drug smuggling, gun running and human trafficking.
Organised criminal gangs, increasingly multi-ethnic, act with extreme violence.
Many have a paramilitary background.
These groups, and I quote verbatim from the Europol report 'are seeking to expand their interests in the EU, and may exploit opportunities in the possible accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Zone'.
Europol Director, Rob Wainwright, stated in an interview that 'The possible accession into Schengen of Bulgaria and Romania and visa liberalisation for Ukraine - one would see these as potential new opportunities for organised crime'.
We have a duty to our citizens to take Europol's warnings seriously.
The Schengen Agreement is already opening all the doors to Europe to organised crime and illegal immigration.
It therefore needs urgent repair before it is extended.
