Many thanks, Commissioner, for a very good answer.
I just wanted to ask whether you think it is possible that this mission could still make it to Kosovo this year, or is that something that you really could not judge?
Would it not be important that a country so small that we are pouring funding and effort into supporting it could also give its young people the opportunity to really get to know Europe?
It is certainly completely counterproductive to 'imprison' the populace there.
I know that you sympathise with the idea of opening up borders, but do you regard it as realistic that this mission could perhaps still take place during the Polish Presidency?
