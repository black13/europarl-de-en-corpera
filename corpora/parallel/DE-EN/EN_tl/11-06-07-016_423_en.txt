Commissioner, please do not be angry, but let us get serious.
I would like to read my question to you.
It is as follows: is the Commission prepared to reallocate at least 10% of the EUR 51 billion currently available each year to fast-start funding for new electricity networks for renewable energy?
You have now had quite a lot to tell us, all of it correct.
It is just that none of it is what is at issue.
What is at issue is sending out a signal and saying, yes, we have understood.
Yes, we are drawing the conclusions from Fukushima.
Yes, we really are serious about 2020.
To push forward energy change, we need to bring the electricity from northern Germany to Austria.
My father was head of Voralberger Kraftwerke, the power generating company for the Austrian Province of Voralberg.
I am sure you have experience in this area.
You need power lines to do this.
Once again, my question is, are you personally prepared to really get this fast-start funding specifically, which everyone is saying that we urgently need, off the ground and not merely implement what your predecessors decided?
