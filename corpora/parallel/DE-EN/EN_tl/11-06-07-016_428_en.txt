Mrs Jensen, it is our stated goal in the next programme period to thematically tie in structural policy - insofar as it is affected, in any case - with the Europe 2020 strategy.
In this area, there are thus key objectives and priorities that are to be applied in the course of a tailored adaptation in the regions.
It will then be the job of the regions to select a few priorities for themselves as if from a menu, in particular, when it comes to competitive regions.
The regions will then set and agree very realistic but also ambitious and quantifiable targets together with us in the Commission in a partnership and investment agreement so that, at the end of the period, we will be clearly able to see whether or not the objectives agreed between us have been achieved or perhaps even exceeded.
If it turned out that they had not been achieved, we would then have the possibility of together examining the causes of non-compliance and whether it was due to domestic or external factors.
Building on that, we could then draw conclusions for future programme planning and the financial allocation in the subsequent period.
This represents a very material, very qualitative development of regional policy over the forthcoming financial period.
