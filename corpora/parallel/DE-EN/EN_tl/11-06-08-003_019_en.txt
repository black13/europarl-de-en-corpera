Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo, you will understand that the Left has particularly high expectations in relation to the social alignment of the EU and is therefore a little disappointed that your report does not give greater priority to social aspects for the coming years.
I am sure that the preservation and development of the European model of the social state and the European solidarity principle will be of enormous importance in times of crisis and economic cut-backs.
Both of these are significant European cultural achievements and I believe that giving these up could signal the end of the European social integration process.
Of course you have enumerated many important challenges, some of which go beyond the Europe 2020 strategy.
However, I do not believe that the proposed tentative increase of 5% will be enough to meet these challenges.
As Parliament, we should state clearly that we intend providing particular support for a social Europe.
Other elements, such as ERD, FRONTEX and ITER may need to wait a little longer.
I believe it is wrong to invite the Council to set negative priorities, in other words, cuts.
At the same time, we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own-resources system.
In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand.
This is not just a useful financial instrument, but also offers greater transparency in relation to how the EU is financed.
Naturally, this involves an important part of financial market regulation.
I also believe that we need to do away with the British rebate and ensure that unused EU resources are returned to the EU budget.
