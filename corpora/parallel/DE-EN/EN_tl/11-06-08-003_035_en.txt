Mr President, I am happy to deal with this question.
The fact is that I am not just a member of the Christian Democratic Union, but have also been Vice-Chair of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein for 13 years.
Before this committee expressed its view, the CDU/CSU Members of the European Parliament agreed a position.
The statement on own resources agreed by the CDU/CSU Members of the European Parliament, which, to a certain extent, contradicts the party's national position, is completely at one with the findings of the Policy Changes Committee.
I stand by this, also in my capacity as a CDU politician in Germany.
