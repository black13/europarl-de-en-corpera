Mr van Dalen, I believe that you are making a serious political error.
If we in Europe fall back into a pattern of following political national self-interest, then we risk destroying 50 years of work on the European project.
What we do here is not a waste of money.
We must take decisive action against any corruption and financial scandals as they arise.
Naturally, we are on your side on this issue.
However, when it comes to generating European added value, as we have done in many areas, we need to work together to develop this because, when they go it alone, the national states are weaker in the face of international competition.
You will not achieve good results with 27 national states acting unilaterally, but only by pooling forces.
This was recognised by the founding states after the Second World War.
We should work on developing this, not destroying it.
