Mr President, I was born into the European Union in 1975 and it has shaped my political life ever since.
That is why it pains me all the more to have to pour cold water on this matter.
When there is talk of increases, then discussions must lead to a consideration of the correct use of resources.
Although the report is ambitious in seeking to find the greatest possible majority support from the House, I believe it lacks ambition in the objectives and aims it seeks to achieve in its current form.
The agricultural and structural budgets are left untouched.
However, more money is being sought for research and development.
The only response that occurs to the House and to the report is more money, although there is no clear indication where this money is to come from.
We hear talk of the Union's 'own resources', but there has been no definition of what these resources actually are.
If people were serious about wanting structural reforms, they could have taken up the suggestion made by David Cameron, for example, of going to the Council and saying: funding is to be frozen, but we demand that unused resources should be able to be carried over to the next financial year, so that we can continue to spend them on viable projects and to save money.
The future viability of the EU should not be measured in terms of decimal places.
To this extent, I am more than a little disappointed by the present report.
