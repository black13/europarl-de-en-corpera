Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are five questions we need to ask ourselves:
The first is: what budget is required for the 2020 growth and employment strategy?
Secondly: what budget is required by a currency union?
Thirdly: what potential is open to us to make savings?
Fourthly: what budget is required by the United States of Europe?
Fifthly: what role is Europe 2020 to play?
Do we want to play a role at all?
We, the European Parliament, take our responsibilities seriously.
We deal in plain speaking.
In Austria, we have a saying: if you do not pay up, the band does not play.
We want to achieve our goals, meet our obligations, accept the challenges and keep our promises.
More functions, greater competitiveness, more sustainable growth, more jobs, more research and further integration cannot be achieved with less money, without a financial review, without an evaluation of existing disbursement of funds and without our own resources.
More Europe will also create a potential for savings in the Member States.
More Europe will also create more efficiency and is our response to globalisation, to the future and to sovereign debt.
What is it that we want?
We do not want to freeze the budget.
Anyone seeking to freeze the budget will damage Europe and weaken our ability to fulfil our duties to our citizens.
We want to introduce a transaction levy as a resource of our own, accepting the challenges and adhering to the Treaty rather than burying our heads in the sand.
That is our strategy.
Let us really set the ball rolling and vote in favour of this report.
