Mr President, Mr Pieper, I am surprised to hear you say that Mrs Krehl must be dreaming.
A large majority voted in favour of the intermediate goal when the vote was held in the Committee on Regional Development.
I believe that we will get the backing of the majority here, too, because there is majority support for the solidarity of the regions.
That is why we need this intermediate goal.
I should be interested to know why you refer to this majority as a dream.
