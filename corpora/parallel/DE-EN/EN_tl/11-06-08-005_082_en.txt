Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, this is your perception of the issue.
We in the Committee on Regional Development have a different proposal from the one contained in the Garriga Polledo report.
That is my first point.
My second point is that significant fundamental resistance to the intermediate category still exists within the political groupings.
You are well aware of this.
That is why I find your question surprising.
I think that you are dreaming when you simply claim that we have come up with compromises and that these are unambiguous.
Anyway, it is a matter for the Committee on Regional Development to prepare the matter for debate in plenary.
I am very surprised by your extremely optimistic view that our work is complete.
