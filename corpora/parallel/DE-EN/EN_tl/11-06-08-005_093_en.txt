Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the Staff Regulations is to be presented together with the MFF package.
This question of how the EU is actually administered is dealt with very succinctly in paragraphs 125 and 126 of the Garriga Polledo report.
Commissioner, I would ask you to be ambitious when presenting the Staff Regulations.
After all, the question of what we do, which has been discussed in detail here, is at least as important as the question of how we do it.
The question is what role will the European Commission play in future when implementing all the points in the 2020 programme we have presented today.
I would like to see the Commission choose a stronger role for itself, rather than delegating all the tasks to others.
That is why it is important, in the context of the Staff Regulations reform, that vacancies should be created for these new tasks, so that the Commission itself can also get involved.
We have an enormous number of free days.
The Commission's officials have up to 13 weeks paid leave.
Commissioner, I would suggest that you take some of these free days and reallocate them to the implementation of the budget, so that we can actually achieve the political goals we want to achieve.
I would ask that we should also be provided with an EU 2020 strategy for the administration of the EU.
This would require action not only from you, but also from the entire college and the President of the Commission.
