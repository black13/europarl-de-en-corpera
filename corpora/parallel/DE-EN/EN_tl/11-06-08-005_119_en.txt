Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors find themselves not just paying the EU budget through the huge redistribution mechanism, but actually paying two and three times over.
In future years, real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees.
This will have to be financed by the net contributors, in other words, the hard-working German, French, Italian, Dutch and Austrian citizens, from their national budgets; the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries.
The people in the economically strong EU countries are angry - at least every bit as angry as the demonstrators in Athens - because they have to tighten their belts for the sake of the PIIG states.
Demanding budget increases in this difficult situation is out-of-touch and scandalous.
We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors.
Instead, we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings.
Farming subsidies, the largest and most contentious budgetary factor, should be renationalised.
This would take the pressure off the EU budget and the Member States will be better able to respond to the specific character of their agricultural sector.
If the enormous amount of money paid in taxes were to reach small and medium-sized farmers instead of big landowners, agricultural factories, large businesses, monarchs and golf clubs, then maybe it would be possible to halt the decline in farming.
