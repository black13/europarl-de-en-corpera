Mr President, I have two comments to make on the so-called Eurovignette.
On the one hand, I would have liked to have seen a clear formulation to the effect that the financial resources collected there really are to be used for road building.
My second point is that I assume that the provision stating that the countries can exclude small commercial vehicles weighing between 3.5 and 12 tonnes from the Infrastructure Costs Directive will be respected by the Member States.
After all, a lot of medium-sized enterprises use vehicles in the 3.5 to 12 tonne range.
Most of these businesses will be unable to sustain higher costs.
Such businesses are often the pillar for potential employment and enterprise in our rural areas.
