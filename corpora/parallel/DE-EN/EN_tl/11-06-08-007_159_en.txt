Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Leinen report because I am convinced that by recording this data in the various countries, we will learn far more about the situation in these countries.
However, I have chosen to speak again because a number of contributors to the debate have said that we should only deal with these accounts and ignore GDP completely.
I would like to advise you against this.
That is an extremely dangerous development.
Gross Domestic Product is an indicator of economic development and prosperity.
If we want to stop measuring this or only want to use social and environmental criteria in our measurements, then we are heading for a disaster.
Thus, all of this can only supplement GDP figures.
GDP must be at the centre of our analyses, as agreed in the Rosbach report.
I believe that this should also apply here.
I should like to emphasise that yet again.
