Mr President, of course I welcome any trade agreement between two countries or businesses because, if correctly managed, world trade can help improve living standards and contribute to progress.
On the other hand, I always worry that the large number of bilateral agreements will cause us to lose sight of the overall picture and that we will end up with a patchwork of agreements that makes it hard to achieve a genuine agreement within the framework of the WTO.
For me, bilateral agreements are always the second best option.
The best option really would be to continue with trade talks in the context of WTO negotiations and to conclude the agreements that world trade is waiting for and that the global economy desperately needs.
