The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU.
Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further.
There is no denying that technically securing borders will not automatically make them secure as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system.
However, this challenge also concerns Member States already in the Schengen area.
For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately.
