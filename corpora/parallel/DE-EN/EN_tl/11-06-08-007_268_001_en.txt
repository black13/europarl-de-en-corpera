During my time in Parliament, I have campaigned on many occasions for nuclear safety in the EU.
Such a risky technology for generating energy with all its hazardous by-products and fatal consequences for both man and nature in the event of nuclear meltdown should not be glossed over under the pretext of climate protection.
Unfortunately, the Seventh Framework Programme also includes funding for research in the field of nuclear power.
However, the report also calls for stricter regulations for the EU's INDECT programme.
It states that the EU Commission should immediately publish all project documents and define a clear and strict mandate for the research goal, the application and end users of INDECT.
This is an initial success in which the rights of the EU's citizens are taken seriously on a rudimentary level at least.
Having weighed up the issues, I abstained from voting.
