The Seventh Framework Programme is not just about research in general; it is also about a specific field of research that ought to be of particular concern to all of us following the Fukushima disaster.
It is a question of funding from the Euratom programme.
What is the use of productive reactors if they buckle under water masses and in the event of earthquakes?
What is the use of the most productive nuclear power station if a minor fault is enough to make not only the immediate surroundings, but broad swathes of land, uninhabitable for decades?
It is important for us to focus more on nuclear safety and to push ahead with the development of alternatives.
Now that the Euratom research programme is shortly to be extended for the period 2012-2013, Fukushima ought to be taken as an opportunity for a rethink.
We need to focus more on protection against radiation and final storage.
It is a matter of life or death that we should not stick to the same priorities, in other words, the expansion of nuclear power, but rather that we should concentrate on safety aspects.
The present research programme is, of course, unaffected by this.
I have taken this into account when voting.
