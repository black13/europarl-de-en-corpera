The European Union and Canada have had good, solid trade relations for many years.
However, the potential for economic cooperation is far from exhausted and I welcome the negotiations in relation to the CETA.
Nonetheless, progress in WTO negotiations must be given priority over bilateral agreements.
This resolution covers a range of important themes.
I particularly support the reservations expressed by the European Parliament in relation to the possible negative impact on European agriculture.
The principle of mutuality must be preserved in order to ensure a solid, sustainable agreement for both sides.
In this context, I would like particularly to refer to the debate on origin labelling for slaughter cattle which needs to be resolved, as well as tariff-related and technical obstacles, such as protracted approval procedures for EU products.
Clearly, the aim of the CETA must be fair competition.
