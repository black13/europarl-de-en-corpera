I believe that the activities of credit rating agencies are generally extremely dubious.
This is not just because they do not identify risks in good time, as in the case of the US real estate market, but also because they can make a bad situation worse after a crisis occurs.
We cannot allow private US rating agencies to decide arbitrarily on the creditworthiness of European states.
This report is a step in the direction of more stringent controls on credit rating agencies, which is why I have voted in favour of it.
