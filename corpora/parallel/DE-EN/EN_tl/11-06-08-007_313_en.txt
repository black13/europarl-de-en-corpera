The financial and economic crisis has thrown a critical light on credit rating agencies and, in particular, their active role in the continuing crisis, the core problems identified being a lack of competition, excessive dependency on external credit ratings and a lack of answerability in the sector.
For this reason, the rapporteur recommends examining the idea of setting up a genuinely independent European credit rating agency, stating that the new European Credit Rating Foundation must be self-sustaining.
Because of the far-reaching consequences of ratings, intensive interaction with this sector is unavoidable.
This is why I have voted in favour of the report.
