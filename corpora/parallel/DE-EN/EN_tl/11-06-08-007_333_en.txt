I voted in favour of this report as I believe that businesses have a social responsibility - towards their employees and customers, the environment and society at large.
A new term has been added to the German dictionary: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
This is - and should remain - a voluntary matter.
In our globalised markets, CSR entails much more than making a donation to the local football club.
Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy.
They are Europe's ambassadors to the world, flying the flag for Europe's social standards worldwide.
We should support CSR, not regulate it.
In this case, Europe's role should be that of a moderator, not a regulator.
This principle must be applied if the European Commission is to get serious and take up the topic of CSR once again: we do not need excessive regulation.
We have underlined this position with this report.
