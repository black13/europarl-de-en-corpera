In this report, the European Union has set itself very ambitious targets based on well-conceived principles.
The Member States are being called on to implement core labour law standards for businesses in their own countries.
Unfortunately, this call does not seem to extend to businesses outside of Europe at present.
Although I am in favour of the principles behind the report, I do not believe its conclusions are absolutely correct, which is why I abstained from voting.
