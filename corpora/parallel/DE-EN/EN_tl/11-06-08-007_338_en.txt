I support the principles set down in the report.
However, I would point out that these are lofty aims that will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in reality.
We already have countless trade agreements that make no demands in terms of adherence to social standards.
As long as this obvious discrepancy exists, the effectiveness and rationale of this report will necessarily be limited.
The report calls on the Member States to implement core labour law standards for businesses in their own countries.
Should not this also extend to businesses outside of Europe?
It also seems to me that the report claims to combat the negative effects of globalisation, although, in the final analysis, this cannot be achieved with the measures discussed here.
For that reason, I have abstained from voting.
