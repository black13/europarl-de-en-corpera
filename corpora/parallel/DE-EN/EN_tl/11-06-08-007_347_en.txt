The rapporteur complains that people are still not the focus for social policy and that the human factor is still required to take a back seat to the competitiveness factor.
As the report explains, the EU enjoys a good worldwide reputation in terms of the ideal link between economic dynamism and a social model, which also gives rise to a certain responsibility.
The EU should no longer be allowed to operate a double-standard, for which reason I am in complete agreement with the rapporteur.
