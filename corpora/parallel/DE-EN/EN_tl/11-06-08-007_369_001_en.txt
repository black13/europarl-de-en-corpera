There are major challenges ahead in Europe's labour market.
The younger generation is faced with the problem that good education alone is no guarantee of finding a good job.
Worse still, it no longer even offers protection against unemployment.
On the other hand, large businesses are complaining of a shortage of specialist staff, often a welcome excuse for employing people at low wage rates.
This renders it impossible to establish a family or to find a reasonable work-life balance.
The mutual recognition of education and training is the first step in the right direction.
The report's call for action in the area of youth unemployment is also correct.
However, simply calling for action is too vague.
For that reason, I have abstained from voting.
