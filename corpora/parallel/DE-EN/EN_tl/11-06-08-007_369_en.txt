The world of work has undergone some major changes.
While, in the past, a good education was a guarantee of a good job, these days, a higher education diploma or degree will not protect young people in particular from unemployment.
In particular, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a start in one's career.
On the other hand, businesses are constantly complaining about the shortage of specialist staff, using this supposed shortage as an excuse to use cheap labour.
The complete flexibility and mobility demanded, as well as the 'bucket' prices being imposed on the labour market in the form of new working models like 'Mac-jobs', make it impossible for many people to establish a family and to achieve a reasonable work-life balance.
Within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy, it may make sense to support the mutual recognition of education and training.
However, the success of the strategy depends on taking steps to deal with these problematic developments.
In this sense, the report's call for rapid action in relation to youth unemployment is to be welcomed, although there is a lack of concrete detail.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
