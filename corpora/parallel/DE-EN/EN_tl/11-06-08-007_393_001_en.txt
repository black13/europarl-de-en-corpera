The idea of giving developing countries a helping hand and (also) offering them financial support is something to be warmly welcomed.
Humanitarian principles and the desire for global balance provide plausible grounds for this.
The European Union already provides help within the framework of a variety of programmes.
Nonetheless, this report plans to establish more instruments, thereby expanding development aid.
However, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, development aid payments should be a matter for the individual states.
