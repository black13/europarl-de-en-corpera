The fostering of prosperity in so-called developing countries is a necessary measure, particularly in order to prevent a tidal wave of migrants flooding into Europe.
At present, this is being managed through a variety of programmes.
However, the aim of this report is to increase financial aid.
This is something I cannot support.
In view of the present financial difficulties within the EU, we cannot provide this aid at the moment.
Furthermore, it is the Member States and not the EU that should determine how development aid is to be used.
