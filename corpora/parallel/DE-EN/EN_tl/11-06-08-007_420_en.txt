Impact assessments are a valuable legislative instrument, serving as a knowledge-based preparation for political decisions, and thus contributing to better law making.
Transparency, a uniform quality standard and the presentation of the advantages and disadvantages of a sufficient number of political options are the key to reliable impact assessments.
For this reason, I voted in favour of the alternative proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
