A Europe that belongs to its citizens can only work as a Europe of homelands, subsidiarity and national sovereignty.
Until now, it has seemed as if European contract law was something unnecessary and the general principle applies that if a provision is not necessary, then it should be omitted.
I also believe that this report is a diversionary tactic, designed to draw attention away from the fact that something far more important, namely, EU-wide consumer protection, is still in need of improvement.
It is for that reason that I am voting against this report.
