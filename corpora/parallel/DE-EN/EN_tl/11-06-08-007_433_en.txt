European contract law should ensure a more smoothly-running Internal Market and this report draws particular attention to the potential benefits for SMEs and consumers.
The related efforts to find a common legal framework here have been ongoing since 1989.
In 2008, the EU Commission circulated a proposal for a directive on consumer rights.
It is of far greater importance for Europe's consumers that consumer protection should be improved at EU level.
This should not take the form of restrictive actions, such as those once familiar when bank accounts were overdrawn, but instead should combat shady business practices, fraud, etc.
It is open to question whether European contract law will improve market access for small enterprises because, according to analyses, it is mainly medium to large-sized retail businesses that are involved in cross-border trade, something that is due to the bureaucratic red tape entailed, as well as the costs.
The existing problems with cross-border online shopping will persist for some time to come.
Furthermore, it has not been established beyond all doubt that standardisation is really necessary.
When in doubt, I back the principle of subsidiarity, which is why I am voting against the Wallis report.
