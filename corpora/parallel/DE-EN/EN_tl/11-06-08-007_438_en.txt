The rapporteur favours an optional instrument.
Consumer protection organisations are already sceptical about the EU's approach to this topic.
On the one hand, they question the causal link with the basis for future contract law, while also, more importantly, fearing a further complication of the legal situation.
At present, a 'toolbox' is the preferred option because this would meet current needs and special provisions in relation to the most common types of contract would be a genuine aid for consumers.
However, all options should be kept open and examined at present.
