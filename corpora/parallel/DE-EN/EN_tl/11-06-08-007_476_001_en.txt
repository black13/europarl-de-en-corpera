Once again (as in the case of the ITER project), the EU has managed to delay a project for so long that the costs are impossible to estimate.
This is equally true for the follow-up costs for the GNSS (Galileo and EGNOS satellite navigation systems) and Schengen Information System II projects.
It is not just follow-up costs that have exploded: 'normal' project costs have also reached massive proportions.
An attempt is now being made to limit damage by making savings.
These are necessary moves.
Unfortunately, it seems as if these cuts will only affect the European taxpayer as they will result in reductions in services.
Although GNSS will only have a military application, it will be the taxpayers who foot the bill - twice over now as a result of the follow-up costs.
This situation casts a pall over the GNSS project, which is otherwise something to be welcomed.
For that reason, I have abstained from voting.
