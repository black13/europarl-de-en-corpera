Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors have been asked to pay up two and three times over.
In future years, real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees.
This will have to be financed by the net contributors, in other words, the hard-working citizens of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria, from their national budgets; the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries.
Demanding budgetary increases in this difficult situation is scandalous.
We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors.
Instead, we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings.
Farming subsidies, the largest and most contentious budgetary factor, should be renationalised.
This would take the pressure off the EU budget and the Member States will be better able to respond to the specific character of their agricultural sector.
For this reason, I have no hesitation in voting against the Garriga Polledo report.
