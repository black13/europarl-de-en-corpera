Europe's hardworking citizens are being required to pay more and more.
Following the disastrous euro rescue package, which simply involved the net contributors taking a hit for the mismanagement and corruption in a few southern states, the plan is now to ask the already overburdened citizens of the net contributor countries to cough up even more money.
Instead of taking every opportunity to save money, expenditure is being further increased.
We should be aiming to reduce the burden, not increase it.
I therefore voted against this motion.
