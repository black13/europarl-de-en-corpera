The Garriga Polledo report assumes a figure of between 75 and 90% for the intermediate category for regional support.
This range is unacceptable to me because it offers the prospect of payments to few areas that require support, including in the western part of the EU.
This goes against the actual aim of regional support, namely the strengthening of the weakest regions.
