Madam President, many thanks for your question.
I accept the criticism that I have dealt in generalities in the minute's speaking time allocated to me.
However, I can provide more concrete examples.
European values are one thing; however, European values also mean, for example, that a Member State should operate on the rule of law, which entails issues such as the separation of powers and the democratic principle.
When, for example, a constitutional court has no jurisdiction in budgetary and taxation matters, this constitutes a restriction in the separation of powers and is unquestionably a dubious situation.
Accordingly, I believe that we can discuss such issues.
With regard to the other questions, such as the two-thirds majority, I must ask to what extent this is compatible with parliamentary democracy if future governments no longer have any room to manoeuvre.
It is certainly open to question whether life imprisonment without any right of appeal or judicial review by the supreme court is compatible with the principles of democracy and the rule of law upheld in the European Union.
These are questions that need answers and I believe that the Commission must investigate.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
