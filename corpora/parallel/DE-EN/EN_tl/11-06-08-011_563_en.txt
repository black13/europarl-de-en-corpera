Madam President, Mr Alvaro, you have just demonstrated how to extend your speaking time by accepting numerous questions.
However, I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the provisions for the Hungarian constitutional court - I am not sure whether you have read the Hungarian constitution in its entirety - are almost identical to those that apply to the constitutional court in Germany.
Therefore, I wanted to ask you whether the German constitutional court is just as undemocratic and worthy of criticism as the Hungarian constitutional court?
I would like to hear your answer to this question.
