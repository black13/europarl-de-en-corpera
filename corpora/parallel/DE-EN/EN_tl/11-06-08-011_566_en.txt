Madam President, I hold Mr Landsbergis in high esteem.
However, I am unable to find a question in his speech.
If this was not a question, then I will use the time to make a statement.
As far as I am aware, no constitution defines the law for future generations.
That is not the issue at stake.
What we are dealing with is human dignity - this is a principle found in the German constitution, as well as others - and the Hungarian constitution is no different in this regard.
I cannot see a contradiction here.
The question is whether this is to be restricted or defined in future.
However, as I said before, I failed to understand your question completely.
Sustainability, the protection of future generations, the desire for a healthy natural environment and the protection of quality of life - all of these are principles that, if I am not mistaken, can be found in the constitutions of all Member States, and that have been upheld in many supreme court judgments.
I believe that this principle was never questioned by you, even during your time as President.
