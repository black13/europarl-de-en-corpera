Madam President, no, in fact this is basically quite simple.
Having heard from others that other Member States should put their own house in order and examine their constitutions, perhaps Mrs Gál could quote an article from the constitution of one of the Member States of the European Union that she would categorise as an example of an area where a state needs to 'put its own house in order'.
After all, it was Mrs Gál who explicitly stated that that is what other Member States should do.
In other words, where is the specific criticism of the constitution of another Member State that needs to be addressed?
Once we have this information, we can, of course, get down to discussions.
