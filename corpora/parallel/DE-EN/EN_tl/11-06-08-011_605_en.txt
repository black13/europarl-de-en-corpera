Madam President, Mrs Gy≈ëri, Mrs Reding, I fail to see the point of this debate.
I would have framed some of the points in the Hungarian constitution differently.
There are also some points in my own German constitution that I do not fully agree with, likewise the French constitution.
However, this has nothing to do with this House, because it is not responsible for such issues.
That is the crucial point.
That is, unless is it specifically established that some provision is in breach of European law.
If someone does not like a particular element in a national constitution, this has nothing to do with this House, because this is a matter of national identity and jurisdiction.
Just as the Commission forced changes in Hungary's media laws because some points were unacceptable, so it or the European Court of Justice will take action if laws are passed when implementing the constitution that breach European law.
It is even possible to take a case to the European Court of Justice.
It is for this reason that I believe what we are witnessing here is a bit of political theatre.
We do not have the right to interfere with the Hungarian constitution.
Perhaps I would have done certain things differently, but it is Hungary's right to do things as it sees fit.
