Madam President, Mr Brok, I found your remarks somewhat irritating, which is why I asked to speak.
Naturally, the European Union has competences that enable it to establish the compatibility of national law with European law.
As you said yourself, anything that breaches the European Treaties can also be clarified in a court of law.
So, why should this House be prevented from debating such a situation?
Is it not, in fact, absolutely necessary for this House to debate this issue?
I believe that we are witnessing a trend whereby national constitutions are seen as an area where there is no room for political debate among European democracies.
If we live in a European democracy, then of course, the core components of our constitutions must be mutually agreed and must be compatible with the international treaties that we have all signed.
These include, for example, the Convention on Human Rights, as well as the Treaties of the European Union, and I believe that we should be able to debate this issue in this Chamber.
