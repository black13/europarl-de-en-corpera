author. - Madam President, today we find ourselves debating the issue of the European Arrest Warrant.
It is high time that this discussion was brought to the table.
We have submitted a question through the groups tabling a debate on the reform of the European Arrest Warrant and its application, and are asking the Commission and Council to respond with proposals.
The European Arrest Warrant was trumpeted as the perfect example of mutual recognition in the area of justice and policing.
When the European Arrest Warrant was passed as a framework decision, the European Parliament always made it perfectly clear that, on the one hand, the conditions for applying the European Arrest Warrant are relatively strict, so that it should apply only to really serious crimes, that it should be applied in a proportionate way, and that the procedural standards in the European Union should be harmonised at the same time.
None of these requirements has really been met in full.
In many specific cases, the Arrest Warrant is not applied in a proportionate way, as we can see in the reports now available to us.
Thus, we need to adjust procedures, both in practice and in legislation.
Thanks to the work of Vice-President Reding, after ten years, we are finally making progress in harmonising procedural standards.
However, it is essential that we should make numerous further advances, including in relation to the conditions under which prisoners are held and the question of individual standards of legal protection.
In future, our sole concern should not just be the cooperation between the police and judicial authorities as regards mutual recognition; we must also look at the establishment of procedural standards.
Nonetheless, the European Arrest Warrant must be amended today, as its application is obviously incompatible with the standards we have called for, particularly in terms of the checking of proportionality in individual cases.
