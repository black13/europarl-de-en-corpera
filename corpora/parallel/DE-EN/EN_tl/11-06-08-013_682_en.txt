Madam President, it is hardly conceivable that our relations with Russia are based on an agreement dating from 1994.
We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then.
We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia.
Where the neighbourhood is concerned, we deplore the war with Georgia, the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine, the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria.
At the same time, our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran's nuclear programme is pleasing.
As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation.
Yet what is modernity without democracy?
In the list of priorities that you have just given, Commissioner FÃ¼le, human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes.
Is that the best we can expect in this area?
Do we expect nothing more of Russia's democratisation?
I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections - there must be progress there.
There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level.
Two summits a year is too much.
Let us have one summit, as we do with America.
We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas.
Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either.
