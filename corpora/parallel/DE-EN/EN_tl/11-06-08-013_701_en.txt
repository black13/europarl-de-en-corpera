Madam President, firstly, may I say that I was astonished to hear a man such as Mr MÃ¶lzer, who is well educated in history, say that there are historical zones of Russian influence in Europe and that this includes parts of the European Union such as Romania.
The days of the Hitler-Stalin pact are long gone and in a democratic world, we should be practising a kind of European Monroe Doctrine; in other words, that the fate and the policies of Europe are decided by Europeans.
That does not mean that we do not want a policy of good neighbourliness and dialogue.
Yet Nizhny Novgorod - the venue for our meeting - should also serve as a warning, because it reminds us of the famous story of the merchants of Nizhny Novgorod who believed that they could buy their freedom and their security and were then hanged.
We have to realise that we cannot buy security with money or by glossing over reality; it is only obtainable through honest partnership.
We need a common foreign affairs and security policy.
We need energy independence and energy security and less dependence on Russian energy policy, which is still being used for foreign policy purposes.
We also need to speak clearly on human rights.
We cannot afford to compromise here.
Where Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are concerned, I would state that these individuals must at last be freed - otherwise the state visit by the Russian President to the European Parliament will take place under a huge cloud.
We want to have a partnership with a Russia that is in the process of democratising, but to do that, Russia must democratise - in reality and not just in our wishful thinking.
That is why I think Mr Swoboda is right: the forthcoming elections will be decisive.
Then we will see whether our partnership with the Russian people - of whom we are very fond - can be expanded into a genuine partnership with the Russian state.
