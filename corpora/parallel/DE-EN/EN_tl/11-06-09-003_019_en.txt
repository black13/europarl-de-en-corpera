Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise the aspect mentioned by the Commissioner that 'the national authorities have learnt from this', because I believe that the way the Austrian national government - and specifically the environment minister responsible - has proceeded with the amendment of the Austrian act on environmental impact assessments is to be seen as very positive and could be used as an example, as a benchmark, for many other cases with which many people are not as familiar.
Finally, however, I would like to give my support to the amended petition by Mr Jahr which calls for specific and effective tools to allow influence, monitoring and correction as far back as the planning and early stages of such projects.
