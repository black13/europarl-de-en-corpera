Madam President, it may be that I have misunderstood Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, which is why I wanted to ask.
I believe that it is important for the rules that are currently in force to be followed.
We should not always be able to talk our way out of things by saying that we do not need to keep closely to the rules because of a change in circumstances.
Rules must always be followed to the letter and rightly so.
I would like to know whether you meant that the rules must be adhered to, regardless of the situation, and that people should not always be guided by the circumstances.
