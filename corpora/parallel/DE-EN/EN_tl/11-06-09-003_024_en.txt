Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, this discussion once again highlights the fact that with regard to the whole area of the environment, we have a major communication problem.
The environment, the economy and regional interests are constantly being played off against one another.
This is where the big problem lies.
We need support from the Commission to ensure that the environment is seen as an essential aspect of the economy.
At the moment, far too little emphasis is being put on the fact that measures to protect the environment and the natural world can also create and safeguard jobs.
Currently, the discussion is always polarised: either nature or jobs.
We politicians have, unfortunately, also used this type of argument.
I am calling on everyone to work on raising awareness and to acknowledge on both sides that we need to preserve the environment in order for the economy to continue functioning effectively in future.
