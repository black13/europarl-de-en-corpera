Madam President, I am actually happy with the response, but I would just like to have some clarification on one point.
Under the current regulations, ski pistes only have to be included in the calculation of the thresholds when structural changes are planned during the development of the facility.
All the other areas used by skiers, fare dodgers or other people do not come into consideration.
I am of the opinion that the effects of using an area which has not been left in its natural state should be included.
One final, brief point: in one area of a Member State which we, Mr Oettinger, are both very familiar with, the Committee on Petitions has the option in selected cases to apply a blocking procedure.
I believe it would be a good thing for us to agree with the Commission and the Council that it is possible to put a freeze on proceedings if this is handled responsibly.
