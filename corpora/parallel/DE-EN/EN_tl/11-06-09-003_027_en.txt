Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Wieland again, as he is a lawyer, whether he now wants to include the mountain hikers and the ski mountaineers, who wear skis and who sometimes use the ski lifts so that they do not have to cover the entire distance on foot, and also people using other sporting equipment.
Will the whole Alpine region be subject to an environmental impact assessment?
He should define the criteria more accurately and explain exactly what he means.
