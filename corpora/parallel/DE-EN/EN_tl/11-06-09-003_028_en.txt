Madam President, I would like to make one thing quite clear and to contradict the impression that has been given.
The natural world is not the property of the conservation organisations.
Nature is there to be used by the people.
Therefore, as has just been touched on, I am not of the opinion that Dam√ºls-Mellau is a case where this blocking procedure should have been applied.
