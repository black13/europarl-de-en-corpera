Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the Commission shares the European Parliament's concerns.
This is very nice, but we have been waiting for years for the Commission to take action and to make some genuine progress in this area.
We have Mr Busuttil's report in front of us.
In the last parliamentary term, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection repeatedly highlighted the fact that we finally need to do something to help people.
The problem is that people are still waiting for this help to arrive.
Many of the small voluntary organisations that are affected do not have the financial means or the chutzpah to defend themselves.
Only last week I received another letter asking: 'How can I defend myself?
I do not have the money for a lawyer, so I cannot take legal proceedings'.
I believe that we must finally give the citizens of Europe an effective means of ridding themselves of this problem.
