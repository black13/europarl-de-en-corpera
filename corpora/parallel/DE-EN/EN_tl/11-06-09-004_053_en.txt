Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that this is really a European problem.
Everyone is familiar with these cases and we are hearing stories from a number of different countries.
I have a whole stack of these cases on my desk and I admit that I would have fallen for most of them.
The problem is, and we have covered this on numerous occasions, we have Directive 2006/114/EC, we discussed the matter in 2008 in the Committee on Petitions, and we have held debates here in plenary, but the problem is continuing and even growing in size.
Mr Oettinger, I heard what you said at the beginning and I have the impression that the problem has landed with you.
Perhaps a new Commissioner will have a new opportunity to take action in this area.
I would like to ask you to take the problem seriously.
It may seem to be a small problem, but it has a serious economic impact and it affects small, medium-sized and family-run companies in particular and they form the backbone of our national economies and our society.
If we do not succeed in stopping this in all the Member States and in implementing the directive uniformly and effectively throughout Europe, even greater damage will be caused.
