Madam President, once again, all this was obviously not about moving forward one millimetre or three metres on this subject, but about party political disputes.
We can do this.
We made much more progress on this resolution in Parliament across all the party boundaries than we have done now.
For me, it is highly regrettable that we are once again fighting over the question of yes or no.
You know that I personally hold a very individual view on this issue but I have been prepared to compromise and to find common ground in Parliament in order to improve the safety of European nuclear power stations in their current locations, which is where they are likely to stay.
It is our job to achieve results for the people of Europe and not just to make explanations.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
