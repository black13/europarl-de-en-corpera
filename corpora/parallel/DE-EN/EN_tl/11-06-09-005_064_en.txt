Madam President, Mr Reul, I take seriously your call for objectivity and honesty in our dealings with one another.
Therefore, I would like to ask why you sound so aggressive and why you are accusing the Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance of hypocrisy.
You have used the ridiculous argument that a year ago, it would not have been possible to push through a stress test of this kind.
However, you did not explain to Parliament that the only reason that this was not possible was because you, Mr Reul, and those on your side prevented it.
We had this problem before Fukushima.
If we all want safety, then the right thing to do is to show a permanent commitment to safety and not just when there has been a core meltdown in three reactors.
