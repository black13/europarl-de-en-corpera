Madam President, Mr Landsbergis, I am sorry, but I cannot answer the question.
I cannot speak on behalf of the German Government.
However, I believe that you are right when you say that not only must we deal carefully with the subject of the safety of European nuclear power stations, but that we must also take responsibility for influencing the construction and the condition of other power stations, in as far as we can.
Mr Oettinger has said that he is making every effort to promote the stress tests and possible changes in the directives in other areas of the world and is committed to ensuring that these higher safety standards are adopted.
In this respect, I think that your remarks are justified.
