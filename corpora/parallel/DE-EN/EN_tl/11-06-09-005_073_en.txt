Madam President, I beg your pardon, Mr Chichester, I was speaking German, but I said absolutely nothing in my speech about Germany.
If I were to say anything about Germany, it would be this: I believe it is right that the German Government, under the leadership of climate policy expert Klaus TÃ¶pfer, for example, has said that the risks involved in these power stations are too great, that in the case of a disaster, the risks would be unmanageable and that this is why Germany is getting out of nuclear power.
I believe it is important to mention this here from a German perspective.
However, I said nothing about this in my previous speech.
Secondly, I would like to say on the subject of Japan that TEPCO and other operators of nuclear power plants maintained before Fukushima that their plants were technically equipped to withstand all the types of earthquake that were likely to occur.
There were forecasts and warnings that there would be a horror tsunami of this kind.
I do not understand why the International Atomic Energy Agency did not intervene earlier.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
