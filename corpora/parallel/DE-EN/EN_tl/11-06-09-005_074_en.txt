Madam President, I would like to ask you, Mrs Harms, why you have not thanked Mr Oettinger.
Why did you not say thank you?
I think the accusations that you have made against him here are outrageous.
Mr Oettinger was the only person who made the most of the opportunity to bring together everyone involved immediately after Fukushima and to insist that we carry out stress tests at a European level, regardless of the responsibilities.
Now we have a result that goes far beyond the tests carried out over the last 15 or 20 years, with European involvement and with peer reviews by teams that have been put together at a European level.
I believe it is unfair for you to continue following your own green policy without taking any responsibility.
