Madam President, I remember very well a remark made publicly by Mr Oettinger who said that he knew that certain plants in the European Union would have to be disconnected from the grid as a result of the stress tests.
I then asked him which plants he was referring to.
I am waiting for him to follow up on what he said.
I remember that Mr Oettinger said during the last plenary session that he would not sign the document that was currently on the table concerning stress tests.
He did sign it, despite the fact that very few changes were made in terms of quality.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
