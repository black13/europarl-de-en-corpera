Madam President, as we currently have no nuclear power stations where, in the case of a core meltdown, the effects could be restricted to the reactor, I am of the opinion that we should get out of nuclear power.
I am happy to admit that openly.
It is not a secret.
My second point is that right from the beginning, we have been fully committed and we are still committed to genuine technical inspections of existing plants which focus on the well-known safety problems.
We very much regret the fact that this will not be happening.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in this Parliament have campaigned for the introduction of high, mandatory safety standards.
Mrs Niebler knows why we failed and why we currently have no high, mandatory safety standards in Europe today.
