Madam President, I am happy for us to talk about this again, but I have a very big problem.
I think what has been done about the nuclear hell that has emerged in Japan is magnificent.
I have often visited Chernobyl, including the exclusion zone.
I believe what the workers in this dangerous zone are still doing today is magnificent.
The people who we have turned into heroes are fighting for pensions, for health care and for other things decades after they became heroes.
It is easy to talk about heroism, but genuinely dealing with the consequences is another and much sadder story.
