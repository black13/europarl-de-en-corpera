Madam President, Mr Oettinger, in Austria, where you like to spend your holidays, we are doing very well when it comes to nuclear power plants.
The radioactive intensity of today's debate does, of course, have one benefit.
It reminds you, Mr Oettinger, that you can undergo a road-to-Damascus conversion and switch from being a friend of EnBW, the German power company, to being the person responsible for monitoring nuclear power stations.
If you do really well, you may even be drawing up the exit strategy.
However, you must be aware that this will involve a struggle over responsibilities.
The 'more' that you promised us is not enough and, of course, it is very important for you to put pressure on a joint neighbouring country of ours, the Czech Republic, which, as far as I understand it, would prefer to not take part in any kind of more critical test, in particular, with regard to crimes.
You should also be exerting pressure on the blatant nuclear lobbyists from the United Kingdom, which brings us to the main topic.
Do not allow yourself to be influenced by the lobbyists in the Commission.
Take a look at who really holds the power in important organisations such as the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) and the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA).
Keep an eye on Dominique Ristori, a Commission official who is invisibly but inextricably linked with the nuclear lobby, and on other Commission officials.
It will be worth the effort if it enables you to achieve the objective that you say you want to achieve.
Most importantly, you can no longer be seen to be on the side of German industry and all the power companies whose names begin with E - EDF, E.ON and EnBW - in this discussion.
You need to keep a critical distance from them.
Austria, the country that is also your holiday destination, will give you the help you need.
