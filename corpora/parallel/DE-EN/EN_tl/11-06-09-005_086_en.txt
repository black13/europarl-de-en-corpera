Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the stress tests are necessary and also long overdue.
It is surprising that they have not been carried out before.
You should take the credit for the fact that all the nuclear power stations in the EU are finally going to be inspected.
However, we must admit that we are skating on very thin ice with these stress tests.
You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure.
Of course, there is the risk that the inspection will differ from country to country.
Some will not want to include aircraft crashes and others will only open up a part of their plants for stress tests.
You need to make sure that the tests are genuinely comprehensive.
It is also clear that you have not made a comprehensive evaluation.
The area of human failure is incomplete.
The risk now and in future is not that an aircraft will accidentally crash on a nuclear power plant, but that there will be targeted attacks on these plants from outside.
That is precisely what is not being tested.
I live on the border with France and Luxembourg and there are four nuclear power stations in Cattenom.
We have been told that the fire service and the police are responsible for them.
I imagine that al-Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism.
This really must be included in the stress test.
Finally, what will the consequences be if you find errors and weak points?
There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing.
Will some of the power plants really be shut down or modernised?
It is high time that the Euratom Treaty was revised.
This situation, where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations, cannot continue.
