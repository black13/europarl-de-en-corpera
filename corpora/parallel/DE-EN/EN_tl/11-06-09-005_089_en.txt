Madam President, I have a question for Mr Strejček.
What do you say to the fact that as far as we know, the Czech Republic would prefer not to take part in serious stress tests and that it does not want to be involved in the question of criminal attacks?
What is your own approach to the nuclear industry and what are your personal relationships with these lobby groups?
