Madam President, Mr Oettinger, using the example of the Cattenom nuclear power station which threatens hundreds of thousands of people in Luxembourg and also in the German regions of the Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate, I would like to explain why these watered-down stress tests will not do the job.
Cattenom is on the approach path to Luxembourg airport and it is precisely the consequences of a plane crashing on Cattenom which are not being investigated.
After the first document was submitted by the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), you yourself tabled an amendment to have aircraft crashes included in the initiating events on page 4 of the document.
This amendment, which was a good one, was blocked by France and the United Kingdom.
It disturbs us that you have fought for this and lost and that you have still not been able to admit that you have lost.
That is dishonest and this is why we are critical of you.
We must make it clearer that France and the United Kingdom are currently not cooperating over the things that we and you both want.
We need to take an honest look at this issue.
Mr Liese, the German Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union did not support us on the famous resolution about the exit from nuclear power.
Chancellor Merkel is rather braver than you are, at least on this occasion.
