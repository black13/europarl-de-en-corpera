Madam President, the Austrian people voted with a clear majority against nuclear power and this sends a clear message to our politicians.
I would like to mention that Mr Palacio has already made a great effort to give Europe more room for manoeuvre in this area.
Mr Piebalgs' nuclear safety directive was also successful.
I hope that we will soon have a new nuclear safety directive which is binding and which lays down the inspection procedures and the standards.
We should be evaluating which of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards are available to us and which can be incorporated into EU law in a legally binding way.
Of course, one-off stress tests are not enough.
In future, there must be a series of stress tests so that dangerous nuclear power plants can be shut down immediately.
In order to achieve this, we need an EU regulator who has joint powers with the national regulators and who is entitled to disconnect from the grid any power stations which fail to meet these standards.
I can only endorse what has already been said today.
The Euratom Treaty must be revised.
We must call on the Heads of State or Government to ensure that this becomes a joint European issue in the Council.
It must not be the case as it has generally been in the past in the Council that the nuclear working group opposes anything which comes out of Europe.
Most importantly, we need research within the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) into the decommissioning of nuclear power plants.
We also need research into final storage and we should be focusing on protection, safety, training and inspections.
We must introduce the clearing house model that is currently in front of us into European legislation.
Mr Oettinger, you can rely on the support of this House in this respect.
