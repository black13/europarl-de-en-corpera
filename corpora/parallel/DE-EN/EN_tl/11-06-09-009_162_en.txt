Mr President, I think we can argue for a long time about the extent of Russia's progress on the road to democracy.
Of course, there are many problems from our perspective.
However, on the other hand, it is always better to develop our cooperation with Russia, in particular, when we are calling on Russia to respect human rights or to improve environmental rights, if only because of its size.
If we can ensure that the cooperation is friendly, but also serious, and if we do not forget to make legitimate demands and highlight legitimate failings, we will be making a step in the right direction, not only in terms of the cooperation between Europe and Russia, but, most importantly, in terms of human rights.
Ultimately, this is all about improving the situation of the people of Russia.
