Mr President, I am very pleased that we have discussed directory companies and their practices today.
This is a very important topic in the European Union.
Despite the fact that the Committee on Petitions has been working intensively on this subject since 2008, we have not yet seen any significant improvements.
I would like to explain why the situation in Germany is so difficult.
It is both mandatory and normal practice in Germany for a legal entity to register its address in an online directory when it is founded.
Anyone who registers a company will receive around eight to 10 letters in response.
It is likely that one of these will be genuine and the others superfluous.
If you reply to the wrong letter and fill out the wrong form during this period of founding a company when you have a lot of work and a great deal of red tape to deal with, you will find that you have signed a contract and are faced with a bill for up to EUR 1 000.
Therefore, I would like to urge the Commission, once again, to consider an EU-wide ban on these misleading business directories.
