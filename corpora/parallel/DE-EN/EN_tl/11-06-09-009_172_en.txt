Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the few of you who are still here, visitors to the European Parliament, in conclusion, I would like to make some brief remarks on the subject of misleading directory companies.
I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important for us in the European Union to make our opinion clear on this.
This is a part of organised crime in Europe which involves bogus companies taking money from people and from small and medium-sized businesses over the Internet.
We must make every effort to prevent this from happening.
The Commission has made many soapbox speeches calling for genuine support to be given to small and medium-sized companies and for the amount of red tape to be reduced.
One important aspect of this is to bring an end to this type of organised crime.
The resolution represents a step in the right direction, but only a small one.
We must take action and, therefore, I am calling on everyone to continue with this work, not only those Members who are not here, but all of us who represent the citizens of Europe in Parliament.
