in writing. - In the split vote on paragraph 17 of this resolution, I voted against the second part.
I believe that focusing on individual disadvantaged groups in society, as this paragraph does, is inappropriate.
Other groups, such as those with differing political opinions, have their human rights violated and we must not tolerate this.
The first part of the paragraph means for me that the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people can be protected, without losing sight of other groups, in order to ensure equal treatment.
