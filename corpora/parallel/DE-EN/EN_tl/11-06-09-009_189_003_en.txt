In recent years, there has, unfortunately, been a growing trend towards unfair business practices and misleading advertising.
In the past, it was generally consumers who were the targets of these scams, but now the fraudulent practices are extending into the business world.
The problem is that these fraudulent activities generally take place across national borders, which makes it harder to arrest and prosecute the criminals.
Some of the companies constantly change their names and their P.O. box addresses and this also makes it difficult to arrest the people who are pulling the strings.
Therefore, it is important for us to close the loopholes in this area so that we can take action against fraud more effectively.
However, the measures should be directed not only at the business world and not only, as in the specific case covered here, at the misleading commercial practices of directory companies.
Decisive action must also be taken against the various forms of fraud aimed at consumers.
I see this petition as a step in the right direction, which should be followed by further measures, and, therefore, I have voted in favour of it.
