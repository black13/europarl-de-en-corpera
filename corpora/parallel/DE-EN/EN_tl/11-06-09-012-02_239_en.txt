Mr President, Mr Oettinger, the current US Government initially spoke out clearly in favour of closing the detention camp at Guant√°namo.
Unfortunately, the US Government was not able to follow up on its announcement.
This included closing the military commissions set up there because they do not meet any of the standards for fair court proceedings.
This makes the fact that there is an imminent death penalty decision and the threat of an execution all the more dramatic.
Therefore, our resolution calls urgently on all EU institutions and on the Member States to do everything possible to prevent Mr al-Nashiri from being executed.
We are calling again for the USA to impose a moratorium on the death penalty and to join a worldwide movement in which 96 states have made an irreversible decision to abolish the death penalty.
The number of states which have retained the death penalty and still make use of it has fallen to 58.
This is a positive development.
Mr al-Nashiri was imprisoned in Poland in a secret prison set up by the CIA where he was subjected to intense torture.
We Europeans must finally seriously come to terms with our shared responsibility for these grave violations of human rights.
The practice of hushing this up, sweeping it under the carpet and allowing those responsible to remain largely immune from prosecution must not continue.
Today's debate also shows that it is not helpful to talk in superficial terms about anti-Americanism or anti-European sentiments.
Instead, we must deal with the facts, including the sources which Mrs Gomez referred to.
In addition, the UN special rapporteur on torture submitted a useful document during the last committee meeting which proves that prisons of this kind were established by the CIA in Poland.
