Mr President, the USA is not the largest democracy in the world, as another speaker said.
It is the third largest.
However, I believe that the USA will not be impressed when the second largest democracy in the world after India - the European Union - collapses into internal polemics on this important topic.
The subject is far too serious and it has rightly been said that our partnership with the USA is based on human rights.
We are fighting in support of the rule of international law.
Guantánamo is a zone where national and international law do not apply and, therefore, it goes against the principles of international law.
We are fighting against military jurisdiction and for the rule of law, which is not compatible with military jurisdiction.
We are fighting for the right to life and this is not compatible with the death penalty.
We are fighting for human rights and these human rights are being violated in Guantánamo.
Therefore, we must make it quite clear to an important ally, like the USA, that we are not prepared to accept this.
This has been Parliament's position right from the beginning and across all the groups.
It has also been the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
Guantánamo must be closed.
Even terrorists have human rights, but they must, of course, have a legitimate punishment imposed on them in the interests of their victims.
However, that must be the subject of proper legal proceedings.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
