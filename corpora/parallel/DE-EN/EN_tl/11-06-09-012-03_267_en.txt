Mr President, I would simply like to ask my fellow Member what the continuous declarations concerning the universality of human rights mean when, in the case of Ukraine, the issue suddenly only concerns internal affairs.
Saying that no one should intervene in the internal affairs of a country is the old Soviet argument.
In cases which concern human rights, we will always intervene, in particular with regard to a partner as important as Ukraine.
