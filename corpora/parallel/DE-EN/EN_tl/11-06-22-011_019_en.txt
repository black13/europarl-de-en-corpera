Mr President, I would like to move that we postpone the debate and the vote on economic governance to the July part-session.
Our reasons for wanting to do so are quite simple.
The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated.
As MEPs we have not had sufficient time to have a proper look at these.
The necessary translations were not available, either.
We see this as unacceptable pressure being exerted by the Council and would ask you as fellow Members to resist this pressure and to vote in favour of the motion to postpone the debate and vote.
