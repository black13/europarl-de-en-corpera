Mr President, in all of the countries that are experiencing a crisis, there have been genuine problems.
There is absolutely no point in denying that.
This situation can be abused from two different sides.
It can be abused, as some credit rating agencies are doing, for example, by giving advice that drives countries to ruin.
However, it can also be abused by making political statements to the effect that we do not need to change anything.
If some of the demonstrators, in Greece for example or in other countries, believe that we do not need to change anything and that we can carry on as before, then they are wrong.
We are therefore in favour of giving our full support to the measures proposed by Mr Papandreou's government.
These measures are a step in the right direction.
They must be supported, and that is something that some of the trade unionists in Greece also need to recognise - the only way to overcome this is if, at the same time, we pursue a policy of growth together.
I wanted to make that absolutely clear.
In other words, no abuse from either side.
That is extremely important.
