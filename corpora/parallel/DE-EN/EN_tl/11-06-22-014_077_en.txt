Mr President, the EU's current migration policy has failed.
An example of this is the Commission's plans for so-called mobility partnerships in order to give the mass influx of people from North Africa a semblance of legality.
Mrs Malmstr√∂m has declared many times that Europe is allegedly dependent on immigration from North Africa.
However, the fact that many Member States are having to deal with high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people, is deliberately ignored.
In Libya, the population has doubled in the last 20 years.
Thus, if the gates to North Africa were opened, the pressure on the European labour market would increase further.
Therefore, we do not need more immigration from North Africa, but rather a stop to immigration altogether.
Our citizens do not want mobility partnerships in this regard; instead they want readmission partnerships.
Our fellow citizens do not want open borders, but rather the reintroduction of controls and a strengthening of Frontex.
This also ought to be considered at the forthcoming Council meeting when 'progress' in immigration policy is discussed.
