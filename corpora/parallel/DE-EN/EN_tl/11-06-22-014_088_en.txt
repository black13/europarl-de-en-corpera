in writing. - Whereas the immigration world champion Canada attracts more highly qualified migrants than any other region of the world - in which regard, those who are not able to make a living are also quick to leave again - Europe almost pursues a policy of 'compassionate migration for the unqualified'.
The fact is that the majority of Africans who come to Europe are not refugees, they are economic migrants.
This human horse trading under the false heading of 'refugees' as well as the humanitarian call for asylum is causing irreparable damage to the asylum system.
A European asylum policy is doomed to failure on account of the undesirable side effects of previous proposals: the Dublin Regulation was intended to prevent asylum tourism.
Now, countries with easily accessible external borders are swamped, but the majority of asylum seekers nevertheless are landing in the countries with the most generous social security systems.
The fact that granting asylum seekers equality with the national population in terms of access to the labour market and social security has boosted economic migration was only to be expected.
The increased rights of illegal immigrants make deportation almost impossible.
A uniform asylum law would only be desirable if it was based on the most stringent national asylum law, like that of Denmark for example, and if there were consequences for contraventions of the law, like the tourist visa for illegal immigrants.
A European asylum system based on the central principles of humanitarianism and muddling through is to be firmly rejected.
There must finally be a clear differentiation between refugees with a right to asylum and economic migrants.
Moreover, Frontex and readmission agreements must be developed further and illegal immigrants must consistently be deported.
