rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we were to ask European citizens what they expect from European politics they would answer quality of life, using terms like health and environment.
With this common agricultural policy, we are facing precisely this task of fulfilling these expectations of European citizens in us as politicians, but also in politics in general.
The contribution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is an important one in this context, because we want the same things European citizens do.
We want wholesome food produced in a diverse system, and by diverse I do mean biological diversity, but also diversity in terms of production.
We must enable the preservation of the environment in which we live.
We need to take care of our water bodies, the air and the soil.
We need to ensure that the rural habitat continues to be developed and does not become the poorhouse of Europe.
We need to pursue an agricultural policy that involves the development of all regions.
We need money for this and we need the money to be properly and fairly distributed.
