Did anyone else not hear the English interpretation?
Perhaps it is just a local problem in the back rows.
We are looking into the matter.
Apparently it was a channel mix-up.
We are working on the problem.
Please bear with us, but I am sure the speech can be read afterwards on the web.
We have web streaming and I am sure the interpretation will be there.
