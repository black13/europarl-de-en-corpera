Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his persistent and positive work.
Where the future of agricultural policy after 2013 is concerned, we have to decide the direction in which we want to go.
Do we want an agricultural sector that faces up to the challenges by acting in an innovative, modern, courageous, self-aware, responsible and independent way in the market?
Or do we want an agricultural sector that continues to be drip-fed by Europe and which needs its hand to be held and encouraging words from Mummy with each step it takes into the future?
That is the course we are currently setting.
To cope with the challenges of the future we need to promote modern technologies in the agricultural sector instead of having endless debates on ideologies.
If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years.
It is too much of a strain on our farmers' finances.
Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives, which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes.
We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner.
We should not care whether it produces conventionally or organically, so long as it handles resources responsibly.
We should also not care how many animals are kept, so long as those animals are treated well.
The important thing for us must be that we have sufficient good quality food in the future at affordable prices in Europe.
After all, Europe is not alone in the world.
