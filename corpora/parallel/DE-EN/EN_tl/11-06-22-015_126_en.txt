Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and I am pleased that the report bears unmistakably socialist, social democratic hallmarks.
We want a sustainable, ecological and social agricultural policy.
We want greening and we want it in the first pillar.
Cross-compliance and the agro-environmental measures of the system to date are not enough to achieve support for the whole of society, but that is precisely what we need.
Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital.
We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment, because we need people.
People to look after the agricultural sector, as well as the areas upstream and downstream.
The rumours emanating from the Commission concerning plans for massive cuts in rural development in the next multiannual financial framework are not acceptable.
We must continue to work for a strong second pillar in the common agricultural policy (CAP), for rural areas and for Europe.
I would like to issue a general warning to anyone intending to cut agricultural funding.
If this is done, there will be no reform.
Everything will then stay the same as it is.
That will be quite inexplicable to the citizens of Europe.
