Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Dess report represents a major step towards reform of the common agricultural policy.
It is of fundamental importance that we find and deliver an efficient basis for the allocation of agricultural funding.
This includes making allocations in the first pillar, in particular, fairer.
I think it is high time to give up the historical approach.
We have many discussions on how funds are distributed between the Member States, but we also need to discuss how they are allocated within Member States.
There are major imbalances there, too.
Less favoured areas, particularly mountain areas and small farms, need to be given special consideration.
Where less favoured areas are concerned, Commissioner, 12 months ago this House delivered a report on the redefinition of these, in which we were highly critical.
We have heard nothing more about this and I would be very interested to know the Commission's thinking in this respect.
