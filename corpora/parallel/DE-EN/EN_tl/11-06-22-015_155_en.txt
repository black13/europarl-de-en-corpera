We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard to ensure that the new EU agricultural policy is oriented towards ecological standards.
In our view, farmers must be rewarded for providing services to society.
That is exactly what they do, and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market.
Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on.
These payments are important for long-term planning.
By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much.
The report is a good compromise; it is a European compromise.
The question now is what the Commission, and particularly President Barroso, will make of it.
Cutting the funding for environmental protection in particular suggests narrow-mindedness, and I hope Commissioner Ciolo≈ü will be able to talk him out of it.
