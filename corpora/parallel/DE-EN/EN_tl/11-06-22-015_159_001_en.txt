in writing. - A healthy farming sector - and I am not talking here about agro-industrial factories, but rather about small-scale family farms - provides a guarantee of the continued existence of rural culture, nature and our cultural landscape, as well as being essential to securing the supply of food for our population.
Just how important the latter is has been made clear to us once again by the recent enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) crisis.
Consumers make great demands of organic produce.
They expect organic produce to provide ecological balance, which in reality is often more than questionable.
Rather than having an especially positive impact on sustainability, the prudent use of resources, CO2 savings and the protection of livestock, organic produce is often transported right across Europe.
The EU needs to act here - and I speak as a representative of Austria, the leading country in organic farming.
Greater importance must be attached to regional provision and seasonal availability, as well as strict labelling of the origin of foods.
Services provided by agriculture must therefore be recompensed by fair product prices.
Let us not use the common agricultural policy to promote agro-industry; let us promote our farmers instead.
