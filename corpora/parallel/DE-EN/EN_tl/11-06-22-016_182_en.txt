Mr President, the drama surrounding the European Union is turning into a tragedy.
Tomorrow it will probably come down to every last vote.
As someone directly elected by 500 000 voters in Austria, how can I endorse this package?
We can now explain the concept of economic governance even to highly eurosceptic people, but not if it has no democratic legitimacy and there are no checks and balances.
How is it supposed to work if, on the one hand, a protectorate is de facto established - Greece - and on the other the taxpayers in better-off nations have their bonds plundered via the European Central Bank and the bad banks?
How can you explain to people who were adamant that they should not give up the schilling and the mark that we now suddenly need Eurobonds simply because the banks cannot be kept in check - by the way, Mr Hughes, it is very nice that the social democrats have now realised this.
The only way I can imagine that is if we finally give in and say we should have done this, that or the other at the time; if we admit our mistakes and, as Europe burns around us, finally put forward a vision in which we are able to survive globalisation.
I do not see this in the current package, however, and that is why - quite apart from individual points - it is so difficult for any responsibly-minded person to vote for it.
