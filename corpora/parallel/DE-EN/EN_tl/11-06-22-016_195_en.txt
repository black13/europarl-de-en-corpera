Mr President, the more we guarantee in the future European stabilisation mechanism, the more dependent the sound states become on the overindebted periphery of the EU.
Centralisation and a single currency, which could never be a hard currency in the long term, have contributed to the current problems, yet a continuation along this wrong path is precisely what is now being proposed to us as a solution to rescue us.
Economically strong and weak economies are first arbitrarily thrown together in the same pot.
Then we make recourse to various rescue measures - all in vain - and now the whole thing is to culminate in European economic governance.
In my opinion, if overindebted economies want to remain in the euro area then they must be subjected to strict budgetary control instead.
The sort of centralisation which takes the form of Brussels exerting budgetary authority over all the Member States represents improper intervention in the sovereignty of the Member States, however, and would moreover reduce the sound countries of Europe to mere playthings of EU bureaucracy.
In my opinion, we should be bolting the door against Brussels' creeping desire for ever more centralisation.
