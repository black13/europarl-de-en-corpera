Mr President, Mr Langen, I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas.
I am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of selected objectives proposed by Mr Rehn from the EU2020 package, such as research and development and the fight against poverty.
This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems.
