Mr President, since I have no speaking time left, I would ask Mrs Lulling the following question: would you be prepared, Mrs Lulling, to tell Parliament on my behalf that I did not mean all the Greek Members just now, but only the two communist Members who spoke immediately before me, Mr Chountis and Mr Toussas?
Would you be prepared to confirm this to Parliament?
