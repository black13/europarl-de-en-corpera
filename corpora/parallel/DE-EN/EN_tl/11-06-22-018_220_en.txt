Mr President, I am of course happy to say that and to confirm that.
However, I should also like to say this: we are also addressing the Greeks.
In Greece there are only 10 tax exiles who say that they earn more than EUR 1 million per year.
I am addressing them too, just as Mr Langen addressed the communists.
