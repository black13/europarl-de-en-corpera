Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Karas a question.
We are in the midst of a crisis in the single currency.
We have discovered that we have fundamental problems, such as the lack of a common fiscal and economic policy.
These findings by the economists and the academics are quite surprising to me.
Do you really believe, Mr Karas, that no one was aware before the introduction of the single currency of the truism that common governance and political union are also needed?
Perhaps no one was quite brave or honest enough to tell the citizens of Europe this.
