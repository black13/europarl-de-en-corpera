Mr President, the European economic governance package sends out a clear signal that we must avoid debt crises wherever possible in future.
We must take effective measures to prevent the euro from being destabilised.
That is the basic message of this excellent report produced by Mrs Wortmann-Kool.
In order to achieve this, we need greater political coordination between the Member States and strong supervision at an EU level.
This supervision is an essential element of the Europe 2020 strategy.
We must finally make consistent use of the Stability and Growth Pact, which forms the basis for the strong euro, in order to show the Member States with high budget deficits where the limits are.
This is what the citizens of Europe are justifiably calling for and not only in the countries which are supposed to be showing solidarity in the form of constantly growing rescue packages.
We must not allow any more excuses or uneasy compromises to be made when the Member States disclose their convergence programmes and budget policies to one another.
The citizens will only be prepared to accept painful reforms if they are shown a clear picture of the situation, so that they can give their support to the necessary measures.
In contrast to the widely held belief in nationalism, we do not need less Europe, but more.
For example, we should strengthen our Community method which is based on the Treaty of Lisbon.
The Commission must and will accept its responsibilities, identify trends in financial and economic policy at an early stage and ensure that the dialogue between the financial institutions and the policymakers is much more effective than it has been.
