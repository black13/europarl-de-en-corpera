Madam President, firstly, I would like to say on the subject of the export ban that I fully agree with Mr Oettinger.
As there seems to be a broad consensus on this issue, I hope that there will also be agreement when it comes to the vote tomorrow and that we can support the Commission.
It would certainly be very sensible for the Commission and the European Parliament to take a joint approach in this respect.
Secondly, on the issue of public participation, you said, Mr Oettinger, that we do not need detailed regulations in this area.
In principle, you are right.
However, we will also need public participation across national borders.
As we have storage facilities which are close to borders, we cannot simply say that this is where the border is and the issue has nothing to do with the other citizens.
We will probably need common rules in this area, otherwise there may be disputes or people may be excluded and told that the matter does not concern them because they are citizens of another state.
However, we are all citizens of Europe.
As some countries are affected by storage sites of this kind which are close to their borders, it is important for us to establish certain principles and for the Commission to propose some fundamental regulations, so that public participation is taken seriously and is based on common principles.
