Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the speeches show that the Members of the European Parliament have read, digested and evaluated all the details of the proposals.
I do not think that there is a conflict.
I agree that we should include your suggestions in the procedure.
We believe that one point which Mr Swoboda mentioned, the subject of equal cross-border rights for public participation, is important.
It is often the case that final storage sites and nuclear power stations are situated in areas close to national borders for geological or other reasons, which means that the indivisible, equal participation of citizens, transparency and the appropriate rights are all needed from a European perspective.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
I hope that we will have your support tomorrow in the vote here in Parliament.
