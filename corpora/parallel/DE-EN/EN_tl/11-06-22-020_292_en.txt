Madam President, the European Union needs an effective common agricultural policy to enable it to meet society's demands for high standards and, most importantly, to allow it to play a strong, independent role.
Businesses in Europe must remain competitive.
They are faced with major challenges, including fluctuations in the price of raw materials, high production costs and low income levels.
Downward pressure is being exerted on prices by the low production costs and low social, environmental and quality standards in third countries, which cannot be compared with the standards in the EU.
When new trading relationships are established, it is essential for us to protect European production levels by including safeguard clauses.
Clauses of this kind which are used in an industrial context, for example in trade agreements with South Korea concerning the car industry, must also be applied to agriculture.
This is all about establishing a level playing field and equal opportunities for all.
Every country should have the right to focus on the concerns of its citizens, including food security, the environment, reservations about genetic modification and the needs of rural areas, in order to support sustainable agriculture in Europe.
