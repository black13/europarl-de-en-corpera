Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports Mr Eickhout's report because it sends out a strong message both internally and externally that we are not giving up on combating climate change.
It is an internal signal that we are taking seriously the promise made in the 2008 climate package of 20% renewable energy and 20% energy savings.
Mr Oettinger, you have presented us with a proposal today and we have a great deal of work ahead of us.
Both of these measures together will result in a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions within the EU.
Who could be opposed to this?
It is not possible, because it is a package of legislation which we have adopted.
In addition, we have a responsibility to the rest of the world.
We also have to achieve a level of 5% clean development mechanisms (CDMs).
That makes a total of 30%.
I hope that this will not be watered down.
The amendment to paragraph 3 would destroy the entire report.
If this amendment is passed, we will be voting against the report tomorrow.
I hope that this will not be the case, because we need to send out a strong signal.
