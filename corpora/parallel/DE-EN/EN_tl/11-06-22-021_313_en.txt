Madam President, I believe that Fukushima has also changed the world with regard to CO2 emissions.
This is simply about ensuring that we have a reliable energy supply.
We will have to supplement or replace nuclear energy with gas and coal.
Burning gas and coal will, of course, result in CO2 emissions.
Therefore, the level of 20% which we have currently set ourselves is very high.
We should be pleased that we have a reserve in the form of energy efficiency, because this reserve will allow us to support the new forms of energy that we need to replace nuclear power.
Gas and coal will play an important role in replacing nuclear energy.
I believe that the trade unions and the employers are seriously concerned that CO2 policies will result in jobs moving outside Europe and that the entire raw material industry, whether it involves steel, aluminium or paper, will leave Europe, if we introduce regulations that are too strict.
I would like to warn everyone that we are pushing ahead too quickly in this area.
Our policies must be viable and realistic.
