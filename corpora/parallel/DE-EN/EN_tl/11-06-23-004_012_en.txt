rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - Mr President, from the perspective of budgetary control, the European Union is often accused of taking a sloppy approach to spending.
Who is responsible for this?
In 80% of cases it is actually the Member States, which have joint responsibility for the expenditure.
It is often the Member States.
We all remember how the British Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, said to the President of the European Parliament that instead of asking for more money, we must first of all make sure that the money is spent more effectively.
Which country was the biggest offender in 2010?
The United Kingdom.
All the British programmes were stopped in 2010.
Why is that?
It is because the rules are too complicated.
Therefore, I would like to ask my fellow Members and, in particular, the Commission to campaign together with the Member States for simpler rules, for more effective and simpler monitoring systems and for the introduction of new components.
For example, if research policy were to include an award or a prize for a particularly successful, innovative project, this would make it much easier to monitor.
The same applies to cohesion policy, where we could create a leverage effect by providing project-related loans.
There are a lot of opportunities open to us for innovation.
We should take a brave step forward.
