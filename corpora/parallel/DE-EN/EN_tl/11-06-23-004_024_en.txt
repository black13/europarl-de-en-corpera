on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to give my general support to what Mr Lewandowski has said about the fact that in times of crisis the important thing is to ensure the right balance between the need to make savings, the effective use of funding, austerity measures and, at the same time, the readiness and the ability to invest, so that we do not completely stall our economy.
I am in favour of these general guidelines and I believe that they should also be the benchmark for our budget.
Now the question is whether the requirement that Mr Lewandowski has so rightly referred to can actually be met.
There are a number of important areas of criticism from the perspective of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
If we highlight one particular project, the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, it becomes clear that this is one of the projects which is receiving the largest increase in funding in the next budget, in other words, EUR 740 million.
Is this the right signal to be sending out at a time when funding for other research projects, in particular for renewable energy, is being cut?
We want to take seriously the claims made by the Commission and the European Union that they really intend to combat climate change and to move towards the use of renewable energy, but then we see that the funding for this project is given such a high priority and we believe that this is the wrong decision.
For this reason, we were not able to give our support to this negotiating mandate, despite the fact that we believe that much of it is correct.
