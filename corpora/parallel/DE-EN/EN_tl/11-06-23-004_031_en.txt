Mr President, in the draft budget for 2012, for the first time the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy are being carefully interlinked with the budget process.
Therefore, we welcome the work that Mrs Balzani has done.
Youth unemployment in Europe is around 20% on average and in Spain it has even reached the level of 40%.
These are alarming figures.
They make it easy to understand why young people are taking to the streets, for example on the Puerta del Sol, and why we are increasingly talking about a lost generation.
We must do much more for young people.
As far as the Europe 2020 strategy is concerned, according to the Commission, around 43.5% of the funding relating to commitments will help to achieve the 2020 objectives.
Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to open up more opportunities during this year's budget process to redeploy funding with the aim of achieving long-term goals.
