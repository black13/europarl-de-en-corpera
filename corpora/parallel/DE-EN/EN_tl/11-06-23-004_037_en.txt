Mr President, as we all know, the European Union is having to tighten its belt.
This is not just because increasing the size of the budget would be a slap in the face for our citizens in the light of national austerity programmes, but also because next year payments have to be made into the permanent European financial stabilisation mechanism.
This money has to be found from the already cash-strapped national budgets.
When one group wants to circumvent the budgetary constraints by carrying over into the next year the annual budgetary surplus that is normally paid back to the Member States, it is clear that this is an attempt to pull the wool over the citizens' eyes.
This would result in an even greater increase in the budget than that proposed by the Commission.
It may well be that spending is planned for many multi-annual programmes and the relevant funding cannot be cut at present because the EU would otherwise be open to accusations of breach of contract.
However, in my opinion there is plenty of scope available for making savings.
In addition to reducing the number of EU agencies, the most important thing is to improve the procedures for combating fraud.
Simply by recovering amounts of money that have incorrectly been paid out, we would be able to ease the strain on the budget significantly.
