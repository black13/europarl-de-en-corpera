on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Mr Hahn, ladies and gentlemen, I have to contradict the previous speaker.
The central message for the Commission from Mr Pieper's report is that European cohesion policy brings its own added value for Europe.
It is the instrument which holds the EU together at its heart.
This is obvious to the citizens in all the regions of Europe and, in particular, in the very disadvantaged regions and the crisis regions.
The decentralised and participative structure of cohesion policy allows it to make a decisive contribution to creating a resource-efficient, low-carbon, innovative and social Europe.
In contrast to the rapporteur's personal opinion, I believe that the instruments of cohesion policy, together with intelligent investment, can also help to combat climate change and poverty.
Therefore, we are disappointed that, despite the attempts which the rapporteur has made and is still making, these two aspects were omitted from the report.
I would like to say to the Commission that a significant majority of this House is in favour of these two aspects.
Unlike the rapporteur, and I am saying this as a German, I am of the opinion that the Commission proposal for an intermediate category will result in a balanced and transparent structure for future cohesion policy in the light of the dramatic problems in some regions.
It is ridiculous to believe that savings can be made in this area.
It is also important for Germany that the European Union continues to develop in a harmonious way, because this brings benefits for Germany.
This is why we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are voting in favour of an intermediate category.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
