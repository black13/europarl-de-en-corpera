Madam President, cohesion policy will only be successful in future if we face up to certain problems now.
Firstly, what is happening to the Member States that are permanently in breach of the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact?
In these cases, the Structural Funds cannot have the desired effect.
Instead, the money simply disappears and the EU degenerates into a transfer union which is also a bottomless pit.
Anyone who receives regional subsidies must also adhere to the rules.
Secondly, the Structural Fund must not be centralised under the aegis of the Commission.
This will increase and not reduce the amount of administrative work and the result will be that expensive, new, decentralised agencies will be established.
Thirdly, we need greater efficiency in the use of structural money.
There must be clearer objectives and more frequent evaluations and the recipients themselves must take more responsibility.
The principle of cofinancing must be firmly established.
Fourthly, in addition to all the cultural, social, religious and foreign policy concerns, the accession of Turkey would place a massive burden on the Cohesion Fund.
In realistic terms, it would blow the budget.
We know this to be a fact.
It is not just something that people say.
Turkey has been receiving billions of euros of structural money for years.
We need to take a critical look at this approach.
To summarise, in future I would like to see regional subsidies ending up where they are really needed, in other words, in innovative projects which produce clear results, in small and medium-sized businesses and, most importantly, with citizens in the regions and the cities.
