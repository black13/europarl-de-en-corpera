Madam President, Mr Hahn, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of regional policy has been highlighted today.
Our cohesion and consolidation policy must cover all European regions.
By regions, I also mean the people that live in these regions.
That is a very important point.
In the course of some of our delegations to the regions we have seen how valuable European funding is for regional development, for achieving social cohesion and also for women's policies and gender equality.
I can only encourage the European Union to offer more of the programmes in future which are received very positively by the people and which are aimed at precisely these objectives, just as we have established in the process of investigating the implementation.
We need people in the European regions to have a feeling of ownership.
We are now in a phase where we are discussing intermediate regions.
This is very important because Europe has helped to ensure that jobs have been created in these regions.
My understanding of growth is that it is primarily sustainable growth if it brings social justice.
Cohesion policy lies at the heart of European policy.
