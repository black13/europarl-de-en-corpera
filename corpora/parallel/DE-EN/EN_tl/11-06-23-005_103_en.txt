Mr President, I would like to raise two points in relation to cohesion policy and regional policy.
The first is the dispute regarding the so-called intermediate category, which runs very much along national lines.
I believe it is essential for us to consider the following points in relation to this discussion: regional policy and economic development policy must offer an incentive system so that the relevant regions can develop.
If the system is set up in such a way that a dependency on continuous subsidy develops without requiring effort among the regions to obtain the relevant resources, then I believe that such an intermediate category would be an unmitigated disaster because it will always be a bone of contention and offers no rationale.
However, I do believe that it makes sense for Objective 1 regions that lose their Objective 1 status to continue to receive special support.
I also believe it makes sense that a region that is experiencing financial and economic difficulties for specific reasons should also receive support.
What we do not want is a continuous subsidy mentality; instead we should offer help and support to the regions that need it.
