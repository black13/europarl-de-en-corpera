on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I have asked to be allowed to speak because I am sure that my fellow Members will understand me when I say on behalf of my group, and I am sure my other fellow Members will agree, that you are taking on a difficult role - you are better aware of this than we are - and that you have our complete solidarity in your new position because, whatever our political opinions, we all share the same desire.
That desire is that the wonderful country that you serve as Foreign Minister should overcome its serious crisis as quickly as possible with our help.
We need Greece.
We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your country and with you.
Mr Vice President, Foreign Minister, Stavros, what I would like say at a personal level is: you have not only been a good friend and a great colleague, but have also enriched all our lives in every possible way.
Thank you for our many years of work together and good luck, Stavros.
(Applause)
