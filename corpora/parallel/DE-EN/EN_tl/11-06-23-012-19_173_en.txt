rapporteur. - Madam President, I want to keep my remarks short.
The vote actually took place in March and what we are now witnessing is the final vote.
Since we took three years to reach this compromise, I would like to point out that the Council and Commission cooperated particularly effectively here.
In particular, the Hungarian and Belgian Presidencies did some really excellent work.
My fellow Members from the other groups, Mrs Gebhardt, Mr Rochefort, Mrs Turunen, Mr Triantaphyllides and Mr Wieland and above all you, Madam President, as fellow rapporteur, have made an enormous contribution.
I would like to thank you warmly for this.
I believe that this directive will represent a significant step in developing the internal market in the interests of both consumers and businesses.
