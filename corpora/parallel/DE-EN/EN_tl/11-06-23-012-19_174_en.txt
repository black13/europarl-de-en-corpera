on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, as we know, this is a democratic institution, and from time to time we need to apply the rules of democracy.
That is why I have chosen to speak again now that this package is to be concluded because I have an important question to ask about this package on behalf of my group.
You have a clear majority for the line you are taking here.
There is no doubt about this and we have accepted this situation, even though we do not agree with you.
However, because the process is not yet concluded, I have one question.
The answer to this question will have a major bearing on how our group approaches further procedures.
We have now raised two important points in the form of questions to the Council in the Wortmann-Kool report and the Ferreira report, setting out the position of Parliament and asking the Council now to change its position.
That is all well and good.
I would now like to ask you the following question: what do you intend to do if the Council does not change its position?
Will you reject the package?
Will we have a second reading?
If so, then we are ready to fight this all the way with you.
Or will you approve the package nonetheless?
In the light of this postponement I believe that this is an extremely important question for Parliament.
