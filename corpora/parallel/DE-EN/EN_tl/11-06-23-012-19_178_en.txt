on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I read a moving appeal for the future of the European Union by three of my fellow Members in a German daily newspaper.
Such a show of unity is generally always very moving.
However, it is evident when it comes to the regulation of the financial markets and the balancing of social justice that this unity is weak on detail.
I believe that we should not try to conceal political dissent at this point, but rather that we should argue and debate in a transparent way on the direction of policy, even in times of crisis, as a service to the citizens of Europe.
