Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the European Parliament is a very hard-working body, however we need to pay more attention to a balance in the voting times, so that we do not have a situation where there is nothing to vote on one day and an enormous number of votes the next.
That is why I am now proposing that we should stop voting now and defer the remaining business to the next plenary sitting.
(Applause)
There are no issues on the agenda that are so pressing that a vote is absolutely necessary today.
We have already voted on the legislative points.
I believe that this was the most important thing for now.
(Applause)
