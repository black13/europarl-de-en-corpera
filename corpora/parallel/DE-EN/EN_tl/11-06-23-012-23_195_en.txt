Madam President, Mr Weber's motion makes good sense.
We have completed a truly enormous programme with some major, significant reports.
We now no longer have any legislative reports to vote on.
It is already after half past one.
It would be best to postpone the non-legislative reports to the July part-session.
This would be no great loss.
