Madam President, there is a reason why we have cohesion policy, and such policy has a clear beginning and it must also have an end.
I believe that the reason cohesion policy exists is to balance living standards and economic development throughout the European Union.
That is why it is right to subsidise and support regions that find themselves below the general economic standard.
However, it is equally important to ensure that these financial resources are being correctly deployed, in other words that they are having the desired effect.
This report is very important to me because it also contains an analysis, thus providing the basis for conclusions for the next two support periods.
I would like to mention one example: in my particular region in Eastern Germany, cohesion policy has had a significant effect since 1990.
We have witnessed development there and I see it as a definite success when we reach a point where we can say that these regions now need a phasing out programme because this means that living standards have risen there.
