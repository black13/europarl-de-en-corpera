Madam President, we need to achieve greater efficiency between the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other structural funds.
I believe that it is extremely important that we should have different funds.
Naturally, these funds should have different objectives and targeted approaches.
I believe that it is extremely important that we have included the regions here and that the European Union is setting down guidelines that can be implemented in the regions and applied accordingly.
However, it is just as important that this targeted approach should also look at how matters are implemented in the regions, so that these funds do not impede one another, so that we do not duplicate subsidies, so that we do not promote nonsensical programmes - in other words we must coordinate the objectives pursued with these funds.
I regard this as increasing efficiency.
I expect that we shall continue to work in this area and that more reports and results will be presented to us.
