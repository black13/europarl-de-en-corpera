Madam President, I believe that the approach to excessive deficits is a bit like a football match: if a set of rules is established, then these must be adhered to.
It is not enough to look each other straight in the eye and say 'we promise to obey all the rules'.
Life has changed.
In other words, if the rules of the game are broken, then penalties and punishments must be handed out.
Of course, this cannot be achieved with a democratic decision.
Let me come back to the image of the football match.
Just imagine that a foul has been committed.
The referee makes a decision here.
Imagine what would happen if the referee were to hold a vote among the players each time to determine whether this really was a foul.
This would be impossible.
That is why we need a clear decision-making process.
What do we do when someone breaks the rules?
Finally, I would like to emphasise that of course we also need solidarity.
Rather than simply punishing the one who has broken the rules, we also need to help them to get back on the straight-and-narrow.
