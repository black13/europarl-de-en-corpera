Madam President, please forgive me for demanding your attention so often.
Unfortunately, this was not my week with the catch-the-eye procedure.
I kept missing out.
There were a couple of things I wanted to say about this point too, however I am happy overall that we have passed this directive.
I also voted in favour.
I am also pleased that we have been able to strengthen consumer rights and have included so-called door-to-door selling, because a lot of shady practices are to be found there.
However I would once again ask that we should remember the problem of bureaucracy when implementing this law.
In Germany we have a particularly large number of small and medium-sized businesses.
Although these businesses are not involved in door-to-door selling, they naturally make frequent deals with customers that are concluded with a handshake.
This has been the practice for hundreds of years.
We need to take care that we do not overburden these SMEs with excessive bureaucracy.
To restate the point, I am happy and voted in favour of the directive.
