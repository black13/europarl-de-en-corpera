Madam President, I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess.
If agricultural policy is to remain competitive and become more environmentally sound, it must be financed in an appropriate way.
I would emphasise the word 'appropriate'.
'Appropriate' applies just as much to the farmers as to the taxpayers.
I believe that the establishment of competitive structures in the agricultural sector is something to be expressly welcomed.
Taken in this context, capping direct payments is a counterproductive measure.
It is not our job to destroy competitive structures.
I grew up in what was formerly East Germany, where the politicians dictated operating structures and all production data to the farmers in detail.
This ended in state bankruptcy.
We must never allow such a situation to be repeated; I wish to spare the European Union such a catastrophe, which is why I am against capping and also why I ultimately abstained from voting on this report.
