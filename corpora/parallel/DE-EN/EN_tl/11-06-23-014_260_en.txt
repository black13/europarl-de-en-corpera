in writing. - Mr Draghi is a completely unsuitable candidate for the top post at the European Central Bank.
He was a Vice-President and Director of US investment bank Goldman Sachs, where his responsibilities included Europe and contact with the national governments there.
This was at precisely the time when Greece supplied the EU with the falsified figures in relation to its deficit and budget.
In this context, Goldman Sachs is accused of having advised the Greeks in this falsification.
In addition to these shady dealings, Mr Draghi is also particularly open to criticism for his uncompromising stance against a debt haircut in Greece and in favour of the bail-out.
As a representative of a southern euro area Member State which is faced with enormous financial problems, his appointment will also send out completely the wrong signal to the markets and our citizens, who do not want a transfer union, but rather a stable currency.
The right candidate would have been Germany's Axel Weber.
However, he did not even put his name forward for the post because he recognised the wrong-headedness of the measures now being taken with the blessing of Mr Draghi.
The nomination of Mr Draghi can be seen as yet another nail in the coffin of the euro and a threat to the EU as a whole.
