in writing. - A customs union has existed between the Principality of Andorra and the European Union since 1990 on the basis of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters.
The current amendment proposes that the Joint Committee should define measures for implementing customs security provisions.
Prior declaration will no longer be required if the EU and Andorra each guarantee the level of security in their own sovereign territory.
The expansion of the internal market standard will bring benefits to the citizens and businesses of both the EU and Andorra alike.
