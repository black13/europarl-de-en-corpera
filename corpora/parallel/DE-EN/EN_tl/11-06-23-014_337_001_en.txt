in writing. - This recommendation deals with the Agreement on civil aviation safety, signed on 6 May 2009 on behalf of the (then) European Community.
At present, only six Member States have bilateral agreements on product certification with Canada.
These will become redundant when the Agreement on civil aviation safety between the EU and Canada comes into force.
The strong safeguard measures allow the acceptance of the findings of the other competent authorities to be suspended or the Agreement to be terminated should this become advisable.
It would be possible to terminate the Agreement as a whole or just in part.
The Agreement is to be supported provided the product approval procedures become shorter and simpler without compromising on safety standards.
