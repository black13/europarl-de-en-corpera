in writing. - The Agreement between the EU and Canada on civil aviation safety, which is a supplement to the Air Transport Agreement with Canada, is intended to remove technical trade barriers.
In essence, the aim is to minimise duplicated assessments, tests and controls insofar as possible and to enable uniform certification.
A joint committee is to be established to find possible solutions to problems that arise during implementation.
Collaboration and mutual recognition of certification are to apply to the areas of airworthiness and maintenance.
For the future, there is potential for unlimited mutual recognition.
In addition to the joint committee, which is to deal with practical problems and disputes, there are also plans for joint inspections and investigations and the exchange of safety data.
It is to be welcomed that strong safeguard measures will allow the acceptance of the findings of the other competent authority to be suspended or the Agreement to be terminated should this become necessary.
The Agreement is to be supported provided the product-approval procedures become shorter and simpler without compromising on safety standards.
