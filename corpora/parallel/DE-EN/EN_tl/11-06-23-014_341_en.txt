in writing. - The Agreement is intended to minimise duplicated assessments, tests and controls by enabling both parties to use the certification system of the other.
This mutual trust in the system operated by the contracting party is based on an approximation of the requirements and regulatory processes, as well as regular consultations between the parties and the establishment of a joint committee.
Because of the shorter and more cost-effective product-approval procedures permitted, the companies working in that sector will save millions each year and will be able to increase their competitiveness.
The Agreement will make the market more competitive and safer, because enforcement authorities will be required to cooperate more extensively.
