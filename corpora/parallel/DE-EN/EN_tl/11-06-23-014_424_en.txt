in writing. - The targets identified in terms of economic growth, employment and competitiveness cannot be attained through the planned measures because the economic development of the Member States is being stifled.
A framework for controlling economic policy can perhaps be implemented by the various constituent Member States, but not by the EU as a whole, because the strength of the different national economies varies so much.
That is why the euro area should be dissolved as quickly as possible.
The strong states should unite to form a new monetary union and the others should return to their own currencies.
A call for the surveillance of national economic policies in the present situation would mean socialist state intervention, something that failed in the past and that is one of the reasons for the current financial difficulties in the euro area.
There is little democratic legitimisation for such measures, which is why I voted against this report.
