in writing. - Monitoring budgets should not simply involve gaining access to correct facts and figures.
Of course the Commission should also issue recommendations, for example in relation to reducing debt.
However, under no circumstances should we allow Member States to be dictated to on how to spend their money.
European governance is not something the citizens of the EU want, nor is it provided for in the Union's Treaties.
It represents clear contempt for the principle of subsidiarity.
It is not governance by the EU that will help the affected countries to recover economically, but rather a withdrawal from the euro area.
I am unable to support this motion for the reasons stated.
