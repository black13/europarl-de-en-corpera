in writing. - The intention behind the report - ensuring budgetary discipline in the Member States - is to be welcomed.
While I have heard the message, I am not sure I believe it.
There is also a silent majority in Europe that agrees with me.
Interventions in the budgets of the Member States should be rejected.
Different approaches and solutions must be tried and should be discussed by Parliament as a matter of urgency, something that has not happened so far.
We must draw the right conclusions from the wrong turns that have been taken in recent years.
As long as no alternatives are proposed, I am unable to approve this course of action and cannot vote in favour of the motion.
