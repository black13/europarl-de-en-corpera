in writing. - I seriously doubt that the Stability and Growth Pact, which has failed to work so far, will suddenly become a panacea in one of the most difficult economic phases in the history of the EU.
Although this would be desirable, in view of the current crisis, it remains a chimera.
We have reached a stage where we can no longer afford further rescue packages.
Moreover, dipping into national treasuries and using taxpayers' money to save budgetary delinquents is very unfair.
I therefore voted against this report.
