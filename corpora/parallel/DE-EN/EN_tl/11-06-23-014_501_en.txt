in writing. - The dishonesty of the Greek Government in presenting false information in relation to its budgetary situation has contributed to the current crisis with the euro and the EU.
Following the last rescue package, the socialist government in Greece failed to implement the painful, yet necessary, structural changes.
All of the planned European governance measures aim to wrest power from the Member States, increase the influence of the central powers in Brussels and restrict democracy in Europe.
The lack of participation by the banks and investors, who made healthy profits in recent years, shows how much influence these groups actually wield over the political elite in Europe.
While the top ten thousand will cash in - thus, all the payments to Greece will not go to the Greek people, but will instead line the pockets of investors - the people of Europe are being weighed down with more and more unjustified financial burdens.
Because this should be roundly rejected, I voted against this report.
