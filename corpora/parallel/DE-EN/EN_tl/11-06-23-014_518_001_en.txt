in writing. - I voted in favour of the results of the negotiations on the Consumer Rights Directive because it was possible to find a balanced compromise between the interests of both consumers and the business community.
By harmonising consumer rights, we are helping to strengthen the internal market, thereby also strengthening Europe.
The directive enables businesses to safely cross borders, taking the internal market one step closer to becoming a European home market.
The new rules offer consumers more security and confidence when they make purchases, particularly using the Internet.
However, sadly, some provisions miss the point.
I would have welcomed it if the Council in particular had agreed on more objective solutions that were sympathetic to small businesses.
Above all, it could have been possible to add the procurement element to the definition of off-premises contracts.
