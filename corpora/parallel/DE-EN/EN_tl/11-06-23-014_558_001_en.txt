in writing. - Some time ago, I drafted a motion calling for greater safety for nuclear reactors in the Danube region.
After all, the Danube region, which lies right in the heart of Europe, is where some of the most dangerous reactors are located: Temelin, Bohunice, Mochovce, Dukovany and Paks.
The mostly outdated construction methods used have led to poor safety standards.
Dangerous incidents occur with alarming regularity, but are mostly swept under the carpet.
Neighbouring countries like Austria are often not even informed when an incident occurs.
Even in the environmental impact assessment procedure there is insufficient consultation or no consultation whatsoever with neighbouring states.
However, funds are now being made available for the drafting and financing of plans for the closure of productive reactors.
That is why I abstained.
