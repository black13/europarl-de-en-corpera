in writing. - I have my reservations about the management of radioactive waste and, although this initiative contains some good ideas, it is not enough to solve the underlying problem, which is why I abstained from voting.
Even though the nuclear industry has spent five decades looking for solutions to radioactive waste, we are, in this respect, still at square one.
Nuclear waste is transported the length and breadth of Europe in convoys that cost the taxpayer millions, entailing a high risk of accidents.
Risk-free storage over a period of millennia is an impossibility and such an idea takes the argument about clean and cheap electricity from nuclear power to absurd lengths.
Nuclear dumping sites in the immediate vicinity of nuclear power stations and/or in areas where earthquakes are prevalent are particularly risky.
Worryingly, in the case of the Krsko storage facility, both factors apply.
