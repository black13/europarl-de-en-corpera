in writing. - The EU needs to tighten its belt.
This is not just because increasing the budget would be a slap in the face for our citizens in the light of national austerity programmes, but also because next year payments are to be made into the permanent euro stabilisation mechanism.
This money needs to be found from the already cash-strapped national budgets.
It may well be that spending is scheduled for many multi-annual programmes and the relevant funding cannot be cut at present because the EU would otherwise be open to accusations of breach of contract.
However, there is plenty of scope available for savings.
It is for these reasons that I have voted against this draft budget.
