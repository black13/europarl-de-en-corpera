in writing. - The line being taken by the governments of the core Members States of the EU, the European Commission and the European Central Bank is becoming increasingly clear.
The Commission's proposals primarily aim to tighten up the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact.
In future, compliance with the Maastricht criteria is to be enforced though early warnings and drastic penalties.
However, this pact has not worked in the past and probably will not work in the future either.
It is about time that we concentrated on stable, sovereign national economies and reducing the national debt of individual states.
It is outrageous that the same hard-working countries should again and again be required to pay for the mistakes of others.
