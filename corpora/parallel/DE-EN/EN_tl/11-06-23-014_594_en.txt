in writing. - In voting on the CAP report, we are deciding on the cornerstones of future EU agricultural policy.
I welcome the decision that agricultural policy is to become more sustainable, that the competitiveness of European agriculture is to be strengthened and that a balance is to be sought between old and new Member States.
I am vehemently opposed to cuts in the EU agricultural budget because I believe that the common agricultural policy must remain a key area in the EU budget.
For the citizens of the EU, the services are essential for food quality and safety, animal welfare and environmental standards and for the vitality of rural areas.
The market does not reward these additional services.
Agricultural funds are service-related payments that enable reliable planning for farming families.
It is essential that we should adhere to the established 'two-pillar model'.
Only the interplay between the first and second pillars enables both innovative competitiveness and sustainability.
The second pillar is a strong element for sustainable agriculture.
Switching compensatory allowances for disadvantaged areas to the first pillar would have disastrous consequences for most regions.
I welcome the fact that small farms are to receive greater support by grading payments.
A ceiling for direct payments is also open to debate.
Today's fundamental decision by Parliament defines the parameters to be used by the European Commission as a template when drafting the legislative package.
Agricultural policy must remain a key element of European policy.
