Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge a vote in favour of this report to ensure that we have a broad basis for future negotiations with the other institutions and offer my thanks for so doing.
I would also like to thank you for your excellent cooperation with the other groups and with the other rapporteurs.
Thank you very much for your patience.
(Applause)
