Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important that we should discuss the situation in the Middle East this week.
We all agree on that.
But I think it is equally important that we discuss Chernobyl this week.
I cannot support this proposal.
The whole world is talking about the tenth anniversary.
A major conference was held in Vienna.
There was a tribunal.
And then we say we will postpone it to whenever.
I really think it would show Parliament in a poor light if we do not discuss it on Wednesday.
We must not turn it into a competition between Chernobyl and the proposal to ask the Council to report on the situation in the Middle East this week and to debate on it, and then put Chernobyl in second place!
There are various other options.
We can listen to the Council on the subject on Wednesday morning, but please not just in a week's time.
At a time when the whole world is discussing Chernobyl and the effects of that disaster, we in this Parliament cannot say, we shall hold back and say nothing about it!
