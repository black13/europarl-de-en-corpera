Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are doing here is developing a European industrial policy for a particular sector.
In the pharmaceutical sector, we need to reconcile a number of different interests.
First of all, there is our common heritage of biodiversity and acquired scientific knowledge, the latter being a basic prerequisite for the development of pharmaceutical products.
Secondly, there are the interests of society, since our social security and healthcare systems are greatly affected by price levels in this sector.
Thirdly, there is our common interest in lasting innovation for the future, which means that we will always need industrialists, and they in turn will always need a challenge.
Big profits are not enough, otherwise we would have seen a flood of industrial innovation in Europe in recent years, which has clearly not been the case.
Those who have invested in the sector, however, quite legitimately wish to see a return on their capital.
Mrs Soltwedel-Sch√§fer's report, as adopted by the committee, contains a number of acceptable compromises, and I think it would be most inadvisable to reject these in the hope that giving the industry carte blanche is the right thing to do.
It would be wrong for us to introduce a German-style industrial policy which simply allows the economy of this sensitive sector to govern itself.
What we need is to achieve a democratic balance of interests which presents a challenge to the pharmaceutical industry, and thereby stimulates the innovation that is required.
