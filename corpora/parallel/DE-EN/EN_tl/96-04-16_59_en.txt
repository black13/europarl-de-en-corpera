Every time drugs are discussed in the European Union, tempers flare - this time between France and the Netherlands.
I am alarmed at how all the protagonists in the debate portray their own opinion as the only legitimate one.
This is an accusation often levelled at Mr Chirac, but in my experience it is at least as true of those, within and outside this House, who make a fetish of liberalization.
As far as the PPE Group is concerned, the contradiction that is often drawn between help and punishment does not exist.
Both are necessary if the problem is to be tackled truly effectively.
The Swedish model seems to me the most successful one at present.
Throughout the debate today, and indeed on other occasions, I have heard no convincing argument against the Swedish model, and I see no reason why it should not be a model for Europe as a whole.
In the light of that, I am also irritated by the debate between my country - Germany - and the Netherlands.
Our Foreign Minister, Mr Kinkel, said recently in The Hague that nobody wished to interfere in the drugs policy of the Netherlands, but the German Government as a whole takes a different view.
I wonder whether Mr Kinkel has forgotten that we are in the third year after Maastricht.
The dialogue about combating drugs is not interference: it is European domestic policy.
The drugs problem must be tackled at European level, firstly by means of prevention - that is what we are discussing today - secondly through better cooperation in policing, via Interpol, and thirdly through a common development policy to create alternatives in the countries where drug crops are cultivated.
To my mind, the third point is of particular importance.
I hope that everyone who is following the debate today will also be listening when this question is discussed on Thursday, not because I am the rapporteur, but because the drugs problem cannot be tackled effectively without alternatives for the countries where drug crops are grown.
