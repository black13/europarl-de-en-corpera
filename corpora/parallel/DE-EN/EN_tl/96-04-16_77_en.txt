Madam President, I should like to support the amendment.
I do not think there is any contradiction here.
The committee approved the table unanimously because, in the table, priorities are established very clearly, perhaps more clearly than in the broader brush-strokes of the text.
As I said, however, there is no contradiction here, and the committee approved this table unanimously.
