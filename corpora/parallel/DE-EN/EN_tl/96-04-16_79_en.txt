Madam President, the table I referred to was, of course, that of the committee, not the table submitted by Mr Soulier and the PPE.
It is really quite straightforward, because the committee presented and approved this table, not the one that was submitted by the PPE.
I would therefore ask that the vote be retaken, because what I said clearly created some confusion.
So to recap and to make it quite clear: the committee's table is not the same as that of the PPE.
