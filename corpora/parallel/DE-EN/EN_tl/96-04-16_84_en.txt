Madam President, although the House is empty, there is a great deal of noise going on behind me, but I am none the less pleased that the House has accepted my report, and that we have approved the legislative measures in the SAVE programme.
I would call on the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to follow Parliament's lead in this case, for once, because we have clearly seen that without legislation there is absolutely no movement: that has been demonstrated with regard to CO2 reduction and energy efficiency.
There has been no movement on the THERMIE programme, a programme on renewable energy, which is being held up by the Council.
Despite its high-sounding political pronouncements around the world, and despite having signed up to the Rio and Berlin treaties, the Council is blocking the one programme - THERMIE II - which is concerned with renewable energy.
It is therefore all the more important that we, as a Parliament, get it implemented and make the Council and the Commission put their money where their mouth is.
Otherwise, we in the EU will gradually become a laughing stock!
I would not go so far as to call us liars, but absolutely nothing is happening!
High-sounding words about the need for energy efficiency and CO2 reduction are being bandied about, but nothing is being done!
It is all hot air.
That is why the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy included the legislative element in SAVE II.
So, to repeat my advice to the Council and the Commission: take your lead from the committee - it is giving you sound advice!
Otherwise, we shall make problems when it comes to the budget.
