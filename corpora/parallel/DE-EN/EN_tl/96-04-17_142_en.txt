Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to use this debate to express my bewilderment at the fact that at last week's conference in Vienna, ten years after the reactor accident in Chernobyl, there was neither any new evidence presented on the overall extent of the disaster nor agreement on the immediate closure of the reactor complex in question.
In Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania, there are still 15 reactors of the same design as Chernobyl in operation.
The long-term effects of the disaster on man and the environment have still not been researched.
There are still the most enormous difficulties involved in providing proper medical care for the victims.
That is why I am highly sceptical about the special meeting of the G7 in Moscow on 19 and 20 April devoted exclusively to nuclear safety.
I appeal to the four G7 members that also belong to the European Union not to deviate at the meeting from the line laid down in the memorandum of understanding and to be even more vehement than hitherto in demanding the closure of these reactors.
Unfortunately, as in the case of the resumption of work on the Mochovce plant in Slovakia, which is of special concern to me as an Austrian, we see that the nuclear industry is not interested in seeking realistic alternatives but prefers to carry on the unprofitable and hazardous construction of the nuclear plant in order to complete a showpiece project for nuclear power stations in eastern Europe and to earn itself kudos.
There is a conclusive and authoritative study which demonstrates that upgrading the Mochovce reactor to western safety standards is not only shortsighted but downright impossible.
The aim of this interest group does not seem to be the prevention of further accidents on the scale of Chernobyl but rather the creation of new nuclear risk factors and sheer profiteering.
I call on the Commission to reexamine the Mochovce project in terms of its danger to Europe and, if need be, to take the necessary steps to halt it.
