Mr President, have we not learned anything in the last ten years?
Scientific evidence shows that 60 000 deaths were directly caused by the after-effects of the Chernobyl accident and not 30.
Perhaps they were the ones who died immediately.
Innumerable people became ill.
Six hundred thousand people had to be evacuated.
The EBRD now wants to make one billion dollars available for the completion of two reactors in Ukraine.
That is the price for the closure of Chernobyl.
How long shall we continue to support this extremely hazardous technology with its frighteningly inadequate safeguards?
Two days ago we learned that Mochovce is to be built with Russian and Czech money.
I just marvel at all the things for which Russia has money.
French and German companies such as Siemens will help to build this dangerous nuclear centre.
That is scandalous!
In Germany the same sort of reactor did not receive an operating licence.
It is truly scandalous!
Mochovce is a nightmare!
It endangers the whole of central Europe.
Vienna is almost within sight of it.
How many million deaths does the EU need before it will agree to change its energy policy?
We need different solutions in Ukraine, and we need different solutions throughout central Europe.
I do not want membership of the EU to be conferred on any country that jeopardizes the health and safety of the people of another country.
I now ask the Council whether its policy on Slovakia is changing as regards the talks on Union membership.
