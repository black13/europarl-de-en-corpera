Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak today about what lessons we have learned from the Chernobyl disaster - the full extent of which we are, of course, as yet unaware, since we do not know what consequences will be suffered by unborn generations or how the contaminated landscape will develop in years to come - I have to conclude that we have not learned the necessary lessons and that many years have passed without anyone taking the action that really ought to have been taken in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster.
How else could we speak today of the sarcophagus having so many cracks that repairs are necessary, and how else could we be saying today that it will take several years before the other Chernobyl reactors are decommissioned?
Commissioner, when you speak of reactor safety, it strikes me that safety cannot only mean better knowledge of the effects of radioactivity, but that reactor safety can be achieved when unsafe reactors are closed and when we in the European Union provide the countries of eastern and central Europe with appropriate financial and other resources, and by 'other resources' I mean energy-supply programmes, development programmes for different sources of energy.
Nuclear safety is indispensable, not only to the countries of central and eastern Europe but also to all the countries of the Union and the whole of Europe.
As an Austrian, I also wish to take this opportunity to express my total incomprehension of the decision reached by the Slovakian Government to press on with a technologically dubious plan to complete the construction of an unsafe reactor with funds that could have been put to better use a year ago to build a gas-turbine plant with which the energy demand of the population could have been met.
Madam President, let me just say this in conclusion: I understand the fascination that nuclear energy holds for scientists, but I believe we have become bogged down and that the lesson of Chernobyl would be to make an orderly retreat from this nuclear quagmire.
