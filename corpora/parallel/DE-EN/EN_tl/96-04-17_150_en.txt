Madam President, the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl is full of flowery statements and costly conferences, but when it comes to discussing concrete international aid, we are fed with lies, sweet talk and duplicity.
What has happened to international responsibility when the IAEA in Vienna presents an international Chernobyl project based on the assumption that the health of the inhabitants of that region is not seriously endangered by the reactive contamination of Chernobyl?
And this is done despite the fact that 200 reputable scientists from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine have already identified an increase in cancer, leukaemia and organic brain damage.
For Belarus, the hardest-hit country, the equivalent of 31 annual budgets would be needed to establish some degree of control over the impact on man and nature.
That country cannot possibly afford to take such action.
That is why Belarus is pursuing a policy of rehabilitation, has cut social welfare and has legalized resettlement, and the whole thing is supported by TACIS aid, which is promoting economic development in highly irradiated areas.
As far as financial accountability is concerned, the nuclear operators could be made to bear responsibility for the risks by means of an international aid fund stocked by a risk levy on those operators.
