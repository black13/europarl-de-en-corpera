Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should not like to miss this opportunity to thank the presidency for their kind and helpful comments.
It was particularly valuable to learn that the Union had sent observers to the elections in Palestine.
From time to time you tell us, Mr President-in-Office, what the troika has been doing and what has been happening with the American delegation in Rome.
Now, in the light of your comments, I can better understand why the French Government chose to go it alone.
I wish to begin with the common ground that has characterized the Middle East policy of the European Parliament for many years.
First of all, the European Parliament has unequivocally and emphatically condemned every act of terrorism, including today's Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel by the Hizbollah.
Secondly, irrespective of party and national allegiance, we in the European Parliament have welcomed and supported the peace process between Israel and the PLO.
Let me repeat the gist of what the late Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, said at the peace rally to explain his belief in the peace process and his commitment to it only a few minutes before he was assassinated.
'For many years' , he told the rally, ' I fought for my country on various fronts and gave everything to enforce a military solution for the sake of Israel's security and her right to live within secure borders.
Today I know that only the peace process, not military action, can achieve this.'
Mr Rabin, as a former hawk, was more able than anyone to convince people that there is only one way to solve the Israel-Palestine problem.
His conviction and his commitment to peace cost him his life.
Deaths, misery, expulsion and suffering are on our agenda today.
That is why this Parliament, which has spoken such clear words in the past, must turn to Israel today and tell it to stop the bombing and the expulsions in Lebanon right now!
