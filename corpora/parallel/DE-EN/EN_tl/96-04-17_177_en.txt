Mr President, in the path of justice is life, says the Bible in chapter 12 of the Book of Proverbs.
That is the motto of next year's congress of the Protestant Church in Germany.
Without justice there is no life and no peace.
It is in three different capacities that I address the following requests to the Middle East, to its competent representatives: first of all as Europeans we have to agree that we too are responsible for stability and peace in the region; secondly, as German Europeans we have a special responsibility to ensure that peace reigns in Israel and that the State of Israel can live within secure borders; thirdly, as chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries and the Gulf States, I shall be in the region next month with colleagues from the European Parliament, visiting Syria, Jordan and Lebanon; our official parliamentary delegation will convey the clear message that we want peace in the Middle East and that anyone who destroys peace there through acts of terrorism will thereby become an adversary and an enemy of Europe.
I urge the Hizbollah and their backers to stop firing on northern Israel, to call a halt to terrorism and to accept the offer of negotiations.
We want to amend point 5 of the resolution, which I believe would make it acceptable.
Our aim as Europeans is not only to secure peace in Europe but to secure stability and peace all around us, not only for Christian reasons but because it is better for all concerned that peace should prevail in this and other regions of the world.
We Europeans believe in the peace process that Mr Rabin initiated, and we shall do everything in our power to ensure the success of that process.
