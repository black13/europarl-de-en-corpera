Mr President-in-Office, your answers have been excellent, but I am afraid the same cannot be said of the situation itself.
If we added all of the national minorities or ethnic groups in the European Union together, particularly after enlargement, they would constitute the second-largest Member State.
This, then, is a very sizeable problem.
At the moment, the preamble to the Europe Agreements contains an obligation to protect minorities.
When these states accede to the Union, however, this obligation will cease to apply.
The Intergovernmental Conference, of course, has a mandate to prepare the Community for enlargement, and I cannot imagine how the Community can be enlarged without an internal mechanism for the protection of minorities.
Otherwise many problems from central and eastern Europe will be imported into the European Union.
