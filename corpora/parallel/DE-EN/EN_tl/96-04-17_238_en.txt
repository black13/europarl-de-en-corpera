Mr President, I have a further point of order.
There has seldom been a discussion for which it has been so important to have the Commissioner responsible present in the House.
Could you please ascertain, at the start of our discussion of the item on BSE, why Mr Fischler is not present?
We need him to give us a clear statement.
I do not wish to imply any lack of respect for his deputies, but we do need a clear and unambiguous statement from Mr Fischler himself.
