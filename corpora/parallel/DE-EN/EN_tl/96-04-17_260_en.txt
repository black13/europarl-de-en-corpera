Mr President, I am glad to be able to answer that.
It is quite true that the Commission intends to help stimulate the beef market.
We are working on the principle that the only sensible way in which to proceed is to translate any such programme into action in cooperation with the Member States, and we have a budget appropriation for the purpose which we can use.
Finally, we believe that we must choose the right moment for starting such action very carefully, because if we were to choose the wrong time, whatever we do might well be counter-productive.
