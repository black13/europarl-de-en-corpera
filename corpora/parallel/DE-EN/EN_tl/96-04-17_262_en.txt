Mr President, I shall be glad to take your admonitions seriously and keep my remarks as brief as possible.
Firstly, as regards calves, it is true that in the Netherlands at the present time, calves are being slaughtered which originated in the United Kingdom.
However, I would point out that this measure does not represent a health requirement, but is one initiated by the Netherlands.
In view of the marketing problems involved, however, the Council has decided to give these measures some support as well.
As regards your question about the eradication of this disease in itself, I am sure we are all of one mind that it is in our common interest to have the disease eradicated as soon as possible.
But we cannot pretend that the answer is simply a matter of saying that the more animals we have slaughtered, the better.
We must also look at the targeting and effectiveness of our measures, and that is why it is now critical that we receive an appropriate proposal from the United Kingdom.
As for the measures taken in other Member States, the herds in which cases of BSE have appeared have so far been slaughtered as far as possible.
There have only been a few cases, and the Commission is also ready to discuss the cases which are still pending or to help with slaughter in those cases too.
As regards the further spread of this disease, I may have misunderstood the question.
At any rate, there is no evidence that the disease has spread into 30 countries.
