We had an opportunity of discussing this matter together this afternoon, Mr Macartney, and as I told you then, the first thing to be done is to ensure that the controls are operating effectively throughout the United Kingdom.
This means having checks on how the system is operating, on registration and the measures introduced in all parts of the United Kingdom, including of course Scotland, Northern Ireland and the various regions of England itself.
Over and above this, a question of differentiation or regionalization is emerging, on the basis of comparisons with previous control measures.
But I am sure you must realize that the regional approach that was adopted to cope with swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease in Italy, for example, or in the case of other comparable diseases, must be viewed quite differently from this present problem.
The crucial point will always be the adequacy of controls.
That is why the British Government has announced that proposals are also to be submitted in this respect.
In the first place, however, it is up to the British Government to put forward proposals of this kind, and as soon as such proposals are available, the Commission will of course assess them.
As regards a system of registration, or the sort of cow passport that you mentioned, the inspection team which is going to the United Kingdom next week has been asked to look at the registration system which is in force there, and will if necessary report on whether any further measures are needed in this field.
