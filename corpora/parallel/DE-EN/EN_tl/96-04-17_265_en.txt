Commissioner, you said that confidence among consumers must be created through measures to guarantee health.
Do you think that a sweeping statement that British beef is safe represents that kind of measure?
Do you think that if all of us sitting here tonight were to say that British beef is safe, that would be a confidence-building measure and anyone would believe us?
Or might we not be making ourselves look ridiculous?
My second question is this: if, as you say, you cannot stabilize the market in terms of quantity, then why are you withdrawing 50 000 tonnes just when the debate is at its height?
Whether it is actually safe or not, that meat is going to be forever tainted.
My third point is that you referred to selection or culling.
I would agree that even in Britain, not all the animals are sick, and not all their meat is bad.
Will the Commission put any effort into this aspect of the problem, and has Professor Weissmann made any proposals for tests to be carried out on live or slaughtered animals?
There is a heated debate on this question at present.
Could not the Commission make some contribution here?
