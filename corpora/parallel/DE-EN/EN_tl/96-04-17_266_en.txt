Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, in reply to your comments about market measures, I said that intervention in itself could never solve the problem.
But that does not mean that the statement can be turned on its head and taken to mean that we should - or could - abandon intervention altogether.
There is one thing you must not forget, and that is that each of these cattle now standing in the cowsheds of Europe is growing one kilogram heavier every day, which means that they are becoming harder to market every day as well.
Remember too that the quality of the meat does not improve with prolonged fattening.
All these factors, in my view, justify us taking action now.
If we wait until the market has totally collapsed, that will not do anyone any good.
With regard to tests on live animals, Professor Weissmann has told me that at present, there is no reliable procedure for carrying out tests of this kind.
He also pointed out that it will be no easy matter to develop such a test, for the simple reason that the biochemical mechanism of the prions is known to be constructed so as to prevent the body's immune system from reacting to them.
This means that entirely new designs for testing procedures must be developed - assuming, that is, that such a thing is possible at all.
