If I may briefly recapitulate what I said earlier in my statement, we have already announced, for the 50 000 tonnes, an increase in carcass weights from 340 to 380 kilograms, and for the remaining quantity the weight limit has been removed entirely - in other words, there is at present no carcass weight limit here at all.
In addition, to match the higher weights involved, we have adjusted the quality classes eligible for intervention; we cannot use intervention for all qualities, since we have no interest in holding only meat in intervention which no one else wishes to buy.
