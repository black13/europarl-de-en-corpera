Mr Cabrol, in reply to your question as to whether a health observatory should be set up, I would say that this would make no difference at all to the situation we are faced with regarding BSE.
We simply have to live with the fact - and this is a problem and a responsibility that no one in Europe or the whole world can lift from our shoulders - that unfortunately we still have at our disposal very little scientific knowledge on BSE or the extent to which it can be transmitted to humans, and so on.
At the same time, this means that there are a number of things which unfortunately cannot be ruled out, and it is precisely this factor which is causing us so much concern at present.
This is the difficulty which, in my view, we have to come to grips with as responsible politicians.
