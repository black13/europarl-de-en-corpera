As I have already explained, all these considerations and proposals must be based on comprehensible control mechanisms.
This is an essential precondition, because otherwise we shall never gain the confidence which has been mentioned.
However, I also feel that our initial efforts must above all build on those measures which have already been introduced.
I do not think it has really been made sufficiently clear to public opinion what enormous changes have been made in our procedures in the course of these last few weeks.
You should not forget that animals aged over 30 months are now excluded from the food chain both for human and animal consumption.
Equally, it must be remembered that the parts known as SBOs are now being removed from younger animals as well, and carefully disposed of.
These are major changes geared to public safety and confidence, and they should be put across much more strongly, because of the far-reaching effect they will have.
It seems to me that one cannot rely on the idea of each of us saying in turn: ' But my cattle are not infected.
They have never been in contact.'
That would just be making things too easy for ourselves.
We must try to bring about an overall solution to the problem.
