One thing has become clear from scientific research, and that is that the suspect tissues which are at the root of the BSE problem are firstly the brain, secondly the spinal cord, and after that a number of very specific internal organs or offal.
This is where the real problem lies, and if you read the research findings, you will see what differences exist, and what concentrations of prions are encountered in these various tissues, when infection by the disease is clinically diagnosed in an animal.
Consequently, the deciding factor is this: can one or can one not eradicate these doubtful tissues or parts in every case?
That is one of the crucial points.
As regards the mechanism for the disease spreading via the floor, I must confess that I really cannot imagine how that is going to happen in practice.
You cannot have any scientific evidence for this, and the point is best dealt with as follows: when it comes to slaughter hygiene regulations, we in the European Union have - and we should make this clear for once - the strictest regulations in the world.
We should not forget that, when it comes to the general point at issue.
