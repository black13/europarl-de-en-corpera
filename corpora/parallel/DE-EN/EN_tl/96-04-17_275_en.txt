In view of the lack of time, I shall simply ask two questions.
Do you not agree, Commissioner, that in the long run, it would be wiser to abandon intervention in the case of British beef?
What I personally fear is that if this meat comes back on the market in the future, there will again be difficulties.
And there is another problem: the at-risk imported cattle which have gone to other countries should now also be looked at closely.
Will there be slaughtering programmes here too?
I am sure you cannot read all the many press reports, even those in Germany.
But when we read in one of the leading German newspapers: ' Fischler says there are no medical reasons, only political ones' , then in my view that does not help any of us.
