Mr President, I have to say that I do not share the view that intervention should be abandoned for British beef, or that this would be possible.
Secondly, as far as British animals which have been exported to other countries are concerned, I have already said that here - with regard to cattle which could have developed problems or might develop them in future - we are of course working on eliminating this element of uncertainty.
As for the reports in the media, it often happens, unfortunately, that a number of journalists simply copy from one another, and in the process two things are frequently entangled.
The first is that there is of course a clear basis in law for the Commission's decisions, and this forms what might be called the judicial background to this decision.
The second thing is, however - and this is where the end and the means have sometimes been confused - that logically, the measures we have taken not only serve the interests of public health, in other words eliminating uncertainty, but are also intended to help restore consumer confidence and control the upheavals on the beef markets.
