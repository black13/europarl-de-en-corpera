As regards the manufacturing of animal feeds, there are several provisions which have been adopted over the years.
But if the users of these feeds fail to use them properly, they can hardly have the producers prosecuted for that, since feeding them to ruminants has been unequivocally prohibited for several years now.
All the same, we have to take it that this ban is not always obeyed.
For several years, there has been a total ban on feeding ruminants meal which is itself derived from ruminants.
I have already indicated that this ban is unfortunately not always obeyed, but to bring the producer before the courts for that reason seems impossible to me, in legal terms.
The special Council meeting has now decided on three additional safety measures.
Firstly, this ban must be made clear, and it must be made clear once and for all that feeding animal meal to herbivores remains prohibited.
Secondly, a further safety measure is to be introduced for all meat and bone meal production, to ensure that such feed can only be produced in plants where the processes used are declared by the experts to be free of any problems.
Thirdly, the way in which the contents are listed must be changed, so that the wording on the outside of the feed container makes it quite clear, in large letters, what the feed may and may not be used for.
We are taking it for granted that everyone can read.
