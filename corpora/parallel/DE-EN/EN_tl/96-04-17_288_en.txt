It seems to me that the questions are starting to become somewhat repetitive, Mr Hyland.
I have already provided the information asked for in your first question, and would prefer not to repeat myself.
As regards your second question about the particular situation in Ireland, we know that Ireland depends on exports, that is quite clear.
Ireland is the Member State which is most dependent on beef exports, and I can inform you that we have been making great efforts to restart the exports to third countries from Ireland which have been affected by the various import bans imposed by states in Central Asia and the Near East.
