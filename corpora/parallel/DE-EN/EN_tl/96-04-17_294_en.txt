We have been informed of the statement that was made in the House of Commons yesterday, and the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Hogg, also faxed his statement through to me.
There has been personal contact with the British Government.
The British experts have reported to various committees, including in particular the Standing Veterinary Committee.
As I have already stated, there will be a further meeting with the British Minister next week.
The main purpose of all these meetings is to allow us to discuss together the specific measures and decisions which must now be adopted.
