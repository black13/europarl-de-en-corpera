Mr President, despite the lateness of the hour, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the way in which she has reconciled so many interests - those of the producers, the wholesalers and the retailers.
The point has already been made that the directive allows retailers a period of grace, without in any way affecting the protection given to the consumer.
Anyone wishing to breathe life into the section of the EU Treaty which refers to a high level of consumer protection must, to my mind, be in favour of this report.
Anyone who goes into a shop today to buy food for the weekend - and I assume that even Members do such a thing occasionally - has to spend a great deal of time and either be good at mental arithmetic or have their calculator with them if they wish to be price-conscious and compare prices.
For many products, they cannot see the unit price at a glance.
Price transparency does not exist - but that was the aim at European level nearly 20 years ago.
The rules which have applied up to now have no doubt made things better for the consumer in some countries.
Personally - and here I am in the same boat as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten - I have found them rather confusing, and quite often simply a puzzle.
If I bought an unwrapped piece of ham, I could see the selling price and the cost per kilo.
If I bought a prepacked item, I could see that there were two pieces, but had no idea how big they were: it would just say 116 grams and the selling price.
I had to work out for myself what the cost per pound or kilo was.
So I am very pleased, no doubt like the great majority of consumers, to see the unit price at last becoming a reality.
