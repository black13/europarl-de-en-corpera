We in the Green Group see eastward enlargement as the current political goal of the European Union.
Enormous historical importance attaches to it.
It could become one of the main prerequisites of a peaceful and democratic Europe.
The countries of eastern Europe in particular entertain high hopes of early accession.
For that reason it is unfair and irresponsible towards those countries to nurture their hopes of possible speedy accession on the occasion of every state visit while at the same time developing an accession strategy that is not conducive to rapid enlargement.
After all, it is not only the countries of central and eastern Europe that have to prepare to move in step with the European Union.
It would be wrong to try and solve the European Union's own structural problems by extending its market eastwards.
How are these countries to develop the ecological and social aspects of their economies if the so-called conditions of accession are based on an export-orientated development process?
This would resolve neither the social nor the democratic conflicts in those countries.
Expecting the countries of central and eastern Europe to embrace the principles of the common agricultural policy is a step in the wrong direction.
If they pursue such a policy, they will be faced with a huge employment crisis.
Those countries are neither prepared for such a crisis nor able to overcome it.
The European Union has no option but to prepare for this enlargement by reforming its structural and agricultural policies.
Such reform is essential if we are to shift our agricultural policy from export-orientation to integrated rural development and to a common agricultural policy that will guarantee economic and social cohesion for all Member States, including new ones.
I also believe it is wrong to seek to develop a common security policy without preventive mechanisms and without the OSCE.
This is a major flaw in the Oostlander report.
