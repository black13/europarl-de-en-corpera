Mr President, on a point of order, I should like to move an amendment to the order of voting.
In the voting list the amendment I am tabling on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party comes before the amendment tabled by the Green Group in the European Parliament.
The Greens' amendment, however, goes further.
Both amendments concern research with foetal tissue.
The Greens reject such research outright.
Good reasons may be found for that, but it does not reflect the view expressed by Parliament in other resolutions.
That is why we should vote first on the more radical amendment proposed by the Green Group in the European Parliament and then on our amendment, which does not reject such research in principle but formulates very strict conditions for it.
I believe we can then carry this Amendment No 3 together, because Parliament has already adopted it once.
But let me add that some groups would like a separate vote on the passage concerning somatic gene therapy at the end of Amendment No 3.
If it is still possible, I should like to ask for that to be arranged, but the more important point to me is the voting sequence.
