Mr President, the rapporteur is quite right to point out that this is primarily a technical matter.
But he is equally right to point out that in the end we are concerned with the protection of cultural goods.
In that regard I take the view that the proposal he has submitted, i.e. to introduce a special category for water colours, gouaches and pastels, is right, in order to prevent any inappropriate equal treatment or inappropriate unequal treatment in future.
But we should also follow the proposal from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and review the effectiveness of both the directive and the regulation after three years.
I think a separate comment has to be made on the wording with regard to the return of national cultural goods.
So long as a member country of the Council of Europe produces legislation on what is called plundered art it is in my view also essential to pose the question what the ownership or possession of cultural goods actually means.
I think we have to discuss this right from the start in relation to the general accessibility of cultural goods, protection against misuse and forming part of a regional or local cultural context.
Who is the owner of the symphony from which we have taken our European anthem?
I think the answer to that question is also relevant to the fine arts.
