Mr President, humanitarian aid is an act of humanity in emergency situations, either in crisis situations resulting from natural disasters, in which case we have to ask ourselves whether we are partly responsible, or when preventive diplomacy and political action as a whole have failed.
Since 1992 we have had the European Union's Humanitarian Aid Office - ECHO.
Mrs Sauquillo has submitted an important report that sets out specific objectives and general criteria for the Community's humanitarian aid.
We have noted that difficulties arose with other Commission departments and that problems have occurred in the cooperation between ECHO and the other Commission services responsible for development policy.
We were told that they have been or will be dealt with.
However, to date we have not seen a specific document defining the areas of competence.
I believe we must differentiate between emergency aid, aid for reconstruction, i.e., rehabilitation, and development aid - that is not in the report.
Only on the basis of a common programme can we achieve anything in the field of humanitarian aid.
It was also said here that this is an area of foreign policy.
Here I think the European Community, if it formulates a new foreign and security policy at the Intergovernmental Conference, must take care not to use humanitarian aid as a new means of defining its foreign policy profile at the cost of humanitarian aid.
There is no evidence of harmonization with UN organizations; so the possibility of giving the European Union a higher profile must not mean putting an end to on-going forms of cooperation and we must not set up separate bodies.
Finally, in my view we need a little more modesty and a little more cooperation with the NGOs.
The NGOs in particular have often criticized ECHO for taking a centralist approach.
Here we must encourage dialogue, here we are a critical partner; then we will be able to provide humanitarian aid in real emergency situations.
