Mr President, the common position of the Council on the amendment of the Directive on driving licences has already taken account of major proposals made by the European Parliament, which pleases us, although we should have welcomed the replacement of some discretionary clauses by peremptory clauses.
So let us regard this proposal as a first step in the right direction, though not perhaps the last.
But driving licences are also part of our citizens' everyday lives.
That is why it is important in our eyes that, besides being an instrument of harmonization, driving licences should also be a means of improving control and security, that they should perhaps also contain information which might even make the difference between life and death in critical situations.
We therefore hope that all the Member States will agree on a sound compromise between data protection and the sort of information that contributes to safety in general as well as to the safety of the individual.
It does seem to me, however, that the most important of the amendments is the fourth, the aim of which is to outlaw the imposition of annual taxes on driving licences.
If this amendment is not accepted, we run the risk of seeing the European driving licence pressed into service as a means of levying new vehicle taxes, which could also vary between countries.
The beneficial effect of the introduction of a European driving licence would, in my opinion, be completely overshadowed by these disadvantages.
That is why we also support Mr Farassino's proposal, and we hope that he will obtain a majority here in the House for all his amendments.
