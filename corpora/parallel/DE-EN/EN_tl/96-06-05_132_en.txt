Mr President, despite the unresolved issues, I believe that we can generally be satisfied with the work done on this Directive.
The Commission, with its credit-card model, has put forward a foresighted proposal.
It represents a successful compromise between harmonization and respect for the specific characteristics of our Member States.
Every citizen of the EU who lives for more than three months in another Member State will come to appreciate the advantages offered by this Directive.
In the same way, Member States will be able to switch in due course from paper licences to the credit-card format and will do so secure in the knowledge that the necessary interoperability of the 'credit-card' -style driving licence is guaranteed in all Member States.
And from a parliamentary point of view, we too can take pleasure in the fact that some of the results of our work are reflected in the common position.
Licence-holders who so wish, for example, will now be able to have their blood group and allergies entered on request and make a voluntary undertaking to donate organs.
Anyone who remembers the first reading here in the House will know that even this dictate of common sense did not pass unchallenged by some Members.
But let us hope that today at least we shall make the rapid administration of first aid our prime concern rather than exploiting the all-too-serious subject of data protection for the purpose of panicmongering.
