Mr President, the two reports we have dealt with this evening - the Argyros report and the Pompidou report - are very closely interrelated.
That is also demonstrated by the almost identical lists of speakers.
As this debate draws to its close I really wish to confine myself to a very few remarks.
First of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very clear report, which has brought a great deal of order to a number of instruments that had never before been properly collated.
The devil, however, is so much in the detail here as in the implementation.
For example, we are going to need clear statements on codetermination and on the possible cofinancing of research projects by third countries.
There must also be decisions regarding the right to use the results of such research and regarding entitlement to subsequent profits.
That brings us to the question of intellectual property.
The absence of harmonized rules governing intellectual property is not unique to Europe.
We shall also have to incorporate the national rules that already exist, of course, into international agreements.
We shall have to guarantee compatibility.
We shall also have to guarantee compatibility in any joint ventures that may take place between researchers and business, something that has not really been tried out at all in our part of the world and does not exist here yet as it does in the United States, for instance.
But we also need compatibility between all the factors associated with venture capital and with mixed public/private funding.
A great deal has been said today about all these points.
There are many things we cannot regulate at EU level, but I hope that we here in Parliament - and in the Commission too - can provide inspiration and ideas so that national governments can work together to promote harmonization.
Such harmonization will serve us well when it comes to cooperating at international level.
