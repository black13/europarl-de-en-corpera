Mr President, many thanks to Mrs Marinucci for her very good report that we have been discussing here.
'Environment' , it seems, is but a word, an empty shell.
ECU 600 million had almost been voted by the Council.
A majority of the ministers were on the point of agreeing, when things suddenly took a turn for the worse.
Petty jealousies, concern that too much money might be poured into the South, finally won the day, and agreement was reached on ECU 450 million.
Does this amount really reflect the wishes of the European people?
When I consider that in 1996 we are promoting tobacco production to the tune of ECU 1.1 billion and spending ECU 894 million on textile fibre plants and silkworms, I have to ask whether the European environment is not worth more than silkworms.
What is more, this amount of ECU 450 million has been earmarked for a multiannual programme.
This is downright scandalous, Mrs Bjerregaard!
There am I, on the one hand, protecting the livelihood of tobacco-growers, while on the other hand they probably have no clean water to drink and too little pure air to breathe.
The one is really no substitute for the other.
I should also like to mention the Commission's laxity with regard to the investigation of the misuse of LIFE funds in Italy.
Why has it taken so long to institute proceedings?
This reticence on the part of the Commission is losing us a great deal of money every year!
Lastly, I wanted to mention that the inclusion of the countries of central and eastern Europe is very important to us, because environmental conditions in some parts of those countries are disastrous.
But if that is mentioned as a priority, Commissioner, we must also be prepared to find the necessary resources.
Where will you obtain the money for such priorities?
I am interested to hear that.
