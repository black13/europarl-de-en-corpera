Mr President, as the third pillar in your proposals for improving labour-market policy you referred to the electricity sector, the creation of the single electricity market.
I should like to ask how you assess the value of the single energy market in terms of new job opportunities.
Is energy, as a cost factor of location in Europe, not perhaps being overpriced here?
Should not rather the alternative and regenerative forms of energy technology be developed and encouraged more vigorously, so that such innovations can lead to real new jobs in Europe and new export opportunities for companies based in Europe?
Have we not been grossly underestimating the importance of environmental protection as a means of securing and creating jobs?
