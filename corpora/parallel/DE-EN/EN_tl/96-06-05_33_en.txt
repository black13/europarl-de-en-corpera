Not taking any risks is the greatest risk, President Santer, as you so rightly said.
So it is not a matter of merely producing piecemeal measures but of ensuring that we create a common framework.
As for the Member States, which fear different paths to unity more than the devil fears holy water and which only once, namely in Essen, where they identified five new key areas for action, have got round to pulling the various strands together, should we not make it clear to them that we do not want anything new?
We do not want any new structural-fund resources but rather more effective application of the existing structural funds.
We do not want to create any new local employment initiatives in competition with SMEs; such action should be taken as a parallel effort accompanying in a fair and balanced manner our promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Is it not equally necessary to tell them that we must devote more of our resources to practical education and to the promotion of vocational training?
But in our view this also means that we must not reduce still further the already meagre Leonardo funds.
We must therefore make it clear to these countries that it is not a matter of pursuing new whimsical policies but quite simply of distributing more prudently the funds that are available.
