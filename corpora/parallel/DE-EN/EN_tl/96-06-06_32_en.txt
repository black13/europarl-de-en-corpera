Mr President, the agreement on financial services was adopted almost a year ago and has only now been referred to Parliament, shortly before the deadline.
We know that it had been a bone of contention for years.
We know that many developing countries had very serious objections to this agreement and to one-sided liberalization of trade in services in general.
Among their objections was the fact that, although the agreement was intended to create freedom of movement for major banks and insurance companies, it contained no provisions on the free movement of persons.
A concession has since been made to the developing countries, but this does not alter the fundamental issue.
We also know that the United States has not acceded to this agreement, so a major international trading nation is missing.
What we do not know, however, is how this agreement will affect employment in Europe and in the Third World.
The WTO is conducting secret diplomacy, and the European Commission seems bent on outdoing it for secrecy.
Not even the competent parliamentary committee was duly informed.
Two years ago we were already sounding warnings to the effect that the WTO would mean less democratic control by parliaments and citizens.
To rush through in this way, without time for careful scrutiny, an agreement with such far-reaching implications for people's lives cannot be justified to the voters who gave us our parliamentary mandates.
That is why we shall not vote for this agreement.
Nor can I share the euphoria about the liberalization of world trade that is prevalent in parts of this House.
On the contrary, I fear that if we continue to pursue this ambition we shall liberalize ourselves to death.
