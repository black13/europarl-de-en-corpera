Madam President, I did not vote for this report either, along with numerous other Austrian Social Democrats, because it effectively forestalls something that the world and Europe have long awaited.
It is not as if the inhumanity and the escalation of the conflict with Polisario had happened yesterday.
Efforts to find a solution have been going on for years, and it is quite obviously the case that Morocco has no interest in an amicable settlement.
Nor are the human-rights violations a new phenomenon.
I am not prepared to pay the piper before he plays the tune.
I should have considered it more appropriate to state clearly that there should and must be such an agreement but only if Morocco fulfils the clear conditions that this Parliament has stated in its resolution.
