Madam President, we in the Freedom Party also regret the actions of the Croatian Government in relation to the appointment of the Mayor of Zagreb and the restrictions on the opposition and on freedom of the press, and we call for a rapid improvement in the situation.
However, in awareness of Croatia's difficult position after waging a long and brutal war to obtain its freedom, we believe that this brusque rejection of Croatia for the aforementioned reasons, especially when compared with the treatment accorded to Russia or, as was mentioned earlier, Romania, is heavy-handed and counterproductive.
The votes of some Members may also reflect a delayed reaction to Croatian independence, which some groups accepted reluctantly.
This, however, would be the wrong way to lead a country scarred by years of Communist dictatorship and by civil war towards the Western European fold.
For that reason we reject this resolution.
