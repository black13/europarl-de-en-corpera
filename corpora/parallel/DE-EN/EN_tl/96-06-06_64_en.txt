Madam President, I voted against the resolution.
I should have expected the European Parliament to signal far more clearly that consumer protection and public health are not subordinated to economic interests in the European Union.
The decision taken by the Commission makes a mockery of consumer protection and public health.
The relaxation of the export ban at a time when more and more cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are coming to light can only lead one to conclude that such a decision is based on sheer cynicism.
The Commission, the Council and even, to an increasing extent, the European Parliament are buckling under the blackmail tactics of the British Government.
It is to be feared that the Commission's decision will pave the way for the complete lifting of the export ban.
I believe it is a totally misguided decision, because consumer protection and public health must take priority.
We must practise preventive health care.
As long as scientists cannot rule out a health risk, we must try to have the export ban maintained.
That should have been our aim.
I believe that this decision taken by the Commission shows total disregard for consumer protection and public health in the European Union.
That is why I regret that we did not adopt a more radical resolution.
