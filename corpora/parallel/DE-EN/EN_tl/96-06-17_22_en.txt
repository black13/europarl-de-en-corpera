Mr President, thank you for allowing this exception.
On behalf of my group, I should like to highlight three important points, and firstly the amount of the increase: ECU 700 million.
Even though savings are now the order of the day in all the Member States and at EU level, we believe that there is an urgent need to invest in the future.
And this can only be done through innovation, the basis for which is research and development.
That is why we have endorsed this overall sum.
Secondly, we agree with the Green Paper on innovation that the dissemination and exploitation of results must be improved.
We have taken this into account in our amendment on the allocation of resources.
Even though money is not all that is needed here, it certainly does help!
Thirdly, we are in fact in a transitional phase, in the middle of the fourth framework programme.
The discussion has in some cases been unusually heated, however, due to the fact that the thrust of the research topics was altered in an over-hasty way.
We hope that the consultation process in preparation for the fifth framework programme will be smoother and more relaxed.
Finally, I am grateful to the rapporteur for having worked with us in such an open and fair manner, and I would thank the Commissioner for having sought and conducted a dialogue with Parliament, after certain initial difficulties.
As Gordon Adam has already said, we do need an absolute majority in Parliament.
For that reason, there has been a strong desire in the House to reach an agreement, and this is reflected in our compromise proposals.
