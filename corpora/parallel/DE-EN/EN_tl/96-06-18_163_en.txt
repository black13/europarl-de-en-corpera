First of all, to my mind, one must distinguish between standards and patents.
It is of course very much to the advantage of small and medium-sized firms to apply standards, so as to offset to some extent the disadvantages which they suffer in calls for tender because of their size.
In order to make smaller firms more aware of standards and facilitate their application, we are working closely with an association created by small and medium-sized enterprises, whose brief is to ensure that these standards are known and complied with during the production process.
I believe that, as a result, more and more small firms will begin to apply standards.
Patents are of course something quite different.
I do not know whether that was a slip of the tongue, because patents have nothing to do with standards.
Naturally, a patent must be registered in accordance with certain procedures.
This is done either nationally or through the European Patent Office, which is increasingly taking over the work of the national patent offices.
It is true that the fees charged are sometimes fairly high, which in the case of the European Patent Office - where we have a certain amount of influence - is due to the fact that the Office is funded entirely from these fees.
The European Parliament itself regards it as essential that such authorities and agencies should be funded out of their own revenue, and clearly this is a financial burden which we cannot reduce.
