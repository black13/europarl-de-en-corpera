The honourable Member is absolutely right.
What you say is indeed logical, and ideally standards would be applicable internationally.
In many sectors, we already have a global market, and you rightly mention telecommunications.
Together with the European standardization organizations, therefore, we are attempting to ensure that these standards apply worldwide.
In practice, there are two ways of doing this: the first is to participate in the work of the international standardization bodies which already exist.
Here we are more active than anyone else: for example, almost 80 % of the work leading to such international standards - and, incidentally, of the financial resources too - is provided by the European Union.
I myself would not have thought this massive percentage possible, but at a meeting with our American friends, who have always accused us of seeking to use our European standards as a form of protectionism, we looked into who does what in the international standardization bodies.
The Europeans carry out the bulk of this work.
Secondly, there is a method which is very effective once a standard has already made an impact on the market.
The best example of this is GSM, the technical standard for mobile communications.
Once such a standard has made its impact on the market, this impact spreads to the global market, and we hope that many of the standards which we are drawing up in this new sector - telecommunications - will have a global impact.
