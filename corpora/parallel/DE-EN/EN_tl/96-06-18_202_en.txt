I would repeat that even if we were to give these small farmers an opportunity to grow different crops, that is no reason to expect people in Europe to smoke less.
The two things are completely separate, and must be kept apart.
In any event, I think it would be premature to hold a detailed discussion today.
I can assure you that our report, soon to be presented, will also ask what would happen if aid for tobacco growing were discontinued, so that you too will be able to assess the likely results and consequences of such an option.
Some Members of the House - including the last questioner - have drawn attention to the importance of retaining this aid and preserving jobs in tobacco growing.
We shall be able to discuss this with one another.
