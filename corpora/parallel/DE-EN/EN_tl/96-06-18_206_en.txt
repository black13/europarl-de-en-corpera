Mrs Hardstaff, with the best will in the world, I cannot go along with your assertion that there are simply poor countries with poor farmers, and then rich countries with rich farmers who are not deserving of support.
Unfortunately, because of the structures which exist - even in the country with the best structures in the European Union, namely the United Kingdom - some farmers are experiencing real income problems.
It cannot, I am afraid, be inferred from the fact there are many wealthy farmers in the UK that those who do have problems there deserve no support.
We cannot discuss the matter on this basis.
