Perhaps I might add that certain programmes are being implemented on a continuing basis: there are, for example, the Structural Fund resources, which can be used to assist Objective 5b or 5a areas, and which could be applied to support the restructuring of the rendering industry in the United Kingdom, for instance, or to promote investment.
Other initiatives can also be taken under the Objective 3 and Objective 4 measures; these offer very specific support.
With statistics alone, we cannot help anyone.
However, if you think it important to have precise figures on the employment situation in this sector, I shall gladly pass the matter on to my colleague Mr Flynn, who is the Commissioner responsible.
We could perhaps carry out a detailed survey, or else obtain information from the UK authorities.
