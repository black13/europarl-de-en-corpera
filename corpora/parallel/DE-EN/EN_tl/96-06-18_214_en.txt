I think we actually need to look at the scale of what is involved here.
If you think that intervention costs are lower, I would point out that across the EU, the total amount in intervention has reached 150 000 tonnes.
The cost of intervention for 100 000 tonnes is ECU 240 million.
This means that we have already spent ECU 360 m on these measures alone, to enable the animals to be slaughtered immediately, because ultimately this boosts employment in slaughterhouses.
If they are then stored in refrigerated warehouses, people are employed there too, and so on.
If you now consider that an additional 25 000 animals per week are currently being slaughtered, under the provisions on animals over 30 months old, you will get some idea of the effect this is having on employment.
I therefore believe that these large-scale measures are in fact the most important contribution in terms of employment.
Moreover, I would draw your attention to the fact that the volume of turnover is significantly greater in the United Kingdom than in many other Member States.
Although prices to farmers are low, the turnover of slaughterhouses is higher than in other Member States.
The question of employment can certainly not be seen merely in the UK context.
