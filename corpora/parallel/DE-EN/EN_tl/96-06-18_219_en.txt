Thank you for your comprehensive reply, Commissioner.
I just have a brief supplementary question.
The health of consumers really should be our overriding concern, and with regard to final products we now know, for example, that gelatine is contained in cake glazes and in jelly-babies, which are so popular with children.
Can you assure me, with a clear conscience, that these do not contain any pathogens, and that they represent absolutely no health risk to consumers?
And with regard to bull semen, can you state with a clear conscience that no disease can be transmitted through it?
