In reply to your last question concerning bull semen, I can say the following: we based our decision on the view of the experts on the Scientific Veterinary Committee, according to whom there is no risk associated with bull semen.
As far as gelatine and tallow are concerned, perhaps I might describe the present situation once again: firstly, we asked the scientists to define a procedure which ensures that any possible trace of the BSE virus is inactivated, in other words destroyed.
Secondly, we have stipulated that every manufacturer of gelatine and tallow in the United Kingdom must obtain a licence from the British Government.
Thirdly, we have ensured that only certain specific products may be used to manufacture gelatine and tallow, namely those which I have already described.
Only such tissue may be used.
Fourth, the British Government is obliged to inform the Commission as soon as it awards a licence to an industrial company.
Fifth, the Commission carries out an inspection in the UK - and invites all the other Member States to join it - and only once all these matters have been resolved to our satisfaction will the Commission formally decide that a particular British company may once again place gelatine or tallow on the market.
Even then, every consignment must be accompanied by a certificate from the veterinary official, stating that all the rules have been complied with during the production process, and indicating the frequency of inspections carried out in that company by the veterinary official.
In effect, this means that we now have a blueprint for the future, and it is now up to the British Government - and of course the industry in Britain - to see how rapidly they can adapt their procedures so as to meet the requirements for safe production and enable these inspections to be carried out.
No one can say at present when exports of gelatine will in fact be resumed.
