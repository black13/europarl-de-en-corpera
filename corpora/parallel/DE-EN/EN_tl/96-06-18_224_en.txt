Mr President, the Commission keeps the scientists informed continuously both of the detailed statistics and the most recent history of the disease, and frequent discussions also take place in meetings of the BSE subcommittee of the Scientific Veterinary Committee.
The fact that, to date, 99 % of cases have occurred in the United Kingdom and only around one per cent in all the other countries of the world is not attributable to other countries being less meticulous as regards the obligation to notify the disease.
This disease is notifiable in all countries, and we can therefore assume that the Member States are fulfilling their responsibilities in this respect.
It would also be very useful in future - although a good deal of research is still needed - if we could find out not just after an animal has been stricken with BSE that the sickness has occurred, but could also test for the disease, as it were.
That is why I have asked the so-called Weissmann Group to propose some research projects, so that such tests might become a reality as soon as possible.
That would considerably facilitate the handling of this disease.
