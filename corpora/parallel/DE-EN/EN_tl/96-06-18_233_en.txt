Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Fontaine on her excellent report, on which there are a number of comments I wish to make.
With this report, we are at something of a crossroads.
The legal professions, of which lawyers are one of several - business trustees, notaries and the like - are of course based on their national legal systems.
In recent years, however, there has been a growing need within the European Union for these professions - to which I myself belong - to look beyond national borders.
This has obviously made it necessary to get to grips with other legal systems.
I am not in favour of compartmentalizing this profession by erecting an artificial barrier to access, and the report says the same thing.
On the other hand, the legal safety of the citizens in our countries is at stake.
That means devising a system which will serve two purposes: on the one hand, free access to the profession must be guaranteed, in any country of the European Union; and, on the other, a lawyer must have sufficient knowledge of the legal system concerned to ensure that clients and companies receive the best possible advice.
I believe that the Commission's proposal - to lay down a clear definition of this professional title throughout Europe - is a very good one; the discussion about whether lawyers can operate in joint practice, or in companies with share capital or partnerships, is also very welcome, because I think that this question will be of particular relevance to the profession in the future.
The functions of lawyers should not, in my opinion, be seen in narrow terms, but they should also be regarded as business advisers.
In the future, it will certainly be necessary to do this.
If these directives and the debate on them open up such a prospect, then the report is a good starting-point for a very fruitful discussion.
