Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Hoppenstedt, but also take the opportunity of making the following comment of my own: when will the Commission finally submit a framework directive that will allow us to debate the basic outline conditions for liberalization of the telecommunications sector and the preconditions in terms of social policy?
And when will the common framework for general authorizations and individual licences - which the Commission has already submitted - make its progress through the legislative procedure?
I should also like to raise some questions which, while they may be naive, concern what I regard as fundamental issues.
Firstly, there are the conditions for harmonizing selection, as referred to in the reports and by previous speakers.
I think it is clear that the Commission has consciously chosen not to make a sharp distinction between satellite-based personal communications on the one hand and broadband multimedia services on the other, in order to have an instrument that will allow it effective involvement in selection decisions in the latter area.
That is by no means an unwise move, if one recalls the saga of satellite broadcasting and the key role that it played in the establishment of private television channels.
My second point is that a market is being talked about here, and at the same time we are being told that there are currently three providers operating across the world.
I cannot help recalling the words of the great John Locke, the founder of modern liberal thinking, on the question of what constitutes a market: ' Being but two they could not agree' .
Does this mean that if they had been three, it would have been possible to set up mutual relations based on the exchange of equivalents?
If there is anyone here who believes that, I will buy them a drink!
