Mr President, the rapporteur deserves to be thanked for taking over the job of doing the Commission's homework.
As we approach the end of the millennium, our society must give the same priority to preventing cruelty to animals - preventing unimaginable and prolonged suffering among living creatures - as it does to consumer protection.
Preventing cruelty to animals is almost a form of consumer protection from a different angle.
It means protecting consumers from going about clad in the fashionably processed suffering of mammal species.
A person's ethnic origin can never entitle them to use cruel trapping methods.
It is quite amazing that the USA and Canada have so far refused to recognize that leghold traps are inhumane.
It is scarcely possible that regional development and the welfare of the people concerned should depend solely on the use of leghold traps, which are not even a traditional trapping method.
We should also recognize clearly that the decline in recent years in the sale of furs and skins is part of a pattern of changed practices on the part of consumers.
By following the proposals of the rapporteur, the European Parliament would be sending out a positive signal.
