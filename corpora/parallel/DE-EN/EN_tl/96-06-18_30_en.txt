Mr President, the Commission's report confirms the view of those who believe that both the Union as a whole and individual Member States will be adversely affected if the monetary union enters into force step by step on the scheduled dates.
Degeneration into a two-speed Europe is inevitable, and even if this state of affairs were to be only temporary, it is at odds with the goal of economic and social cohesion.
The prerequisite for unrestricted participation by all Member States in the euro will be that the budgets of those countries already meeting the criteria, weakened as they will be by savings measures, will have to provide substantial support for the 'outsiders' .
The distortions of competition, caused by unilateral devaluations, which are at present a burden on the external trade balances of certain Member States, cannot be overcome by the countries with soft currencies remaining outside.
It is therefore particularly important to devise as soon as possible intervention mechanisms to neutralize speculative pressure.
This report, at any rate, contains only vague and general indications, and does not state when the general guidelines for the future exchange relations between participating countries and those not yet participating will be drawn up.
Yet again, the fears of citizens in many Member States are being borne out: that in view of the poor economic situation, only a few countries will be able to meet the stability criteria; and, at the same time, that the vital question of the stabilization of exchange rates between the 'ins' and the 'outs' is unfortunately only now beginning to be addressed.
Furthermore, in this divided Europe, some parts of the export and tourism sectors in countries with hard currencies will continue to suffer significantly from the adverse effects of savings measures introduced in order to achieve convergence.
