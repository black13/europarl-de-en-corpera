Mr President-in-Office of the Council, previous speakers have pointed out various important points.
I should just like to emphasize certain aspects once again.
If we introduce a process such as the conciliation process, then there must be a reason for that process.
We are an institution within the European Union, which consists of three conglomerations, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
But if we institutionalize such a process, regardless of what form it takes or how flexible it is, then that process must have sensible and reasonable legitimacy.
Mr De Clercq has already pointed this out.
It is shameful to see how you treat us and how we all, indirectly, treat one another.
Please, allow this procedure to be taken seriously, as it should be in principle, and allow us to conduct reasonable negotiations!
We have made 36 proposals, and 27 of them have been accepted by the Commission.
Perhaps you accept only six of these proposals, but then at least allow us to talk about these six, or five, or ten, or however many you like.
And do not come to the conciliation process, like the one we have had, and present us with those proposals that you are not prepared to accept.
We want to hear about those that you are willing to accept, because those are the ones that we can talk about.
Only then - and I would ask you to really give this some thought - can the work of the institutions, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, serve the public better.
We must present our work as serious cooperation, even if, among ourselves, this is purely symbolic.
Even symbols, as we know, have their serious side.
Please, let us enter into negotiations once more.
Let us know which proposals you are able to accept, and you will find that Parliament is willing to listen, and the committees too, as you know, are always willing to listen.
Please allow us to come up with some serious results.
