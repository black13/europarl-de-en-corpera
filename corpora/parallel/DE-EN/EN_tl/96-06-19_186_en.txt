Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first of all I should like to thank you for your clear answers.
However, in connection with Kosovo I should like to make one comment.
You have read out to us some very fine-sounding statements, containing demands that human rights should finally be respected.
But we have a credibility problem here, because we have threatened all manner of things, but have not really taken any serious action.
Do you not think, Mr President-in-Office, that it is high time to set a real example in Kosovo, in other words to stand up, credibly, for the right of self-determination, or at least for the protection of the Albanian majority, so that the European Union will at least be standing up for something in earnest?
On the one hand we issue statements, but on the other hand the sanctions are increasingly being relaxed, and the Serbs continue their provocative behaviour.
They are just laughing at us!
Mr President-in-Office, it is vital that we should regain our credibility.
Do you not think that this would be a good opportunity?
