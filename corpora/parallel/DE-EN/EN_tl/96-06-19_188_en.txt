Mr President, the collapse of Yugoslavia was triggered in Kosovo by the major deployment there of a million Serbs in 1989, and by the abolition of autonomy.
So why has Kosovo retreated into the background?
Because the Albanians of Kosovo, who are not a minority, but rather the majority in Kosovo, did not use force, but deliberately chose non-violent means.
I see a very dangerous development here.
If this majority, the Albanian majority, is punished because it chose non-violent methods, then this will send the message that violence is necessary in this region.
I therefore take the view that we should have a Kosovo Conference of our own, since Kosovo was omitted by mistake from the list of conditions for the recognition of what remains of Yugoslavia.
In addition, I believe that elections should be held there in the presence of international observers.
I think there is an urgent need for action here, before catastrophe strikes.
So far, this has only been done in one case, that of Macedonia, and in that case it was helpful.
We really ought to take preventive measures, because otherwise violence will flare up again there, and will spread like wildfire.
