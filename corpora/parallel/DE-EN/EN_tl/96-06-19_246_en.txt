Madam President, Mr Flynn, in businesses and factories in Europe there are often no instructions at all about how to handle explosive atmospheres, or at best they exist only in rudimentary form.
An explosive atmosphere is a highly inflammable mixture of air and flammable substances, and constitutes a potential danger to workers.
Therefore there is a need for a European directive.
Organizational measures and technical specifications should be laid down in order to improve protection for workers' health and to ensure greater safety.
Graham Mather has done some excellent work here on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment.
What are the principles to be observed in order to avoid explosions and provide adequate protection?
The formation of explosive atmospheres must be prevented.
The igniting of explosive atmospheres must be avoided.
The effects of explosions must be limited so that they no longer constitute a hazard.
By observing each separate principle, the necessary protection can be achieved.
Rooms in factories should be divided up into various zones, depending on the level of risk.
Employers must be aware of their duty to inform and involve their employees and their representatives, and to listen in good time to what they have to say.
The safety measures must be checked at least once a year, using suitable instruments and modern technology, and must be under the constant supervision of a responsible person, to be appointed on the basis of their professional training and experience.
In order to provide equality of opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises, this directive must be implemented within a reasonable time.
Last but not least, a vade-mecum should be drawn up, in agreement with the Council, in order to explore the options for putting the minimum requirements into practice.
Our unanimity within the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment certainly sends a positive signal to workers, and also to the Commission and the Council.
