Mr President, I am surprised that you have allowed the objection in the topical and urgent debate pursuant to Rule 47, i.e. to switch the question of the transporting of atomic waste with the subject of elections in Bosnia.
I am referring to Rule 47, which says that a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with paragraph 1 cannot be included on the agenda for a debate on topical and urgent subjects etc. etc.... if the subject covered by this motion is already on the agenda for that part-session.
Now there is absolutely no doubt, Mr HÃ¤nsch, that the subjects of the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and elections are already on the agenda, since they feature in several reports that are to be debated this afternoon.
The reports by Mr Alavanos, Mr Mendiluce Pereiro, Mr Giansily, Mr Titley and Mr Pex are of course concerned with this subject.
I am very surprised that you should ever have allowed the motion by the Group of the European People's Party.
In doing so you have created a precedent!
I am therefore requesting that the matter should be discussed again this afternoon, at the Conference of Presidents, because up to now it has always been argued, in practice, that subjects for topical and urgent debate are not allowed if the subject is already being dealt with in other debates.
