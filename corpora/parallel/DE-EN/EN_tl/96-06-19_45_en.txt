Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is an astonishing degree of agreement to the effect that as far as the third pillar is concerned, results have so far been unsatisfactory.
Even the British Government is entirely in agreement with this view, and this is contrary to many of our citizens' expectations regarding European policy.
If we look for the reasons, the first thing that we find is the requirement that there should be unanimity in the decisions of the Council of Ministers.
However, if we look beyond this, we find that, on grounds of national sovereignty, it is claimed that certain decisions should not be taken on a Community basis, but ought to remain the preserve of the national authorities.
Yet suppose that Community police action would guarantee the public greater protection from crime than would a national procedure, then that would mean that the public were being deprived, in the name of national sovereignty, of a protection that they were actually entitled to.
If sovereignty leads to a situation in which the public are deprived of possible protection against crime, then I cannot imagine that sovereignty in that sense is supported by the will of the people.
Therefore, in the context of the summit and the negotiations over the Maastricht Treaty, the concept of sovereignty must be examined under the microscope.
Sovereignty is the basis of the nation state, and in the foreseeable future we shall no doubt need that as the organizational model for the purposes of performing public duties.
However, sovereignty must concentrate on those key areas in which it is indispensable, and it must allow a little room to manoeuvre so as to enable Community duties to be performed, not least as far as the third pillar is concerned.
