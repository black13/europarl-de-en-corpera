Madam President, in the motion for a resolution on broad economic guidelines there is at least one expression that is open to misunderstanding.
Therefore I should like, on behalf of my group, to make an explanatory statement regarding this expression.
We are of the opinion that a "relaxation of monetary policy' is only possible where it does not lead to the endangering of price stability, of interest levels and, therefore, of a possible upturn in the economy, because this is the prerequisite for the creation of new jobs in Europe.
Only if this is made clear are we prepared to agree to this resolution as it stands.
