Madam President, we are shocked at the death of Mrs Abiola, whose husband is in prison even though he was legitimately elected.
We are shocked at the way the Nigerian Government is behaving towards us.
The murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa gave rise to vehement international protests.
There were resolutions and discussions.
The Nigerian Government took an arrogant attitude to us in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and to the ACP Assembly but in the end there was some hope that we could enter into a dialogue and achieve a certain amount of democratization.
This hope sprang partly from the fact that we have economic relations with Nigeria and that new agreements were concluded.
Some of this has been destroyed again as a result of this murder.
This dictatorship is being supported by our trade relations, by us buying up oil instead of imposing an embargo and lastly also by the European Union selling arms.
We should not get our hands dirty here.
We should stop at this point and demand that the Nigerian Government initiate a process of democratization, immediately release Mr Abiola, move towards new elections and take legal measures to prosecute the murderers of Mrs Abiola.
Only by so doing can it signal a move towards democratization and real respect for human rights.
