Mr President, this third human rights subject also concerns the European Union's relationship with a dictatorial regime and the relations between politics and economic power.
This time we are concerned with Burma.
We are concerned with the National League for Democracy, with Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, with the opposition movement there.
The latest measures taken in Rangoon to suppress the opposition movement, which we support, have shocked us.
The question is, what can we do about it?
I believe we can make political protests, but we in our Member States should also use our economic power to persuade the appropriate undertakings to implement our political demand, namely: the need to respect human rights.
Undertakings should give practical support to our demands in their dealings with the political leadership of such countries.
If BMW from Germany, Heineken from the Netherlands, Total from France go to Burma now, their economic cooperation should be accompanied by political dialogue.
They must not fail to refer to the need for democracy!
Of course that should also form part of the negotiations which the Commission is conducting on behalf of the European Union and which we are conducting with the ASEAN states to ensure that human rights really are respected there and that the opposition has freedom of movement and expression.
