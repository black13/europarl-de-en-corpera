Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the terrible legacy of the Pinochet dictatorship has still not been overcome in Chile.
There are still more than one thousand unsolved cases of disappeared people, the torturers and murderers have not been found and sentenced, crimes have not been atoned for!
An unconstitutional amnesty law still covers the period from 1973 to 1978!
Unfortunately I have to add that torture is still taking place in the prisons!
Five political prisoners still fear the death sentence and the Amnesty International annual report that has just appeared paints a shockingly gloomy picture.
Today we are concerned with the case of a Spaniard working with CEPAL who was murdered by the Chilean secret service in 1976.
His file was wrongly closed.
But in fact we are concerned with far more than that, for the murder of Carmelo Soria is not an isolated case.
It is urgently necessary for the amnesty law pronounced by murderers to be suspended and for the government, military and police apparatus to be purged completely of all those who committed crimes during the military dictatorship.
The families have the right to know who murdered their relatives and that the perpetrators must atone for this.
There must never, never be torture in Chile again!
With the forthcoming signature of the EU-Chile framework agreement President Frei will testify to that.
