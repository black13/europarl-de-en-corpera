Mr President, first let me say that I am not speaking on behalf of the EPP Group because this time I am representing a minority of the EPP.
Mr Moorhouse has already spoken for the majority.
I just want to say one thing on behalf of this minority: we are a liberal party which can represent different views.
We systematically regard some nations as the whipping boys of the world and assert all kinds of things about them; it is quite clear that Turkey will figure among them.
Yet Turkey ought to be our friend, that would be in the European interest.
I at least take the view that we have been elected here in order to represent Europe, to represent European interests and not to go on some kind of worldwide excursions that may be wonderful but have no effect whatsoever.
As Europeans it is simply our duty to say some things more clearly, that is in our interest.
Mr President, I shall certainly not vote for these senseless resolutions.
