Mr President, all those who know, love and value Belarus and the people who live there are noting with great concern that human rights violations in that country are becoming a constant theme here.
There are continuous reports about the decline in democracy in that country.
Belarus is isolating itself more and more.
Wide circles of Belarussians, and not just the Popular Front but also the non-governmental organizations and the liberal democratic and social democratic forces within the Belarussian Parliament are making efforts to direct this process of transformation towards reforms.
Yet the stubborn line taken by the government keeps destroying these efforts.
We must continue to support the democratic forces in that country by adhering consistently to our decisions.
We should constantly remind the Belarussian Government that in signing the interim agreement it has also signed the democracy clause, which we consider important.
It is incomprehensible why the Belarussian Government is playing down the decision by this Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs and dismissing it as personal animosity.
