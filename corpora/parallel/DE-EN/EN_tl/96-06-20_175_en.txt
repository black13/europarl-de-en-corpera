Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, money does not stink, as the saying goes; I would add, unless it is laundered.
That takes me right into Mr Lehne's report, which I consider particularly thorough.
Money laundering is, as we know, only the final link in a long chain of criminal activities, many of which are coordinated by organized crime.
As we all know, these are cross-frontier phenomena which, like combating fraud in general, require intensive cooperation between the Member States of the European Union in the field of both domestic policy and judicial policy.
Consequently we need comprehensive legislative action to improve the coordination between the national judicial and police authorities.
In this context particular emphasis is laid on the need for appropriate procedural provisions in the Member States.
Only then will it be possible to detect and prosecute criminal money launderers successfully, for instance by making it easier to monitor telecommunications traffic or temporarily confiscating assets.
The rapporteur rightly points out that the criminals are entirely at home with computers and the most recent techniques.
In view of the enormous technical advances, it is therefore quite right to call for the existing European system for combating money laundering to be adjusted to technical innovations such as direct banking and prepaid cards and under no circumstances to delay this.
That this requires highly developed control systems and techniques but also of course specially trained personnel is self-evident.
The call to extend the measures to combat money laundering not just to money from drugs trafficking but to all the proceeds of organized crime is also important.
It is particularly necessary at this time for us in the European Parliament to give a signal to the people and to make them more confident that Europe is combating crime consistently and successfully.
In that sense the Lehne report is a major step forward.
