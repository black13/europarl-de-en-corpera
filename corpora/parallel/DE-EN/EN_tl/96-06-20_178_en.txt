Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur had to do more than just square the circle or hit a nail on the head.
Because of the 1991 directive he was forced to take a legislative approach to a subject that is after all basically financial and economic.
He had to deal with a range of criminal activities for which there is no EU criminal law.
He had to set up a police force for which there is neither a legal basis nor democratic or judicial control.
With the list of clean banks he was forced in the end to show the money launderers where best to invest their money and in the end he, who after all wants to combat money laundering as we all do, had to call for evidence that the practice of money laundering is on the increase and that it is playing a growing part within the network of criminal associations.
The rapporteur is certainly not responsible for the mistaken philosophy on which the entire money-laundering legislation is based.
For the basic mistake is to take money laundering as an established fact instead of destroying the economic preconditions that make it so and, secondly, to intervene in the protected private sphere by legislative means instead of withdrawing the protection from those who misuse it to cover up their criminal activities.
That creating 'clean banks' will be a strong weapon for combating money laundering is in my view the opposite of likely in more than one respect.
