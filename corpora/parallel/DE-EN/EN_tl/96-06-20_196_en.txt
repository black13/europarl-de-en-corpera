Mr President, the diversity of our languages is an integral component of our cultural heritage and must be preserved and maintained.
The planned action programme will support this important objective.
But let me just point to one aspect to which perhaps not quite enough attention is paid, that of the minority languages.
They too are an expression of cultural diversity and I am glad therefore that the rapporteur has made constructive proposals on this important question in several amendments.
The programmes must take account of minority languages, even if they are languages that are only the official language outside the Union.
Precisely these languages must not be excluded from the information society either.
For instance, a significant Slovenian minority lives in the southernmost province of Austria, KÃ¤rnten, and their language is protected and taken into consideration in the Austrian educational system in exemplary fashion.
Unfortunately one cannot say the same for the German-speaking minority in Slovenia.
But quite apart from that it would be important if pilot actions could be envisaged and carried out precisely for this kind of linguistic minority, as proposed in Amendment 29.
Actions of this kind could also give rise to interesting synergies in relation to enlargement eastward, which will naturally have a major impact on the Austrian frontier regions.
