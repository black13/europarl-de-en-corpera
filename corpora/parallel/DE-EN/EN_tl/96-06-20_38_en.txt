Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the viewpoint of a nuclear-free Member State the plain facts - I emphasize 'facts' - presented by the rapporteur look twice as serious.
We are dealing here with what is no less than a European and international mega-problem.
Combatting the illicit traffic in radioactive substances and nuclear materials is of course the concern of every country and should therefore be dealt with by the United Nations and be classified as a crime against humanity, as genocide was in the 1948 UN Convention.
Given the growth of illicit nuclear trafficking, it still seems legitimate to ask whether the European Union should not regard it as an urgent task to endeavour to get out of the nuclear industry.
At any rate, during the negotiations on the accession of new Member States, we will have to examine the safety aspect of their nuclear power stations very carefully indeed.
