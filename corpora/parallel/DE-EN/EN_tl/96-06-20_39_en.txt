Mr President, I will take less than two minutes.
I would like to ask you to give me an opportunity to clarify something.
I can just accept terms such as utter nonsense or similar interpretations, but not the word 'demagogical' for my statement!
That is why I would like to make a statement of fact that is not demagogical.
Twelve Member States of our Union are not familiar with the problem of nuclear trafficking, three are.
The police authorities of all three countries have confirmed to me as rapporteur that in no case could they establish the involvement of organized crime.
That statement was made by the German, the Italian and the Belgian police.
That is what I have to say on the subject of 'organized crime' and 'demagogy' .
