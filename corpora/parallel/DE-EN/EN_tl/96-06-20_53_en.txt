I want to take what has been expected of us again today, namely to work here for hours and then not to vote, as an opportunity to request that we finally reinstate voting time on Thursday evening.
We will not be able to do our parliamentary work here properly without that voting time.
I ask you to put this to the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents.
