The Pex report is about the way the Council treated the European Parliament at the last conciliation procedure.
And here the question arises: what interest has the Council in ignoring the European Parliament's proposed amendments in this manner?
After all Parliament is not primarily concerned with disputes about areas of competence, as keeps being suggested, but with the matter in hand.
The Council's proposed regulation falls well behind the existing means of supporting the CIS states.
Furthermore it does not take account of the new facts, namely that the EU now has a long border with Russia.
And lastly, what is called the compromise package really only regulates means of improving the way TACIS funds can flow back into the European countries and in such a way that all EU countries get their share.
It fully ignores the fact that the sufferers will be the people in the CIS countries.
Nor does it take note of the fact that small projects in particular will hardly be allowed now.
The disappearance of the entire social dimension and most of the environmental and health aspects will considerably impair the process of transformation in these countries.
By its attitude the Council is showing that it does not want these improvements in terms of content either, which is why it is hiding behind the arguments of the compromise package.
