Madam President, when I listened to Mrs Pack I actually had the feeling I should hand her my two minutes' speaking time, for what she said was so interesting, so clear and factual, and a good answer to the irresponsible demagogy we are faced with today.
The truth is, indeed, that we find ourselves in a time of democratic decline.
Anyone who knows a bit about Albania - unfortunately too few people know this country - will remember how things started out there.
I was there shortly after the collapse of the communist regime and saw the dreadful conditions that prevailed there.
Of course it is quite clear that you cannot have the kind of democracy we know in Switzerland or the UK there yet.
But there is no doubt that great progress has been made.
Something really is being done for the people in Albania.
The country has a government that really wants to do the right thing, and we have to recognize that.
That irregularities occurred during the elections cannot be denied.
The fact that the elections had to be repeated in 17 constituencies is evidence of that.
But in most constituencies the electoral process was orderly.
I very much regret that the opposition, which for the rest was made up almost entirely of communists, withdrew the electoral observers before the end of the elections.
They simply did not want to find out the truth because they knew full well from polls carried out in the course of the elections that they were facing a major defeat.
So I believe that we should do our utmost to ensure that Albania gets what it deserves, namely that it is accepted into the community of European democracies, even if that will still take a while.
