Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
It is always a pleasure to deal with people who know what they are talking about and that is quite definitely the case here.
Even if the report looks rather technical at first glance, it does cover major problems as regards content.
Let me particularly emphasize the fact that it is thanks to the rapporteur's and the committee's work that regionalization in the wine sector has now been established and trend away from the producer towards the vendor, towards artificial production, has been stopped.
In our group's view that has something to do with ecology, even if no specific reference is made to it here, because the description of origin allows the consumer to know where a product comes from and to check how it was grown.
In the age of BSE, when we have seen what anonymity and uncontrolled sales can lead to, it is particularly important to be stringent in this field.
Now one could say, in relation to sparkling wine in Russia, that it does not matter what you get drunk on, but of course here we are concerned not with alcohol but with a semi-luxury.
That is why I am very glad that this report was drawn up; our group supports it and the amendments it proposes.
