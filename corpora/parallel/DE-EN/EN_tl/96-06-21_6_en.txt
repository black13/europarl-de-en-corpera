Madam President, I had asked to speak before Mrs Van Dijk began talking about the networks, which cannot be discussed if there are no motorcyclists.
I refer you to the proceedings for 18-19 June, page 18: in connection with what Mrs Larive said just before Mrs van Dijk spoke.
Mrs Larive has just left for Cuba - I do not know if she has gone for good, I presume she is coming back - but the proceedings say &#x02BC;lastly, Madam President, an appeal to the motor cyclist himself, 82 years, average value'.
Motor cyclists are usually on the elderly side when they hang up their helmets for good, but Mrs Larive was not referring to 82-year-old motorcyclists, but to 82 decibels.
Will you have that corrected?
