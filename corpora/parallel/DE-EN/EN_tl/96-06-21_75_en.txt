Mr President, I just wanted to say the following on Mr Valdivielso's report.
We are facing a very serious problem in the Ceuta region because of developments in Gibraltar.
That will lead to political tensions.
Here the Valdivielso report raised a very important subject, namely aquaculture.
Any who knows this region is aware that it is almost predestined for aquaculture.
I just wanted to put the question whether joint aquaculture projects could not be carried out between Gibraltar, Ceuta and Melilla and also include Morocco, for then we could contribute towards the political detente of the present situation through a practical economic project.
That is why I welcome this excellent report but hope that we will also take it further, for this is where a real start can be made, which might prove important in the future.
