Madam President, the Schulz report was postponed yesterday and it says in the Minutes that it was deferred to the next part-session.
I would like to know whether the so-called mini-session in Brussels is or is not now a part of this plenary part-session, for that would mean that it is postponed to July, or whether the Brussels part-session should be regarded as a separate part-session.
I would also like to know whether this report is to be taken on Wednesday at the beginning of the part-session or on Thursday during voting time.
Would you please clarify this because it is in no way clear from the Minutes.
