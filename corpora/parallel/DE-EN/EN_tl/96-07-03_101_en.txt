Madam President, what the Commissioner said was most interesting.
However, she did not give her position on the main question.
How does the Commission interpret Article 100a(4)?
That is a relevant question for those who want to know whether Austria, Finland or Sweden can retain their national provisions in the field of environmental protection and the working environment.
That means it should not be insinuated that in using the measures they want to apply these three countries are trying to bring about arbitrary discrimination and covertly to restrict trade.
That is not the purpose of these three new countries.
The aim of these three new countries is to maintain and further improve the high environmental standards in Europe.
That is also the priority of the individual European citizen.
Commissioner, Article 69 of the Treaty of Accession states that specific provisions may be retained and will be reviewed by 1998.
It also says that regardless of the results of that review, the acquis communautaire shall apply from the end of the transitional period.
That is the real snag.
I would like you to tell me how things are to go on if no agreement can be reached?
Is what was promised to us in 1994 still applicable if difficulties arise in European harmonization?
Those are relevant questions, which have remained unanswered.
We do not want specific rules but would hope that Europe as a whole will go along with us and introduce the same rules that are already law in our three countries.
That is the subject today, not individual difficulties with cadmium, alkali-manganese batteries and so on.
