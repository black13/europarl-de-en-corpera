Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tabled two amendments because I had a burning need to do so.
Why?
Because the SAVE II programme, for which appropriations of ECU 150 m were proposed, was cut to ECU 45 m by the Council.
Just imagine: Germany is referring to its subsidiarity, Austria was actually in favour of it being cut to ECU 35 m.
Quite incredible!
We are the model European country in terms of environmental standards and yet we are cutting precisely those programmes that help us to implement these environmental standards.
What the Council has done here really is ludicrous!
That is why I think it is important to draw attention to this now and to say, that will not do!
That is not what the European Parliament wants!
We want to support good programmes that help us to save energy and that is why the SAVE II programme should be allocated at least ECU 150 m if it is to be at all competitive.
