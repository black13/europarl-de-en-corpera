Thank you, Mr President.
Mrs Peijs, I would like to compliment you on the energetic manner in which you always raise the question of the SMEs and put forward your arguments, many of which I agree with.
I am very glad to see how energetically you keep doing so, in our committee and here in Parliament.
The Council should not only take that to heart, that is one aspect, but should also take a closer look at the problems of the SMEs in Europe.
For small and medium-sized enterprises and the policy vis Ã  vis these enterprises represent the policy for the basis of employment in Europe.
Basically, in terms of support measures the SMEs still come off worst in comparison with large firms, with shortterm industrial projects, especially in rural areas.
Now one could say that these are the usual arguments put forward by parliamentarians, who always want more and more and are never satisfied.
That is not the case.
I regard the ELISE programme as a very good project.
And it will bear fruit.
My request to the Commission and the Council, and especially to the Council, is that they draw up a more consistent and well thought-out general plan for the SMEs.
To be paid too late for work already done, especially outside Europe, spells the end for small and medium-sized firms, which is why my group endorses and supports a directive on payment periods, as referred to in Mr Harrison's report.
We also support Mr Hendrick's proposal, which Mrs Hautala will be discussing in a moment.
