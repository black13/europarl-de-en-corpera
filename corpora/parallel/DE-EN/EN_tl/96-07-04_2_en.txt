President Santer reacted irritably to my question yesterday and accordingly congratulated himself on the fact that he was not descending to my level.
A Member from one of the large groups asked me whether I would accept that as it stood.
Surely no self-respecting Parliament can allow itself to be attacked in this way by an Executive!
That is why I want to explain my question yesterday and clarify some personal questions which President Santer brought up.
Firstly, Mr Santer is an honourable man in his own choice of words.
I had no intention of saying nor did I say anything that would cast any doubt about that.
However, I must confess that I am somewhat concerned about one thing, namely that the political attitude displayed by President Santer yesterday in pretending that every failure and every defeat was a success could one day plunge our EU into a serious crisis of credibility.
It fills me with consternation that the question about the Lyons summit and the way it was used for electoral purposes, which is an objective one - and not just for President Santer - was punished with authoritarian disparagement on the part of the Executive, for it makes me pessimistic about our parliamentary future if objective problems of this kind can no longer be addressed in graphic language.
But I am not giving up hope that this was merely a slip-up and that in fact President Santer has a more highly developed sense of democracy than to regard himself as an authority who may at most be criticized in the roundabout language of sycophants.
Ladies and gentlemen, I very much hope that you will realise that here I am addressing a common concern of this House.
