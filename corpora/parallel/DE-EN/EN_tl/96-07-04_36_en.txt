Madam President, our group voted against the Schulz report because for internal policy reasons Mr Schulz has created an extremely contradictory report through his amendments, by which he has tried to belittle the Bavarian security organs, which represent an important front in the fight against organized crime.
That is why we could not vote for that report and we call on Mr Schulz to follow the example of the US Congress and the US Senate, where both large parties have jointly initiated a major programme to combat nuclear smuggling, which they designated as the number one threat to the United States, on the basis of a report by the Institute for Strategic Studies which drew on hundreds of cases of nuclear crimes in the territory of the former Soviet Union.
The United States has managed to get the major democratic forces to cooperate.
Mr Schulz has missed that opportunity and I hope we will soon follow the example of the United States in this area.
