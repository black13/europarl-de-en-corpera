Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Martin, for his report.
Nevertheless, at second reading of this proposal, I should like to make one or two critical comments.
We are discussing aromatized wines, wine-based drinks and wine-product cocktails.
All these terms include the word 'wine' .
In accordance with all current foodstuffs legislation in Europe, wine is a drink that is produced from the fermentation of fresh grapes.
We must bear in mind that, in using the word wine to describe a composite drink with a minimum wine content of only 75 % - aromatized wine, that is - we are to a certain extent undermining the significance of this natural process, which has been employed by man for over 5500 years.
I believe that we must respond to this situation with clear rules governing descriptions.
When consumers purchase and consume this product, they must be able to recognize clearly that it is a composite drink.
They must be able to trust in the fact that they are not being offered a counterfeit.
I agree with the opinion of previous speakers that we must adopt a common organization of the European wine market and find a joint solution as soon as possible.
I believe that this will make an important contribution to ensuring the confidence of European wine producers and consumers, who have a right to be offered quality products.
