Mr President, if the common position is adopted in this form, it will lead to serious discrimination against airlines at their home airport.
The draft directive will allow all airport managing bodies, from the outset and for an indefinite period, to provide unlimited groundhandling services without being required to undergo a selection procedure in the same way as the airlines.
From the economic point of view, there is no real justification for airport managing bodies to receive better treatment than the airlines which use the airport in question as their home base.
The airlines possess the necessary facilities and qualified staff at their home airport.
They should therefore be fully allowed to utilize these staff, as well as to make optimum use of all these facilities, so as to be able to offer a complete third-party and self-handling package at their home airport.
The destruction of current and future jobs within airlines can hardly be the Council's intention.
