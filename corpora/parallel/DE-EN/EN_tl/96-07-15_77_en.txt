Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before the House today a report which has been causing us a great deal of concern for several months.
I should therefore like to reiterate that our main objective is - and must continue to be - to ensure that airports remain as independent economic bodies.
At both readings, therefore, we have attempted to introduce stringent requirements for self-handlers.
This is the only way to preserve the investment power of airports and to protect groundhandling services from market dominance by home airlines.
I also believe that it is imperative for employees to be represented in the user committee.
The thinking of management and labour must undoubtedly be incorporated into such important decisions.
The harmonization of training and safety standards will be to everyone's benefit: airlines, passengers and employees.
It is very rare that a common position is rejected by the committee concerned.
However, we have been confirmed in our decision by the numerous comments of all the interested parties.
It must be clear to everyone: the Council and the Commission have failed to achieve a balanced compromise between the interests of airlines, airports and employees.
If the Commissioner is unable to assure us today that he supports our amendments, this House will have only one course of action: rejection of the common position!
The Council must finally take on board the fact that this House takes its work very seriously, and that - as is widely known - Parliament's proposals have met with the broad approval of the various interested parties.
