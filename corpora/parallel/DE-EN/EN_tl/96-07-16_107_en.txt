Mr President, according to Article 129b, the trans-European networks must contribute to the strengthening of the Community's economic and social cohesion.
The Union's actions in this field are required to promote, firstly, the harmonious development of the Community as a whole, and secondly - and in particular - the linking of the island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions of the Community.
From the point of view of the coastal regions, this second requirement was not at first given adequate consideration.
In the end, the Committee on Regional Policy managed to ensure that it was taken more into account.
The joint text now provides for the sea-side continuation of transport infrastructure, in accordance with the 'road to sea' concept, which includes the integration of seaports and short-sea shipping.
From the point of view of regional policy, this is a success.
These two aspects of the guidelines must now be translated into action.
If just the major projects are implemented, only the economically strong regions will be interlinked.
That will mean that the economically weak and peripheral regions will miss out on the economic boost that is intended to result from the development of the trans-European transport network.
Furthermore, provision must be made for an adequate number of stopping-off, approach and departure points.
This is the only way to prevent a large number of regions from becoming purely transit areas.
In the view of the Committee on Regional Policy, this is a classic conflict between transport policy and regional planning policy, which can only be resolved by means of solidarity between the regions.
However, there is also a need for solidarity with regard to the codecision procedure.
The impression has been strengthened that the Member States need to be shaken up in this respect.
Parliament will no longer allow itself to be deprived of the democratic rights conferred on it by the Maastricht Treaty.
