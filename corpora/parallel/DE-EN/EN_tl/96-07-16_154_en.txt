Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
I should now like to ask you what form the Commission believes the treatment of social issues at the WTO Conference in Singapore might take, and whether the Commission intends to advocate the establishment of minimum social standards - for example on the question of child labour - within the framework of the WTO agreement.
There is a proposal for a Council directive on a four-year scheme for a generalized system of preferences.
This proposal provides for the possibility of granting preferential treatment to third countries which endeavour to protect workers' rights, prohibit child labour, and so on.
What measures is the Commission taking to secure acceptance of this social clause at international level, for example in the framework of the WTO?
