I should like to thank the Commissioner for fighting - despite the Kalanke ruling - for positive measures and firm quotas.
I am also familiar with the figures, and I know of course that for women, the glass ceiling will be reached at some point, and that despite the Commissioner's efforts, not everything has yet been achieved.
There is another source of bitterness which I would ask the Commissioner to address.
There are age limits for recruitment to the Union's institutions, and those age limits should undoubtedly be abolished.
Considering that the retirement age is being raised from 60 to 65 in virtually every Member State, I believe that we must also eliminate these age limits for recruitment to the Union's institutions.
