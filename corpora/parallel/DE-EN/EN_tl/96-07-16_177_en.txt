I should like to make two comments on the honourable Member's remarks.
Firstly, Greece's financial contribution will be funded from the budget of the Ministry of Culture.
The honourable Member did not say if the Greek Minister of Culture has stated otherwise.
If that is the case, we shall have to investigate the matter - and I shall see to that.
Secondly, with regard to the question of traffic problems, I have already indicated that the co-financing of the construction of an underground car park will undoubtedly help to resolve some of these problems.
