During Mr Cravinho's last visit, we explained when the next payments could be expected.

The Commission and Parliament cannot, on the one hand, constantly attach importance to the necessary checks being carried out with the utmost care and, on the other, complain about those checks when amounts are owing.
We are endeavouring to speed up our procedures but, unfortunately, careful checks sometimes take longer than we would wish.
We acknowledge the problem, and we have discussed the outstanding difficulties with the Portuguese Government.
In these talks, moreover, I had the impression that there is complete understanding for our position.
