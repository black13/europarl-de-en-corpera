Mr President, it is indeed true that there are a host of unanswered questions with regard to this issue.
And I am quite unable to say when those questions will be answered, let alone whether the answers will be satisfactory.
That is why we have asked the Greek Government to reconsider the priorities for the second Community support framework.
I would underline the fact, however - and this is the point the honourable Member is making - that the Community support framework is, in any case, at present totally oversubscribed.
This means that, one way or another, we shall have to reconsider which projects are most important and must definitely be carried out.
The honourable Member will be aware that the two major motorway projects - Pathe and Via Egnatia, as well as certain others - are still unresolved.
Consequently, I believe that the right approach is to establish the priorities and determine what can be funded successfully up to the end of the support period, and what needs such careful clarification that it is perhaps no longer feasible.
We are currently engaged in such discussions with the Greek Government.
