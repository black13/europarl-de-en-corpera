In the first place, the Structural Fund regulations are valid until 1999.
They were approved by all the Member States and cannot by changed by a stroke of the pen from the Commission.
Secondly, the new Structural Fund regulations have been in force since 1994: in other words, they only recently came into full effect, after a difficult period of approval.
I believe that is important to gather experiences first, before making changes on the grounds of initial difficulties or problems of adaptation.
Thirdly, it is indeed our aim to integrate the local and regional levels into structural policy to a greater extent.
In this respect, however, there are problems within Sweden which we cannot resolve, but which can only be sorted out by the Swedish Government, in partnership with the local players.
As far as any administrative muddle is concerned, we must always bear in mind that there are two kinds of muddle: that caused by the Commission, which we are now trying to clear up within the framework of the regulations currently in force; and the muddle at national level.
After all, nowhere is it stipulated that, for example, four ministries must be involved in managing a Structural Funds project.
There is clearly room for simplification at national level in this context too.
