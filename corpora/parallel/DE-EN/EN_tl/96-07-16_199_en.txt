That is possible in theory.
In practice, however, I doubt that the majority of Member States would allow structural policies to be agreed between the Commission and the regional or local authorities alone.
The interpretation of the subsidiarity principle hitherto has, of course, principally concerned subsidiarity between the Commission and the Member States.
However, we have always laid great stress - admittedly, not always with success - on the need to extend application of the subsidiarity principle from the level of central government to the lower levels, and to establish a genuine, practical partnership in the implementation of the Structural Funds.
And this is not because the Commission is interested in bypassing anyone, but because our experience has shown that the more the people on the ground for whom these policies are devised become involved, can contribute their ideas and also help to monitor efficiency, then the more success we achieve.
