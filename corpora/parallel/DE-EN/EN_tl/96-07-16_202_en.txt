Mr President, I readily admit that I enjoy listening to the charming Commissioner, as well as seeing her here.
When I tabled this question, however, I was unaware that she would be speaking on this subject in the Committee on Regional Policy.
I should like to put a very specific supplementary question: will the Commissioner seek to ensure that, when the Structural Funds are reorganized, the Objective 1 regions lose some of their spare fat?
I come from an Objective 5b region, and I am concerned that those regions sometimes lose out because all the other regions insist on keeping what they have.
