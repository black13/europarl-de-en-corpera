Mr Schiedermeier, if by the 'spare fat' of the Objective 1 regions you mean support for achieving or surpassing the goal of having a GDP which is 75 % of the Union's average, then I believe that we must examine very carefully how we are dealing with these regions.
Indeed, the aim of structural policy is clearly to help the disadvantaged regions - and one way in which we define being disadvantaged is in terms of a percentage of the Union's average GDP.
If this criterion is to be retained in future, then we must draw the necessary conclusions.
I believe that we must have a far wider-ranging debate on this subject.
This is one element of that debate, and we shall have to discuss it further.
