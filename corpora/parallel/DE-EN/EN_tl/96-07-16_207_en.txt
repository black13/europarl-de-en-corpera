Mr Vallv√©, the payments will only be suspended if the reference values laid down by the Council in its recommendations are exceeded.
For 1995, those values were - as a ratio of public deficit to GDP - 10.7 % for Greece, 5.8 % for Portugal and 5.9 % for Spain.
All three Member States stayed below their respective reference values, and it was therefore not necessary to block the funds.
However, the Cohesion Fund regulations do contain an element of conditionality, and so we have no choice but to act accordingly if the reference values are exceeded.
The Commission has no other decision-making options.
