Mr Nicholson, you will be aware that I personally have been pressing strongly for swift action, and that I also take great pains to ensure that we actually decide on projects.
I therefore regularly ask to see the lists of approved projects, which then lead to corresponding payments.
When I look at the host of activities that are now being initiated - and I asked to see a schedule of the decisions once again today - my feeling is that we have been making considerable efforts.
I would even go so far as to say that we are acting more swiftly in the case of Northern Ireland than in the case of other regions.
A short while ago, we were discussing the implementation of the URBAN initiative in United Kingdom, where the approval and implementation of the programme for Belfast, for example, is viewed with some envy.
You will see, therefore, that there is a considerable difference between the normal procedures and the efforts being made to implement the programme for Northern Ireland.
Nevertheless, I shall continue my endeavours, and I should be grateful to the honourable Member for any specific indications as to where snags may be occurring.
And if he thinks that these snags are the fault of the Commission, then he must let me know directly.
With regard to the question of consultants, we are, of course, frequently faced with the problem that those who do not know their way around so well depend on the help of consultants.
I would stress, however, that enlisting technical help does not necessarily mean employing consultants and spending part of the funds on consultancies and similar bodies.
On the contrary, the local partnerships and community groups, for example, can use the technical assistance which is available to help them draw up their proposals.
