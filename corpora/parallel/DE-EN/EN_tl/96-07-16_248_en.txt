Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Austria is to hold its first direct elections to the European Parliament on 13 October, and there is currently a great deal of debate as regards what Parliament can achieve, what individual Members can achieve, and who are the winners and losers in the European Union.
There is also some discussion in Austria of how Members are paid and who pays them, both of which are, in my opinion - and let me make this quite clear - entirely legitimate topics.
He who pays the piper calls the tune, as the old saying rightly has it.
So financial transparency is an important issue when people come to consider who is best able to defend their interests.
Both the reports before the House today suggest ways of guaranteeing our citizens the financial transparency that is required.
They both have a lengthy history, which has already been discussed.
I would simply say here that there were important and objective reasons for the problems that have arisen in drawing them up.
The different legal traditions in the fifteen Member States have made it almost impossible to persuade the necessary number of Members to commit themselves to a common solution.
Now, however, we have found a common solution, but I have to say that it is far from perfect, not because the main ideas present any difficulties, but because there are still certain side-issues concerning problems of definition.
We hope that the compromise will produce sound, workable and transparent solutions for the future.
We also hope that over the coming weeks and months in Austria and Finland - where elections are also to be held - and indeed throughout the Union, people will judge the work done by Members of the House not just on financial criteria, but also on other issues, such as the central question of who best represents their interests.
