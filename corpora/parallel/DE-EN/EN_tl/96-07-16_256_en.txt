Mr President, a good many people in this House have been angry with the Greens for criticizing Members' undeclared income and the lack of clear rules governing their expenses, and people have been quick to accuse us of currying favour with the public.
However, I think that if there had not been criticism from within the House, it would soon have come from outside and would have weakened Parliament's standing.
How can we try to explain why there has been this endless tug-of-war about banning the acceptance of gifts?
How can we explain why Members make up to 50 % profit on their travel expenses?
How can we explain why travel expenses are paid even if Members have not made the journey and even if they live in Brussels anyway?
How can we explain that some people claim allowances for attending meetings of committees of which they are not even members, that meetings are deliberately extended to the following day so that Members can claim a second day's allowance, and that Members employ their relatives as assistants?
I could easily go on with this list of abuses, and only my lack of speaking time prevents me from doing so!
