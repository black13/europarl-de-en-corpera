Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too would like to congratulate Mr Caudron.
His report deserves our support, but it also requires some modification, since there are obviously two sides to the ECSC.
On the one hand, it is an example of a robust industrial policy with its own research and social arm, whose carefully regulated and focused long-term strategy has, broadly speaking, succeeded in bringing structural change to the sector.
On the other hand, it is also a prime example of an industrial model which we all know started to give us problems a long time ago.
It is highly monopolized, with cartels and a die-hard aristocracy among the workers.
It pursues an aggressive external trade policy.
These are the less favourable aspects which the Community cannot afford to allow to continue in the longer term.
So what we need to do is to carry on with the positive side of the ECSC while at the same time making it more open and less privileged.
The ECSC reserves, for example, cannot be treated as some sort of private fund for the coal and steel industries.
Raw materials and energy are more general issues, and we are going to have to discuss exactly how we want them to be used.
