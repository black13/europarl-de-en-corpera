Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as other speakers have already said, there are four freedoms in the internal market.
Three are geared to economic interests, whilst one is the focus of popular expectation in Europe.
Three of them - the economic freedoms - have been achieved, but the free movement of persons has not become a reality.
I wish to know why this should be?
We are told that freedom for people represents a greater risk.
But is that really true, if one considers the environmental risks involved in freedom of movement for goods, in the explosive upturn in mobility, the waste of energy and the excessive division of labour in Europe?
Goods have to be given free access to markets, even if they do not meet the standards or conform to the traditions or safety expectations of the Member States.
But we are told that it is people who represent the risk.
On the contrary, we are facing much greater risks as a result of the free movement of goods, currencies and services.
Many people are prepared to tolerate those risks only because of the promise to introduce free movement of persons.
By delaying and failing to fully implement freedom of movement of persons, the Union is denying the rights of its own people.
To restrict freedom of travel to citizens of the Union, and to continue to make it difficult even for them, is to deny Europe's openness to the world.
It means that the fears of a Fortress Europe are being borne out by Union policy.
This is a policy that is based not on people's needs but on fear of people, a policy geared not towards cultural openness in Europe but towards total control of the population, a policy that divides, rather than unites Europe.
