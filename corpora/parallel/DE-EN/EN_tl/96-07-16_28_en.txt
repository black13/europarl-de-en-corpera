Madam President, freedom to travel is probably the most important element in creating the internal market as an area without internal frontiers.
Implementing this fundamental freedom will meet the expectations of many citizens of the Member States.
For several decades, the people of the former communist countries were denied the fundamental freedom to travel.
It is therefore all the more important that no one - and particularly not those people - should be treated as a second-class citizen within the Union, not least at the internal frontiers.
Amongst the measures needed to counter any possible increase in crime after the removal of all the controls, and to prevent illegal immigration by third-country nationals who are already in the Union illegally, are more intensive cooperation by police forces and social services, and the effective exchange of information through Europol.
