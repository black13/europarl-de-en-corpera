Madam President, I have a question concerning yesterday's order of business which was approved when the agenda was finally adopted.
My question is this: how can a report - in this case the report on groundhandling services - be brought forward by a day?
It is one thing to expect us, as Members of the European Parliament, to be capable of preparing a speech in an hour and a half, but what about those members of the public who are catching an early flight this morning so that they can be here when we discuss groundhandling services this afternoon, and who have made a hotel reservation for tonight so that they can be here for the vote tomorrow?
This makes a complete nonsense of the effort we have all been making to ensure that our sittings are open and members of the public can participate.
