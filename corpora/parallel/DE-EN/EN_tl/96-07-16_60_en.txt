Mr President, I should like to support Mr Schulz's motion to refer the three reports back to the committees responsible.
It really is surprising, to put it mildly, that just when Parliament is dealing with an opinion on a particular issue as a prelude to a Council decision, the Council is embarking on an entirely new procedure about which it is clear that the Commission and Parliament know nothing.
This is no way for us to deal with one another!
We shall therefore ask the Council to explain its motives, and to deliver that explanation where it is required - in the committees responsible.
For that reason, we would ask you not to vote today but, by referring the matter back to committee, to give us an opportunity of putting some urgent questions to the Council - which may prove embarrassing - about how it came to embark on this procedure.
