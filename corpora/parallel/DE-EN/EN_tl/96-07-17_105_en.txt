Madam President, we voted for this resolution, which was drawn up jointly with most of the other groups.
We should have liked it to be more forceful in some points.
We should also have welcomed the adoption of the amendments that called quite explicitly for the appointment of a committee of inquiry.
Nevertheless, we assume that the resolution itself will result in a committee of inquiry being appointed.
Mr Santini, in his explanation of vote, clearly reiterated why this is necessary.
We now hope that this afternoon's Conference of Presidents will recommend the establishment of a committee of inquiry and that Parliament will be able to vote on it tomorrow and institute the committee in due form.
If it is necessary to use this new instrument, which has been available to us since Maastricht, the purpose of its use is not to act against the Commission, be it in the case of BSE or in any other case, but to work with the Commission in its present efforts to identify where faults have occurred with a view to ensuring that both Parliament and the Commission follow a consistent line in future in the implementation of measures against this BSE epidemic.
