This report has two sides to it.
It can be unreservedly supported in its criticism of the shortcomings, restrictions and limited effectiveness of the Union's common foreign-policy stance.
As far as my own country is concerned, I can say that our neutrality has neither prevented us from participating in any previous initiatives nor will it prevent us from not only actively supporting but also helping to shape this common international policy of the Union.
But there is also a second side to this report, and that is the presentation of its strategy for defence policy, with which I - and no doubt others too - have certain problems.
Talk of Europe as a power with a deterrent capacity sends a shiver down the spine, not of the potential enemies of Europe but of the peoples of this continent.
I consider it wrong to want to make the Union into a nuclear power.
The potential strength of this Union is a broad security partnership with those States that are not yet Members or that may never become Members.
Austria, with its neutrality, has no problem at all in participating in the dynamic further development of the Union.
But a warning needs to be voiced in good time against any development that could ultimately result in this whole Union also assuming the status of a military pact.
