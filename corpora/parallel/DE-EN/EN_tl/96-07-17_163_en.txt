Mr President, once again the mounting unemployment in Europe has been cited, yet once again few speakers have acknowledged the real causes.
The President of the ECOFIN Council is also trying to pretend that the EU has nothing to do with the loss of millions of jobs, that the neoliberal crash course we have triggered off with the convergence criteria, and which is apparently to be pushed through at any price, simply does not exist.
It is almost cynical to speak of the responsibility of the Member States for employment policy in full awareness of the fact that the convergence criteria have deprived the Member States of their last vestige of control over their own employment policies, that they are practically forced to consolidate their budgets with fast, hot money from the social security budgets instead of through necessary structural reforms.
On the other hand, however, there is no competent body and no money to pursue a European employment policy.
We are rushing headlong into monetary union without first creating a social union.
We have mounted the horse before bridling it, and we should not be surprised if we suffer a nasty fall.
