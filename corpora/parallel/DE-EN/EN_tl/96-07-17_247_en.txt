Mr President, can the presidency tell me why it is considering sanctions against Burma, a move for which I have a certain amount of sympathy, whereas sanctions against Cuba, for example, are felt to be counterproductive?
I should like to know basically whether there is a general political line on sanctions.
We want to enforce respect for human rights.
We have economic interests.
We must strike a balance between these, but we should not apply double standards.
