Madam President, it is very gratifying to note that tourism also features in the list of priorities of the Irish presidency.
I should like to point out that the entire European tourism and travel industry has great expectations of the Irish presidency.
The substance of these expectations is that this industry should finally be granted the official and legal status commensurate with its actual social and economic importance and with its contribution to the maintenance of peace and international understanding.
A few months ago, a majority of the European Parliament voted in favour of tourism having its own legal basis in the Treaty.
It would be very good and very gratifying if, under the influence of the Irish presidency, the Council also endorsed this position, which has important implications for the preservation and creation of jobs.
