Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the abduction of children is a phenomenon which frequently occurs, and in which the children are the main sufferers.
They are snatched from their familiar surroundings and plunged into a situation of conflicting feelings which may have serious consequences on their further development, which can then be put right only with a great deal of difficulty.
I have had plenty of conversations on this subject with many of the people involved and also with NGOs, and I also know what it is like for the children.
Yet in these various processes the children involved are not sufficiently listened to and taken seriously.
We cannot close our eyes to the fact that very often the family, in the traditional sense of the word, no longer exists.
The statistics in every country, and in the Union, show us that the number of single parents is increasing.
In order to be fair to the children in such cases, statutory provisions are necessary.
I should like to see the Convention on the Rights of Children added to the existing conventions mentioned in this motion for a resolution.
Furthermore, I should like to point out that the existing conventions have not yet been ratified by all Member States and incorporated into their own legislation.
In addition, I would ask the Commission to inform us about all forms of cross-border abduction of children within the Union, and not only about the type that we have been talking about today.
On this subject an appropriate investigation should be set up, financed and coordinated, in order to determine what the results of the European integration process are as far as children are concerned.
I would also ask the European Council, at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, to designate children as an independent group of persons.
I believe that it is important that children should be given independent rights.
