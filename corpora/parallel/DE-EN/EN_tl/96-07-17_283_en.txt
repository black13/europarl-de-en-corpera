Mr President, Mr Kittelmann, I know that this is really more of a technical report, but nevertheless we must also look at the political background, as the previous speaker has already said.
Last December, we, the European Parliament, took an important decision regarding the EU's relations with Turkey.
That decision was based only partially on real changes, for example in the constitution.
Much of it was based on promises and hopes which the European Parliament expressed at the time.
Mrs Çiller, who was then the Turkish Prime Minister, appealed to us to support her in keeping the fundamentalists out of power.
Yet now all that has been forgotten.
She shares the government of the country with them, and is now Foreign Minister.
Promises, such as respect for human rights, and the positive revision of proceedings against those members of parliament who were condemned on the basis of a very problematical law, have been forgotten.
How will Turkish women retain their equal rights?
Why are people still being tortured?
Why do people disappear, and why are people still dying after being tortured in police stations or after being interrogated?
What, if anything, has changed, and what, if anything, has improved?
I feel that Mrs Çiller has disappointed my hopes of a Europeoriented Turkey.
If things go on like this, I shall no longer need to worry about what basis the Joint Committee should work on, but I have to ask myself whether the money that the EU is making available might not be better invested in other countries.
