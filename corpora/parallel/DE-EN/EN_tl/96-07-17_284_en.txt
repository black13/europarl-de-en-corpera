Mr President, we could agree to the changes to the Commission's text proposed in Mr Kittelmann's report, but only if we ceased to be aware of their context, i.e. the customs union with Turkey.
In this false framework, however, such proposed technical improvements, which in practice are sensible, would not produce any better result in substance.
I can still remember very well how seven months ago, in this house, we voted in favour of a customs union with Turkey.
Now the Islamic fundamentalists are in government, and Mrs Ã‡iller has helped them to get there.
So what lessons have those who once recommended the customs union learned from the failure of their strategy?
It seems to me that instead of drawing certain conclusions they are now simply sticking their heads in the sand and acting as though nothing has happened.
But this ostrich-like policy, this strategy of going ahead with our eyes firmly closed, is probably something that we shall very soon come to regret.
There must be no preferential treatment for a state which does not even respect the most elementary fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of opinion, and which is waging a dirty war against a section of its population, namely the Kurds.
The European Parliament should therefore take no further steps in the wrong direction, and should forget about any decisions to push ahead with the customs union - and here I am talking only about the financial protocols - until democracy and peace have been restored in Turkey.
I would ask all those who agreed at the time to review their decision again, and to think about the reasons for their agreement.
