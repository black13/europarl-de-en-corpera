Mr President, the report - and Mr Schwaiger has emphasized this point - says that this is primarily and exclusively a technical regulation.
Of course we should agree with that definition, and therefore I shall also give my full agreement to this decision.
However, I did not, at the time, agree to the customs union with Turkey, and I feel that subsequent developments have more than vindicated my decision.
I am sure that many of the people who said yes at the time must now be looking at their decision with increasing doubt and growing dissatisfaction.
Let us just remember, it was made emphatically clear to us at the time that the conclusion of the customs union would be a crucial argument in preventing large sections of the Turkish electorate from giving the fundamentalists the majority in that country.
And yet that politician, who at the time stated so emphatically that she wanted to halt this fundamentalist upsurge, has now formed an alliance with that party, which in spite of everything was successful in the elections.
I do not know whether it is true, as a Turkish opposition politician has stated, that this is a joint venture, the main purpose of which is to prevent the surprising wealth of both party leaders from being investigated by parliament.
One thing, however, is clear: what is being done is to make possible all those things that we were told, before the election, were going to be prevented.
We have already been told how many promises Turkey has failed to keep, and it is now time that we asked ourselves seriously whether the present government really wants to take Turkey along the path to Europe.
