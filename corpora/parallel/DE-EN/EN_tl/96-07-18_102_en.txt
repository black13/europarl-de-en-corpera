Madam President, we Austrian Social Democrats are very pleased finally to have been able to vote for this report because, after the adoption of amendments, a security policy perspective which in our opinion is dangerous, risky and, more especially, unacceptable to our country no longer represents the opinion of this House.
We are not in favour of the continuation of the Cold War by other means; we favour a new start in security policy free of preconceptions.
This new start must not lead us into military blocs bristling with weapons, but only to a new kind of common security system for Europe.
This text now explicitly recognizes that we can learn from different forms of security policy experience, especially that of the neutral states, and that has enabled us to vote for this report.
