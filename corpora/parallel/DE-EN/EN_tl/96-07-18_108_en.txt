Madam President, we Austrian Social Democrats want to see the European Parliament make an effective contribution to the search for a comprehensive, forward-looking security policy concept.
Today's vote was a step in that direction.
By adopting the amendments of the Social Democratic Group, this House has turned aside from continuing the outworn concept of the Cold War.
We are happy that reference to a common nuclear deterrent could be removed from the report, that the report reflected not only the historical experience of NATO but also the positive historical experience of neutrality and that no one-sided emphasis was placed on military security.
We Austrian Social Democrats advocate a modern comprehensive security concept.
We will participate actively and in a spirit of solidarity to the further development of an effective common foreign and security policy in Europe, but on the basis of a comprehensive security policy.
