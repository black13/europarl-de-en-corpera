Mr President, I do not see that as a threat.
Some months ago we discussed Burma, last month we discussed Burma, and now we are doing so again.
We are disturbed by the death of James Nicols, the Consul for Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden.
His death is evidence of torture in that country.
He was prevented from sleeping, he was not given medical care.
We can no longer tolerate this inhuman behaviour, this inhuman treatment by the SLORC.
According to information from the IMF, 3.1 % of the gross domestic product of Burma in 1994 was generated by forced labour.
That is a measure of this tragedy, which we cannot simply stand aside from.
Perhaps it was our protest, perhaps it was also the commitment of the NGOs that has so far prevented Heineken and Carlsberg from investing there.
There are other potential investors, such as BMW, who we hope will adopt the same stance.
We, particularly the Commission and the Council, are also being called upon to react.
I do not think the Commission should grant any more preferences.
We must make it clear diplomatically that relations will be suspended if the situation does not change.
The Council must also make that clear, particularly in the context of relations with the ASEAN states.
In conclusion, let me say that we must continue to support Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, and I hope that diplomacy will bear fruit in this matter.
