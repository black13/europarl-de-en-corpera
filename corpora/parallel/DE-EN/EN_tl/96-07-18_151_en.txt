Madam President, on 10 May there was a mass break-out of Vietnamese refugees from the Whitehead Detention Camp in Hong Kong.
This highlights a worrying situation.
There are still 25 000 Vietnamese 'boat people' in Asian camps, 15 000 of them in Hong Kong.
Nevertheless, 50 000 boat people have returned voluntarily under a UN programme.
In Hong Kong, however, about 2 000 people were also forcibly deported.
I criticize that, because we also have Vietnamese people in the Federal Republic of Germany who are due to be deported.
I do not think that people can be simply expelled in this way.
The right thing to do is to set up programmes and help them with their repatriation.
For that reason, we oppose the deportation of these people from Hong Kong.
On the other hand, we call on the Commission to use its efforts in international fora in order to ensure that funds are made available for new repatriation programmes under which people from Hong Kong and other Asian states or from Europe can settle in Vietnam, if that is what they want.
No asylum-seekers must be expelled from Hong Kong or from the Federal Republic of Germany, and I think that the Commission should promote a programme for Vietnam, making use of the 17 million budgeted.
