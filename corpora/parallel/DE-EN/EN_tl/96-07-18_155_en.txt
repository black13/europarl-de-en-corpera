Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am also concerned over the situation of Taye Woldesmayat, Chairman of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association, about whom we have been hearing here.
He was arrested at Addis Ababa Airport without charges.
I tried to do something for him and received a letter from the Embassy stating that he had been arrested on legitimate grounds.
Detailed charges were not given but, basically, he is being accused of clandestine activity.
As he cannot engage a lawyer and has no contact with his family, legitimate conditions for detention under the rule of law do not apply.
We must make it clear to the Embassy or the Government that we do not approve of that.
The Ethiopian Teachers' Association is constantly harassed and persecuted.
We witnessed a similar case back in December 1993, when Mr Abera Yemane Ab was arrested in similar circumstances and legal action was taken against him without any indication of charges.
We cannot accept this situation.
We seek to defend human rights.
For this reason, the Ethiopian Government should explain what these people are charged with, or it should release them.
