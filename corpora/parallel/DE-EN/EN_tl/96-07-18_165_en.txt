Madam President, as you know yourself, our group was in Banja Luka exactly a week ago today.
We saw there what is really going on in this so-called Serbian Republic.
I can only say that, on the basis of our conversations with the local representatives and spokespeople of Mr Karadzic, I felt as though time had rolled back fifty years.
Indeed, the way people talked and the arguments they used reminded me strongly of the most terrible Gauleiter of the Hitler period, quite apart from the Stalinists who were also represented there.
We really are talking about a gang of brigands, and the chief brigand, Karadzic, really has fomented infamy here.
One of the worst cases was reported to us by the Bishop of Banja Luka, that of a priest who had been held in detention for nearly a year, since 24 August last year, together with his parents.
The Serbian authorities maintain that they would have intervened on his behalf but that the local police chief will not authorize his release, although he has not been charged with anything - he has simply been thrown into jail.
When the Bishop asked for our authorities and representatives to intervene, promises were made to him, but nothing has happened.
Hence it is high time that we, the European Parliament, took clear action on this situation, which is in direct breach of the Dayton Agreement, and demand that our representative, Mr Bildt, who after all is obligated to us, finally do something to ensure that Father Matanovic and his parents are released, which is their right.
If we cannot achieve that, it would again be apparent how incapable we are of taking effective action.
That would be a grave danger to peace.
