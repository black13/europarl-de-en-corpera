Madam President, I heartily concur with what the previous speakers have said, particularly the remarks of Mrs Laurila, for whose report I also voted in the Foreign Affairs Committee.
I would like to add something, however.
It is somewhat rare today that such matters have to be dealt with in a topical and urgent debate.
It had been the long-standing custom of the European Parliament to draw up reports on the political situation in particular regions through its committees, especially the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy.
In those committees, we were able to examine and discuss situations in all their aspects.
Suddenly, that is becoming increasingly difficult and, in this case, quite impossible.
So we have to use any opportunity we can get to put out an opinion of the European Parliament.
What is the actual reason for this opposition of the Social Democratic Group?
They are otherwise always so keen on autonomy, self-determination, democracy and human rights.
Why are they giving way to pressure from a country, which has incidentally put severe pressure on the rapporteur because of this report on Taiwan?
Are they so eager to show deference to China?
I really do not know.
Why should the European Union not support a country which has great economic significance in the region, which is on the road to democracy, which in other words is also a factor of democracy, in a way which after all does not alter the political situation?
Why do we seek to prevent a nation from realizing the capabilities and possibilities it possesses in the great network of international organizations?
It is really incomprehensible, for we have had links with that country going back many years.
We should above all remember who is exerting pressure here.
Again and again, we find that human rights and concepts of democracy are at stake, and we should really not set a bad example here.
