Madam President, I have to say again that to argue in terms of the WTO, Commissioner, is not actually an answer.
I could understand the social principles of the ILO being quoted.
But the WTO is not exactly the personification of democracy.
So this answer did not convince me at all.
The European Union should pursue an independent policy; bringing the WTO into the discussion is really ridiculous.
