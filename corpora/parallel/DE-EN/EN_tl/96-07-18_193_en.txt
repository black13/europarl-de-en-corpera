Madam President, my colleague is quite right.
For a year and a half - with very few interruptions - Russian troops have been bombarding Chechen settlements.
Thousands of civilians have fled, without recognition and without rights.
Human rights violations in the filtration camps are hardly even mentioned.
And western governments look on, pat Yeltsin on the back and praise his democratic reform process!
I cannot help thinking of the Council statement after the elections.
What a democracy!
And what mendacity!
Instead of the expected peace talks, Yeltsin again deploys heavy artillery against the civilian population one day after the elections.
In so doing, he destroys the confidence of all the voters in his country.
There is not much hope left for a democratic development.
Yet the agreement we have concluded with Russia sets democratic development and respect for human rights as preconditions.
I remind the Commission that that was the basis for the interim agreement; you said that we could exert greater influence through the interim agreement.
But, as I see things, absolutely nothing is happening.
At this point, I would like to ask the Commission: will it propose to the Council that the interim agreement be suspended?
Will it ensure that a conciliation committee, as provided for under the interim agreement, is brought into operation?
Has the Commission formulated a basis for concrete steps to be taken against the Russian Government?
Or does the Commission accept these attacks on the civilian population in the northern Caucasus?
Will it continue to look on?
I would like a very concrete answer to these questions for, in this Parliament, it is our job to support democratic forces Russia, and they are growing ever weaker.
We hope that we can support the soldiers' mothers, the peace groups, because they are the hope for that country.
