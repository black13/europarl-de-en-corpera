Madam President, the Chechen drama furnishes yet another clear demonstration of what the words and promises of Russia, particularly the present Russian regime, are worth.
We should not forget what Yeltsin proclaimed in his June decree, namely that he would withdraw the troops.
General Lebed said up to election day that he was in favour of ending the Chechen war and after the election - bearing out what I said earlier - that he favoured a military solution.
In a word: we have again been completely misled in the matter of this Chechen war, at least those who took the declarations seriously.
I was not one of them, because I know a little history and hence am well aware that you cannot base anything on such words, and that advance benefits of any kind only bring about one result: they merely encourage certain personalities to continue their gangsterism.
Finally, Madam President, there is something else we must realize: Russia today, in the age of decolonization worldwide, is the last great colonial empire on earth.
The French were in West Africa when the first Russian crossed the Urals in order to conquer Asian territory.
And what is happening in Chechnya is only the start of decolonization in Russia.
Hence, in order to save our credibility, we must really stand up for the selfdetermination of nations - that applies to the Chechens too - and we must put serious pressure on Russia to keep the promises it has made.
If they break their word again, we must not reward those responsible by maintaining financial aid, which will only encourage them to carry on as before.
Chechnya is a historic challenge for us.
Whether we are up to it, only our future will tell.
