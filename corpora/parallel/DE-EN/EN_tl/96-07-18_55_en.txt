Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as I can see, we have twelve minutes left to debate this very important report.
We could then continue the debate this afternoon, and possibly vote this evening.
Another variant I have just heard mentioned would be not to have a debate, only a vote.
It is out of the question that we should only vote on such an important report without previously debating it.
Now I know that the secretariat has great problems with the agenda.
We lost half an hour of our time this morning because of a completely pointless debate, and that again encroaches on the quality of the work we should be doing here.
We really should spare ourselves the kind of rubbish we had to listen to this morning.
It is an impossible situation when we are put under such pressure of time to discuss a problem that has been under lengthy discussion between the groups in this House, a process extending back over a period of several months, including three committee meetings, and when this problem should now be driven through the House at such breakneck speed.
I therefore officially request, on behalf of our group, that the debate and vote be deferred to the September part-session in Brussels.
I know that will give rise to difficulties, but the groups must decide amongst themselves what priority is to be assigned to the human rights report.
Another topic may simply have to give way.
