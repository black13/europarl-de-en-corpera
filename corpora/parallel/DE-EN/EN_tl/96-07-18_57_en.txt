Mr President, I wish to support the request of the previous speaker from the Socialist Group because I think that the subject of human rights, especially human rights in the European Union, which is covered by Mrs Laura De Esteban Martin's report, is of great importance to this House, also that it has great relevance to our own credibility.
Having experienced a fair amount of agitation over this issue in the past, this House should not now fail to attribute the required degree of importance to such a report, even if only for the sake of form.
It would be completely unacceptable if Mrs De Esteban Martin were to start the debate in the quarter of an hour now remaining, followed quickly by a contribution from a PSE spokesman, and the debate were then to be suspended in order to be continued this evening just before the summer recess; we would end up voting on it tomorrow, perhaps with many fewer Members present.
I do not think that would do any justice at all to this subject: the world looks not only at how the European Parliament deals with human rights in Iran, Turkey and elsewhere, but also at how we handle what happens in our own Union.
For that reason, I request that this debate be adjourned to the Brussels part-session.
But I appeal to you, Mr President, when we meet in September, let us not debate this matter at midnight, but after Question Time with the Commission; in other words it should be given a prominent position on the agenda.
