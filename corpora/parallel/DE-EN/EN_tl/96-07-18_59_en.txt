Mr President, if I may take up your time once again, I am glad we have adjourned this report.
But I appeal to colleagues from all groups to exert their influence on the Bureau in order to ensure that the matter is not simply tacked on to the end of the agenda in Brussels, but that the report can be debated at a prominent stage in the proceedings.
I consider that to be very important.
Also, Mr President, I ask that this be recorded in the minutes and that you take the matter up with the Bureau.
