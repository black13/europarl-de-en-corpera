Madam President, our main concern through this report and through this vote was, once more, to make it clear to the Commission that we will not accept further cuts in spending on development.
We see from the supplementary and amending budget that the agreements we reached with the Commission are simply not being applied.
We have reinstated the budget lines which had been deleted - women and the Third World, environment and the Third World.
We had agreed with the Commission that further posts should be filled in DG VIII and that the money for these posts, on which we cannot take a decision, should be used by the Commission for DG VIII, so that NGO projects, which at present cannot be implemented because of lack of staff, can go ahead.
We have to note that these posts have not been created.
On the contrary, in the next financial year these very posts are to be transferred to DG I. I think that these arrangements must be queried once again in the supplementary and amending budget procedure.
They conflict with what Parliament has discussed with the Commission.
This whole process suggests that we are being drawn into something we prevented last year: the Commission is cutting back on funds for development policy in order to promote what I would call a militarized foreign policy.
Our group does not want that, the Committee on Development and Cooperation does not want that and I personally was opposed to it.
I have therefore cast my vote accordingly.
