Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my pleasure in knowing that at least we have now approved Amendment No 4 in Parliament, to the effect that the ecologically acceptable cultivation of fodder, which is essentially what is intended, is now possible on set-aside land.
I should like to explain, however, why our group did not refer the amendment back to committee after the Commission did not accept it.
We are of the opinion that Parliament has always tried to give farmers information about the set-aside rate in good time for sowing.
This time it has succeeded.
Therefore we do not want to cause a delay now, although we are of the opinion that it is necessary for this amendment, introduced by us, to be adopted.
I now have confidence in the Commissioner's word, that he will ask his colleagues to examine it.
When the next round of amendments is due, which will be soon, we shall propose our amendment again, and then, if you say that you will not accept it, it will be time for the gloves to come off.
We are confident that the Commission will accept this amendment.
Therefore we have let it go this time, quite apart from the fact that it is also doubtful whether we would have obtained a majority for our amendment.
