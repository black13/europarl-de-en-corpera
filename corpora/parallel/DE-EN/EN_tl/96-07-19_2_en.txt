Mr President, exactly the same thing has happened to me today as happened yesterday when it came to the minutes.
For the second time in succession I have not had a chance to speak.
I wanted to say something about yesterday's minutes.
Yesterday, Mr Blak said that we should put an end to the circus.
Even yesterday I wanted to object to the word "circus' .
The item "Approval of the Minutes' was on the agenda, and we had come to that item in the plenary session.
This is a parliamentary right, not a circus!
I wanted to reject this formally, and I would therefore ask that this should be done in future, whenever the approval of the minutes is on the agenda.
