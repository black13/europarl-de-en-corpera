Mr President, Mr Gillis, when it is a question of the farmers of Europe receiving support, then you have me on your side, even if, as in the present case, they are Irish sheep farmers.
However, I do not think that this type of support is the right way of going about it.
We shall therefore abstain from voting on the regulation.
What you are proposing is not forward-looking.
We have just been told that by our Finnish colleague.
When there are subsidies on one side, and when the market prices collapse, then that means that there is a chance for these sheep farmers to continue to exist, after a fashion, even when market prices are low, while other farmers, who do not receive support, then get into serious difficulties.
In addition, you have not proposed any system of staggering, such as the one that applies to less-favoured areas.
This means that if you pay a premium per sheep, then that premium will most probably not go to the farmer, because the dealers will include the premium in their calculations and will put even more pressure on prices, which again will result in difficulties for Finnish farmers and sheep farmers.
A further point concerns the assertion that the value of sheepmeat will be enhanced.
The value of sheepmeat will not be enhanced by EU premiums, by public money.
All that this can do is to make up for a loss.
The value of sheepmeat is enhanced by its having a value in the market, by Irish sheepmeat's having a reputation in Europe.
Consumers are prepared to pay for that.
We are going in the wrong direction if we think that we would be able to stabilize the market this way, by pumping public money into it.
This is the wrong direction, and it has nothing to do with quality.
Nevertheless, I do not begrudge the Irish sheep farmers the money that is now being paid to them by the EU.
