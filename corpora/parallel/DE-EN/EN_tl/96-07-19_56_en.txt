Mr President, I asked to speak before Mr Hallam asked.
I wanted to say something that you could certainly not object to.
I am delighted that the Friday meetings were not scrapped, because the best part about the plenary session is its Friday Presidency.
I just wanted to thank you for that, and to wish you a pleasant holiday.
