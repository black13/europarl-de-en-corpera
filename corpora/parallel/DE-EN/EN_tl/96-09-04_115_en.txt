Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we Members of Parliament welcome the diversification of the new programme planning in the three countries Greece, Spain and Portugal, especially the concentration of investment on important infrastructure measures, the more broadly-based assistance to services and the more broadly-based assistance to employment, we nevertheless call for urgent improvements in the implementation of the structural funds in these countries.
That applies to Greece.
As in the past there are obstacles to innovative projects in Greece because of its inefficient and insufficiently transparent administration.
Those responsible for small projects find the situation particularly difficult.
It is also urgently necessary for the Greek authorities to implement the provisions of the regulation, to include regional and local authorities in the planning and implementation of projects and to insert the projects, in particular the transport projects, into an integral, sustained development strategy in order to avoid any adverse effects on regional planning and the environment.
For Spain, the use of water is increasingly becoming a key development issue.
That is why the protection of this resource must be a major factor of project decisions.
In the case of Portugal, it is energy resources.
Overall, the statement made in the tenth chapter of the Delors white paper has proved true: that the EU will remain inefficient as long as it is geared to the exploitation of finite natural resources and disregards the potential of labour.
