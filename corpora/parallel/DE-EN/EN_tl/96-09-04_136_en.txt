Mr President, first I want to give warm thanks to Mr Langen for his clear and convincing report, which of course deserves our approval.
Today we are taking a major step forward towards the closer approximation of taxes in the European Union.
Just because we want competition between the different places and systems of the European Union, we need common rules of play which everyone observes The proposed rate - from a minimum of 15 % to a maximum of 25 % - fully reflect the needs of today.
The German Social Democrats have even objected to the possibility of an increase from 15 % to 16 % and they certainly consider it totally wrong to cease to apply the ceiling rates.
That is why I cannot understand, Mr Metten, why you are even questioning the 25 % rate today, which would of course mean that even higher rates than this one would be possible.
Without the restrictions and rules proposed by the Commission, there could not be any competition between the different systems in Europe and we would end up with a kind of catch as catch can.
We cannot and do not want that; quite the contrary, I am convinced that the European Union must in fact take further fiscal measures in the coming months and years in order to put an end to tax evasion.
Surely we cannot accept that large earners, for instance, should pay lower taxes simply because they have moved their place of residence from their home country to a neighbouring EU state.
If we want to put a check on tax evasion, then we need not less but more European cooperation in this area.
One particularly serious disadvantage of the capital gains tax is that nationals are treated worse than foreigners.
As soon as we treat nationals and foreigners the same in relation to capital gains tax throughout the European Union we will have overcome the main cause of tax evasion and taken a major step toward fiscal justice.
