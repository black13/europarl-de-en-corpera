Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Community model of what will continue to be national driving licences is finally being perfected.
After adopting the first supplementary provisions to the 1991 directive on driving licences, which relate to plasticized driving licences in credit card format, some weeks ago, we are now discussing a second set of supplementary provisions.
They concern the additional but no less necessary information that is to be included on driving licences regarding the conditions of use for drivers and vehicles.
This information is to be set out in a uniform, codified form.
That is a good idea, for if the driving licences issued by the various Member States continue to use different codes for the information given, practical problems will continue to arise between the various countries for drivers, firms, administrations and the police.
I therefore welcome the creation of standardized international codes and I also think it is sensible to split them, with the numbers up to 99 being harmonized Community codes and the numbers from 100 remaining national codes in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
This system of codes will definitely lead to greater freedom of movement for the individual, especially for the handicapped in the EU, and to greater road safety and legal certainty.
That is something our people will perceive directly, for it will benefit them directly.
For instance they will no longer be exposed to possible arbitrary police decisions.
The simplifications in the control, checking and administrative systems will also make the rules more transparent and citizen-friendly.
We should not ruin that again by establishing Community-wide procedures for the withdrawal of driving licences or the introduction of a European penalty points driving licence.
In my view only the country issuing the driving licence should continue to be responsible for doing this.
