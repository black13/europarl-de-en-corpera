Mr President, I would like to endorse what the Commissioner and the previous speaker said.
I always held Ken Stewart in particular esteem.
We agreed that human beings play a particularly important role in shipping and need to be protected, be they passengers or crew.
I think we will always remember Ken Stewart and it is most important to have people such as him among us, to remember them and, we hope, to find successors with the same greatness of mind.
Unfortunately we come now to the sad question of passenger ships.
I think the Commission has made good proposals.
I think it is a good idea to have uniform safety standards for passenger ships in domestic waters too, for our citizens find it inexplicable why there are different standards in a Community of fifteen states.
Commissioner, what we are not so happy about is the long transitional provisions, which extend up to the year 2010 in the case of some details.
I hope you and we in this House will agree to call on the Member States not to apply these transitional provisions in any part of the Union, for if we believe that minimum safety standards are necessary, then these must apply in every part of the Community, because people and tourists have the same right to safety when they use a passenger ship in every part of the Community.
Perhaps the Commissioner could say a few words on this.
Secondly, I want of course to thank the excellent rapporteur, Mr Per Stenmarck, for his report and ask the Commission to take on board a particular request he made and to defend it vis Ã  vis the Council; this special request, which the Socialists also support, reads as follows: ' such common standards should not impair the implementation of existing higher standards of safety in Member States' .
We all agree that no Member State should use this directive as a means of lowering existing higher safety standards and here too I would be grateful if the Commissioner gave his views.
