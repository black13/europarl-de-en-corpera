Mr President, it is wonderful to be noticed by you, thank you very much!
Commissioner, the current policy of the USA is, as you noted, destabilizing political and economic transatlantic relations generally, and this is all the more regrettable, as you pointed out, in view of the new hopes we had in the context of the transatlantic agenda.
I strongly regret that and I would emphasize that extra-territorial actions should be condemned in general.
Otherwise the credibility of international law and international organizations and institutions as a whole - here I need only mention the UN and of course the WTO - will be put at risk.
We cannot afford that.
It leads to international political and economic destabilization.
Commissioner, when will Parliament officially be consulted on a Community regulation?
I know you have put a proposal before the Council, and the question belongs with the Council.
When will the Council consult us?
Second question: are you considering taking the matter to The Hague?
