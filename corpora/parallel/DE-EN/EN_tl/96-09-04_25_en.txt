Mr President, Commissioner, the USA supposedly regards Cuba as a threat to its national security and therefore does not regard the WTO as competent.
Does the Commission agree that this kind of link-up exists and share the view of the US Government, and will the Commission call for a WTO panel procedure prior to the American elections?
For that is most important in this connection and interestingly enough the Commission did indeed submit a proposal four weeks ago which was designed to protect European companies from the Helms-Burton law.
But why only now?
Why did the Commission not do so four years ago at the time of the Toricelli law?
Surely there are interesting parallels!
What is the Commission's view of a country that first ratifies treaties and then tries to bypass them with the help of national legislation when it suddenly decides they no longer suit it?
How does the Commission view that?
Thank you again for calling me.
It always works when a beautiful woman on my right raises her hand.
