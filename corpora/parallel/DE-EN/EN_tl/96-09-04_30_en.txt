In your introductory statement you yourself pointed out that Helms-Burton is merely the tip of the iceberg, that the United States is also drafting legislation on a number of other states which, geographically at least, are closer to Europe.
However important it may be to keep the effects of the Helms-Burton legislation on the European economy or on Europe and the world in general within bounds, in my view it is just as important, not to say urgent, to ensure that the Americans - regardless of their concerns in this matter and the understanding we have for these concerns - do not start including other countries and other economic areas in their legislation too.
What is the Commission doing in this regard?
