Mr President, I still have a lot to learn.
But you must tell me how sixteen eyes looking out from different corners, some of them short and some them long-sighted, can always take the right decision!
Mr President, I also want to thank the Commission warmly for the practical position it adopted and for demonstrating its ability to act.
Since Parliament took a very detailed decision on Helms-Burton very early on, and also on Iran/Iraq, the content of which basically is still entirely consistent with the situation there, I believe it has fulfilled its obligation and that it will continue to do so.
I would be interested to know what legal differences you see between the D'Amato legislation and the Helms-Burton legislation because my impression is that there are differences of view on this within the Commission too, at least from what emerged in the Committee on External Economic Relations this week, with which I do not agree.
Both laws are contrary to international law and Mr Eizenstat referred to political reasons that cannot be recognized by the WTO.
What is your position on this?
