Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that the gap between poor and rich regions is continuing to widen and in view of the fact that the drastic cuts inspired by monetary union are destabilizing the entire system of economic and social cohesion, it is urgently necessary to make every effort to use the structural funds effectively!
The new structural funds regulation certain suggests means of giving impetus to sustained development in the disadvantaged regions.
But although that is one criterion of the regulation, the Commission did not examine, either in the programmes or in their implementation, whether the sustained development that the structural funds are to promote in these regions also takes account of the need to protect natural resources.
Other rules were not referred to either in the report, such as respect for the principle of equal opportunities.
For example, the Member States did not have to prove that they involved their environmental partners in the planning and implementing stages in good time.
Here the Commission must assume more responsibility: it must make checks and, in particular, it must intervene.
Parliament cannot accept the fact that the SMEs still have such a hard time obtaining the funding.
What is the use of wonderful strategies to assist SMEs at European level if, as in the case of Germany, the Member States make access more difficult for them by cutting the European resources for such assistance?
Why is the Commission allowing the rules of the new structural funds regulation to be so crassly disregarded?
What is it doing to stop this?
