Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday Mr Schiedermeier gave us an excellent example of a non-factional, expert piece of work, reaching, as we saw in yesterday's debate, from Portugal to Finland, and this is all the more remarkable if we bear in mind the fact that a number of Member States - Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has mentioned this, and of course I am thinking mainly of Germany here - have tried to block the Commission's initiative in this sphere in the name of subsidiarity.
I share the view of Mrs Schroedter, but I should just like to point out that progress on the subject of the social economy, which is closely related to the present subject, was made in this House during the earlier legislative period, by Aline Archambaud.
I should just like to make a few necessary comments on the subjects covered by this report.
Firstly, we must take care to ensure that local employment initiatives do not fall into the trap of duplicating other work, on normal working conditions, access to the employment market, qualifications etc.
Secondly, we must incorporate them into more far-reaching objectives which must be pursued at the same time, such as: halving unemployment levels by the year 2000, decentralization and local and regional development of the economy, culture and society, as our Portuguese colleagues have pointed out, as well as economic and social reform, and feminization, and that means the balanced redistribution of paid and unpaid work, and not the creation of a new servant class of housemaids and car-park attendants.
Seen as a whole, this is an important contribution towards replacing the status of women employees with that of female working citizens, and in quantitative terms it is a significant contribution.
In the Federal Republic of Germany alone - and you can work this out - with about eight million people affected by unemployment, about one million new jobs will have to be created in this sector, meaningful, future-oriented jobs, which really will enrich society.
In this sense, the implementation of the Commission's initiative is an urgent demand, which we must make together.
