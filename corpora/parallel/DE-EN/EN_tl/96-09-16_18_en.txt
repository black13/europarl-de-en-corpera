Mr President, it is not unusual for Question Time to be cancelled, unfortunately.
Since it was moved from its evening slot, it has been postponed or cut short on a number of occasions and this is now the second time it has been cancelled, if I am not mistaken.
I am afraid that it will carry on like this, because no one bothers to turn up for it now that it is no longer held in the evening, which is why I think it should be returned to its old place.
The only disadvantage with this is that it means the Council has to work another hour and a half after dinner, but that should not be too much to ask.
