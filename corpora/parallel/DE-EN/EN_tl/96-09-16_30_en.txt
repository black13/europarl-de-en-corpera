Mr President, we must not allow the human rights report to be used as a cudgel in our internal political wranglings, and I am afraid that your speech, Mr Schulz, showed distinct signs of doing that.
How can you talk about human rights in a way which is bound to earn you a reprimand from the President?
We want to see Mr Le Pen and his colleagues out of Parliament just as much as you do, but this is a matter for the voters, not for you as an individual!
Mrs De Esteban Martín has done an excellent job on her report, and made an outstanding speech on which I warmly congratulate her.
This Parliament has not had much fortune up to now - to put it mildly - with its human rights reports, which have either failed to be adopted or been highly controversial, for the most part because they were not so much a reflection of the human rights situation in Europe as of the internal political disagreement on the concept of human rights.
As long as this remains the case and we are unable to find a common definition of human rights, we cannot claim to speak about them with any credibility or legitimacy.
We cannot allow the concept of human rights to be expanded indefinitely.
The previous report called for it to include things like the right to housing, work, a healthy environment and life-long education, which are all entirely legitimate political demands, but as Mrs De Esteban Martín rightly pointed out, they are not human rights, they are a political manifesto.
Manifestos are there to be argued about: human rights should not be.
That is why we need to restrict ourselves to the concept of human rights and leave manifesto demands alone.
The simple key to the problem lies in the Convention on Human Rights, which everyone has signed, and the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg.
The issues which can be brought before the Court are human rights matters, and everything else should be excluded.
