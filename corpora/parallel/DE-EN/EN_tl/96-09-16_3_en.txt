Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is to meet from 23 to 27 September and will be looking at the draft Bioethics Convention, among other things.
Parliament has already held lengthy and detailed discussions on this extremely important issue, but we have unfortunately not yet delivered an opinion on the subject, having failed to adopt the Pelttari report at the July partsession.
We feel it is absolutely essential for the European Parliament to state its position on this issue, which has such far-reaching implications for the future of mankind.
We are therefore proposing that our group's oral question should be put on the agenda for this week, and I also hope that the Christian Democrats will propose the same for the PPE Group's question.
The European Parliament must say something, otherwise the Council of Europe will simply decide what it wants and we shall be left without any official position whatsoever, which would be completely irresponsible of us.
We have requested, pursuant to Rule 96 of the Rules of Procedure, that the vote on this motion today should be taken by roll call, in accordance with Rule 119.
It is up to you to decide when the debate should be held.
It was not our intention for us to start the discussion today; we simply wanted to ensure that the issue is debated and voted on at some point during this week.
