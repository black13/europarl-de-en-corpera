Although the protection of human rights and basic freedoms is one of the Union's main responsibilities, we always seem to make very heavy weather of it, as we can see from today's debate and our failure to adopt Mr Newman's report last year.
We must be very careful not to close our eyes to the human rights violations that are happening right here in the Union.
Every month, we adopt a large number of resolutions, and we often have debates on human rights violations outside the Union, yet the issue of human rights within the Union comes up only once a year.
I would like to take three examples from Mrs De Esteban Mart√≠n's report to illustrate what I think is important.
The first is the right to education.
We all agree that every child should be entitled to an education, so that it can learn how to live in society.
But street children and the children of asylum-seekers are not included here, because they are not automatically entitled to attend school.
Secondly, there is the treatment of asylum-seekers, which previous speakers have already mentioned.
Asylumseekers are people who come to us to ask for refuge.
If we then send them to so-called safe third countries, we cannot be sure that they will not be passed on elsewhere and possibly end up in a country where human rights are not respected.
As I see it, these people should not be allowed to be sent to such countries, or held in prison with common criminals before being sent on elsewhere.
Asking for asylum is not a crime, and should not be treated as such.
Finally, I have made the point on a number of occasions that the right to refuse military service is still not recognized in all Member States.
In my opinion, refusing military service on conscientious grounds has to be accepted and must not be regarded as a crime.
