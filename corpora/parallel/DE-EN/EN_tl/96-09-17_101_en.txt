Mr President, the fact that we need to address ourselves to the subject of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes is in itself extremely regrettable.
Campaigning for equal opportunities means nothing other than striving for men and women to be recognized as equals.
All the Member States of the European Union put fine words on paper.
In this report, the Commission too has expressed admirable intentions in the form of fine words.
But these will do little in practice to remedy the lack of equal opportunities; that is why the Commission and the Council must listen to the fundamental demands of the Committee on Women's Rights.
To overlook the particular contribution of women to child-rearing and their self-sacrificing attention to the social needs of dependants, whilst at the same time participating in the world of work, would be to misunderstand the concept of equal opportunities.
For many reasons, so-called atypical contracts of employment are becoming the only way for an increasing number of women to earn a living.
These women are especially dependent on equal treatment in social security schemes.
The same applies to part-time workers, as we have just heard.
I very much hope that, by adopting this report, we shall move one step closer to real and tangible equality of opportunities.
