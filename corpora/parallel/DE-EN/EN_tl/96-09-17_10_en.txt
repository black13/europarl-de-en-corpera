Madam President, you have followed the rapporteur's proposal and put the first item to the vote.
That request for urgency was approved.
According to his recommendation, you should now also put the other two items to the vote.
We wish to reject urgency for these, so that it is made clear to the Commission that we do not see this link between beef and veal, the support system, and the general pursuit of agricultural reform.
