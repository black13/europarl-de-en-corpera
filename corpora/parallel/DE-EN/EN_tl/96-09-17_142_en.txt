Ladies and gentlemen, I shall not take up the comments made by the previous speaker, but I am very surprised by the scepticism within the ranks of the PPE Group.
After all, according to the Delors White Paper, reductions in working hours in the northern Member States led to the creation of 8 % more jobs, even accounting in the Netherlands for half of the 30 % rise in employment.
In Germany too, between 1983 and 1992 a third of newly-created jobs were attributable to reduced working time.
We must nevertheless be realistic about one thing: growth alone will have only a minimal impact on employment.
The Prognos Institute in Basle has predicted, for example, that Germany will have no more jobs in the year 2010 than in 1992, primarily as a result of gains in productivity.
Although we shall see increased employment in the service and information sectors, there will be a decrease in the production sector and further job losses in agriculture.
Of course, as politicians we cannot just sit back and accept this.
Paid work not only provides economic security but is the principal route to individual self-fulfilment.
That is why I am so impressed by the blueprint outlined here by Mr Rocard - and it is a package of ideas, not just a reduction in working hours.
This report will be a major stimulus for debate both in the national parliaments and at European level.
For many years, employers were opposed to reduced working hours and in favour only of flexibility, which meant constant availability around the clock, variable working hours and temporary work.
All this has now changed.
Volkswagen in Germany is just one example; our CDU colleague is mistaken in thinking that there are no others.
Even SMEs have taken to experimenting with modern, innovative schemes regarding working time.
Mr Rocard's proposals represent a significant component of a European policy on employment.
