The Commission welcomed this provision.
We also supported Parliament in having such a provision included in the Maastricht Treaty.
Of course we take Parliament's right of initiative seriously, first and foremost because the Commission is the body at which it is directed.
It would indeed be quite uncooperative on the part of the Commission if we were to impede the House in exercising such a right, and that is why I gave you the information which I did.
Understandably, the right of initiative is sometimes used in relation to very complex and difficult issues - if they were not so complex they might already have been addressed.
For that reason, the process is sometimes quite lengthy, but there is no question about the importance that we attach to Parliament's right of initiative: we know how valuable it is.
