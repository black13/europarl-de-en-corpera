I should like to begin by dealing with the general point which you have raised again.
Every year, we discuss with Parliament the legislative programme that we intend to set ourselves for the year, and consider both the Commission's proposals and the wishes of the House.
In the context of those discussions, a number of initiatives are taken up which are handled much less formally than they really ought to be.
To take an example from the discussion in recent weeks: the House regards pornography on the Internet as a pressing problem - as indeed it is - and the Commission has already said that it takes the same view and intends to consider appropriate measures to restrict the scope for pornography, if not actually prevent it.
At the moment, although it falls within my remit, I cannot tell you how far we have progressed with the medical card.
It is one of our pilot projects.
We have a pilot project looking at uses of information technology in health care, and we are working on that.
I would ask you to bear with me, but at the moment I really cannot tell you exactly when the groundwork for this card will be completed.
The problem is not just a technical one, but concerns above all the question of how to keep protected personal data confidential.
I am sure you will agree that if such cards are to list not only an individual's medical history, but also their life history and personal circumstances, care will have to be taken that these details do not find their way into unauthorized hands.
This is one of the problems, and while there are certainly ways to resolve it technically, that will take time.
We will be glad to write to you and give you an update on the situation.
