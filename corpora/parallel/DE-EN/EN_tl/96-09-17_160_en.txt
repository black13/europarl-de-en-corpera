Yes, you may well be right.
As far as the accident in Spain is concerned, we do not have enough information as to whether it was caused by a lack of rules or by failure to observe existing rules and carry out checks.
Unfortunately, the fact is that rules alone are no guarantee of success: only by monitoring how they are observed and implementing them can we ensure, as far as possible, that disasters like this are prevented.
I can only support what you said concerning the urgency of the matter.
Unfortunately, it is often a problem in politics that attempts at regulation are met with reluctance until an incident occurs.
In your own country in particular, there is little support for attempts at regulation before there has been an incident.
Something always has to happen first, and then everyone comes and says that the situation is particularly urgent.
I am thinking, for example, of seat belts in buses.
If I had introduced rules on safety in buses at the time when I was responsible for the internal market, there is no doubt that I would have been heavily criticized in quite a few Member States, including your own.
Then, as soon as something happens, everyone asks why the Commission did not introduce these rules long ago.
So this is also something that we have to bear in mind, but on the point at issue there is absolutely no dispute between us.
We are treating this as an urgent matter.
