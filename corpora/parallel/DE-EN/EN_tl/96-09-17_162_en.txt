In my view, such rules can already be introduced under existing legislation.
We do have a clear competence for the internal market, and services are provided in the internal market.
If services are provided badly and damage occurs as a result, that situation should be dealt with by the Union under the legal provisions which already exist.
I am thinking, for example, of our regulation on liability in the case of defective products.
We have our own regulation concerning liability if a producer manufactures a defective product, and indeed under the terms of that regulation, any producer who sells a defective product is held liable.
That rule was introduced in the context of our general competence in the internal market.
There is no reason why it should not also apply to services.
That is not to say that I am against including tourism in the list of Union competences, but it is not necessary to do so in order to deal with the cases in question.
We can already introduce legislation on these matters now.
