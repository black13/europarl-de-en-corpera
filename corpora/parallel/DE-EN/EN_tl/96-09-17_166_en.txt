Protocols have to be particularly secret when there is nothing in them, because it is a way of enhancing their importance.
That should come as no surprise to you.
But in this case, there actually is some substance there.
It is wrong to see this as a meaningless declaration.
In fact, it indicates that other forms of aid continue to be possible outside the OECD agreement: aid for research and development, for example, and regional aid.
For instance, if we consider that it makes sense to establish a shipyard as part of a regional programme, then of course that will still be possible.
The OECD agreement does not rule out that type of aid.
However, all cases of this kind of aid will have to be notified if the aid is granted by a national or regional government.
The Commission will consider each case and publish its conclusions in the Official Journal.
And this may result in one of our partners deciding, in such a case, that the decision is at odds with the OECD agreement.
We shall then discuss the case with the partner in question.
This is essentially obvious - but it is not meaningless.
Since you have now made the matter public, we can discuss it publicly.
It may be, however, that you have made a mistake in making it public - that is also a possibility.
