I suspect that you may be confusing something here.
The declaration that was issued by the Commission does not appear in the Official Journal.
What would be recorded in the Official Journal would be if a country - Denmark for example - granted subsidies to its shipyards.
I know that this has never happened in Denmark and never will do.
But if it were to happen, we should of course have to look into it.
We would then publish the outcome of our investigations in the Official Journal.
That is the procedure.
