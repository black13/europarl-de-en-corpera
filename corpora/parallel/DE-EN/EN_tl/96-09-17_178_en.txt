Yes, Mr Harrison, I am sure you know that we have already taken a very important step - a step at international level, for the benefit of American and Japanese companies too - by extending the duration of patent protection when the term of a patent is reduced by a long period of trials.
Let us take a practical example: someone has developed a drug, and naturally has to have it approved.
Obtaining approval necessitates a whole series of tests, which are very time-consuming, and it may turn out that half the term of the patent, or more, has elapsed by the time the drug goes on the market.
We have made a rule, and implemented it internationally, to the effect that the trial period is added on to the term of the patent, so that the overall period of protection is the exact term of the patent from the day when the drug is placed on the market.
This is a very important new measure which has considerably improved the position of the research industry.
To that extent, we have already found an adequate solution.
If firms are still thinking of moving to countries outside the Union, it is much more likely to be because of the possibilities which have now opened up for many of them, particularly small firms, in the field of biotechnology.
I do not need to labour this point: hopefully my years of hard-fought struggle with you - not you personally, but with Parliament - in an effort to produce sensible rules on this question too will soon bear fruit, because here - and I would hark back to the debate on Mr Rocard's report - we really do have an industry that is creating new jobs and is competitive.
We are hounding that industry out of the Union, and obviously that makes no sense.
There will be no need for us to reduce working hours, because if we have no jobs, reducing working time is not going to help us.
The important thing is that we should have jobs in the first place.
That is why we need a clear set of rules.
