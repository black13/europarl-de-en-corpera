We know that this is a problem, and that is why the new department which I referred to earlier has become actively involved in the discussions on the problems of certification.
Naturally, we are in contact with the relevant groups in the industry, but we have also involved other interest groups in the debate.
Moreover, we organized the first, and so far the only meeting of all these groups at EU level - the discussion forum on the ECOcertification of forests and forest products.
So we have been active in this area.
The Commission is currently considering a discussion paper which contains various options for resolving the problem of certification.
We also hope that we shall be able to play an active part in the preparations for the intergovernmental panel on forests, particularly as regards the problems of trade and the environment, and I hope we shall achieve a sensible solution in that context.
