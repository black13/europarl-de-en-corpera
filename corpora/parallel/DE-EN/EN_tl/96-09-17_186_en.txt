I can give you the exact timetable again, as we see it.
By 1 January 1998, the date of deregulation, we aim to have achieved six objectives: firstly, creating the option of carrier choice; secondly, number portability for local lines; thirdly, promoting national harmonization, in other words we are seeking to ensure the convergence of national numbering plans; fourthly, the creation of a European telephony numbering space and common access; fifth, establishing a common framework for number regulation and management; this will then ensure that divergent national rules are not established.
The next step will be carrier pre-selection by 1 January 2000.
Naturally, this will be much simpler for the user.
We envisage the extension of number portability for users of mobile and personal communication networks as well as for users of generic services and then from the year 2000 the implementation of a long-term numbering plan involving the creation of the European country code with the administration and management of the code transferred to the European level.
We hope that we shall succeed.
I know that we have the support of the House.
Sometimes the Member States tend to drag their feet, but that, at any rate, is our timetable.
