Of course, if someone is careless with foods of this kind - if they are left open for a long time and standing around unrefrigerated, for example - that is the sort of carelessness which is virtually beyond the reach of legislation.
What might perhaps be considered - and I myself do not know whether this already happens - would be for infant formula to be required to carry a warning, stating that it must be handled carefully, must not be left standing around open, and so on.
We should be glad to check whether there is already such a provision in the Member States, or in our own regulations and directives.
If there is not, then introducing it is probably the only step that we can take.
Legislation is, of course, powerless to prevent people from handling these foods carelessly, in spite of all the instructions.
