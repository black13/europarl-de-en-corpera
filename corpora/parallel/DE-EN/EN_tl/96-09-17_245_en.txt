Madam President, the rapporteur has presented a report whose starting-point is a very optimistic one.
The problem, Mr Rocard, is that no public or local authority in the European Union can create lasting jobs; only businesses can do that.
And as for the claim that a reduction in working hours creates more jobs, small and medium-sized enterprises, when rationalizing their operations, have proved unable to do so, and large firms are shifting some of their production to third countries.
That does not help us either.
What is not addressed by either the report or today's debate, in my opinion, is the question of what to do about non-wage labour costs in Europe, which are a major element in the cost of labour.
As long as we have huge discrepancies in Europe - from Iceland, with 31.2 % of net pay to Austria with 102.4 %, and an EU average of 78 % - the question of job creation in some European regions will always remain problematic.
I think another aspect must be highlighted too: massive subsidies are needed for SMEs.
There are at least 18 million people out of work now.
If we encourage the establishment of a few hundred thousand or a few million SMEs, we shall make a major contribution to tackling the scourge of mass unemployment.
