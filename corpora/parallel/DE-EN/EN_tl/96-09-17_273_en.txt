Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species was concluded in 1973 and will soon be 25 years old.
A great many of the species that it was intended to protect have not survived that long.
They have been hunted; they have been collected illegally and then transported in conditions where they suffocated, died of thirst or withered away - prestige objects which never made it to their destination.
In reality, the extinction and disappearance of species and the fact that we - let alone our descendants - will never see their return has robbed us all of mankind's common heritage.
We currently make use of only a tiny number of plant species.
We have totally failed to recognize the opportunities that are destroyed when plants become extinct.
The loss of the animals, too, upsets the balance of nature.
A regulation is therefore urgently needed.
I should like to thank the rapporteur warmly for her commitment to bringing that regulation into existence.
I also hope that the Declaration on the Protection of Animals, which is already mentioned in the Final Act of the EU Treaty, will be extended at the present Intergovernmental Conference, in line with Parliament's wishes, so that the protection of animals is properly included in the Treaty.
Much as I value the work that the rapporteur has done, there is one point on which I do not share her opinion.
I believe that documents should accompany the movement not only of plants and animals listed in Annex A, but also of those in Annex B.
We wish to see the Annex A list kept as short as possible, not extended to include other species because we failed to pay enough attention to them.
Given the emphasis which is placed on dismantling bureaucracy, I think that the option of a single accompanying document within the Union is feasible and should be considered.
