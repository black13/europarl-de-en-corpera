Madam President, both the Green Paper from the Commission and the report by Mr Barzanti adopt a stance of critical openness towards the challenge of new information technology.
This is something different from the line of 'we must join in' , as has been pointed out here this morning.
It is a position for which the House owes thanks to both parties, and one which it should support.
One thing is particularly important to me in this context, namely to protect the individual freedom of artists and their works against the interests and technological pressures of marketing.
Certainly, as Mr Barzanti said, what we must do here is to stress and not abandon the achievements of traditional copyright in the Berne Convention.
However, I wonder whether the nineteenth-century copyright geared to the originality of the author and the copyright law based on intellectual property are sufficient to meet the new technical challenges.
Today, in my view, the point is more the individual freedom of the author to assert his rights, together with freedom of public access.
Art cannot and should not become information.
Rather, it should facilitate information and freedom of information.
Only when it is free to do this can we ensure that the information society does not become one of deformation.
