Madam President, I should like to thank Mrs De Esteban Mart√≠n, who unfortunately is no longer present.
In developing her initial position, she did a remarkable amount to enable many points, not least those raised by our group, to be discussed in connection with this report on human rights.
I am sorry that she has not been supported by her own group today to the extent that she deserved, but we shall have to bear that in mind.
With the adoption of this report today, we have taken a major step forward, since the European Parliament now once again has a basis for its work which entitles it to talk about human rights violations outside the European Union as well, since those who fail to acknowledge what is going on at home do not have the right to criticize what is happening outside.
As for the statements by Mr Le Gallou and Mr Blot, I would only say that they have the right to talk such nonsense as they do, since talking rubbish is a human right as well, and this is after all the human rights debate that we are holding here.
To that extent, their otherwise somewhat disturbed utterances are acceptable today!
