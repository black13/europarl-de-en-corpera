Mr President, child abuse and violence against minors is, unfortunately, not a new phenomenon.
Unfortunately children are abused, abducted or subjected to other violent crimes every day in our Member States too.
The fact that we are holding a debate on this today follows on from the events of last week but also from the Stockholm conference.
This has given the conference more weight.
All the participants agreed that Stockholm would not have gained so much publicity if the terrible events in Belgium had not come to light shortly beforehand.
Many people have realised that sex tourism and sexual abuse of children is not just something that happens in holiday destinations several hours away by plane but that it has come very close and that it also concerns every one of us here to some extent, for here too children are abused every day.
One positive aspect is that the Stockholm conference and its action programme will not be forgotten as quickly as conferences. often are.
Several Members of this Parliament will also continue working assiduously ensure that the action plan is implemented.
For this we not only need to make money available but also to continue working on measures to prevent, combat, rehabilitate and inform.
I welcome the fact that both the Commission and the Council intend to give real consideration to this question on 26 and 27 September at the informal meeting of ministers of justice and of the interior.
But above all, we must insist that the 1989 UN Convention on the rights of children is ratified, implemented and respected immediately, in my country Germany too, for about 30 % of our population is under-age.
That is why it is hard to understand why this population group does not have its place in the Treaty as a separate group.
I hope this will be borne in mind at the conference on the revision of the Treaty.
