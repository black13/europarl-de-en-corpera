I believe the question of the delegation of legislative powers is indeed a serious one.
I regard the question of the access of all groups concerned as an important one.
I also think that consumer and environmental groups should be involved and I think it would be a mistake to restrict the inclusion of environmental policy in every policy area to standardization.
It is probably right to include civil aviation, but it will not be possible to control industrial dominance by this means alone.
Mr President, I want to end with a remark that is inescapable at this stage in the debate: ' would the last person to leave please turn out the light' .
Thank you.
