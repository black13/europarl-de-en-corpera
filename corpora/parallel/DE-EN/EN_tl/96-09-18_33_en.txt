Gentlemen of the Council and Commission, you have constructed a fortress of words here today against Parliament's criticisms but above all a fortress of words against the fears and concerns of the people.
President Santer presumed to claim that the convergence criteria of monetary union do not conflict with the requirement of full employment.
He did this in face of every scientific finding and in face of the opinions of countless experts in Europe.
The reality is that this project of monetary union produces unemployment, has strangled growth and is being misused for making cuts in social services.
Gentlemen, do stop confusing your policy with Europe and stigmatizing any criticism of your policy as anti-European.
Destroy the fortress of words and stop closing your minds to the knowledge that the fears, the concerns and the criticisms of millions and millions of people are right and your policy is not right.
