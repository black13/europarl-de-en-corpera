Mr President, after what we have just heard from Indonesia, we can establish the following: this is not a democratic state and it is not a state in which human rights are protected.
On 27 July the headquarters of the democratic Indonesian party, the PDI, was stormed by military and para-military troops: 5 people dead, 24 disappeared and 149 injured are the minimum figures to be condemned.
We are outraged that peaceful demonstrators from the democracy movement were pursued in the days that followed.
According to our figures, at least 100 individuals were arbitrarily arrested and are now facing prosecution under the anti-subversion law.
There is no freedom of opinion or of the press; on the contrary, journalists are being prosecuted too.
Indonesia did not subscribe to the international pact on civil and political rights.
There is no agreement on the prevention of torture, which is of extreme concern to us.
That is why we call for three things: first, the release of the people under arrest; secondly, what we have always called for in relation to East Timor and Irian Jaya, an end to all military aid from Europe; and thirdly, the inclusion of human rights in the trade agreements with ASEAN.
The EU has concluded trade agreements without addressing the human rights question.
The Commission must alter that.
Human rights must be protected here.
It is our obligation to do so.
