Madam President, as a German of my generation I have learnt a lesson from history.
It must never happen again that the possession or non-possession of papers becomes a question of survival, that papers become more important than people.
This must never happen in any place where we have political influence.
I do not want to pillory or accuse the French state now.
This is far more a common problem, which all our bureaucracies tend towards because of course bureaucracies always prefer dealing with papers than with people and as a result trample elementary human rights underfoot.
In a situation where we are all immigration countries in our capacity as a European Community, one thing must be clear, namely that the uncertain legal situations that inevitably occur at regular intervals must be clarified by legalization, that everyone who resides here must be guaranteed the same human rights regardless of their colour or passport.
It must be made clear that we are pursuing a policy of human rights and civil rights, with the simple objective of returning to the beginning of the French Revolution, when the question of citizenship, of citoyennet√© , was simply the question: who is living and working in this territory?
Unfortunately that has almost become a utopian objective today, but we will achieve it.
