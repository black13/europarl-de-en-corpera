This urgency relates to a serious case of the export of toxic waste.
It concerns the fact that the British multinational Thor Chemicals, which has exported hundreds of tonnes of toxic mercury waste from the European Union, in particular from the United Kingdom, from Spain and from Italy, to its plant in Cato Ridge, South Africa.
It was first assumed that the waste would be recycled, would be reprocessed in an environmentally compatible manner.
Instead of being recycled it was simply stored.
The result of the storage of toxic mercury waste has been sludge ponds, one death and twenty workers who will suffer for the rest of their lives from the consequences of the health damage that occurred at work.
The drinking water is contaminated, the readings are more than a thousand times higher than the WHO drinking water standards.
The Attorney-General of Natal charged three top management officials with homicide in 1993.
Thor pleaded guilty.
Mandela has now set up a commission of inquiry.
We say to that undertaking and to the European Union: those who produce waste must also dispose of it, which means that 470 t must be repatriated to the United Kingdom, 57 t to Italy and 10 t to Spain.
In particular, we call on South Africa to sign Article 39 of the Lom√© Convention.
Let me also refer you specifically to paragraph 4 of our joint resolution.
