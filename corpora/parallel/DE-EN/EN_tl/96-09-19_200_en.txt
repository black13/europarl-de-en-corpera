Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the EPP Group let me warmly congratulate the rapporteur on his report on East-West cooperation in energy and nuclear security.
It really is a report that stands out in comparison to other matters we discuss here.
It is concrete, concrete enough for the tasks that have to be tackled.
It is balanced, i.e., it evaluates things correctly, and it is also comprehensive enough to address all the difficult aspects in concise form.
We in the EPP have therefore tabled no amendments.
We also support the amendments subsequently tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
We also support Amendment No 9 by the Greens, although unfortunately we cannot endorse the others.
And we support the amendment by the Liberals.
But I would like to make a couple of statements of principle on the subject.
First, every ECU that helps to make nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe safer is money well spent and we should not desist from our efforts here.
Secondly, we must also respect the fact - referred to by other speakers too - that every country must decide for itself which energy sources to use.
We Europeans must not try to impose our theories as though bestowing a kind of public favour.
Thirdly, we must also ensure that if a country opts for nuclear energy, the necessary safety standards are assured.
Let me refer you here to the discussion we held in relation to the Mochovce nuclear power station.
It does not help much if we set the standards so high that in the end Russian technology is applied instead of European safety standards.
There we all do ourselves a disservice and perhaps that has also been of great help in clarifying certain aspects.
The Adam report indicates some viable paths to pursue and we should do our utmost to follow them - here I can only encourage the Commission to do so - so that we can live up to our responsibility as Europeans for the entire continent.
