Madam President, I am sorry to prolong the sitting but we cannot let the Commission go like this.
Those were all things that are already going on.
We are talking about a document on strategies.
It is a question of strategies and in this respect I must start by pointing out that the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia has already been signed and that it is for the Council to ensure that it is now ratified in the individual Member States.
Secondly, I would like to know whether the Commission has responded to Parliament's proposals, namely in relation to channelling the aid in such a way as to overcome the difficulties between PHARE and INTERREG and between TACIS and INTERREG, and setting up model projects for cross-border cooperation, and whether this will get going in the near future.
Thirdly, I would like to know whether there will now be a follow-up document that really does tackle all the difficulties that are still unresolved.
It is not enough to pat oneself on the back and tell of all the things one has already done!
