Madam President, let me extend warm thanks on behalf of our Committee on Budgetary Control and also in my own name and, I think, also in the name of this House, for no amendments have been tabled to the reports.
That means we are taking the same line, Mrs Gradin!
Your words of cheer and your plain statements also encourage us to continue working together here.
We will succeed, of that I am convinced.
