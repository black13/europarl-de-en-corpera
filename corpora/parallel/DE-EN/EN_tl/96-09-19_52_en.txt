We were not in favour of this motion because what its author said is simply not true.
A great many of us were present during the vote yesterday and no oral amendments were discussed.
We have only just heard about it for the first time, which is why I do not think it is possible to allow this motion.
(The tabling of the oral amendment was rejected)
