Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the political situation in Burundi was once again totally reversed in the past two months.
The coup d'Ã©tat on 25 July showed that the Burundian army will do its utmost to retain absolute power, even if that means ruin for the country.
My group believes that we should strongly condemn this coup.
In that way we will demonstrate our support for the Burundian people in their endeavour to build up democracy and law and order in a country devastated by civil war.
Mr President, a coup must never be worth carrying out.
That is why we should also express our support for the seven African states that are trying to prevent this injustice from becoming internationalized.
The only effective hope for Burundi, however, is that all the parties to the dispute should agree unconditionally to come to the negotiating table.
In that respect, we particularly acknowledge the efforts made by the Tanzanian president to achieve this.
