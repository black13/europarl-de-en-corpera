Madam President, I have a comment on the Minutes, and on yesterday's vote to which Mr Martinez referred.
At the end of that vote, there was a very great deal of uncertainty as to what had actually been adopted.
I should like to take this opportunity to make it clear that we yesterday rejected, by a single vote, a motion calling for the introduction of a tax on wine, so that that part of Mr Martinez's remarks is certainly incorrect.
