Madam President, it was in order to avoid what is happening here now that I asked you to ask the interpreters whether they would stay until 1.30 p.m. so that we can debate Mr Kouchner's report, Mr Hughes's question and the bioethics question.
We have heard from the Commission that the Palestine question only involves a vote, and we can do that.
Mr Hughes's question, too, only involves a vote, if we adopt the same procedure there as we have with many other reports today.
Then we shall have time to debate until 1.30 p.m. so I ask you, Madam President, are the interpreters now staying until 1.30 p.m., yes or no?
If so, then please let us vote on the Kouchner report and the Hughes question and then talk about bioethics.
It's as simple as that!
