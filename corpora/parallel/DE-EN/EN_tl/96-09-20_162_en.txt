Mr Hughes has asked me to make this request.
I think that, for reasons of time, it would be sensible to adopt a procedure whereby we proceed immediately to the vote.
Now, this report is about extending the European Working Hours Directive to maritime transport, and an international conference of the International Labour Organization is taking place here in October and hopes to see a regulation to that effect on working hours in maritime transport.
That is the content of our motion for a resolution, and I would ask you to vote on it now.
