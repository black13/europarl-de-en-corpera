Madam President, I don't like doing this.
I asked you to bring voting time to an end, so that we could finish up in a dignified manner.
I ask you again to do that, and to stop giving Mr Dell'Alba the opportunity to make more points of order in order to delay the debate which he himself called for, as he has been doing in this House for the last two hours.
Also, Mr Cot's behaviour is not undemocratic but legitimate.
I just wanted to make that point to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
But please, Madam President, conclude the voting now.
Because if you give Mr Dell'Alba the floor again after every single vote, we shall still be here next Wednesday.
