Madam President, I would like to start with a point of order, and I would ask you not to count the time against me.
After all, you did say to me earlier that I would have an opportunity to put a point of order now, and I would like to ask why it is, when we put questions to the Commissioner, that the larger groups have a prior claim to the floor.
I enjoy listening to Mrs Green, I even enjoy listening to her twice, and I enjoy listening to Mr Martens too - all their questions were very sensible - but are the other groups not to be allowed to ask any questions?
Why do you pass over the other groups and deal only with the large ones?
This is not an acceptable approach according to the Rules of Procedure!
So, please, when I ask for the floor to make a point of order, do treat that as a priority - our Rules of Procedure say that you must accede to such requests.
I believe this procedure is wrong.
I don't known how you can justify it.
Now you can start the clock, because I am going to talk about the matter in hand.
