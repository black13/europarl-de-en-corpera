Madam President, our group voted against the request, because we did not think the argument in favour of it made sense.
The increases in expenditure which have just been added on here are not right.
Intervention is reduced as a result.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, we reserve the right to ask the Commission, after the vote, whether it is accepting Parliament's amendments.
If Parliament's amendments are not, in essence, being accepted, we shall call for referral back to committee, so that we can negotiate with the Commission; because this is the more important point as far as we are concerned.
