Madam President, what Pauline Green has suggested in her capacity as President of the PSE Group also reflects the view of the PPE Group.
This is a very serious matter, and we must take note of it.
What is at issue here is not just health but the community of law that is the European Union - once a legal decision has been made, no Member State can unilaterally revoke it.
We support your suggestion, Madam President, that the Commission should make a statement on this in connection with Mr Funk's report.
