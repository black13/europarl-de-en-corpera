Madam President, our group voted against the report although we agree in principle that what really matters is to encourage marketing and not intervention.
Essentially, this has also been decided now, but the Commissioner has not expressed an opinion on it.
This means that the content of the votes need not be adopted by the Council.
It can be assumed from this that what Parliament has now contributed in the way of progressive thinking is not being taken up.
In addition, neither of the two amendments tabled by the Greens has been accepted, to the effect that both in the case of intervention and in the case of the early premium there must be a guarantee that this meat coming onto the market, or be used for intervention, comes from BSE-free stocks.
I regard this as a major omission.
On the one hand we are involved in a committee of inquiry to examine the possible errors by the Commission in dealing with BSE, yet on the other hand we are putting ourselves at fault by not ensuring that this meat comes from BSEfree stocks.
In addition, the amendment to the effect that the early marketing premium should also be limited to 90 animals has not been accepted.
This is important to ensure that, rather than the whole of mass production being involved in this premium, it should reflect a preference for production on smaller farms where animals are kept under the right conditions for their species.
That was why we felt compelled to reject this report.
