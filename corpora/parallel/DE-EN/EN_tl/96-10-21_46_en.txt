Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be the first of the new or re-elected Austrian Members to address the House since the European elections in Austria on 13 October, and it is a particular pleasure to speak in connection with a report by someone I hold in such high regard as Mrs Mouskouri.
My colleagues and I are exceptionally appreciative of the emphasis that Mrs Mouskouri places on cultural and educational policy.
For this reason, I think that the report is an excellent one and we fully support it, including all the amendments.
It is important for people in Europe to recognize and come to know and understand one another, and surely there can be no better instrument than literature for furthering knowledge and understanding.
Some points in the report which deserve particular attention are, on the one hand, the reference to small, independent publishers and, on the other, the significant mention of lesser-used languages - and surely we must also include here the languages of minorities.
It is very important that the possibility of wider dissemination should also be available to works of literature in minority languages, which are a valuable element of the literature of our continent and must not be allowed to languish beyond the reach of a wider European public.
Unfortunately, the budget is very limited, and of course we must approve the proposal to raise it to ECU 10.5 million.
While I have no wish to misuse this occasion, I shall use it to say that our group, which has emerged strengthened from the election, intends to carry on working constructively in this House.
We are Europeans, despite the repeated accusations to the contrary during the election campaign.
We do make criticisms, but our approach to Europe is a constructive one, and we shall continue to be guided by the principle that too much centralization is bad for Europe as a whole, and for the individual Member States.
