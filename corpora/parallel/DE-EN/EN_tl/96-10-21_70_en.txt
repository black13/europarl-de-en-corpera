I should like to begin by saying what a pleasure it is for me to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine - a remarkable personality with a great commitment to the health sector in Europe.
Hers is not an approach that lends itself to seeking harmonization via the lowest common denominator.
Medicine is an area in which things are now moving so fast that the content of training must be continually adapted.
The medical profession itself has the most important role to play in this respect.
Certificates awarded in third countries should be checked to ensure that the content of the studies involved is comparable, and should then be recognized without delay.
A precise definition of recognized qualifications in alternative medicine should be drawn up, with the same high standards that apply to general medical education, but without making medical studies a precondition.
Any attempt to water down the high standard of learning will be at the expense of patients and their health, rather than the education budget.
In terms of value for money, the cheapest option is undoubtedly rapid healing, through effective diagnosis and treatment.
Finally, because this is the last time that I shall have the opportunity of addressing the House, I should like to express my appreciation of the high level of cooperation that exists in the European Parliament.
I should like to thank the interpreters and the technicians, everyone on the podium, the Commission and the Council.
I have greatly enjoyed my period of cooperation with you.
Now I shall be watching you from the vantage point of my national parliament.
