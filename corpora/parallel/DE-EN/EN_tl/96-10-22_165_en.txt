I would say, Commissioner, that there has been no significant incident.
Obviously that is not an acceptable argument, because if there were to be an incident, large areas would be contaminated.
Of course, the only reason why we are now starting to transport MOX fuel rods in high style by air is that they are encountering serious blockades on the usual sea and road transport routes, because people simply do not want them.
But correct me if I am wrong: the transportation containers that have been used so far are of Type B, which can withstand an impact at 48 km/h.
Type C is built to withstand an impact at 324 km/h.
However, the figure required in America is 464 km/h.
The aircraft which crashed over a residential area of Amsterdam had an impact speed of 520 km/h.
Given the differences between these figures, surely you will agree with me that, on grounds of safety, the least we should have done already is to impose a total ban on the transport of nuclear material in Type B containers?
As I said, with Type B we have a maximum impact speed of 48 km/h.
Type C, which has not even been fully tested as yet, is designed to withstand impact speeds of up to 324 km/h, but the Americans are saying that the figure should be 464 km/h.
Our first task is therefore to come up with a standard set of rules, before we can even think of authorizing anything.
