Mr President, you spoke of your concerns with regard to employment policy.
We share those concerns.
The European Union is grappling with a problem of drastic proportions, namely rising unemployment, with youth and long-term unemployment the most critical aspects of this depressing trend.
Not even the most fervent advocate of European monetary union can deny the link between the efforts to meet the convergence criteria, on the one hand, and rising unemployment on the other.
1997 will be a year of austerity budgets, dominated by preparations for monetary union, and this will exacerbate rather than ease the major problem of unemployment.
Economists and financial experts from very many different countries are afraid that uncompromising adherence to the timetable will have serious consequences for Europe.
Dividing the Member States into two groups - those who take part in phase one and those who cannot manage to do so - will produce a two-speed Europe.
Such a development runs counter to the spirit of Europe, and it will also have an economic impact.
The excessive and socially ill-considered budgetary cuts which some Member States are making are creating unemployment, damaging Europe as a location for business and triggering recession.
Transferring more resources from the 'ins' to the 'outs' will further damage the economic strength of the donor countries without having a sufficiently positive impact on the recipients.
That is why, as we move towards monetary union, the Commission should take much greater account of employment policy and social policy as elements of the equation, and free itself from what is an absurdly restrictive timetable.
