Mr President, I should like to focus on one element of this year's budget negotiations, namely the Structural Funds.
The European Parliament has one overriding priority, as does our group, and that is to combat unemployment.
In this context, the Structural Funds are an important instrument.
Several amendments were tabled on this issue in the Committee on Budgets, but none of them found majority support.
So what is the situation now?
The Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to reinstate ECU 1 billion in the Structural Funds, in order to avoid creating the impression that the European Parliament is turning its back on structural policy.
The alternative is the ECU 1 bn cut which is proposed by the Council.
However, it will make absolutely no difference what the House decides.
Over the next few years, billions of ECU will be repaid to the Member States because they failed to make use of them within the Structural Funds.
The money was not fully taken up, not even in the new German LÃ¤nder .
It is no longer open to the European Parliament to decide whether any use could still be made of this money.
All we can do is sit back and watch taxes that were paid to Europe being returned to the Member States, which will use them for plugging holes in their budgets, rather than creating jobs.
In my view, the European Parliament must in future demonstrate that it will not tolerate resources being wasted - in the Structural Funds or elsewhere - or Member States failing to fulfil their obligations.
We must consider how to deal with those Member States which fight for every available ECU for their under-developed regions, but then fail to stand by their commitments.
To do that, however, we need a joint strategy - one that will command a majority in the House and which can no longer be left to the Council.
There are ways of achieving such a strategy.
But we need to use them.
