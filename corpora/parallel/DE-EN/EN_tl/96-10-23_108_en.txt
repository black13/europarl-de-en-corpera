Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Slovenia too has now entered into a Europe agreement - late, but certainly not too late.
This is a country that has reached very high standards of economic and democratic development, when you bear in mind where it started.
And it is true to say that Austria was one of the neighbours which, at an early stage, supported Slovenian independence and offered a helping hand during the first turbulent weeks.
There is no doubt that here we have a country following a line of development which may ultimately bring it into the circle of Member States of the European Union.
It is certainly very significant that, despite all the problems and delays that have occurred, it was under the Italian presidency that this agreement was concluded.
I would regard that as a good omen for the future, despite my consternation at a few things that have been said in today's debate not only by Italian Members but by Austrian ones too.
There is no doubt that national and minority identities do cause many problems in Central and Eastern Europe; but nor can there be any doubt that those problems cannot be solved by accusations, the opening-up of old wounds and mutual denunciations, but only by a shared vision of the future, directed towards shared objectives.
We shall of course be voting for this agreement, although there are many things that must be asked of the Slovenian government.
Krsko and the dumping policy of the duty-free shops have been mentioned, but the critical factor is the spirit of teamwork in a region which needs a new economic beginning and a new humanity.
