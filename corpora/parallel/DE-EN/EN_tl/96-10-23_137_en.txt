Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this week is actually the third or fourth occasion to date on which we have discussed employment.
But the question which arises is how this Community can also equip itself with the necessary instruments really to be able to coordinate the policies of the Member States and the added value of a European employment policy.
Other speakers have already pointed out how many questions are still unanswered here.
I, too, once again urge the Commission to give us clear answers.
The essential thing for me - and the reason why we shall be supporting this report - is that it offers a starting point for creating the kind of machinery needed to improve this coordination - including improvements on the part of the Social Affairs Council - and that is certainly a good thing.
But this must not be allowed to happen simply on the old principle of 'If you can't solve a problem, set up a committee to bury it' .
I believe we should make quite sure that the Commission bears that in mind.
Strengthening the Social Affairs Council relative to the almost omnipotent Ecofin Council can only be a first step towards getting an effective, independent employment policy up and running in this Union, a policy free from the illusion that employment is something that happens automatically once growth, monetary union, competitiveness and the profitability of capital are in place.
