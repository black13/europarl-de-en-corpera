Madam President, the hopes expressed in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment of creating 15 million jobs by the end of the millennium and the hard facts of today are worlds apart.
There will soon be 20 million men and women out of work in the European Union, and they deserve better than declarations of intent and expressions of concern.
So it was an important signal for Europe when the Council Meeting in Essen decided to evolve a comprehensive strategy of cooperation between the Member States to deal with employment.
The concentration on those particularly affected by unemployment, increased investment in vocational training and the increase in the intensity of employment give reason to hope that the campaign against unemployment may be waged aggressively, with something more concrete than paper and words.
No one disputes the need to set up the committee on employment and labour market policy.
However, in order to be able to work successfully and effectively, it does need a stable organizational structure.
The expected reports on progress made and on omissions will pave the way for public debate, including debate in the European Parliament.
So we need informative data, analyses and conclusions, and we need them quickly, Commissioner.
The results will lead to a qualified exchange of experience with the Council, the Commission and the social partners on employee protection and social standards, on the conditions for greater mobility and flexible working hours, and, I have no doubt, on opportunities for young people, of whom so many are with us at this very moment in the gallery.
We expect information on the feasibility and efficacy of many policies and schemes which, though they may still be separate today, may in future be pursued jointly.
