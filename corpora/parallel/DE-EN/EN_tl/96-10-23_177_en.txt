The Bureau in Dublin, to which you have just referred, has had to cut back its activities because of the fact that financial resources are no longer flowing to the extent that would really be logical and necessary under the budget.
There are also a number of other initiatives that have had to be restricted for the same reason.
On the occasion of the Commission's last invitation to tender, there were more than 1000 applications in this area, but far too little financing available.
You have stressed the importance of the minority languages and protection of minorities, Mr President-in-Office, and I am grateful for that, but we should be setting more dates.
We are also, for example, setting a number of requirements for those countries wishing to join the Union.
We are asking them to take a number of measures which, in point of fact, are not actually being complied with by all States within the existing European Union.
In other words, we are asking more from others than we can offer ourselves.
Incidentally, I should like to ask you how possible it is that the European Parliament's demand that the protection of minorities be incorporated into and enshrined in the Intergovernmental Conference will actually be met.
