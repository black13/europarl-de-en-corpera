First, as chairman of the Intergroup Working Group on Minority Languages, I would like to thank you most sincerely for your support for the maintenance of the budget line and its possible topping-up.
Even so, I would also like to put the question of whether it may not additionally be possible to make better use of other programmes too.
Mrs Ahern and I this week invited representatives of the Irish language, members of the various confessions in Northern Ireland, to come here.
I am glad to learn that the Irish language is now being nurtured in the north, too.
The question is whether increasing use could be made of cross-border programmes such as INTERREG and others for this kind of cultural cooperation, which furthers the cause of peace, and for the nurturing of minority languages.
I know that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies takes a positive attitude to this.
