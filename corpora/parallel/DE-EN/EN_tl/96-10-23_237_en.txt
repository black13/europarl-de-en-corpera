Mr President, I want to offer warm thanks to the Commissioner for his very clear statement.
The question that was raised several times in relation to my report, first by me and then by other speakers, concerned penalties in the event that the Commission officials were refused access to premises and information during inspections.
It is not possible to incorporate penalties in this draft regulation; nor do we want to delay it.
If I understood you correctly you made it very clear that the Commission will be dealing with this very soon in the framework of SEM and incorporate penal measures.
I assume I understood you correctly; for that affects the amendment I tabled on this draft regulation.
It would be most helpful if you would confirm that.
