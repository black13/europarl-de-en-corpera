Madam President, only chance dictates that we have now moved on from the debate on the reform conference to the subject of poverty, but it is highly appropriate!
All of us here are joining together to agitate for action against poverty, while at the same time the Council of Ministers is binding our hands.
The main cause of poverty is unemployment, and it is certainly no matter of chance that it is precisely the United Kingdom and Germany, who filed the suit against the poverty programme, that have also opposed the employment chapter in the new Treaty.
Those two national governments are responsible for the fact that ECU 12 million are now frozen, and many projects are likely to have to wait 20 months before a decision can be taken.
In every country, low incomes are associated with reduced educational opportunities for children, poor diet and health care and increasing homelessness.
A particularly striking statistic is that the German Society for the Protection of Children believes there are as many as 50, 000 so-called street children.
In West Germany and the United Kingdom there has been a widening of the divide between rich and poor since the 1980s, and in fact both categories have increased in size.
Parliament and the Commission long ago offered to negotiate with the Council of Ministers to establish legal bases for various programmes.
Despite the Irish efforts, nothing has been done.
It is essential, therefore, that in future the Council of Ministers should adopt social programmes by a majority rather than unanimously.
Poverty is not a natural disaster.
To combat poverty and to integrate the poor into our society, we need a long-term strategy which effectively and continuously coordinates national and European concepts.
