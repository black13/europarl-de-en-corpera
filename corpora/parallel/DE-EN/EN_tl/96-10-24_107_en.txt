Mr President, anyone who turns Christian churches into mosques is committing an attack on the freedom of worship and freedom of conscience!
Anyone who tries to Islamicize Hagia Sophia in Istanbul is committing a cardinal falsification of European history and anyone who commits or countenances violence against the Ecumenical Patriarchate should know that all the Christians in the world regard that as an attack on their freedom of worship and of conscience!
I therefore declare on behalf of my group that disassociation from the declaration that Hagia Sophia is a Muslim church, an assurance that the Ecumenical Patriarchate can continue to work undisturbed, the restoration of the Cathedral of St George and the reopening of the theological school in Chalki - these are not requests to the Turkish Government, these are requirements, on the basis of which it will be decided in what direction Turkey and its government intend to go, whether in the direction of a Europe based on human rights and democracy, or in the direction of exclusion from it.
The European Parliament has a duty to make this either/or situation categorically clear.
