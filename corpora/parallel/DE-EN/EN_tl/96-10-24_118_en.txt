Mr President, the Government of Venezuela is intending to abrogate two laws, which will allow mining and logging to resume in the Amazonas rainforest.
Surely it should have come to their ears by now that such activities lead to irreparable ecological damage to the rainforest!
The illegal digging by Venezuelan miners and Brazilian diamond and gold-hunters is already posing a huge risk for the region, which the authorities are unable to handle.
At the same time the natural environment of the indigenous inhabitants is being further destroyed and thus condemned to death.
We are not trying to prescribe to Venezuela whether it may or may not use its natural resources, but if this sensitive region of Amazonas is destroyed, the Venezuelans and their future generations will be the first to have to pay for it, quite apart from the rest of mankind.
The EU must support alternatives in Venezuela as in all the other Amazonas states.
In fact Venezuela is already partly on the right road, as we recently discovered from talks in situ.
I am convinced that if the ecological problems are not resolved or become exacerbated, the social problems will also become exacerbated, and if the social problems are not resolved, that will exacerbate the ecological problems.
This vicious circle must finally be broken, and here the European Union must offer its support, as it must also do in Europe.
