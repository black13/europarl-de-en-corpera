Mr President, I agree with the previous speaker; unfortunately it is easy to see in the case of Belarus what the legacy of the Soviet Union still means today.
But at the moment this state, in which there are certainly also democrats who are trying to set up a free democracy there, is indeed suffering under the Lukashenko government, under an authoritarian and truly repressive form of government, as stated in the resolution.
We know what efforts the opposition is making and we call on the president genuinely to abandon his previous position and to tackle the necessary democratic and economic reforms, as well as respecting freedom of the press, the rule of law and human rights.
I agree with my colleagues: we would like to have the cooperation agreement but we also have to be consistent now about the policy we in this Parliament keep reminding the Council and the Commission to pursue.
For the point is that we must indeed apply the requirement we inscribe in the human rights and democracy clauses of the Treaties.
And unfortunately we must also do so in this case, which is why my group will support the conclusion set out in this resolution, namely that at the moment we will not take any further steps and will wait and see whether the Belarus authorities decide on a change of course.
Then I am sure we will be glad to sign and also to implement a cooperation agreement with the democratic forces in Belarus, as we are trying to do with the other reform states.
