Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as is clear from all the reports, tourism is indisputably not only one of the most important economic branches of the European Union but also offers a great potential for the creation of new jobs.
So it is absolutely incomprehensible why tourism is not specifically mentioned in the Treaty.
It is impossible to understand why countries whose prosperity also depends largely on tourism, such as Austria, for instance, or at least the current Austrian Government, are against the creation of a legal base for this sector.
Of course the principle of subsidiarity is not disputed in this particular case.
If we took industrial policy in the specific sense of Article 130 as our guide, which would seem appropriate and sensible, that would help dispel any doubts, for that Article does not infringe the principle of subsidiarity nor does it imply any major financial commitments.
By using this article we would be sure of being able to tackle the question of tourism globally, at European level, without infringing the principle of subsidiarity, as in the case of industry.
When we remember that the coal and steel industry still occupies a place of its own in the EU Treaty, although relatively fewer people are now employed in it, it really is absurd that tourism, which is so important to the future of Europe, should be underestimated to such an extent.
The right approach would be to be to take as a basis programmes such as those developed by industrial policy in order to make industry more competitive.
European tourism needs massive support in relation both to the development of supply and to joint marketing.
Anyone who wants to make cuts even to a well-meant but more than modest programme such as PHILOXENIA is obviously still unaware of the economic and social importance of tourism.
