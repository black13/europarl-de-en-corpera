Mr President, I think this budget once again demonstrates what we saw last year too, namely that international solidarity is being abandoned in favour of the implementation of a new Community foreign policy.
Year after year we see major development policy budget headings, cooperation with the NGOs, support for the peace process in southern Africa, new budget headings for the clearing of mines, being cut again and again.
If I am right in my view, we are facing a real cut of 3 % in development resources.
I think that is unacceptable.
New famines are already looming.
We are facing a situation of new wars breaking out, which is why it would be important to have a preventive foreign policy that enabled us to pursue a north/south policy in which in future we would no longer have to patch things up whenever we run out of money.
I would therefore call on Members to consider how we want to frame this policy in the next financial year, whether we want to close up the borders of these fifteen Member States, the borders of this Community even more tightly, whether we want to pursue a military policy that encourages this foreign policy based on the idea of further future conflict, or whether we want to pursue a preventive, civil foreign policy.
I believe that development policy can constitute a point of departure here.
A development policy aimed at independent regional development offers the chance and the condition for peaceful coexistence within the south/north framework, which is why we must not cut these scarce resources even more in future.
By doing so we would be giving the wrong signals in respect of international solidarity in a period of market globalization and deregulation, and then we should not be surprised to see even more wars and famines in future.
