Mr President, like last year I am forced yet again to vote against the report drawn up by our Committee on Budgets.
I am voting against in protest at the way in which a majority of the Committee on Budgets has dealt with the Committee on Agriculture's amendments to improve the report, which were not even put to the vote here.
The Committee on Agriculture voted by a large majority to accept the amendment I tabled as rapporteur on the question of bee-keeping in Europe in order to enter a budget heading and a small appropriation of ECU 67m (' peanuts' in relation to the general Community budget) for 1997 so that European bee-keepers would finally be granted the support which the European Parliament unanimously called for in the context of my report of 20 January 1995 showing the continuing economic difficulties facing them.
Probably no-one in this House is unaware of the indispensable ecological function of the honey bee in the natural environment or of the economic significance of the pollination carried out by bee colonies and therefore of the importance of bee-keeping.
Since an increasing number of bee-keepers are giving up because their production costs are far higher than the world market price for honey as a result of health and hygiene, social and weather conditions, these subsidies to support bee-keeping in Europe, which Parliament itself has repeatedly called for, are now overdue.
It is indeed schizophrenic for us to call for subsidies and then decide not to enter the few pennies required in the budget!
