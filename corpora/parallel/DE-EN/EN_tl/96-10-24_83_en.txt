Madam President, there are many points in the resolution which I do not dispute, but I very much regret that it only contains half-truths.
It takes up isolated cases but in no way describes the highly complex situation in that country.
I also regret the fact that after its return the delegation did not have any time at all to summarize its experiences and draw on them in order to draft a resolution, and not just on Colombia but on all three of the countries we visited which, apart from Colombia, were also Venezuela and Peru.
That is my first comment.
My second comment is this: fortunately you mention in recital D that the guerillas also violate human rights, but you should also refer to that in recital M and paragraph 7, where you do not mention that people have been murdered by the guerillas too.
That needs to be said too.
Nor should we just name individual oil companies but tackle the problem as a whole.
Like you, we mourn the death of the human rights campaigner Giraldo, about which you express dismay in recital F. Incidentally he also worked with the Misereor campaign, which gives a great deal of money for Colombia.
People who make such statements should make rather more effort to look at the overall situation and also to say that there is simply not enough political will in the Colombian Parliament.
Corruption and a lack of willingness to tackle these things at their roots are to be found there too.
As the Latin America delegation we should take a much clearer stand vis Ã  vis our colleagues.
