Just a brief clarification following what Mrs Lenz said.
I agree with her on many points.
We would indeed have liked to include more things in the resolution.
But, Mrs Lenz, would you just compare the various drafts that were tabled.
Then you will find that the present outcome really is the most one could expect and is excellent.
In particular, I would ask you to take a look at the resolution drafted by your own group.
I very much regret that we have not yet had an opportunity to sit down together following this truly important visit.
That too should be criticized in the strongest terms.
