Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group I condemn in the strongest possible terms the killing of yet another individual at the demarcation line in Cyprus.
This is the third unarmed Greek Cypriot to have been murdered at the illegal border in Cyprus in the space of a few months.
Turkey, the occupying regime, wants to give the impression that the two ethnic groups cannot coexist, that the 'green line' is a state border.
That is a cruel, scandalous and, in my view, unsuccessful strategy.
Wrong remains wrong.
A flagrant violation of international law remains a flagrant violation of international law - even after 22 years.
The world at large knows that.
We have made it clear here in the European Parliament this morning that Turkey will not receive any more financial support.
Turkey knows now that we are no longer prepared to accept the daily infringements of human rights in Turkey and in Cyprus.
And we in the European Parliament also expect the Commission and especially the Member States to put greater pressure on Turkey to withdraw its occupying forces, support the demilitarization proposal and make it possible to find a just and peaceful solution in Cyprus.
