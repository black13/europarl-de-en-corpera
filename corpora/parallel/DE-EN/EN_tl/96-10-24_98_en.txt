Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there has been civil war in Sudan for years and its neighbours are getting into difficulties because of the influx of refugees and the Sudanese attempts at destabilization.
Other results are human rights violations such as massacres, torture and enslavement.
As ever, non-Muslim religious sects are being persecuted and excluded from humanitarian and other vital aid.
Against the will of the majority of the people, the government is trying to turn Sudan into an Islamic state.
That is why the sanctions imposed by the international community must be maintained.
The EU may only resume its development activities when the government of Sudan observes the EU and ACP resolutions and the resolutions of the UN Security Council, of which we have been reminding them for years.
Unfortunately there is as yet no visible sign of success.
In the interests of the suffering people of Sudan, visible signs of success are, however, urgently needed and I hope we will obtain them.
