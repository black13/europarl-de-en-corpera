Madam President, yesterday an explanation of vote by Mr Dell'Alba was recorded, two aspects of which were not an explanation of vote.
Firstly, it contained personal insults that I must reject, for he accused me of falsifying history, and secondly he called on the President to act contrary to the Rules, namely to delete passages from the explanatory statement in my report.
According to our Rules of Procedure, however, the rapporteur is solely responsible for the content of an explanatory statement.
It can no more be deleted than can passages from a speech.
This could only be done under some kind of Orwellian Ministry of Truth, and the Committee on External Economic Relations has unanimously rejected this notion in a letter to the President.
