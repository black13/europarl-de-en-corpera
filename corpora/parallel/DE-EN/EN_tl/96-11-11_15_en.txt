Mr President, I simply wished to let you know that there was another photographer outside the Chamber just now, attempting to photograph us as we were signing the attendance register.
I would ask you to finally put a stop to this deplorable state of affairs.
There were no security staff on hand, so I told the photographer that what he was doing was not allowed.
Could you please either have the attendance register moved into the Chamber - there is plenty of space available behind you - or take steps to see that we put a stop once and for all to this quite irregular snooping in Parliament.
