Mr President, Mr Howitt has presented an important report on the refugee situation.
It has our support, and we were unanimous in approving it in committee.
Mr Howitt has just mentioned the figure of 53 million refugees.
I believe that there are many more than that.
The figure is somewhere between 200 million and 500 million, depending on who is counted as a refugee - whether, for example, environmental refugees are included.
There are many people in the southern hemisphere whom we completely fail to consider.
And that brings me to a problem in the area of internal affairs.
Refugees from the South are frequently refused entry to our countries.
The terminology is shifting: the concepts of asylum and protection from forced repatriation are being circumscribed in such a way that we no longer recognize these people's human rights.
If a refugee has to obtain proof of his refugee status from a dictatorial regime, that proof will not be forthcoming - in other words, we should take a more liberal approach here.
It is important that refugees should be reintegrated into their countries.
But the conditions necessary for reintegration have to be created.
Mr Howitt mentioned mines.
We need far more resources to effectively clear the mines that have been laid, so that people are able to move about.
For voluntary repatriation to work, we also need people to have the land rights which they formerly held.
This is something that we must support.
The Commission was mentioned in relation to bureaucratic obstacles.
I hope that we can resolve this problem, that as a Parliament we can continue to exercise a control function, and that the people in the camps - 80 % of them women and children - can count on their rights and not be forced to endure sexual or other forms of coercion.
That is where the Commission's duty lies.
