Mr President, Mrs André-Léonard has submitted an important and practical report on this issue.
I believe it is important to call for resources from the budget heading to be made available for innovative measures.
Raising public awareness, communication measures, information and training are all important and necessary, if the further spread of AIDS is to be prevented.
There must be support for methods of providing early diagnosis.
Reinforcement of the health and social services sectors is also something that we can all support.
Another very important point, in my opinion, is a study of solidarity instruments to improve the treatment of people affected by HIV in the poorest countries: we must support this measure, just as we must support medical cooperation and cooperative exchanges.
The promotion of non-discrimination and action to combat stigmatization or the creation of ghettos are extremely important and must be supported if we are to help these people.
A crucial reference is made to support for measures to curb the spread of AIDS - and particularly for prevention - and I should like to conclude with a practical proposal: the House has already made numerous suggestions concerning support for condom sales and marketing, and making condoms available free of charge.
Another proposal was that a condom production facility should be set up in Africa.
I should like to add the following suggestion: tourists arriving by air from the North to the South - and I mean all of them, male and female - should receive, at the airport where they land, a packet of condoms and a leaflet with information about the causes and effects of AIDS.
