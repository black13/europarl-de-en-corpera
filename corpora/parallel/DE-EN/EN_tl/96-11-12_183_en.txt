Commissioner, I should firstly like to make a further comment.
I go to quite a few places in Austria, and I am extremely surprised by the suggestion that the Austrian authorities have somehow been obstructing the return of the refugees.
At least, I have never heard anything about that in Austria itself.
My question to you, Commissioner, is this: do you not have the impression that, in the whole treatment of the refugee question, an unduly bureaucratic approach is hindering matters?
There are large parts of Bosnia to which no one can be expected to return if they have no house there, because it is extremely cold.
There are other areas to which the refugees can happily go back, because it is warm.
The situation must therefore be judged differently from area to area, from community to community.
Are you not of the opinion that the authorities are regrettably adopting an unduly bureaucratic approach in this respect, which is hampering the whole operation?
