Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we should really be doing more to name names here, in political terms.
In view of the priority given to combating mass unemployment and social exclusion, we need to identify the real scandal, which is that the Member States are stalling in terms of quality and quantity, whilst the Commission has only blunt tools in its hands both as regards defining the objectives and applying sanctions.
In the agricultural sector, the Commission has quite different scope for taking sanctions.
Why is that not so in the case of the Structural Funds?
There is a question for you here too, Mr Liikanen.
Is there not a danger, in connection with SEM 2000, that we are formalizing matters and thereby creating a technically correct fa√ßade, behind which those who run the budget carry out refinancing exercises, spend the appropriations according to their arbitrary budget needs and thus exclude the specialist departments?
And finally, is it not possible to coordinate with the national audit bodies in all these areas?
Only by this means can we actually exercise some form of political control, through which the aims of a European social policy are then translated into substance.
