Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the rapporteur, I think the common position considerably improves the Commission's proposal, and this applies - with my apologies, Mrs Bjerregaard - both to the new versions of Annexes I and II and to Annexes III and IV, specifying the project selection criteria.
I do nevertheless still have some serious criticisms.
However good the intentions, legislation will not work in practice unless certain conditions are met.
One of these conditions is systematic coordination with the other directives in the environment sector which cover the same subject-matter, for example the IPPC directive, the Seveso directive and the eco-audit, since transposition is considerably complicated by this lack of coordination.
It must also be said that nearly all the new amendments would make it even more difficult to carry out environmental impact assessments in the Member States.
Both the developers and the authorities examining their applications would have to cope with further complications and delays, without any benefit to the environment.
On the contrary, most of these amendments would detract from the quality of the environmental impact assessment itself, and hence environmental protection as a whole.
However, I would endorse what Mr White said: I too find it a sorry state of affairs that the House always discusses on a Tuesday evening the important legislative business where Parliament has real decision-making powers, and that the press reports do not appear until two days later, causing everything to fall flat.
The President, who has responsibility here, cannot do anything about this time-lag, but it is up to our group to rally round and ensure that environmental issues are discussed at times when there are people sitting and listening in the public gallery, because the environment is something which really is of interest to many of our citizens, who appreciate that it can only be regulated by joint action.
