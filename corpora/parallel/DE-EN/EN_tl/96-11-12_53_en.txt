Mr President, Commissioner, it is in keeping with the importance of this directive that it has attracted a great deal of attention, but has also provoked criticism.
I should like to say two things to the critics.
The European legislation in this case is taking up and reinforcing the position that was adopted as long ago as 1989.
It is not a question of regulation and restraint, but a decision to follow the path of cultural freedom, to which we are committed by Article 128 of the EU Treaty.
We all realize that market forces alone do not guarantee that freedom.
Secondly, the criticism that this is an attempt to subject the new information and transmission technologies to irrelevant regulation does not hold water.
The directive only covers the new media in so far as they include televisual elements.
If the directive were to exclude them, the whole regulatory package would be invalidated.
One thing is clear: where cultural freedom is at risk, the free market is also on shaky ground.
Freedom is indivisible.
I hope that I agree on that point with the representatives of commercial television and the media industry.
