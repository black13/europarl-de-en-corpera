Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is intended that one of the main goals of the new broadcasting directive should be to promote the European programme-making industry and safeguard Europe's cultural diversity in the audiovisual market.
Besides the most important aspect - that of cultural diversity and creativity, which was highlighted so eloquently by Mr Lang - the new directive is intended to generate increased investment in the European film industry by supporting the production and dissemination of European-made programmes.
According to the experts, it should also be possible to create two million new jobs over the next ten years and to enable our European broadcasters to be involved in the rapid rise of new technologies and the anticipated expansion of the audiovisual industry, so as to create a level playing-field for competition with American productions.
A further important aim of the new broadcasting directive is to make major sports broadcasts freely available to the general public.
In future, everyone should continue to be able to watch transmissions of major sporting events, not only at European but also at national level, without having to pay extra for the privilege.
That is why it is important that exclusive rights for major events should be handled in the Commission - and I would direct my remarks here to Commissioner Oreja in particular.
The final point on which I wish to express my views concerns the protection of minors.
Clearly, voluntary selfregulation is not sufficient.
However, we all know from educational theory, as well as from personal experience, that prohibitions and defensive measures are often counter-productive.
That is why I am arguing that positive steps should also be taken, so as to provide strong support for good, exciting broadcasting for children and young people.
That must surely be possible within the framework of the existing MEDIA programmes.
