Mr President, in the item concerning the debate on energy efficiency and gas and electricity distribution, all the committees which delivered an opinion are referred to, with the exception of the Committee on Budgets.
I also delivered an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Budgets.
Is this not something of a scandal?
