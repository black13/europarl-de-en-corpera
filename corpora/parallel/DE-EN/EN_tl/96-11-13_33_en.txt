Madam President, trade always seems desirable to those who are in the strong position, and they dictate their terms to the others.
The purpose of trade is not to make the poor rich or to feed the hungry but to make money out of it.
Not that I have any real objection to that, but I do think we should abandon this mythology.
When we debate the fact that shipments of animals are going to North Africa and we get excited about the conditions in which they are shipped, we are right to do so, but the real basic problem is that we are taking animals there although there are plenty there already.
Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, the poorest states in the world, traditionally live by livestock farming.
They are no longer able to sell their animals because we are taking away their market by shipping subsidized live animals out there, and torturing them into the bargain.
Then our agriculture minister, Mr Borchert, who is now attending the world food conference, says, ' well, we have to do it, because otherwise those markets would be taken by New Zealand and Australia and in that case the animals would be coming from even farther away' .
So we aren't talking about feeding the hungry, we're talking about markets.
Why should animals be sent from New Zealand to North Africa when there are plenty of animals there already?
In other words, we must safeguard the basic right to food.
We must see that all international treaties include a clause saying that it is a basic right of any people to pull back and ensure the security of their own food base, and we must conclude agreements to the effect that trade must not just take place on the terms dictated by the stronger countries, to the detriment and impoverishment of the poor, but should benefit them.
That is what we should do if we really want to introduce an ethical aspect into international trade.
