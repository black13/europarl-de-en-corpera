Ladies and gentlemen, we are agreed, are we not, that we are talking about politics here, not a natural process.
Politics is not just about government, and certainly not just about the authorities: democratic politics also makes certain demands on what the political authorities are required to do.
The Carlos Lage report indicates realistic opportunities for action, following up the requirement stated by Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and also, in his own field, Commissioner Flynn for a structural policy to benefit employment, and especially to benefit equality of opportunity, because as we known women are particularly seriously affected by mass unemployment.
We can and must really take advantage of financial, innovative and administrative potentials.
Because the fact is that a more effective use, a better targeted application, of the existing instruments is the very first thing we must always do.
In combination, after all, they will achieve something.
But we also need a genuine first step away from the neo-liberal plan, which by combatting unemployment results in a reduction of wages, the deterioration of working conditions and social marginalization, towards - and I entirely agree with Mr Cassidy here - a European counterpart, a counterpart based on solidarity, negotiation and equilibrium, to the American model of income and labour sharing.
In the USA, that was achieved without any compensation or solidarity mechanism.
We want to plan it on the basis of solidarity instead of non-solidarity, fragmentation and marginalization, which is what I believe has happened in the United Kingdom.
That means, of course, that we first need to bank on solidarity in employment, but of course we must also provide the appropriate public funding for it, and there must also be a share of the increased productivity for employment.
Otherwise it won't work!
