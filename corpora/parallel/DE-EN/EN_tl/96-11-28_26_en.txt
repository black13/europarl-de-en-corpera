Mr President, I have nothing to add to the many sensible remarks that have been made; what has been said before need not be repeated.
The issue for all of us is what instruments we can find to combat unemployment.
Mr Wolf said that we did not want to recreate American conditions here, and he is undoubtedly right.
On the other hand, we don't want interventionist governments, and especially not an interventionist Europe!
I come from a part of Germany which suffered under socialism for 40 years, and I have no desire to experience European socialism.
So it is wrong, as I see it, if indeed there should be a chapter on employment in the Treaty, that - as Mr Lage writes in his report - the Treaty should make it obligatory to coordinate Community policy for the creation of jobs; but if there is a chapter on employment in the Treaty, then at the most it should create an obligation to coordinate the national employment policies.
To be on the safe side, I should like to ask honourable Members to vote in favour of my amendment to the Lage report, tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, which is Amendment No 1, and to delete the entire passage relating to the insertion of an employment chapter into the Treaty.
