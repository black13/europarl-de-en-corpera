Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the high level of unemployment is a continuing major challenge to the European Union.
The achievements of European employment strategy to date have been disappointing.
Despite all their protestations at the Council, the Member States are not doing enough to support the efforts of the Commission and the European Parliament.
Until the proposals in the confidence pact - regional employment pacts, reduced ancillary wage costs, integration of young people, avoidance of long-term unemployment, equality of opportunity for men and women - are implemented energetically and more swiftly, we shall achieve no progress in the employment sector.
Changing the title of the Commission's report from 'employment' to 'unemployment' would do nothing to change this situation.
What we need to change is the situation whereby the good proposals - and I emphasize the good proposals - in the three reports are no more than words on paper; we must see that they are implemented throughout Europe.
The time has come for employers and employees to realize that they are all in the same boat.
They should stop trying to outdo each other in moaning about how bad conditions are in Europe - they should get together, roll up their sleeves and take an optimistic approach to the task of creating better employment conditions.
This means that one side must abandon thinking solely in terms of shareholder value, while the other must negotiate not only in the employees' interests but also in those of the unemployed.
The appeal must be made not just to governments, Mr Wolf, but also to the solidarity of the social partners for the common good in Europe, and beyond the boundaries of the European Union.
