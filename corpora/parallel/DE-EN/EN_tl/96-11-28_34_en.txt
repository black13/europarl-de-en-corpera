Mr President, is the commitment to create economic and social cohesion in Europe suitable only for times of growth?
The solidarity between generations and between Member States evaporates as times grow harder.
When all we hear is how Europe is finished as a location for industry, investors look elsewhere and public confidence falters.
We must see the Commission's yearly report as an opportunity not for further discussion of the crisis but for discussion of opportunities.
First, the European social model is not an optional extra.
Secondly, the dialogue between the social partners, the alliance for work and the Round Table are too valuable to be casually abandoned.
Thirdly, the prospects of employment for our most important resource -people - must be improved.
Every ECU today and every euro tomorrow that, contrary to the misgivings expressed in the Wolf report, arrives at the right time and place to promote stability, every investment in qualified basic and further training and retraining, and in lifelong learning, increases our fitness for globalization.
LEONARDO and SOCRATES, ADAPT and NOW and more effective use of the structural funds are a reality, not an illusion.
Fourthly, the market opportunities for the SMEs must be improved.
After all, they have substance, flexibility, a spirit of innovation and sound social structures.
However, improved access to capital and research results are still an illusion, not a reality.
Fifthly, we must build up long-term confidence.
The necessary chapter on employment must not arouse any false hopes.
We must not release the Member States from their responsibilities.
But we can develop guidelines which lead to improved coordination.
The comprehensive strategy for cooperation between the Member States, adopted in Essen, investment in vocational training, increasing the intensity of employment - these are the right foundations.
Europe has the brains, the capacity and the creativity.
Let's use them!
