On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I should like to support the position of the Conciliation Committee.
We believe, however, that certain matters have been mentioned which merit further discussion.
For example, we would agree with our colleagues in the Green Group in the European Parliament that the extent of alcohol addiction is widely underestimated.
It is actually the case in some countries that young people can buy an alcoholic drink more cheaply than a non-alcoholic one.
Another problem is the definition of drug addicts as patients.
Much as this should be encouraged, there is also a need here to work out new methods that will allow these patients to be treated.
In our experience, the methods which medicine currently has to offer are not capable of bringing an addict back to health.
The definition alone will not enable us to provide appropriate treatment for the patients - as opposed to criminals - whom we now have to deal with.
We also foresee a difficulty in delegating the provision of information to schools and universities, and in the growing problem of social stratification in Europe.
We know from experience that people in the higher social strata have access to better schools, whereas the schools which poorer people attend are not so good.
In the schools that are attended by the poorer sections of the population, it is often quite impossible to practise prevention or to make documentation and information available.
Finally, there is also the question of closer cooperation with the countries where drugs are produced.
Merely sending money to these countries will not suffice.
Programmes for helping them to make the transition to other products will have to be considered.
