Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have an internal market, we have a European customs tariff, and the customs duties that we levy are the European Union's own revenue.
All this belongs to the Community.
But then we have 15 different national customs administrations whose job it is to ensure that the whole thing functions.
The members of my group - and we are not the only ones - regard that as an anachronism.
We are, however, realistic enough not to think that introducing a single customs administration is a possibility.
That is quite clear.
But we did wish to see the joint system reinforced to some extent.
We had hoped for an action programme which indicated practical steps towards better cooperation between the customs administrations.
Simply on the basis of this text as it appears on the page, I could not recommend, on behalf of my group, that we should support the programme.
However, I shall be guided not by the text on the page, nor by the attitude of the Council - which has given me very little encouragement - but by the spirit of the Commission.
We encountered tremendous support there for our requirements and concerns - particularly from Commissioner Monti and DG XXI - even in those cases where our view did not prevail.
It is this, above all, which has persuaded me to express support - on behalf of my group as well as for myself - for the compromise that has been reached.
I believe that what we have achieved in the discussions on this programme, as well as in the debate in the Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System, is more important than the text on the page: it is more important to bring a problem to people's attention and, rather than simply stating baldly that something has to be done, to bring about a genuine change of awareness.
Bearing that in mind, we shall also be following closely the implementation of the action programme which we are about to approve.
