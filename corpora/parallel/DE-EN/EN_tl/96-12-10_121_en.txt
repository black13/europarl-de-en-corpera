Mr President, the European Union has set itself two major political and economic objectives for the coming decade: firstly to create the economic and monetary union, and secondly to prepare for and accomplish its enlargement.
Both these goals are associated with a massive financial outlay by the Member States.
The measures currently being taken in the individual countries with a view to meeting the Maastricht criteria on time are already lowering the social standards of large sections of the population.
But they are also causing many citizens to feel increasingly unenthusiastic about the European Union and, unfortunately, about the European ideal.
In my opinion this report, which is a very well-balanced one, is nevertheless based on a fallacy, namely that the deepening and the enlargement of the Union can - or even must - take place simultaneously.
On the contrary, it would seem that the completion of monetary union will make enlargement to the east impracticable for many years to come.
Some Member States are simply not able to take on even more financial burdens.
The mere fact that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, with some 106 million inhabitants, will represent 29 % of the population, whereas their GDP amounts to only 4 % of the GDP of the 15 EU countries, shows what unimaginable efforts will be required.
The Union's fundamental aim, enlargement, is very welcome for economic and political reasons.
But everything possible must be done to carry out all the necessary adjustments and reforms in good time, both in the Member States and in the applicant countries, and particular attention must be paid to what is tolerable from a social point of view.
As regards the enlargement strategy, it is vital to opt for a flexible approach, given the widely differing levels of development.
A transitional phase must be planned for each country, in accordance with its needs and circumstances.
