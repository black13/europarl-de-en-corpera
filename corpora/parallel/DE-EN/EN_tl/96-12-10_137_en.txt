Mr President, the agricultural policy is not too expensive; the money is going in the wrong direction, and into the wrong instruments.
Prices for agricultural products are not too high; they are too low to permit the ecologically sound production of high-quality, healthy food.
We support the Rehder report - we support the whole of it.
It was cut by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Mr Funk, what matters is not to establish a new farm policy superseding the CAP, but the direction to be followed if enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is not to end in disaster.
It has quite rightly been said that our efforts should be directed not at the world market, but at the internal market and the regional markets.
Then the market will do what Mr Samland is not prepared to pay for out of public funds.
Because we cannot have both: cutting back public funding and reducing prices would be the death of rural areas.
I am in favour of bringing down subsidies where they are misguided, but in my view, consumers must be expected to pay a reasonable price for healthy food, in the context of a policy based on quality.
