Firstly, I should just like to make one point: you can, of course, say that the aid has been provided too late, but I believe that it is important that it has been provided at all.
I have listed a series of aid measures which have been taken in favour of Iraq since 1991, because these operations were started immediately after the Gulf War.
At that time alone, over ECU 100 million was granted and made available to Iraq.
Naturally, the Commission will not change its policy simply because this decision was taken yesterday.
We shall continue to provide the aid which has been pledged, and thus change nothing in this respect.
I share your opinion that, at present, we can only hope that these measures will together achieve the effect we all wish to see.
I should like to make it clear, however, that the aid provided by the European Union, in relation to that provided by other parties, represents the lion's share.
Consequently, we should not beat our breasts in self-criticism and say that we should do more, but compare ourselves to others and draw attention to how much aid they provide.
