Mr Galeote, the common position undoubtedly provides the continuity that we wish to see, and it builds on the declarations issued by the European Council in Madrid and Florence.
It also unequivocally reaffirms the Union's rejection of the use of retaliatory economic measures.
However, this continuity is not entirely linear, in the sense that the common position also makes an urgent call for an improvement in the human rights situation and greater political freedom.
This criterion also comes into play in determining our line of conduct.
Naturally, there is a need to ensure that the money we make available actually gets to where it is meant to go.
The aid is conveyed to its destination entirely by European NGOs, and those NGOs are required to ensure that the goods do actually reach their goal.
With regard to humanitarian aid, I should like to point out that the terms of reference agreed by the Commission and the Cuban authorities stipulate that the NGOs remain the owners of the goods until they are delivered to the final beneficiaries, and consequently also retain control over them.
In this way, therefore, we are seeking to ensure that the system functions properly.
