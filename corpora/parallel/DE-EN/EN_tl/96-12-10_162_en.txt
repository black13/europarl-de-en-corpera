The Commission does indeed view the situation in the way that you describe, Mr Kerr.
Clearly, our proposed approach or strategy with regard to aid to Cuba must not result in us neglecting to insist on respect for human rights.
On the other hand, though, it must not result in the Cuban people - who are already suffering from the fact that human rights are not fully respected - failing to receive the aid which they so desperately need.
This is why we have to strike a proper balance.
In any event, I am convinced that the strategy we have developed jointly with the Council will have the appropriate effects.
