That is undoubtedly necessary, Mr Salafranca, and I entirely agree that it must be one of the basic principles governing our relations with other countries.
I also endorse your comment that the fundamental principles of respect for human dignity, freedom of expression and democracy must apply.
However, it should also be quite clear - and we must be realistic here - that we cannot enforce all this by granting or not granting aid.
We can call for it, we can insist on it, but we cannot always automatically enforce it.
That is a fact that we have also learnt from a great many other situations.
