To avoid any misunderstandings, Mr Blak, I can take proceedings against a Member State in the Court of Justice if it fails to fulfil its obligations.
However, penalizing an individual transport company which has committed an abuse or bringing an action against it in a national court is the exclusive responsibility of the Member States.
The Commission cannot intrude on their areas of competence.
I can only stress what I said earlier: if we are not provided with further instruments enabling us to take action against such infringements, apart from the normal breach of Treaty procedure, then the latter is all that we can apply.
Otherwise, we must be provided with additional means.
