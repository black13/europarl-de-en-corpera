Mr Spiers, the idea that you have just put forward is not entirely new to me.
I am basically in favour of applying and making use of this possibility, if we are legally able to do so.
However, we must first of all clarify the legal question, since it is unacceptable that an NGO should, as it were, have to gain access illegally in order to be able to carry out such inspections on the ground.
We must be able to confer appropriate powers on these NGOs or their representatives, since we cannot accept the possibility of them being punished for acting in the interests of animal protection.
This question needs legal clarification.
If we can resolve this problem, then I shall be strongly in favour of us pursuing this additional course.
However, I do not believe that we can do without professional inspectors entirely.
I therefore repeat my request for the extra inspectors that we were promised - or at least some of them: perhaps we could share them with the NGOs.
