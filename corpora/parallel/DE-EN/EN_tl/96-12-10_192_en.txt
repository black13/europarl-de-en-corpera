Commissioner, this argument about the register is threatening to disguise the urgency of the need to set up Europol in the public debate.
I should like to ask you how things stand with regard to the process of ratifying Europol, and what the timetable is for finally bringing Europol into operation?
It is not only the argument about the register which is important, therefore, but the timetable for Europol overall.
