Mr President, I should like to make an appeal to the Commissioner, since he comes from a country which produces one of the best alcoholic beverages in the world, namely an excellent whiskey - and I must leave it at that, since my wife is originally from Scotland, so I should not be advertising Irish whiskey.
However, I should like to point out how much the production and consumption of high-quality beverages - above all wine, beer and whisky - have contributed to European culture.
Given that the consumption of these beverages is a social event, or that they are consumed at social events, I firmly reject any kind of generalization whereby alcohol consumption is discussed in blanket terms and no distinction is made between social and excessive drinking.
In my opinion, it is also important for the Commission to disseminate culture and to promote diversity.
I should like to point out that Austria produces an enormous variety of wines and beers, which cannot be blamed without any qualification for the things which people dislike about alcoholic beverages.
I therefore vehemently oppose any kind of across-the-board discrimination - especially against wines and beers - such as that which is currently being imported from the United States and which is continually expounded by the ideologically dominated WHO.
