Mr President, the Green Group in the European Parliament supported the Schnellhardt report, although with very serious misgivings, because the Commission simply removed the section concerning the labelling of alcoholic beverages from the proposal.
Moreover, our position is very weak.
We are now dependent on the goodwill of the Commission to announce that it will submit a proposal on the labelling of alcoholic beverages.
I think we are all agreed in the House that there has to be such a proposal, not only because this is the wish of consumers, but also because there are other considerations which make it necessary.
For example, there are people who need alcoholic beverages to be labelled, because they are unable to drink alcohol for health reasons.
It is therefore quite impossible to understand why the Council and the Commission have bowed to pressure from the alcohol lobby to such an extent.
We shall therefore be extremely vigilant in checking that the Commission actually brings forward this proposal.
Parliament must take this matter very seriously.
We shall not be taking ourselves seriously if we do not now press the Commission to submit a proposal on the labelling of alcoholic beverages very swiftly.
Moreover, that was the arrangement made in the Conciliation Committee.
The Commission must not shirk its responsibility in this respect.
It is Parliament's task to ensure that this proposal is brought forward, that it is applicable in practice, and that it contains no loopholes which make it possible to circumvent the labelling obligation.
I believe that I can leave it at that.
Our group will be very vigilant in ensuring that the Commission brings forward a proposal on the labelling of alcoholic beverages as soon as possible.
That is the urgent wish of consumers, and we must do justice to that wish!
