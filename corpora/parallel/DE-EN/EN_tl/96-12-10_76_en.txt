The idea of a single market with 15 different customs administrations might at first sight seem to be a paradox.
However, this may well be due to the fact that we cling excessively in our thinking to the structures of the traditional nation state, in the form in which it has evolved in Western Europe in the modern age.
What we are dealing with here is not symbols of national power or the foreshadowing of a 'unified European nation state' , but entirely practical operating problems of the Community's internal market.
Bringing the procedures for cooperation between customs authorities into the Community domain seems to us to be the most appropriate approach to solving the problems.
However, that was clearly not available.
Nevertheless, perhaps the imperfect compromise now before the House represents a good starting-point for a creative new approach to finding solutions to the problem of turning the internal market into a genuine 'home market' which can still be democratically controlled and regulated, without being subordinated to a unified state.
