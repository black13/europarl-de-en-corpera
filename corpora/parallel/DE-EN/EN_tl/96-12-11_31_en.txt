Ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk about Serbia, which is indeed also included in the terms of reference of this debate.
I believe that the European Union - both the Commission and the Council and Parliament - can and must play a key role in the democratization of Serbia.
We must make it clear to the opposition and the government in Serbia that a process of democratization, which must be linked to reconciliation both with Bosnia and with Kosovo, offers the only chance of concluding association agreements with the European Union.
We must totally convince Belgrade of the value of the European ideal.
There can be no democratic future for Serbia without reconciliation with Bosnia and Croatia, without democratic civil structures and without rights for all the minorities in Serbia.
Once the opposition and the government realise that, this region will have a future that is marked not by war and hatred but by cooperation and mutual respect.
To that end it is important to speak out clearly in Dublin, to avoid any misunderstandings in this region on which the war has left such a heavy mark.
So I hope that at its Dublin meeting the European Council will come up with some better ideas for the revision of the Maastricht Treaty than what we have been offered so far.
