Mr President, unfortunately one minute is not long enough to congratulate the Irish presidency, which I would, however, have liked to do.
The intensive efforts of the Member States to fulfil the Maastricht criteria are currently leading to a massive rise in unemployment and undermining social standards.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the citizens are quite inadequately informed on the question of the introduction of the euro because the information campaign so far on the introduction of a single currency has been conducted in a remarkably one-sided manner.
Until now the social and employment policy consequences have in fact been concealed, whether deliberately or not.
The massive effect the introduction of the euro will have on all aspects of the life of the citizens of Europe actually requires that the people of the Member States are given a chance to participate in the decision.
In that respect it seems essential in terms of democratic policy to ask the people of the Member States their opinion on the introduction of monetary union by holding referenda.
If monetary union is introduced against the will of the people it is certainly doomed to failure!
