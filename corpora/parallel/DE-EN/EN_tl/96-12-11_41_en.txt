Mr President, at the beginning of the Irish presidency of this conference I want to express my great respect and say that Austria, which will be assuming the presidency in the second half of 1998, can only learn from the way Ireland has mastered this difficult task.
I hope we will be able to work as efficiently as the Irish Republic has done.
The European Union has set itself ambitious aims: a common currency, a common foreign policy, a common house with room for more tenants that is as burglar-proof as possible and co-decision by the tenants.
The latter is also urgently necessary, for the European Union will only be able to achieve its aims if the citizens are adequately involved in the decision-making, with the help of the European Parliament as also of the national parliaments, on a basis of subsidiarity.
I, like Austria as a whole, would urge that a protocol to the Treaty, concerning the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and strengthening the Committee of the Regions, is adopted in Dublin.
We also support all the efforts to strengthen internal and external security.
Austria, which has a long external EU border to protect, is particularly aware of the importance of Europol and Schengen and calls for a common approach to asylum and immigration policy.
We also consider it most important for the CFSP to take shape and for majority decisions to be possible in the non-military area.
The lack of a common foreign and security policy has had particularly adverse effects in former Yugoslavia.
So I think it is urgently necessary for the European Parliament to raise its voice in order to strengthen the democratic opposition in Serbia.
I also endorse the Austrian suggestion that an appropriate stance be adopted on this matter at the Dublin conference.
For only if the democratic structures in former Yugoslavia are safeguarded can the fragile Dayton peace accord survive.
