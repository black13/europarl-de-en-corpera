Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the summit in Dublin on Friday and Saturday is coming at a very difficult time for the European Union both politically and psychologically.
That is why we need to send out a signal of confidence in Dublin.
The heads of state and government must instil optimism and confidence in the citizens of the European Union again, especially in two areas.
First, Dublin must send out a clear signal that the European Union wants radical reforms.
We need majority decisions in the Council.
That is the precondition for the politically, economically and morally necessary enlargement of the European Union.
In that respect, the letter from Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac is most encouraging.
The second condition is that as a preparatory step the heads of state and government must send out a clear signal on Thursday through their finance ministers that they intend to introduce a stable European currency on 1 January 1999 so that Europe can hold its own in an increasingly global world economy.
If it can send out these two signals, the Dublin summit will be a success!
