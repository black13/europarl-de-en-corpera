Mr President, I want to ask Mr Santer for further clarification.
I really cannot understand from his reply what he means.
The European Parliament decided at the last part-session that certain projects would be discussed.
The letter states that if we do not reach agreement the Commission undertakes to withdraw these projects.
Can you simply tell us now: is that the case or not?
With the best will in the world I cannot understand what you mean.
