Mr President, on a point of order in the broadest sense, I want to make a request that could be, so to speak, the culmination of your beneficent term of office here.
Could you not arrange for there to be a counter serving organic food in all our canteens?
That kind of food is better and healthier.
It would be good for all of us and also benefit the producers.
This really would be a major achievement.
