Mr President, this is not about a debate, it is about equal rights for all.
You were supposed to guarantee that.
If you allow the chairman of the Socialist Group and Mr Martens the right to comment on this vote, then you have to allow the chairmen of the other Groups the same right.
This has nothing to do with debate and everything to do with democracy.
I too should like to be allowed to comment on this matter.
It was a bad vote, because its effect was to vote away a large slice of this House's credibility.
We made it clear on 19 September, with 30 votes against, what we in this House insist upon.
We confirmed that vote again in October.
To say now that we can trust what Mr Santer says seems to me to be just a pretext.
What Mr Santer says is one thing, and what Commissioner van den Broek does is another.
And you know it.
(Loud applause)
