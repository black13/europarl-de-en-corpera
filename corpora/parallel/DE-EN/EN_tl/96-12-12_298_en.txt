Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at present there is in fact no parking card for disabled people which is valid throughout the EU.
This considerably restricts their mobility.
Well, this is the point we have reached: just a few days after this year's European Disabled People's Day we are finally getting round to addressing a subject which is very serious in both senses of the word.
The introduction of a Community model of parking cards for disabled people has a very personal aspect, with direct effects on the quality of life for every individual concerned.
But it also has an indirect, economic side with regard to the encouragement of the highly employment-intensive tourist industry - one of the few surviving growth industries.
For both these reasons, the introduction of a parking card which will be valid throughout the EU must be welcomed in principle.
Unfortunately, the legal instrument chosen - the recommendation - has no binding effect on the Member States, meaning that the Community model will exist in parallel, as a supplement as it were, to the national parking cards that will remain in force.
We must not be under any illusions about this.
The present recommendation will lead, at best, to a quasi-standardized external form and structure, which is far from being the same thing as saying that holders of such cards will also be able to rely on equal rights throughout the EU.
To the contrary, Member States and even individual regions will be able to lay down their own specific regulations for parking concessions for cardholders.
Those regulations will, however, have to be published in an appropriate form.
Nor, sadly, does the recommendation harmonize the conditions for qualifying for one of these disabled persons' parking cards.
Nevertheless, it is a limited step in the right direction, so that the Group of the European People's Party votes in favour of the report with all its amendments.
Many thanks to Mr Megahy for his efforts.
