I have one more question.
Regarding the amendments to the Megahy report which you are not incorporating, I have one additional request, because not only the content has been changed but also the wording, in other words it sounds like an editorial change but actually affects the content.
In the German version, at least, of the Commission's text there are several references to 'the disabled' rather than to 'disabled people' .
I therefore ask the Commission to refer to them in its final version as people, not things!
