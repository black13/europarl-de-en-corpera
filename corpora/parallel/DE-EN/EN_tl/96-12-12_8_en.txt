Mr President, on a point of order pursuant to Rule 127, I should like to express the sorrow of my Group and that of many other Members of this House that, as I understand it, you are now making your last 10 a.m. appearance in the chair you now occupy.
I feel we should express our sorrow and some of the sadness that we feel at parting, and also our thanks for all the work you have done.
In recent days we have been giving 'Mr CFSP' some thought.
I have my doubts about the value of that proposal, but I do believe you have really succeeded in giving this European Parliament, as its President, an image of pugnacity and wisdom.
I should like to offer my most sincere thanks on behalf of our Group and, I feel sure, on behalf of many other Members here in this House.
(Sustained applause)
(Mrs Roth presented Mr HÃ¤nsch with a bouquet)
