Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out to my colleagues the fact that all the political groups are perfectly entitled to issue an invitation to a presidential candidate and, of course, to discuss with him his views on what his future work will entail.
He may also be fortunate enough to discuss them with Mr Gil-Robles.
Under no circumstances will the Group of the Party of European Socialists let anything stop it from holding talks with potential candidates.
