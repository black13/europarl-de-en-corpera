Madam President, our Group supports Mr Funk's report and I endorse Mr Goepel's statement.
I want to draw attention to another matter, namely that I have the impression that the Committee on Agriculture has become rather more self-assured.
Perhaps that has something to do with the committee of inquiry, which refused to deal with the Commission's proposal which suggests ways of guaranteeing this funding by making cuts in other areas.
Had we rejected this Commission proposal, as suggested by Mr Funk, the Council would still have been able to take a decision, since we have only a consultative role, under Article 43.
Consequently we did not deal with it, which means that the Council cannot implement these proposals or take any other decision.
We shall be involved in this process too.
The Commission will submit a new proposal to us, and then we shall consider how the CAP should evolve.
