Madam President, Mr Liese's suggestion that we should think of the smaller banana producers in Latin America is a sensible one.
We have introduced a similar amendment.
It does not matter too much which one is carried.
But we do not agree with him on the subject of the quota.
Three million tonnes is sheer nonsense.
I am assuming that the committee's proposal will be accepted.
However, it is much more important that the proportions allocated should remain the same with the new quantity.
In the Commission proposal the so-called dollar bananas are granted 70 % (previously 66 %) and the bananas from the other group of countries 26 % (previously 30 %).
What matters here is that, whatever quota is arrived at, the quantities are allocated in the same way as before.
I should like to address the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as follows: Mr Jacob, if this amendment is carried with the same shares as before, it is important for you, as chairman, to proceed to ask the Commission if it will accept this proposal, so that if it does not accept it, we can if necessary ask for the matter to be referred back to the committee; in this way we can force the Commission to engage in negotiations on the way in which the proportions are allocated.
