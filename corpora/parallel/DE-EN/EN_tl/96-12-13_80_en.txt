Mr President, I wish to announce that before the final vote on the legislative resolution I shall ask for the report to be referred back to committee, since I assume that Amendment No 7 will be carried and the Commission has declared that it will not accept Amendment No 7, unless it declares after the vote, when the amendment has been carried, that it will accept it after all.
Then we shall be facing a different situation, but I did not want matters to move so fast that I was unable to intervene.
This is why I am making the announcement now.
