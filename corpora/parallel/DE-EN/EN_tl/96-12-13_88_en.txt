Mr President, I regret that I must contradict Fernández Martín, a fellow member of the PPE Group, but the position with regard to our Group's decision was that we wished to reject the difficult Amendment No 6.
Obviously, therefore, we cannot now support the referral because this amendment will not be accepted by the Commission.
It is sensible for Mr Fischler not to accept the amendment.
Therefore we are voting against the referral.
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to the committee responsible)
