Mr President, I think that under Rule 13 the ballot you just held is not admissible because you influenced the vote.
If we hold a third ballot, we can do so electronically, as we decided.
That is correct.
That is what we decided.
But in the meantime you keep announcing the results of the ballots.
That means that after the results of the first ballot you indirectly influenced the second one.
In a secret ballot - which is what the first and also the second ballots were - all the candidates are elected at the same time and then you announce the results at the end.
So this was not a secret ballot, even if it was electronic.
I think this is a kind of manipulation we cannot accept!
(Applause, mixed reactions)
