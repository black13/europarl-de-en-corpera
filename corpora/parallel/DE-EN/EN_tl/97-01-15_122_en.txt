Mr President-in-Office, I am sorry to say that you have really only replied to Dutch colleagues, although we are after all a European Parliament.
'European' means German, French, Portuguese and so on!
I made a very specific comment on Serbia, and I should like a specific answer from you on Serbia - not only from Mr van den Broek, but also from the President-in-Office of the Council.
Please, Mr President-in-Office, let us hear just a few words, but ones of substance.
