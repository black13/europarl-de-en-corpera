Mr President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was too modest.
This really is an outstanding success, a result of her work of which you are entitled to be proud, and I warmly congratulate her on it.
I shall deal very briefly with two issues which were raised.
Mr Whitehead and others mentioned financial services.
As you know, we have presented a Green Paper on these, which is still being considered in Parliament's committees.
As soon as these discussions have been concluded, we shall of course bring forward proposals, which will also take up what Parliament has contributed to this debate.
As regards what was said by Mr Gollnisch, this proposal does not change the general law.
In other words, on the question of which law applies, the general rules which already exist today are valid.
We do not need to take any further action on them, because they are sufficiently clear.
There is an international convention, and that naturally remains applicable here.
