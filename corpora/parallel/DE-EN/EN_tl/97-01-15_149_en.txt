Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, almost exactly ten months ago, we voted on Parliament's amendments to the 'novel foods' regulation at second reading.
Certainly, not all the amendments which many Members wished to see were adopted.
Nevertheless, I should like to begin today by congratulating Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the creativeness and ingenuity with which she has managed to extract the best possible result for consumers from the proposals that went to the Conciliation Committee.
I think that Parliament can be proud of this outcome, especially when we consider how little we started with.
I should like to make two points concerning labelling.
Firstly, the presence of all genetically modified organisms in foodstuffs, whether derived from an 'agronomic' or any other kind of modification, will now have to be indicated on the label.
This represents a substantial change from the Council's common position.
Secondly, the requirement to label genetically modified ingredients - and note that I refer to ingredients as well as organisms - will be based on proof of their difference from conventional ingredients.
This is a very significant point, since the fact that the list of procedures by which such proof may be furnished is not exhaustive leaves broad scope for development, something which is very important for consumers.
My final point is that Article 14 now provides for the Commission to monitor the long-term impact of the regulation on the development of the internal market, as well as on consumer protection and public health.
This will supply us with a great deal more information on the effects of these novel foods on human beings.
