Mr President, my 80-year-old aunt has assured me that she will never buy genetically modified foods in her life.
My dynamic young nephew, on the other hand, sees these novel foods as providing the ultimate breakthrough to an age when failed crops, food shortages and famines will be brought to an end throughout the world.
The fact that the citizens of Europe will actually have the power to exclude a food from the market-place, simply by not buying it, will be thanks to the European Parliament, if it approves this joint text tomorrow.
Never before have consumers had so great a power; never before will they have been so clearly and comprehensively informed.
No category of genetically modified foods is excluded from the content of the regulation.
Anyone who says otherwise is not telling the truth!
The safety and inspection criteria are clearly set out in the regulation.
Anyone who claims otherwise is not telling the truth!
The regulation specifically provides that producers can advertise their products as being normal foods.
A fascinating contest will develop: a race for the patronage of consumers.
Nobody must be afraid that they will eat genetically modified foods in future, if they do not wish to.
Anyone who claims otherwise is not telling the truth!
However, the human urge to explore cannot be prohibited.
Mankind does not accept closed doors.
All progress involves risks.
People must be protected from those risks.
There can be no compromises in that respect.
But there have always been courageous people who have dared to seek progress, and who have then achieved it.
Genetic engineering represents a revolution in medicine.
Perhaps it can also genuinely help to reduce food shortages and famine.
It would have been monstrous to have done what the Commission and Council were close to doing - simply depriving consumers of choice.
Tomorrow's vote will represent a great moment in the history of this Parliament: a victory by Parliament over the Council and Commission!
