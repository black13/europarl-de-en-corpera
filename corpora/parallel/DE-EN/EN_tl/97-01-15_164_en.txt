Mr President, I shall be very brief.
If it will help matters, I shall withdraw the comment that Mrs Breyer was lying, although it does not appear in the script for my speech.
Nevertheless, I wish to insist on the fact that it is untrue that this regulation will result in a kind of Russian roulette for consumers, and that it is irresponsible propaganda to claim that something better can be secured if the joint text is rejected.
