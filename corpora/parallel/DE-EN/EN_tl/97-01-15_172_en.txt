Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous debate I mistakenly did not use up nearly all my speaking time.
So I hope you will bear with me if I use a little more than my allotted time now.
On the business in hand: more would have been better.
But I think that in the Conciliation Committee we did achieve something for the people who elected us.
Although the original proposal has been improved, there is still one aspect that worries me, however.
The liability thresholds have been set too low.
That means that a financial risk that could under certain circumstances prove to be a question of economic survival is being shifted from the economically stronger to the economically weaker parties.
Fortunately, legislative rules do not apply for ever.
At the appropriate time they can be improved.
And I hope our counterparts in the Council will keep to their word.
They promised in the Conciliation Committee that they will not insist on the 30-month time-limit for implementing the directive, so that where possible it can be incorporated into national legislation everywhere by 1 January 1999.
In the hope that the directive will be reviewed in the near future to provide greater consumer protection, I think we ought to approve the outcome of the conciliation procedure.
