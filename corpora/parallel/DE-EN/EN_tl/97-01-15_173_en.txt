Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which was asked for its opinion, naturally expected the directive to do more to protect consumers.
Yet I approved it in the Conciliation Committee and would now ask Parliament to do the same.
We need a directive on cross-border credit transfers and I hope that as promised the Member States will implement it by 1 January 1999, i.e. on the date of monetary union.
Parliament managed to carry through its demand that the directive should take account of any transfer below ECU 50 000.
That means it covers the majority of transfers to the private sector and the SMEs.
The mandatory refund amount for transfers that are debited from the sender's account but not credited to the receiver's account, namely ECU 12 500, is a compromise that will have to be improved on when the directive is reviewed.
During the conciliation procedure it sometimes seemed as though the Council believed we were still living in the days of the stagecoach and the money was being carried in cash.
It would be most welcome if the banks voluntarily agreed to increase the amount.
