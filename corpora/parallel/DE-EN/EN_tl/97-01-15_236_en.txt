Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is so much agreement about this no doubt quite excellent report by Mr Castricum that I need not take up much of your time.
This report points towards future developments, not just in transport policy but also in relation to the merits of public and private services in general.
A few years ago, people were still talking in terms of 'market versus state' and 'market or state' alternatives.
Today, as this report makes clear, the aim is to find the best combination of market and state in order to provide the best possible services.
Just as it is clear that services must be geared to the market, it is equally clear that this cannot be done entirely without subsidies or public contracts.
This is particularly true in transport, whether urban, regional or cross-frontier.
A few comments on this.
Public undertakings must also realise that they have to produce for a market.
In the past that was not often the case.
Public undertakings have to reform.
Only then can they expect the citizen to accept them.
They have to do their own part too.
Looking at railway undertakings in my own country: they have to make use of the land they own.
They cannot just sit on it and expect that the state, meaning the people, will give them money so that they can pocket the subsidies.
My second point is that the public authorities must respect the principle that the subsides they give should contain incentives; they should reduce the subsidies rather than allow public undertakings to take it as a matter of course that they receive a certain amount of money every year and, they hope, even more the following year.
In that regard the report basically points in the right direction, which could also be set out and defined in an article in the Treaty, although good practice is more important than articles of principle.
If Europe adopts this practice, it will be following the right road.
