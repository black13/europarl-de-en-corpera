Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the third pillar: about what Dublin has achieved so far in that area, and about our expectations for the Intergovernmental Conference.
Our most important project in this respect is Europol.
Everything was agreed in the Maastricht Treaty, then long drawn-out negotiations on the convention caused delays, and now the project has become bogged down in ratification procedures in the national parliaments.
The fact that Europol is not yet operational is scandalous.
Now it is up to the national parliaments to do their best to give Europol a chance to work.
My second point concerns the growing belief that Europol needs to be given power to act on its own initiative.
It would use that power not to displace national police forces, but rather to have optimal scope for action - not as a European FBI, but simply as a European police authority with responsibility for certain serious crimes which have a European dimension.
That is the direction - already mapped out by Parliament - which the Intergovernmental Conference has to take.
My third point is this: we all wish to see substantial sections of the third pillar brought under the Community umbrella.
This applies in particular to asylum and immigration, and quite rightly so.
When borders within Europe disappear, only Community legislation on asylum will be successful.
However, if we take that view, then it is time we made efforts to draft joint asylum legislation.
Practical joint legislation on asylum is therefore the third requirement to emerge from the Dublin summit.
