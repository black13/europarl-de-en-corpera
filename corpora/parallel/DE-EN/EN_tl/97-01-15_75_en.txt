Mr President, in terms of square miles, Ireland is not one the largest Member States of the European Union, but it is a major player in terms of what it has achieved.
John Bruton's government deserves every respect for the high level of commitment and ability and the energetic initiatives which it brought to the Council presidency.
It built conceptual bridges and demanded practical results, instead of issuing the customary high-sounding but insubstantial declarations.
As to whether Dublin's 'performance enhancement' approach also worked in the area of main priority, which is the battle to reduce the figure of 18 million unemployed, it did manage to create a new level of awareness among the Member States and to link a number of measures in order to make them effective.
The measures in question include, firstly, special support for the target groups of the long-term unemployed and unemployed women and young people, involving employment initiatives at local and regional level; secondly, a significant increase in the quality of training and continuing education, to get us in shape for international competition and make us more flexible and mobile; and, thirdly, the implementation of the programmes agreed for SMEs, where sound structures and a capacity for innovation will generate new jobs.
Clearly, we are only at the start of the necessary process of dismantling administrative and fiscal barriers.
I would also comment that Mr Santer's confidence pact has been steadily gaining support.
Rapprochement between the Member States, which was tried successfully in Essen two years ago and has now been documented in the Dublin declaration, is the best way to achieve greater joint responsibility, coordination and cooperation at European level.
There is less reason than ever to oppose a meaningful future Treaty chapter on employment.
