Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr Pronk talked about the European social model and the European system.
I think we must look at that a little more critically.
We are not here to limit ourselves to defending the status quo.
It is true that there is no change without defence, defence against the neo-liberal attempts to seize territory.
But it is equally true that attack is the best form of defence.
We have the opportunity to design the European constitution as one of the basic levels for coordinating the Europeanisation and democratisation of the economy.
That may sound presumptuous, too aggressive for some, too optimistic for others.
But that is the real situation: the neo-liberal offensive in Europe especially is threatening and has started to reduce the effective existence of employees' chances to help shape affairs at the broader level.
That is going too far.
The least that we should decide here to do together is to reverse the current negative force of this process, and Mr Menrad's report is the first step in that process.
But once the reverse force is under way we have no reason to bring it to a halt at the structure stage where it stopped in our national histories.
We should ensure that we really make further progress along the lines of democratising the economy.
If the people who propelled this neo-liberal dynamic force then start to complain, they only have themselves to blame.
