Mr President, the Thomas report has taken a somewhat strange turn.
After it was presented in the Committee on Agriculture some 200 to 220 amendments were tabled.
After that there was a compromise to group these amendments or to withdraw some of them.
What emerged from that is not much of an improvement.
We think it is so patchy that we decided to table a few amendments, especially on the economic utilization side to stress that the forestry sector must have a natural and sustainable development and to ensure that there would be no common market organisation similar to a common agriculture regulation for wood.
In agriculture that has contributed considerably to the destructive developments.
What we want instead is for the EU in a concentrated and limited fashion to secure a market immune to dumping from outside.
We need certification in which ecological criteria are agreed on an international basis and then recognised by the EU so that a wood industry can develop in the EU where the value of wood is economically anchored.
For a long time the price development in the wood sector was so disastrously low that re-afforestation could not be financed by it and repeated subsidies for re-afforestation were given by the EU which were not of course given in other countries.
We cannot transport a disastrous EU price policy to the outside because as we have already seen forests, and rain forests in particular, would be dragged down in its wake.
We need woods in general to survive.
And that is why the EU must deal with this subject matter in an international context and not set up a regulation solely for within the EU.
