Mr President, I want to begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse, for her detailed and excellent report on the strategy towards the Transcaucasian states.
But I specially want to thank her for the historical overview she has given and which, I believe, is most valuable.
It shows clearly that many problems in many regions can only be understood and tackled if they are placed in their historical and also their religious context.
However, let me also point out that I see a hint of politics in this historical overview, especially in the description of the Russian puppet Shevardnadze, who I believe is always painted in too good a light.
Finally, I would like to use my brief speaking to underline the importance of the Transcaucasian region - especially in with regard to its links with its neighbours, in particular Turkey - in terms of our future energy supplies.
We must do our utmost, in the interests of the people of Transcaucasia but also in our own European interests, to seek stability in this region.
