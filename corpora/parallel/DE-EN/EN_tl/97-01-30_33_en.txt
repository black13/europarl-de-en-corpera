Madam President, Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 11 deal with the same problem, and I would like to say a brief word about that.
In the debate on this report there was a certain amount of excitement about the question: Can a terrorist organization be accurately defined?
Is it possible to define accurately what it means?
Mrs Reding commendably accepted this challenge and included a definition in her report, which makes one thing clear - within the rule-of-law community of the European Union there can be no legal protection for terrorist acts or terrorist organizations of any kind whatsoever.
I want to make that completely clear here.
Organizations like the IRA and ETA cannot expect any protection within the European Union on the basis of any law whatsoever.
It was in order to make that clear that these two amendments were introduced.
So I could withdraw my Amendment No 1, because its content is virtually the same as that of Amendment No 11, if we could agree that we could add six more words to the English version of Amendment No 11, adding 'within the meaning of this resolution' after the words '... cooperation with an armed group...' .
That makes it absolutely clear that what I have just said is covered by this report.
Then I can take back No 1 and we could then vote jointly on No 11.
