Madam President, I quite understand that Honourable Members would like to move on.
But as the debate we are holding here at present has caused a great deal of tumult in some Member States, I should like to repeat one sentence: we do not need to make a special point here of saying that a State that is governed by the principles of the rule of law must also observe those principles in its legal organization, no matter who the accused may be.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, too, is well aware of that, and his request to speak was merely for show.
But it is important that we should make this point here: no terrorist and no terrorist organization can derive any political legitimacy from a law...
(The President cut off the speaker)
