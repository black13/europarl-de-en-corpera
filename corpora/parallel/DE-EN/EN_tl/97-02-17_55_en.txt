Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there have been some changes in the nature of structural assistance since the Delors White Paper, which enshrined the concept of 'sustainable development' .
Delors also made it clear that basically regional development must be interpreted more broadly.
More emphasis was accordingly laid on environmental protection and the using structural change as a means of creating new jobs.
Germany wasted this development opportunity.
There they rake in EU resources and pass them on to the Länder via the instrument of Community assistance, following the economic policy model of the 1950s.
Yes, esteemed colleagues, you have understood me correctly.
In Germany the structural funds cannot be used for the same broad spectrum of assistance as has been customary throughout Europe since 1994.
The main victims of this are the five new Länder and because they have no financial reserves they have to rely mainly on what they can assist jointly with the Federal Government.
But the small and medium-sized undertakings have also suffered, which is why so far there are no SMUs in the new Länder, even though assistance has been going on for a long time.
We cannot just let this continue unchecked and should aim now at decisive changes.
I would ask you to that end to support the amendments tabled by the Greens in the European Parliament.
