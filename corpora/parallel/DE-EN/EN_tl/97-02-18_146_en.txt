Mr President, Mr Santer, you have been praised here by one of my colleagues, whom I respect, for making a courageous speech.
Admittedly, the thought did occur to me that he had received the text of a speech from you which you had not given me.
I also listened to you carefully.
Considering that from tomorrow, as is to be hoped, the sword of Damocles will be hanging over you and your Commission in the form of a vote of censure, I found what you said to be no more than a speech of advance notices.
And at no point did you say anything specific, as I should like to illustrate from a number of examples.
For instance, you said that the Commission's services are being reorganized, staff are being reallocated, and there will be changes in posts.
You said for example that there will also be redeployments in positions of responsibility within the Directorate-General for Agriculture, involving individuals who have held responsibilities in the past and who are still working.
Is that what you announced?
You said that the budgetary resources would be examined so that Mrs Bonino can actually do the work which she will no doubt perform extremely well.
What do you mean by examined?
How is she to do the work if you do not give an assurance that the budgetary resources will be made available?
You said at another point - I am sorry, now I have intruded on the territory of the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and so with great regret I take that sentence back, but you and Mr Samland know what I mean - but we do not need lip-service, what we need apart from a transfer of responsibilities is a transfer of money - cash, to put it quite bluntly.
You said elsewhere that Mrs Bonino was to be involved in the legislation.
That would be excellent - nothing would have more support from me.
But did you say, for example, how you intend to deal with something as simple as the dispute over the paper on future food policy, which the Commission announced over a year ago and which we are still waiting to see?
And why are we still waiting for it?
Because the Commission cannot decide between Mr Bangemann, Mr Fischler and Mrs Bonino.
I shall tell you how you should decide, and you can announce this here today, Mr Santer!
This belongs to Mrs Bonino!
She handles consumer policy, she represents the interests of consumers, more so than Mr Fischler has so far - with apologies to him - and in any event more than Mr Bangemann does.
So say something specific to us on that, Mr Santer!
You said that a food agency is under consideration, a kind of FDA.
You have often said this.
You have already said it on other occasions in a similar way: it will be considered!
I do listen to you with some degree of attention, Mr Santer.
It may not always be an undiluted pleasure to do so, but I do it all the same.
You have already said this before.
So do something about it!
Do something and say to us: we shall set up an FDA, a Food and Drug Agency or a Food Agency.
Do it!
We have been calling for this for a long time here in Parliament.
As you will be aware, Parliament is generally light years ahead of the Commission, and that applies here as well.
You said at another point that at the Intergovernmental Conference, you would support a change in the legal basis for the agriculture sector from Article 43 to Article 100a, and that you would support a separate legal basis for health policy.
I know that you will only be able to persuade the Heads of Government to accept this with the backing of your own institution, and with our support.
So please first try to persuade your own colleagues!
Persuade Mr Fischler that Article 43 is not the right legal basis, and also Mr Bangemann.
Above all, please persuade Mr Flynn that we need a separate legal basis for health policy.
During the investiture of the Commission, he denied that there was any such need when answering a question from me on the subject in the relevant committee.
Please do that, Mr Santer, and also tell us exactly what you have in mind on these issues.
Tell us also, Mr Santer, how you intend to change the common agricultural policy.
Tell us here and now that you will support, in principle, the idea of subsidies now only being granted for quality, and no longer for quantity; that from 1998, the budget will be framed differently, in conjunction with ourselves and the Council.
Say that to us!
These are all specific things which you could have said.
If you had said just two things from this whole list, I would have been satisfied and grateful.
But you did not do so.
Do a favour for us, Mr Santer: you have brought a gentle breath of air into the Chamber and sent a light breeze through it; try to raise a proper storm for once, one which really blows through the minds of your fellow Commissioners and those of the Council of Ministers.
That is really what we need!
