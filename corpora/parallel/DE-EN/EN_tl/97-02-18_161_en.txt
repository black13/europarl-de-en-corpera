Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to concentrate on three points.
Firstly, of course, the relationship of trust between many Members of the House and the Commission has been shattered.
However, the most important thing has to be that political conclusions are actually drawn from this whole scandal, that reforms are introduced.
Here I would like to address Mr Fischler personally as the Agriculture Commissioner.
I sometimes have the impression that you are in a rather protected position, because there is no vote of censure on individual Members of the Commission.
But you will be judged on whether you do two things now.
And these are my second and third points.
It will not do for a country or a government to cause enormous damage and then not to have to pay for it.
A great deal of money has been spent on repairing the damage.
This must be retrieved - if necessary through an action before the European Court of Justice.
That is very important.
And there is another point on which you should be focusing, as Mr Santer also said in his speech: the principal mistake in this series of events was a misguided agricultural policy.
And you are responsible, Mr Fischler, for seeing that a change takes place here, a move away from an industrial agricultural policy and towards an ecological policy.
You will be judged on that basis, and we shall link the question of censure to that point.
