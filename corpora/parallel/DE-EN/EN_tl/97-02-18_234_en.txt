Mr President, I have two brief supplementaries to put to the Commissioner.
Firstly, would it be possible for there to be a survey across all the programmes within your remit which take account of Parliament's concerns about minority languages?
After all, this issue affects a very large number of people in the European Union.
Catalan can hardly be called a minority language; it is one of the more widely used languages.
Secondly, we have approved the supplementary protocols to the association agreements which allow Socrates and other similar programmes to be extended to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
I was the rapporteur on this, and I should like to ask the Commissioner to what extent the protocols have now been implemented, and with what degree of success.
