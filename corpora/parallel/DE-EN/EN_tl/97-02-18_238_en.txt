Thank you for your comments, Mrs Cresson.
I see in practice the extent of the problems involved in implementing the excellent Leonardo programme.
However, I think it is extremely important that every possible resource should be harnessed to allow the transfer of innovation, to facilitate mobility, further training and education for trainees, because this measure also has the potential to prevent unemployment - and that is such a serious problem for us.
I am glad, therefore, that there is a commitment to act, and that you too realize where the problems are.
I am also aware of some additional problems, because in practice it is difficult even to set up an exchange of information between companies which are prepared to participate in the mobility programme, to organize exchanges of trainees and instructors between one country and another.
In practice, I also encounter major problems on the question of whether to count the exchange period as holiday time or as part of a period of training.
Can you see any possible means of removing these additional barriers too?
