The supplementary question introduces nothing new.
I have already explained that we began by agreeing with the industry, including the Greek industry, that we had 19 million tonnes of overcapacity.
Overcapacity causes problems.
It puts pressure on prices.
Even extremely competitive companies were recording losses.
Four years ago, virtually no one was still earning enough to cover their costs.
Therefore, our main problem was how to eliminate the excess capacity.
We did not decide where capacity reductions were to take place.
The Commission did not take it upon itself to say that this or that amount of capacity had to be cut in Greece or France or Germany.
The industry itself made those decisions, on the basis of competitiveness.
I am sorry if the Greek steel industry in particular was not sufficiently competitive in this respect to withstand the competition from other countries, but if it is the task of the Commission to see that the same conditions apply throughout the Union, then obviously it cannot make exceptions.
We cannot allow state subsidies in Greece just because the steel industry there wishes to maintain jobs.
If we did so, jobs in the UK, France or Germany would have to be lost.
We have an overall responsibility.
We take that responsibility seriously, and it is up to each company to see that it remains competitive.
I cannot make any special allowances for a Greek company.
