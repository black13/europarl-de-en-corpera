Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to oppose the use of urgent procedure.
The Council began by taking some months to complete its deliberations, without any regard for the decisions of this House; it then high-handedly amended the programme as it saw fit; and finally it asked the Legal Service to clear up any procedural questions.
The response of the Legal Service was to issue a warning: it told the Council to consult Parliament again because the proposed amendments were so far-reaching.
This is not the proper way to proceed.
I think that the committee must carry out a fundamental re-examination of the issue.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
