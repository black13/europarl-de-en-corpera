Just one comment, Mrs Bonino.
You more or less accused our committee of having taken too long.
First of all, it takes several months before a committee receives the relevant documents.
You mentioned that we have also received the draft directive on guarantees for consumer goods.
I wanted to introduce it in committee in March, but when I had had the paper for four weeks, the Commission ordered a cost-benefit analysis.
That is fine, but I should not then be blamed at some future date for not working.
A word on baby food: I would recommend that you check whether, apart from the Baby Food Directive, there is an appendix somewhere with maximum pesticide levels.
If I remember rightly, that has never been done.
We have no European specifications.
