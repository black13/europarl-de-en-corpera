Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the arrogance of many men - and I would like to make it clear that I mean many, and not all - is quite unmistakable, even in this House.
To say that equality is possible if we simply make everything absolutely equal in legal terms is really so arrogant that one can hardly comprehend it.
All the things we are discussing here - curriculum vitae, employment structure, the world of work, the conditions governing appointment and promotion - all these things are based on the lives and experiences of men.
And they say to us, in all seriousness, ' Yes ladies, all you have to do is to become like us men, and then you too will have equal opportunities' .
Do they seriously believe that that is what we want, that we do not want to carry on being ourselves?
Surely that is not true!
Really that cannot be true!
The family is a valuable thing, it is true, but it is not everything.
We should not forget that the family is not, in fact, the norm, or the universally applicable way of life in our society.
It is becoming less and less so.
And a family does not mean having a marriage certificate.
Family means people with children, and what does a marriage certificate have to do with that?
It is a question of living together, of being together, and that is what has to be taken into consideration, regardless of whether the people who are living together are of different sexes or the same sex.
There is no reason why these people should be disadvantaged merely because they say quite openly, ' I live as I am, and I would like to have the same opportunities and the same options as other people' .
There is no reason why we should deviate from the basic principles that we have already adopted here in the European Parliament.
We adopted these, as Mr Ullmann has just said, as long ago as February 1994.
