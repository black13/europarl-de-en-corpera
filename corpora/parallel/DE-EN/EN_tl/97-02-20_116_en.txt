Madam President, the continuing civil war in eastern Zaire will plunge the population even deeper into their appalling suffering.
It is always the civilian population that bears the impact of such suffering - the women, the children, the old men, the young.
The latest news tells us that not only has the government of Zaire been hiring mercenaries, but that there has been widespread rape of women and girls.
We should help to find a political solution.
What form might that solution take?
We must support the UN's initiatives.
The latest initiative by Nelson Mandela makes sense; he says that a solution lies in Africa itself, and that we should support it with technological and financial resources.
There is a need for an action plan for humanitarian aid for southern Africa.
The mercenaries must be pulled out.
The first thing we can do to help is to look at the situation in our own countries.
Here, close by, we have the Foreign Legion.
That is an example of a mercenary force which is being sent out there, isn't it?
We must ensure that such things no longer happen, that we support the War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda, and that this has a deterrent effect.
Nor should we abandon our development policy.
If we have budget cuts here, the money for civilian development will be lacking.
And, finally: an immediate stop must be put to such things as weapons coming from Germany and, as rumour has it, the police equipment for a dictator like Mobutu being provided by German political institutes.
That is a major contribution to peace.
