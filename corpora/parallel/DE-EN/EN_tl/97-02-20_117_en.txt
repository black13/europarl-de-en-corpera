Madam President, if I may I should like to clear up that last point immediately.
Mr Telk√§mper refers to rumour.
We should not stoop to peddle rumours in this chamber.
If an attempt is made, in a country where such tragic events are taking place, to help with the training of security forces so that they can develop into civilian police forces, without the institutes being responsible for arming them, then I believe that, too, represents a contribution to achieving the objectives this House would like to see achieved.
But now for the subject of today's motion.
The catalogue of disasters at this time in the part-session has become almost a matter of routine.
Time after time, too, we hear that the action taken has produced no effect.
So I regard it as an absolute necessity to come up with a different kind of action.
If the problem of the overcrowded refugee camps cannot be solved, if it is impossible to achieve what Mrs Ogata has called for - the disarming of the militia in the camps - then the question arises of whether we should not direct our efforts towards decentralizing those camps, making it impossible for so many militia men to find concealment among 200, 000 refugees, and for bandits to pursue their flourishing arms trade there.
We constantly hear - it happened again in this presidency's paper - words like 'concerned' , ' demands' , ' condemns' .
Those words have not solved any problems yet.
Europe, too, must finally get its act together and send troops, a military force to safeguard humanitarian rights.
And when we come to debate Mr Fassa's report in due course, we shall find that same demand expressed by the Committee on Development.
And I hope that this approach will enable us to enforce the law, instead of just demanding it.
