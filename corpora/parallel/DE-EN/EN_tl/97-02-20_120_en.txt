Madam President, I should like to raise a point of order pursuant to Rule 108.
Since Mrs GÃ¼nther reacted to what I said, I should once again like to emphasize expressly that I did not imply that the Hans Seidel Institute was involved in the training of the police force of the dictator Mobutu or helping to arm that police force.
