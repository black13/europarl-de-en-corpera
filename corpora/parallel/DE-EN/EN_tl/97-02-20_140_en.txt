I should just like to remind the House of three cases of particular interest to the Green Group.
In all these cases the European Parliament has adopted appropriate resolutions, and I should like to urge the Council most strongly to emphasize those resolutions in Geneva.
First, Colombia.
Following Parliament's resolution of October 1996, the consequences of which included the resignation of the Colombian Ambassador in Brussels, Mr Marulanda, the murders of dispossessed farmers and attacks on the human rights movement have actually increased.
This is an area in which the United Nations must now take action.
Secondly, Nigeria.
Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian Nobel laureate, was until yesterday a guest of Parliament.
He vehemently stated the case for an economic boycott, and especially an oil boycott, against General Abacha's military regime.
This demand must be taken up by the UN commissions, because only the UN can impose this kind of international boycott.
Thirdly, Turkey.
The Turkish government, supported in some places by Europeans, has so far always been able to avoid condemnation by the UN Human Rights Commission.
But the human rights situation in Turkey has not improved by one iota.
The EU must finally abandon all its misguided diplomatic considerations and make it its primary concern to condemn these human rights violations in its own back yard, especially against the Kurdish people.
That is our request to the Council, and we call upon it to act as a matter of urgency.
