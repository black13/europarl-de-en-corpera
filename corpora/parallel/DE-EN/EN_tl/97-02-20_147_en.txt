Mr President, not a week goes by without news of further human rights violations in Iran.
Two such cases have made headlines just recently.
The press was still discussing the arrest of the writer Sarkouhi, who publishes one of the few critical periodicals left in Iran.
Then came word that a private foundation in Iran had increased the bounty on Salman Rushdie.
The Bahai, trade union members and women are being threatened by the fundamentalists.
The government is arresting people.
So where is the dividing line in this case between governmental authority and religious fanaticism?
This Iranian government is supposedly concerned to improve relations with Europe, but how does it actually imagine that such relations are to be established, and on what basis?
Our wish for the Iranian people is that respect for the international principles of human rights will finally re-establish contact between our peoples.
The European Council stated its position clearly on the anniversary of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie.
But when he criticizes the EU, he should be aware that only an international community like the European Union can provide sanctuary.
Many other people, too, in Iran are suffering from the acts of the Iranian regime; death threats and terrorist attacks outside the country cannot be ruled out.
Mr Newens referred just now to the German case.
We in this Parliament stand up for human rights, freedom of religion and opinion, the rule of law and democracy, and we will ensure that Iran is not in any doubt about that.
