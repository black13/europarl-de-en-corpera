Mr President, I welcome the fact that after so many attempts and such a long lapse of time we can once again discuss the case of Mordecai Vanunu in this House.
As Mr Crampton just said, we have passed three previous resolutions and we have achieved nothing.
I believe the European Union and the Israeli government, too, have a duty to take action on behalf of this person.
We should ask the Israeli government to show clemency by ordering an early release for Mordecai Vanunu.
What did he do?
He told the Sunday Times something that everybody now knows - what Israel's nuclear potential is.
If we go to Israel we can talk about the country's nuclear weapons capability, we can talk about his arrest - there are no problems with that.
The fact that he was abducted, that this is now part of history, that he was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment under conditions incompatible with the rule of law, and that ten years of that term have now passed - this must prompt us all to do everything in our power to release this man from his solitary confinement.
I believe that our Committee on Human Rights should concern itself with this situation and should call upon our governments to take action in this matter, because solitary confinement is a barbarity.
He has no contact with the outside world, except for his brother, and that is a thing we deplore in any state where such a thing can happen.
The least that the State of Israel should do is to hold him under humane conditions, and to ensure that his relatives can visit him and that he can take exercise.
But I believe that after 10 years and now that there is really no longer any charge against him - secret services use means that are much crueller, much more terrible, and as for the information on nuclear weapons, we all know that anyway - there really is no reason to continue holding him at all.
So this House calls upon Israel to show clemency.
