Don't worry, Mr President, I don't intend to re-open the debate.
But I did ask the Commissioner a question, and I asked him politely, and so I would like an answer.
What is the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties and also as the guardian of the association agreement between the European Union and Turkey, going to do about the introduction of visas for children and compulsory residence permits for the children of immigrants, for about 600, 000 Turkish children?
In my view it is incompatible with the provisions of the association agreement.
That's what I asked you, and I would like an answer.
