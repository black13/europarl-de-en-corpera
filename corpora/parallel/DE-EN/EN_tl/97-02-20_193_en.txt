Mr President, it was clear to everyone here that I was not criticizing Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's group.
All I said was that I can read Mr Le Pen like a book and Mr Berthu like a paperback, a reference to their intellectual capacities.
If that is an insult to the entire group, I can only beg for leniency!
