Mr President, I have a comment on the Minutes.
On page 18 of the German version, Item 16 (' Union policy towards Algeria' ) the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists mentions my name.
I am not supporting this motion.
Furthermore, I informed the services that I was withdrawing my signature.
