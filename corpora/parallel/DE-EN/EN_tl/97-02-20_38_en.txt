Mr President, since this is an unusual procedure, we need to be absolutely clear about what we are voting on.
The question is whether mobile telephony should be included in this Directive or not.
That is a very fundamental matter, and so we will be voting yes or no on this question.
I believe that the voting procedure should be made absolutely clear, so that all of us really are certain about what point we are voting on.
