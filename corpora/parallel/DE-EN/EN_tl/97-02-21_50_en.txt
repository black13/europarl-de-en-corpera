Mr President, in this Parliament, I am one of those who belong to the Working Party on Hunting, and I also represent the protection of animals, because I am convinced that a true huntsman, a true hunter, is also a protector of animals at the same time.
As such a man, I should like to thank Mr Collins with all my heart, for having brought up the question of these inhumane traps again.
I have been a Member of this Parliament for 18 years now, and I can tell you that this has been going on throughout the whole of that time, and I regret to have to say that on the Commission's side there have repeatedly been manoeuvres to postpone and obscure the issue, so that it has not been possible for us finally to take a clear decision.
We have, admittedly, taken some decisions, but then these have not been implemented, for which various excuses have been given.
Here I should like to place special emphasis on one point in particular: there has been a lot of reference to humane traps.
Perhaps it is possible to make such traps, but the sort of traps that are currently described as humane, at least in the press, are almost as inhumane as the previous kind.
The fact that you cover the traps with a bit of rubber makes no difference at all to an animal's legs.
The tragedy is that the animals, especially in Canada, sometimes have to live in the traps for days, in horrific circumstances.
I believe, therefore, that we have an absolute duty to make the Commission seriously aware of the fact that now, finally, we want to see actions, not words.
What I mean is that we should not go to New Orleans, and heaven only knows where else, but that we should finally take action, on our side.
I know that there is major resistance, but then resistance exists in order to be overcome.
I would therefore ask the Commission - and I have also just agreed with the BÃ¶ge motion, because I considered it right to issue it with an ultimatum - to pay attention, because our patience is slowly running out.
