Mr President, I should like to say that I am totally opposed to Mr Lannoye's motion, not because it is not justified rhetorically, but because it will simply mean ruining Friday as a working day.
We were elected to serve our constituents, regardless of whether they are many or few in number.
Here at least, quality is a substitute for quantity.
We have often found this to be the case, and I would therefore ask Members to vote against it whatever happens.
I should like to thank the President for having said the same thing.
Friday is just as much a working day as any other.
