Madam President, I am not referring directly to the Minutes, but rather to the verbatim report of proceedings for Wednesday.
In that report, the inadequate answer given by the Council to my supplementary question to Mr Sj√∂stedt has been reproduced correctly, and the comment I made later with reference to the Rules of Procedure is also correct.
However, the actual question that I asked has mysteriously disappeared, and has been replaced by a question that I put to the Irish Council Presidency last year.
I just wanted to point out that this means that in some mysterious way parts of the verbatim report of proceedings for December have found their way into the verbatim report of proceedings for February, namely Wednesday.
