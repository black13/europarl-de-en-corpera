Mr President, I too should like to express my thanks, and my belief that you were right to react immediately because the whole incident really was quite incredible.
The European Parliament conducted an intensive debate on racism and xenophobia, and then did something that sets it apart from a good many governments: instead of confining itself to formal declarations, it actually expressed unwelcome criticism, directed not just at the Debré draft law but also at the plans announced by the German Interior Minister, Mr Kanther, to introduce visas for children.
So the European Parliament did what it is supposed to do - a political act.
The reaction of the French Government in saying first that questions of human rights and fundamental freedoms within the European Union are a matter of internal affairs, as Mr Chirac and Mr Hervé de Charette stated, and secondly that the European Parliament has shown that it is superfluous, is completely unacceptable to us.
My view is that by adopting this resolution the European Parliament showed that it is anything but superfluous - that it is capable of a political reaction and of doing more than just coining formal phrases.
I would like to ask you, too, whether there has been any reaction from the French Government.
Has there been any kind of apology for what the Foreign Minister said?
I think an apology is the least that could have been expected.
Has Mr Chirac commented at all on his remarks?
If you have heard of any such developments, I hope you will let us know.
