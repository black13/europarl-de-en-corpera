Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after all this criticism I am going to take up the cudgels on behalf of the Schengen Agreements.
The Schengen process is functioning in Europe, which is more than you can say of most institutions.
It has brought specific advances in freedom of movement, meaning that the citizen has acquired the opportunity to experience Europe.
Many citizens can now travel straight through from Finland to Portugal without stopping, even though there may well still be room for improvement in certain details.
So this is a positive result, and, incidentally, one that makes it clear that something can be achieved through flexibility in Europe by allowing some to move forward rather more rapidly than might have been the original common intention.
That is a clearly positive signal for Europe.
When Mr Schulz complains that any beef steer can wander across borders unobserved and unchecked, but he himself has to show his passport, the perfectly reasonable explanation for that is that Mr Schulz is clearly not a beef steer and so must expect to be checked from time to time.
Apart from the abolition of the internal borders, Schengen also of course includes improving the security of the external borders - and not just as a defence against crime, especially organized crime, but also as a defence against a second problem which weighs heavy on many European States, the problem of illegal immigration.
Here again, Schengen has brought progress.
The Schengen Information System gives us, for the first time, efficient co-operation between police forces, and it may become apparent that such co-operation has more to offer than checks at the internal borders.
Overall, therefore, we are in favour of this process and we want to see it continue.
