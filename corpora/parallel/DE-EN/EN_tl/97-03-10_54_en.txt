Mr President, for me, Schengen is an instrument which effectively combines security with freedom of movement.
Anyone who only wants freedom of movement has obviously failed to understand Schengen as an instrument of security for the citizens of Europe.
Anyone who says no to police checks, no to the inclusion of undesirables in the Schengen Information System or no to the ruling on third countries has not understood Schengen.
Similarly, anyone who dismisses Schengen as an instrument to counter immigration has also failed to understand it.
What we need is a security instrument, and that is what Schengen offers.
Anyone who assembles an antiSchengen package in the form of a motion like this or a report like this must ultimately expect these proposals - which are directed against public security - to be rejected.
