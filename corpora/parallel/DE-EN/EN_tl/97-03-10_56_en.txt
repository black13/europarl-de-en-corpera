Mr President, Mr Nassauer has just been kind enough to refer to me.
I should like to repeat once again what he said.
I had mentioned the fact that cattle can travel unsupervised in the European Union, while I have to produce my passport.
Mr Nassauer saw fit to observe that all this means is that the border guards take note of the fact that I am not a beef steer!
My thanks for the compliment.
At the same time, Mr Nassauer pointed out that he is apparently one of those who can travel unchecked from Finland to Portugal.
If I have to show my passport because I am not a beef steer, I should like to know what the border guards think Mr Nassauer is to excuse him from showing his passport!
