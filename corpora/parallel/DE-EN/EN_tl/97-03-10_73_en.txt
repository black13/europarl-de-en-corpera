Mr President, I should like to turn the spotlight briefly on flexibility.
We all know that the working world has changed completely in recent years.
We can assume that most of those who are now going out to work for the first time will have to retrain three, four or five times.
In other words, flexibility is an absolute must, and lifelong learning - constant relearning - is a necessity.
Only those who really do offer that flexibility and are willing to learn more and relearn will have really good prospects of staying in work.
What politicians can contribute here is assistance to enable the individual to achieve this flexibility.
I believe that the European Union has done a good job here with the range of educational and mobility programmes it offers, such as LEONARDO or SOCRATES or all the programmes to be implemented in connection with the Structural Funds, such as LEADER or YOUTH START or NEW and so on.
All this is important as a way of giving the individual in the job market a real chance to absorb education and experience genuine mobility.
I believe these programmes are also needed because that same mobility helps to transfer innovations between the many small and medium-sized enterprises.
But the big problems that exist when it comes to implementing all this lie in the fact that there are major obstacles in, for example, the mutual recognition of diplomas awarded as a result of training in the various Member States.
Problems also arise with user information, and with the wide variety of national rules.
It is unclear, for example, what counts as paid holiday and what counts as working time, or what allowance is made for training.
What we need, therefore, is a package of measures from the Commission to ensure that all these barriers are pulled down as quickly as possible so that these programmes can help us to pursue an active employment market policy in the interests of those concerned.
