Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Sue Waddington for her excellent report, which as well as being highly detailed has also pointed out the weaknesses in Mrs Cresson's White Paper.
The debate in recent months has demonstrated the need to modernize all Europe's educational systems and make them more attractive and more European for pupils, teachers and instructors.
This calls for honest analysis in the Member States and effective action there and at European level.
The OECD has ascertained that public spending on education since 1974 has declined steadily, especially in the Member States of the European Union.
I now want to concentrate on a few points relating to vocational training.
Equivalence with university education, for example, is not a reality in any Member State and is apparently useful only for soapbox oratory.
Action in this area is very urgently needed for the future of Europe as a business centre.
In ten years' time, 80 % of today's technology and know-how will be obsolete.
And by as early as 2005 or 2006 Germany, at any rate, will be short of qualified skilled workers.
There is a need for modern vocational profiles, which are receptive to new developments and new forms of work organization.
More importance needs to be attached to key qualifications such as social skills, capacity for team work, and overall social thinking which includes responsibility for the environment.
New technologies have certainly been neglected in the past.
I myself have worked for 20 years in the high-tech sector, though, and I would also utter a word of warning against overestimating them.
Fundamental knowledge can only be learned in direct exchanges between teachers and pupils, and that is the only way in which complex structures can be made comprehensible and relationships identified and explored.
So let us not have either-or, but the co-existence of learning and teaching wherever possible.
