Mr President, Commissioner, the amendment to Directive 92/14 represents part of our efforts to achieve greater compatibility between air transport and environmental protection.
It seems logical that, when environmental factors are taken into account, technical feasibility, and the economic consequences too, must result in exemptions, but care is needed to ensure that these exemption arrangements are not abused.
The Group of the European People's Party therefore welcomes the Commission's proposal and all the rapporteur's proposed amendments, partly because they clarify terms such as 'air carrier' and 'operating licence' , which previously led to misunderstandings.
We also agree with the deletion of the aeroplanes from Saudi Arabia.
Quite apart from the fact that, for the purposes of the Directive, the exemptions are not supposed to result in everincreasing numbers, the way the exemption should be looked at in this case is that the term 'developing nation' is difficult to reconcile with these privately owned aircraft.
The Group of the European People's Party also welcomes the fact that the terms 'leasing' and 'subleasing' are explained in more explicit terms, so that more can be done to prevent them.
The procedure is simplified by the introduction of a committee, though we consider it important that this refers only to deletions and that further additions to the exemption arrangements should still be a matter for consultation with the Council and Parliament.
The Group of the European People's Party will therefore vote for this report and all the amendments, and hopes that the Commission and Council will accept the amendments because in our view they all conform to the spirit of the Directive - a healthy compromise between environmental protection, or noise abatement in this instance, technological feasibility and economic consequences for genuine developing nations.
