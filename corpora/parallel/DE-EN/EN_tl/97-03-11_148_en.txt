Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too consider Mrs Morgan's report an excellent one, especially the section concerning technical and educational questions.
However, one problem of concern to Austria is being rather overlooked.
We have a nationalized telephone system.
In Austria it is up to the state to ensure that every pupil and every student obtains access to this information society.
This relates even to minor problems, such as a second home telephone line that does not cost more than an ordinary family can afford.
We are running the risk of producing a two-tier society of pupils and students, which conflicts with the old idea of general and free compulsory schooling.
If the state insists on continuing to control the telephone system, we must make it clear that we are living in a historic time in which the state has the responsibility to ensure that all pupils and students have the same access to learning and studying.
