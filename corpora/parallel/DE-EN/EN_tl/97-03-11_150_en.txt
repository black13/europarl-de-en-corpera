Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the own-initiative report very important, for it emphasizes my view that culture and education are a major factor of innovation and growth in the new environment of the information society and that great importance must therefore be attached to them in the shaping of this society.
On no account must the new means of communication be looked at independently of the information that is transmitted.
The aspect of educational quality is fundamental, especially in regard to the introduction of the new technologies in the educational field.
It is also important to discuss the new concepts of teaching and learning methods.
Firstly, the teachers need to be trained adequately.
They have to learn to change their traditional role as sources of knowledge and make more and more use of the new technologies in their teaching and help the pupils to learn how to choose, so that they take a critical approach to the material transmitted to them.
Of course it is also vital to have continuous and intensive further training of teachers.
But this message goes to parents too.
They form the basis of our society, so that acceptance of the new technologies and the concept of the information society, and thus their success or failure, largely depends on them.
So I am strongly in favour of virtual parental education and of the creation and development of virtual libraries; indeed I have proposed a project of this kind to STOA.
The aspect of lifelong learning is also very important.
The information society relies less and less on material resources and energy, but far more on human know-how.
I agree with the rapporteur that in the past the Commission's measures to promote various multimedia projects were too diffuse and often confusing for the applicants.
I therefore welcome the Commission's educational multimedia joint call, which is finally coordinating the various programmes more closely and therefore making them look more user friendly.
