Mr President, although the laboratory directive was not adopted until 1990 and has not yet been transposed in many Member States, the Commission has already made a proposal providing for massive deregulation and a drop in environmental and safety standards.
Let me refer to two points.
We need liability for the environment and for human beings, and here I would quite openly ask the Commissioner why the scientists themselves should not be held more responsible?
If the situation is as the industry and science promise us, namely that biotechnology is safe, why are they so vehemently against liability?
Secondly, authorization once a specified period of time has elapsed.
I think it is totally irresponsible for authorization to be given on expiry of a certain period of time and for that period to be reduced from 60 to 45 days!
Surely it is absurd that I have to wait longer for authorization to park my bicycle in a certain place than for the authorization of a research laboratory working with pathogenic, genetically manipulated organisms.
We do not need lower environmental and safety standards; what we need is more environmental standards, more safety and above all more transparency!
