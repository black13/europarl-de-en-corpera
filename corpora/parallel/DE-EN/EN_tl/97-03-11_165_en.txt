Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, technology strides on, new findings mean that laws have to be adapted.
And that is a good thing.
But presumably it will remain a secret on what experience the Commission is basing itself here.
The development of this technology and the associated research has to go on for more than a mere five or six years before we can gain an overview of the possible results of the use of genetically modified micro-organisms.
For that is how brief our experience is with the directive before us.
That is why I consider two amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection most important.
Once concerns information to the public.
In the name of democracy and transparency, the safety measures must be made known.
In this area, public information is the real guarantee of safety.
So it is not enough for the public only to have access to information on emergency plans.
The information must actively be provided to the public.
That is one demand.
The second amendment is based on our recent experience with the Commission; I am thinking, for instance, of the authorization of genetically modified maize.
This experience shows that we have to set very tight limits to the area where the Commission can make major changes and take major decisions by itself.
That is why it is very important to set very narrow limits to comitology.
That is the second major amendment we tabled.
Nevertheless I have serious doubts whether the necessary safety will actually be guaranteed even if all the amendments are accepted.
The future will tell, and I hope the story will not be a sad one.
