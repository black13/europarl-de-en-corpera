This directive has two objectives, firstly the safe use of genetically modified microorganisms and secondly to stimulate biotechnology research.
The Commission's proposals need to be improved in two main areas: firstly in relation to damage liability, as has been said.
Anyone working with genetically modified micro-organisms must be liable for any damage that may occur if they are released.
Here I take a quite different view from Mrs Heinisch.
Secondly, there is the question of the legislative processes.
Parliament must not be deprived of its right of codetermination in relation to any changes to the scope of this directive.
That applies to Annexes I and II of the directive.
For these are not, as might appear at first glance, technical rules but concern the core of the directive, namely safety.
It did not help us in trying to assess the Commission proposal that the Commission's general report on the application of the directive is still not available.
Mrs Bjerregaard, you should see to it that it is made available.
In its reply to my written question the Commission announces that it will present its report at an unspecified date in the course of 1997.
According to the directive it should have presented it last year.
I hope that with its proposed speeding up of the authorization procedures, the Commission will in future also provide the required information to the public and the European Parliament more quickly and at least keep to the prescribed time-limits, i.e., penalize the Member States suitably for any delays in transposing the legislation.
In view of its negligence in relation to BSE, I think it is all the more necessary to draw the Commission's attention to these renewed delays.
