Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I have to put another question.
It is important both to Mr Bowe and to myself to know your position, Commissioner, on liability.
You said very little on Amendments Nos 28 and 30.
You said you agree with both me and Mr Bowe, but also with Mrs Heinisch.
That is a major contradiction.
We had asked you specifically whether you believe there should be more selfresponsibility in relation to this science?
That would mean assuming liability.
Anything else, Commissioner, would mean indirect subsidies.
I would like your position on that too.
Last point: I cannot understand how you can say that transparency and access to information would infringe an interinstitutional agreement.
We have the environmental information directive and you are bound to take account of it.
So I really would urgently ask you to answer these two questions.
They are quite elementary and the credibility of biotechnology is at stake here.
