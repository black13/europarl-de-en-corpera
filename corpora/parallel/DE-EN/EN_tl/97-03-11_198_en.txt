Commissioner, thank you very much for your answer, but I would like to put a practical question.
There are still difficulties today, especially in countries bordering on others where there is genuine misery.
Would it not perhaps be useful for the Commission to try to come to a general agreement at least with the states that have already applied for membership of the European Union, in other words with the 11 states that really do want relations with us?
We need a general agreement that also covers the question of transit in the various states where there really is misery - Romania for instance - so that we can resolve this problem, for to act through embassies takes a very long time and is very bureaucratic.
Muchas graçias, Señor Presidente!
