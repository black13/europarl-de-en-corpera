Mr President, Commissioner, are you aware that the Committee of the Regions' working group on agriculture has also drawn attention to this problem and that the ministers of agriculture of various regions are now also addressing the Commission on this question?
The first cormorants appeared here, in this area on the central Upper Rhine, in 1973.
In the late 1970s there were 10 pairs.
Now there are 20 000.
Are any further studies needed here given that fishermen and anglers are already on the streets to draw attention to their problems?
Should we not take joint action here and consider culling the stock to a reasonable level?
Your answer seems rather hesitant to me.
