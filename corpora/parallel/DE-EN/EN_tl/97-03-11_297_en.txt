Mr President, I should just like to ask one question, and at the same time I must apologize, because we could not hear very clearly over here, so I only think I understood what the President-inOffice of the Council was saying.
My question is as follows.
Is there really any point in speculating about what will happen in Sweden in the year 1999?
As far as I know, elections are due to be held between now and then and, to judge by current public opinion, there is likely to be a change in the majority, in which case the whole thing would be invalidated.
It would be better to cross that bridge when we come to it.
