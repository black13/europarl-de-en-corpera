In my opinion, Mr President, your answer is completely unsatisfactory.
You say that there are no constructive proposals.
But from whom?
In my opinion, these constructive proposals are lacking on the part of the Council, and certainly not on the part of the European Parliament!
We have already, on many occasions, given our opinion on the problem of driftnets.
In the past, we have always prohibited them - quite rightly - because public opinion, which is what we represent here, regards the protection of marine creatures and the maintaining of the ecological balance as being threatened by these nets.
The fishing industry also means safeguarding people's economic and social living conditions.
However, we must be extremely careful here, particularly at a time when those areas where fishery resources are available are experiencing losses.
The use of driftnets brings with it two negative consequences.
First of all there is the problem that when driftnets are used the species to be caught cannot be selected.
In addition, sea creatures are senselessly killed by these so-called 'ghost nets' .
Even if we have to make a distinction between the fishing problems in the North Pacific, the South Pacific, the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and within the twelve-mile limits, the fact remains that, basically, the use of driftnets is disastrous everywhere.
We should continue to set an example on this issue, in accordance with our previous decision.
Some updating is needed.
The Council's acceptance, possibly revised, of the Commission's 1994 proposal is therefore absolutely vital and a matter of great urgency.
In order to defend its interests and values, and those of other communities and countries, the EU must find a way, within its own institutions and within the international bodies concerned, to achieve an immediate and appropriate prohibition on the use of driftnets, and at the same time come up with the necessary effective control measures.
