Mr President, this business is even more bizarre.
I have just seen in Wilfried Martens' Minutes, i.e., in the Dutch edition, that my name is listed, although spelt rather oddly, but it is listed.
Let me state quite explicitly that I was not present yesterday, did not put my name down on any list and am not claiming the daily allowance!
