Madam President, the EPP Group voted against Mrs van Lancker's report because we are in favour of the Schengen process on principle, because we recognize that Schengen has brought more freedom of movement in Europe and has therefore also allowed many citizens to experience positive European developments for themselves.
We must also underline that the dismantling of internal border controls must go hand in hand with better protection of our external borders.
The Schengen process does indeed make provision for the need to make our external borders more secure when the internal border controls are dismantled.
We must also make quite sure that the Schengen report is not used as a pretext for interfering in any national asylum policies.
There have now been a number of changes to asylum law in Europe, mainly with the aim of preventing any abuse of it, and this endeavour must not be undermined via a Schengen report.
For all these reasons, and because we are in favour of Schengen, we decided to vote against this report, which does not take account of these considerations.
