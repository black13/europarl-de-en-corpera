Madam President, allow me to explain briefly what disturbs me about this debate.
Many Members are behaving as if we were awaiting a latter-day Pentecostal miracle in Amsterdam, whereas it is perfectly plain that this Intergovernmental Conference is unlikely to reach agreement on any major political issues, neither on fundamental rights nor on the composition of the Commission nor on flexibility nor on new provisions for majority voting.
Everywhere there are conflicts and total disunity.
Yet at the same time everyone describes unity as the prerequisite for our launching the enlargement negotiations.
It is therefore very important that the European Parliament should not become bogged down in details but should address the main issues in its resolutions.
That is one point.
The second is this: I expect the Commission to adopt a more positive approach.
What we have heard the Commissioner saying today is not enough, namely that he expects a conclusion in Amsterdam but does not know how it will materialize.
How can things go on like this?
The third is that it is vital for us to ensure and insist that our national Parliaments exert pressure on their governments.
That is absolutely critical, because it will be too late otherwise, and we shall be jeopardizing not only the existing Union but also enlargement and the European project in its entirety.
There is no more time to lose!
