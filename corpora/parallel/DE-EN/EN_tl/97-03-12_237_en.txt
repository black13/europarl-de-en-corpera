Thank you, Mr President.
The technical quality of the European anthem this morning was appalling.
We must ensure that the European project does not suffer the same fate as our anthem.
We need to enliven our act.
Although we have good reason today to celebrate forty years of the Treaty of Rome, which have brought peace and at least relative prosperity to a large part of Europe and to the people there, we also have reason to worry about the future of Europe.
The main subjects on which we consider the state of negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference to be absolutely unsatisfactory have been referred to on several occasions today.
Without genuine institutional reform we shall be placing the European project in jeopardy.
Majority voting must become the norm, and in future there must be no more European legislation without the exercise of full codecision rights by the European Parliament.
If no breakthrough is achieved on either of these two questions during the remaining three months, the Intergovernmental Conference will not have been a success.
This in turn will put the start of accession talks with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe at risk.
As an Austrian, I firmly believe that there is a place in this united Europe for our Eastern neighbours too.
But to that end we must create a Union that is able and willing to accommodate these new member countries.
We must not jeopardize the work of the past forty years.
In the remaining months we really must do all that is humanly possible to work out sound and sustainable solutions, especially to the major institutional problems, which the Council has so far been desperately anxious to avoid.
