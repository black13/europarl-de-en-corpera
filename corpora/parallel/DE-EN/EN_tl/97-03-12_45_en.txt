Mr President, I consider it my duty to point out to the House an inaccuracy in relation to recital F. In Amendment 12 it is alleged that the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine expressly bans cloning and that this is the first prohibition of cloning in international law.
That is untrue, as many other Members are aware.
I consider it important that this is clear before we vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
