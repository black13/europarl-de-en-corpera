Mr President, I think we should come back down to earth.
You criticized Mrs Green.
But you did then call Mr Konrad.
Mr Konrad saw fit to be provocative.
I found his remarks provocative towards these guests who have come here with their emotions running high, fearing for their livelihood, with their jobs on the line, with families who do not know what will happen to them.
Whereupon, Mr President, you also criticized these guests and told them to be quite otherwise they would have to leave the gallery.
We know that it is not right to agitate from the public gallery, but these people were surely unaware of that!
Let us come back down to earth!
What lies behind these emotions?
Why are they so anxious?
Should we not be pleased - and this question concerns the very identity of this House - that people who are troubled, who are fearful, who expect political action from our Parliament, have come to us.
And then to demand, as several Members have done, that they be expelled is, in view of the problem facing these people, in extremely bad taste.
Secondly, I should like to make a personal statement.
A Member called FÃ©ret, a representative of the Front National, called both Mrs Green and myself fascists.
I utterly repudiate that!
It was a Member representing the Front National, mark you, who used the term 'fascist' to describe a Social Democrat and a Green.
That, I believe, speaks for itself!
