Mr President, I voted against the joint motion for a resolution in the end, even though some of the worst of the Socialist Group's amendments were rejected.
What concerned me was recital D, however.
I do not believe that undermining President Berisha's position at the present time will serve the cause of peace.
I believe that we must press him to compromise, and he is doing so already.
Undermining his position is the most dangerous thing that we could do, however.
That would make the peace process impossible for the foreseeable future.
The second point I should like to make is that there is a great deal of hypocrisy in this debate.
Parliament has frequently attempted to mobilize resources and other forms of support for Albania.
It has been thwarted by the Council and by certain Member States, in particular Greece, and what concerns me here is that now that the results of this mistaken approach are emerging, people are pointing the finger and expecting a society which has been isolated for decades to behave like a democracy which has been established for hundreds of years.
Moreover, it is those who have done the least for Albania and have blocked Community aid who are now being most critical of the country.
With relatively modest resources, we could have created a model of development in this small country.
Now we have lost that opportunity, and I therefore protest at this hypocrisy!
