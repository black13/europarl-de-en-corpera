Madam President, this question involves the human rights and the right to self-determination of the people of Tibet.
No one, not even the People's Republic of China, is entitled to restrict human rights on the basis of their own philosophy or culture, let alone annul those rights.
As the previous speaker said, Parliament must therefore use all the means at its disposal to defend the human rights and the right to self-determination of the Tibetan people.
One thing is clear: the European Union and this Parliament can only interpret the right to selfdetermination as this is set out in the Helsinki Final Act, from which it follows that the right to self-determination does not imply the right to alter borders arbitrarily, since that violates the right to self-determination of other peoples.
That being so, we must stand up for the Tibetan people's right to self-determination as a cultural and human right.
I therefore support the call made in Parliament's resolution for the question of Tibet to be placed on the agenda of the UN General Assembly.
