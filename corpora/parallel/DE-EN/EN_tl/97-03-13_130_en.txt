Madam President, circumstances dictate that I must first express my condolences, on behalf of this House and my group, to the people of Israel, the families concerned, and the government of the country for the terrible incident on the Jordanian border, which has resulted in the death of several Israeli children.
And I do so as a friend of Israel and its people, and as a citizen of a country which has indissoluble ties of guilt with that country and its citizens.
It is precisely for this reason, however, that I wish to make it quite clear that I unreservedly share Parliament's concern and regret at Israel's colonization policy in East Jerusalem, and that I therefore support the demands set out in the joint motion for a resolution.
I should like to take this opportunity to say something personal, as a Christian and a theologian.
Jerusalem is the city of three world religions, and Judaism undoubtedly lies at the root of them all, but I wish to say that the Jerusalem of the twentieth century and, I believe, of future centuries will remain the city of Yad Vashem, the city of remembrance of the most systematically planned and executed attempt at genocide in the history of mankind.
Clearly, therefore, this city must possess a special moral authority within the international community.
However, this moral authority also has political implications, and I would therefore call on the Israeli Government to consider whether its colonization policy in East Jerusalem is in keeping with the moral authority which - for the reasons I have given - this city undoubtedly enjoys within the international community.
