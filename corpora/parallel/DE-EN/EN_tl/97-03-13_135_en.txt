Madam President, I should briefly like to ask the House to consider what would have happened if this incident had occurred a few years ago.
We can indeed see from the prudent reaction of the Israeli Government, which declared from the outset that this was an isolated act, that we have moved a considerable way forward.
Secondly, nowhere does it say in the Oslo Agreements that development in a city with a population of 600 000 must be stopped for several decades; nor does it say that houses can only be built for Israelis, and not Palestinians.
Thirdly, I would ask the House to recall its fears when the present government was elected and to consider the progress which has since been made.
We should be highlighting that progress instead of always pointing an accusing finger, not least since the Knesset has so far refrained from criticizing us in the European Union for possible failures in our own area.
