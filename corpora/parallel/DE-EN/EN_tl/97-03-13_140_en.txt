Madam President, Kosovo is not an unfamiliar subject in the House.
It has long been a powder keg, and we have drawn attention to this repeatedly.
The easing of the situation in Serbia - if one can call it that - has brought Kosovo back towards centre stage, and that is a good thing.
The people there are becoming impatient.
There is the threat of assassinations by the Kosovo Liberation Army and these cannot be ruled out, even though the leader of the Democratic League is continuing to seek a peaceful solution.
This motion for a resolution also relates to another matter, however, which really cannot be passed over in silence: the conditions in the prisons, which are leading to torture and death, consequences which a delegation from our Parliament has been able to see for itself.
In our motion, we are therefore renewing our call for the release of the prisoners, for freedom of the media, and for the start of a genuine dialogue, with a view to finding a solution for the people of Kosovo who have long been subject to repression.
We are calling on the Serbian Government finally to open the office in Pristina for which we have long been asking and which has already been agreed to by the Commission - and as the UN special rapporteur, our colleague Mrs Rehn, has also requested - to show the people that the European Union is standing by them.
I believe that we should be exerting a great deal more pressure here, in order to make Europe's stance in Kosovo really clear.
