Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the treatment of the Mapuche in Pulmari by the Argentine Government is illegal and marked by shameful corruption.
It deserves our condemnation, and the fact that this has turned out so weakly in the resolution is only because of the appeasing influence of the PPE Group.
We are concerned about the Mapuche, and we are also deeply disturbed at another sign of growing repression in Argentina.
This involves the press.
In the past, the press has played a crucial role in this country.
I would remind the House of how it revealed the terrible human rights abuses by the armed forces during the military dictatorship, or how it shed light on the scandalous corrupt practices of Argentine politicians and officials.
I am thinking of how it reported on revolts against the government's disastrous economic policy in several provinces of the country, or how it has supported the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who are constantly under threat.
The precondition for all this is freedom of the press.
But that is now in jeopardy.
On 25 January, the photojournalist Jos√© Luis Cabezas was killed because he was trying to shed light on the dark and criminal machinations of certain politicians.
We condemn that, and I hope that when President Menem visits Brussels in the coming months, he will clarify these events for us.
