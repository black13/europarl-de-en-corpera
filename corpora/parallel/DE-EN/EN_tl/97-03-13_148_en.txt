Madam President, I would say to Mr Telk√§mper that there is a difference between lecturing people in a positive and a negative way.
The relations between Europe and Argentina are undoubtedly among the closest that exist between continents, and that is also why every word we say here is interpreted very sensitively in Argentina.
If we are devoting this resolution chiefly to the indigenous peoples, whose very existence had previously been denied, then I would say that in our view that is an entirely good and sensible thing.
It will therefore also have the support of my group.
However, I do not believe that the situation in Argentina is as disastrous as Mr Bertens also portrayed it, but precisely because we are Europeans, because we have many political groups here, we have to exercise a proper influence and actually talk to the Argentines about these matters.
Of course the murder of a journalist is a terrible thing.
Of course it is right to discuss such things as the threats to the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo - who incidentally are here nearly every month, and hold talks with us.
My group will only be requesting a separate vote on this paragraph because we do not think it is right in terms of the methodology of the resolution.
But the resolution will certainly have our support.
