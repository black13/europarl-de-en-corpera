Madam President, a good many points have already been made here with which I entirely agree.
I shall therefore not repeat them all now.
I think that in Afghanistan, there is the worst official repression of women that we are currently aware of in the world as an official policy.
However, this topic is also dealt with in the other resolution marking International Women's Day.
It cannot be made clear often enough how vulnerable women's rights still are in many countries.
The world women's conference in Beijing is over.
Europe should now be in the very front rank of those helping to put into effect the decisions that were secured with great difficulty, in other words to campaign against the trade in women, girls and children, to combat prostitution, child labour and sexual mutilation in traditional societies of a kind that we still see to some extent in Europe, for the most part among emigrants.
Once they have left the family unit, perhaps expelled from it, women are often regarded as fair game, and it is almost inconceivable in our emancipated society how they can be pursued.
However, we do need a cautious approach to help us win these women over to our side, because a society can only change from within.
But we must support this in our contacts with governments, and I hope that Commissioner Mar√≠n will do this in particular, since he was once responsible for women's issues here in the European Parliament, in his dealings with the Committee on Women's Rights.
