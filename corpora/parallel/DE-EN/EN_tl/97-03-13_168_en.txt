Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the joint motion for a resolution which has been tabled by six groups contains nothing that we have not been saying for a long time already.
Parliament is thereby closing its eyes to the latest developments.
There is no doubt that nuclear weapons are being internationally shunned.
Maintaining the nuclear threat, let alone planning for a first strike, is now even being rejected by the generals, because it has no strategic advantages but would bring endless suffering to mankind and the environment for generations to come.
1997 is a year of major steps towards nuclear disarmament.
At the Clinton-Yeltsin summit, far-reaching proposals on the dismantling of strategic nuclear arsenals will be on the agenda.
Parliament must insist that France and the United Kingdom take an active and serious part in these disarmament efforts and proposals.
If it wishes to be credible, Parliament has a responsibility to prevent the Non-Proliferation Treaty from being furtively undermined in the harmonization of the common foreign and security policy.
It has a responsibility to call for negotiations on disarmament now, and to ensure that the capacity of France and Germany to act is not suddenly Europeanized and furtive talks with Germany or attempts to create de facto situations at the FrancoGerman summit do not become the norm.
Do you not think, ladies and gentlemen, that it is worth campaigning for a nuclear-free Europe, as a symbol of a Europe which is at peace?
