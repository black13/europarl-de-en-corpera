Madam President, I would say to the last but one speaker that Germany has no nuclear weapons, does not wish to have any, and will not have them.
I should just like that to be noted.
As a member of the Committee on Development, I see with some concern that it seems possible that certain countries are making the possession or development of nuclear weapons into a kind of status symbol, so we do need to look particularly critically at the course of events with regard to the newly industrialized countries.
We have to rely on the good will of all those who sign such non-proliferation and test ban treaties.
But we never have any means of ensuring compliance with these treaties.
I therefore welcome the statement in the joint motion for a resolution that greater efforts are needed in this direction, and that countries must be enabled genuinely to accept agreements of this kind on test bans and non-proliferation.
