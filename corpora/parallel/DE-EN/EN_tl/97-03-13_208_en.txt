Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mrs Dybkjær for her excellent report, even if it does not make pleasant reading.
A temperature increase of 2ºC by the year 2030, a rise of 50 cm in the world sea level, an alarming fall in the area of rain forest - the unwelcome trends in the environment go on.
We rejoiced at Rio.
Today, we are disappointed.
We have hopes of New York.
Perhaps this is our last chance.
We all know that first the forest dies, then the people.
Climate change is alarming, there is a shortage of fresh water, there is radioactive waste - why do we make no progress, when we are all familiar with everything?
In my opinion, a very important point here is the fact that many countries, including a good many in Europe, still believe that economic development and conservation are opposites.
That is wrong!
Conservation creates jobs, it gives fresh impetus to the economy, it is a great challenge for research and technology.
The Germans invented the social market economy.
The Austrians - I am proud to say - invented the eco-social market economy.
This means using the market mechanisms for conservation, it means creating economic incentives to reward environmentally friendly conduct and to punish pollution.
And it also involves using taxes to exercise control.
I believe that only the EU will really succeed in providing the necessary political weight for conservation and development aid.
Only the EU, only the rich countries, only the economically developed nations can really succeed in reconciling the economy and the environment, and in enabling both the economy and the environment to flourish!
