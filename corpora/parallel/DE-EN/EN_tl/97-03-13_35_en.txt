Mr President, I just have one question, because this is something that was decided on by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy.
Do you not think, Commissioner, that every penny we invest in the Medzamor nuclear power plant through the TACIS programme is a penny wasted, because it simply cannot be made safer?
It was brought back into operation because Armenia's gas supply was cut off by its neighbours.
Would it not be better for us to concentrate our efforts on ensuring that the country's gas supply is restored?
Then the Medzamor plant - which is situated in an earthquake zone, moreover - could be shut down again.
Would it not be better to devote our time and money to that, rather than to patching up something which cannot be patched up?
