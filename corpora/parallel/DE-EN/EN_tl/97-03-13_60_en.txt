Mr President, with reference to Amendment No 5, I have heard that a number of groups have problems with this amendment because it contains the words 'countries or' .
I would therefore propose an oral amendment deleting those words.
The amendment would then read: ' Organizations which approve of or encourage compulsory abortion or sterilization and infanticide as methods of controlling population growth shall be excluded from Community support' .
The words 'countries or' would therefore be deleted.
