Mr President, I would propose that the second paragraph of Amendment No 11 should incorporate the present text of the motion for a resolution, with five words being deleted.
You all have the text in front of you.
I shall read it out in the amended version in French:
' rejects any proposal to list in the Treaty a large number of conditions to be fulfilled before Article 7A, providing for free movement of persons, comes into force; strongly criticizes the fact that this text does not provide a role for the European Parliament and the Court of Justice' .
