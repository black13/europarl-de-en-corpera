Mr President, I have a request in connection with yesterday's disturbance in the gallery.
I would ask you to have the film taken of the incident examined.
I have heard that the film shows two things: firstly, that a group of these people sang the 'Internationale' with raised fists - I myself heard singing, but I could not tell exactly what was being sung; and, secondly, that someone gave a speech to the camera calling for a different kind of Europe.
It should be checked whether this is true or not.
I hope that it is not true!
