Mr President, unlike many of my colleagues, I supported Mrs Morgan's proposal in the vote on Amendment No 20, since I believe that the cultivation of minority languages, for which she argues as a particular matter of concern in this report, is extremely important.
We advocate the protection and promotion of minorities throughout the world in our resolutions.
And we repeatedly advocate it as a principle in our list of demands to the IGC, I am glad to say.
But I believe that we must also do so when it comes to actual competences within the Union - legislation and practical measures.
It makes no sense to defend a principle and then not apply that principle in practice.
I therefore wish to thank Mrs Morgan for her report, which has my full and complete support.
