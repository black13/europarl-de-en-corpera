Madam President, naturally I have supported the excellent report by Mr Martin, because the interests of our wine growers are at stake.
But I did so with a heavy heart, because of course any withdrawal from production of wine-growing land means a setback as far as our culture and civilization are concerned.
Mrs Kla√ü was right when she said that the areas of poorer land should be the ones to be set aside.
Often, however, the only question is how to decide which are the poorer areas.
We are fortunate today, that our session is being presided over by a President who represents one of the best wine-growing areas of Europe, namely Lower Franconia.
I am very glad about that, because it sends out a positive signal, because we must be quite clear about one thing: set-aside is a setback.
We must do more to concentrate our deliberations on the effects on people's health of moderate wine consumption.
We must urge the Council Presidencies to finally do something about it.
Unfortunately, Ireland and the Netherlands have done nothing, and so we are now putting our faith in Luxembourg, which is itself a wine-producing country.
Finally, I should just like to say, quite clearly, that we should be doing all we can to spread the message that, as Europeans, we should be drinking less Coca Cola and more wine.
