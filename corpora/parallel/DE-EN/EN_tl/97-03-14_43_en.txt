It is extremely important, for the future position of the European Union in a global world market, that the Commission and the European Parliament should recognize the special position of the so-called emerging economies of the world, in other words, those countries that can no longer be classed as developing countries, but at the same time cannot be regarded as real industrial countries.
These countries harbour an enormous, in some cases unexploited, technological talent potential, they attract considerable foreign investment, and in some areas of state-of-the-art technology they have long been our competitors.
These countries have already developed remarkable economic power in some sectors, and it is no coincidence that more than a few well-known European companies use Indian software, for example.
Japan and the USA already have strong positions in these markets.
The same applies, to a lesser extent, in the case of some Member States of the European Union.
However, it is high time that the Commission, too, aimed its policy in these countries more towards those sectors that are already developed, and sought to achieve European participation in the state-of-the-art technology markets in these countries.
The current action plan is an initial step in the right direction.
It reveals the need for the European Union to take definite steps in order to ensure that it does not lag even further behind Japan and the USA in these countries, but starts to catch up with them.
It is clear from this that countries which in some fields already occupy a very strong position can no longer be treated on the basis of development-aid criteria alone.
On the contrary, our efforts must lie in the direction of effective cooperation in our mutual interest, cooperation in the sense of partnership, with the same rights and obligations, and in the sense of reciprocity, as the Commission puts it in its report.
