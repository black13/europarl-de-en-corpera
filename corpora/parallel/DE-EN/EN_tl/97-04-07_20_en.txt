Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is the moment when social Europe is beginning to grow, thanks to the struggles of the people concerned.
The initial court proceedings have shown that there is also a real chance of further development, and at this historic moment this Parliament should start to play its role as the sounding-board of the European public, and should look after the interests of the people concerned.
Therefore we should give ourselves time to deal with this issue.
Ladies and gentlemen, pull yourselves together and do it!
Millions of unemployed people, millions of marginalized people are looking to you for action.
If you refuse them, then you will be showing them that you are pursuing a vision of European construction that has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the interests of the people involved.
It is for this reason that no one in this House can vote against this request.
