Mr President, I think it is quite incomprehensible that the Commission once again feels that it has to postpone the issue for two years, and I should like to take this opportunity to say to those ladies and gentlemen who believe that there are no alternative methods that that view is totally incorrect.
It is not true, for example, to say that there is no alternative to the eye irritation test.
This fact is now established knowledge at international level.
If that is what you maintain, sir, then you do not know what you are talking about.
It is also complete nonsense, in this context, to quote a few poor prisoners on whom some kind of tests are being carried out.
Every woman and also every man who would like to use perfumes would do without them if they knew that, in order to manufacture these products, somebody has to be tortured.
I too can quote a statistic, from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the provisions in force are particularly stringent.
This statistic was published in 1997.
It refers to thousands of dogs and cats.
There are millions of animals tortured year after year.
And all of you, ladies and gentlemen, who perhaps have a dog at home, and who think about what else you can do to make its life better, should just try to imagine how you would feel if it was your dog that somebody was going to test a cosmetic product on.
I believe that enough research has been done, and that there are enough alternative methods.
We all know why this issue is really being postponed: it is exclusively for reasons of trade policy.
It has nothing to do with a lack of alternative methods.
