Mr President, having heard what Mrs Flemming has to say, it is obvious that both the Commission and the Member States accord very little importance to the concept of animal protection.
The Commission's annual report for 1995 makes it quite clear, at any rate, that the Commission is totally lacking in commitment when it comes to implementing the restrictions and halting animal experiments in the cosmetics industry.
Although the cosmetics industry itself has carried out a certain amount of research that is worth mentioning, the Commission has to a large extent limited its own action to merely coordinating certain validation programmes.
It is a fact, unfortunately, - and scientists are by and large agreed on this - that research methods not involving animal experiments are still not sufficiently well developed in some areas.
I should therefore also like to give my support, in particular, to the rapporteur's demand that research and development work aimed at discovering alternative methods for tests in the cosmetics field should be included in the fifth R & D Framework Programme.
