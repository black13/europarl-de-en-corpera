Mr President, we asked for this debate so that we could discuss with the Commissioner the question of what happens next, now that Luxembourg and Austria have declared a ban on imports.
I understood the Commissioner to have said that she is not prepared to examine in depth the new scientific evidence that these two countries have submitted, and that she is also not prepared to examine Parliament's proposal - which I hope we shall be voting on tomorrow - to the effect that any decision should be postponed until all reservations have been removed, including, for example, the reservation - which has not been examined at all - that this foreign genetic material can be absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract.
We are faced with a major problem involving democracy and consumer policy.
I should like to ask the Commissioner how she feels about postponing the decision until investigations have been carried out.
I should very much like to know how she assesses the studies and findings that Austria has submitted, and I should also like to know - and I have already asked this question - why this product is not covered by the novel food regulation.
I cannot understand what all the fuss is about.
We are here to conduct a debate, and if the Commissioner has not answered these questions, then it is our job to raise them again.
Mr President, would you please ask the Commissioner to deal with these specific questions, which have not yet received an answer.
