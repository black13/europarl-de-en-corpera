Mr President, Austria, like Luxembourg, has imposed a ban on exports of genetically modified maize, on the basis of both ecological and health reservations.
In addition, the people of Austria instinctively reject the idea of genetically modified maize.
I believe that we have a duty to take into account the instincts of the people that we represent here.
In Austria at the moment there is a petition for a referendum against genetic manipulation, and we are expecting a record level of participation.
If you argue that scientists have found that there are no reservations about genetically modified plants, that says nothing about the real dangers: it merely says something about the way science works.
And in this area in particular we all have reason to be sceptical, because we know that a substantial proportion of scientific research has for a long time now been contract research carried out for multinational companies which, for economic reasons, are interested only in their own specialized sector.
