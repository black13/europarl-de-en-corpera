Mr President, Commissioner, I am in favour of making the debate about the use of genetic technology more objective.
I believe that genetic engineering is an intellectual technology, a technology of the future, with special significance for medicine.
Biotechnological medicines are already being used today in the treatment of cancer, diabetes, heart attack and multiple sclerosis.
Objectivity, however, has two sides, and therefore, Commissioner, it is still, objectively, incomprehensible to me why the Commission has authorized the importing of this maize, despite the fact that thirteen out of fifteen Member States were against it.
I also find it objectively incomprehensible that the warnings of the Scientific Committee on Food have been ignored.
Did not something similar happen in connection with BSE as well?
And, we are told, any effects on health are possible but negligible.
Have we not heard those words somewhere before, and not too long ago either?
As always, ladies and gentlemen, Austria has provisionally banned the marketing of the product in question, following new scientific findings.
But the fact is that because, on the basis of the new scientific findings, there are two issues in particular that have not yet been finally cleared up, namely the question of the possible transmission of resistance to antibiotics and also the problem of the possible development of resistance to the BT toxin, and because further scientific investigations will be necessary in order to come to a definite conclusion regarding these risks, Austria has imposed this ban.
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, but especially you, Commissioner, to agree that the approval of such a controversial product should be made, once again, the subject of a thorough, objective investigation!
