Mr President, on the subject of the agenda and the work of the Conference of Presidents under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure, unfortunately Parliament has still not set up a monitoring committee in order to ensure that the requirements of the Committee of Inquiry on BSE are met.
Despite many letters, following the decision by the Committee on Agriculture, you have still not replied to them.
Since 1 April of this year, a regulation now has to be implemented, in accordance with which the animal carcase units would have to work in accordance with specific quality criteria.
But they are not doing so!
This Parliament ought to be raising the issue of this requirement, which was one of the main requirements, with the Commission.
This is not possible, however, because the committee has not yet started to operate.
I have the impression that the setting up of this committee will continue to be postponed, by one political group which is being guided by electoral considerations.
We cannot make the reputation of this Parliament take second place behind the electoral considerations of one Member State.
Therefore I should like to ask you to press ahead with the setting up of this committee, so that this Parliament can do its work properly.
