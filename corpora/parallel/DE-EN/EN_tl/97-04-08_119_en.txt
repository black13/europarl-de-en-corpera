Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur's view that the annual economic report is too optimistic and does not take the problem of rising unemployment seriously enough.
It makes an over-simplistic connection between competitiveness and labour costs, whilst ignoring the importance of creativity and innovation to both production and marketing.
The mania for budget consolidation in both the public and private sectors is directed too much towards cutting jobs and too little towards investment.
The example of France makes it clear that competitiveness cannot be improved by reducing labour costs alone: despite the reduction of labour costs in that country, unemployment has not fallen, and there have been further losses of market share.
It will therefore be important in the future to take a critical look at the EU's patterns of expenditure.
As long as the bulk of the Member States' financial contributions is poured into support for agricultural overproduction, while comparatively paltry sums are earmarked for research and development, we should not be surprised if the EU's competitiveness is declining.
