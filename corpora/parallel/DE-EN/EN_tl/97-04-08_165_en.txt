Mr President, a driving licence entitles the holder to move freely in a motor vehicle within the European Union.
If a citizen of the EU decides to live or work in another Member State, it has hitherto been necessary for him to exchange his driving licence within a certain time limit.
With the introduction of a Community driving licence, that is now about to change, and the 1991 directive must therefore be amended.
For the principle of mutual recognition to be applied in practice, the codes for each type of check must be readable and understandable in every Member State.
That will be helpful for the officials who carry out the checks, but also for drivers themselves.
It is not enough for a document to have the word 'Europe' printed on it: its contents must also be geared to the free movement of persons and the freedom of choice of residence.
This applies in particular to disabled driving licence holders, since the system of harmonized codes will now set out the conditions for driving a motor vehicle in a clearly non-discriminatory way.
To this extent, we welcome the Council's common position.
At first reading, however, Parliament called - and we have just repeated that call in the Committee on Transport and Tourism - for mutual recognition to be extended to penalties, i.e. the suspension or withdrawal of driving licences.
Unfortunately, neither the Council nor the Commission took account of those amendments, and we are now retabling them.
It cannot be the purpose of freedom of movement to make it possible for road hogs whose licence has been suspended in one Member State to continue driving with impunity in another Member State with the same licence.
If the argument of subsidiarity is put forward to defend such an abuse, the people of Europe will have little sympathy for it.
They are not interested in which pillar of the Treaty is concerned, they simply wish to have workable proposals.
