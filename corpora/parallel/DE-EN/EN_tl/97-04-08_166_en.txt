Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Council's common position on the creation of a standard Community model for national driving licences.
Firstly, this will contribute to facilitating the movement of persons within the Community; secondly, to increasing road safety and enhancing legal certainty and consumer protection; and, thirdly, to facilitating the establishment of residence in a Member State other than the one in which the driving licence was issued.
In order to achieve these goals, it is necessary for all particulars - all additional information and restrictions that must be recorded in a driving licence - to be presented in a non-linguistic form.
The proposed system of standard coding of both the notes on the conditions for driving a vehicle and the notes on the administrative procedures for the harmonization of driving licences will make driving licence endorsements easier to understand and simplify checks on national driving licences, which will continue to be valid.
So far, so good.
But I fail to understand one section of this House: how can you accept the continuation of national responsibility for issuing driving licences - even if on the basis of a standard Community model - and at the same time call for Community legislation on the suspension and withdrawal of licences?
Clearly, double standards are being used here.
Surely matters of justice and internal security are still aspects of the Union's third pillar, and therefore subject to intergovernmental cooperation?
I can only recommend the rejection of these amendments, which are in breach of existing Community law and which, I am sorry to say, were adopted by a majority in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
I should like to thank the Council for its common position, in which it takes over the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading and accepted by the Commission.
