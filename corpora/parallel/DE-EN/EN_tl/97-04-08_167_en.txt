Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that Mr Watts has to campaign in the United Kingdom until 1 May.
Once again, we are discussing the question of driving licences, and we must finally bring this debate to a close.
Firstly, because the Community driving licence was supposed to have been introduced on 1 July 1996 - and I have an example here of what it is supposed to look like.
Now we are talking about 1 July 1997!
Secondly, because we now only have to decide on the codes, on which we are actually agreed.
We must therefore seriously consider whether we wish to have driving bans which are valid Communitywide, or only at national level.
I am my group's spokesman on the design of the standard Community driving licence, and I have always supported the introduction of such a licence.
As Mr Koch rightly said, however, the individual Member States are exclusively responsible for issuing driving licences, and they must therefore also be exclusively responsible for withdrawing them.
And so it must remain!
The example of the Italian in the United Kingdom that Mr Morris just gave was very revealing.
This is the nub of the matter!
Until we drive on the right everywhere in Europe, we shall continue to have such problems.
When we drive on the right throughout Europe, we can talk about Community-wide driving bans.
This is a clear case of distortion within the European Union.
We should now accept the Council's common position and avoid delaying further still - through a quite unnecessary conciliation procedure - the introduction of a standard Community driving licence.
