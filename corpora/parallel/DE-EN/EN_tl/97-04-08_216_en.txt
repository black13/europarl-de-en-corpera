Mr President, there has been no application from the Irish Government nor any attempt on its part to alter the existing NUTS classification.
Indeed, it could not be altered without corresponding changes at an administrative level, and I am in no doubt that the present system is more advantageous to Ireland as regards support in the period up to 1999.
It is true that the figures available to us show levels of some 66 % for the border counties, 58 % for the mid-east, 63 % for the midlands and 78 % for the west, but as I said, these are figures from 1994; the new phase of funding from the Structural Funds begins in 2000, and you can see that if the present pace of development is maintained, the figures will not take long to reach the 75 % level.
The Irish Government has not yet come forward with any proposals for a different approach, but should it do so, the Commission would consider them in the same way that it would consider proposals from other Member States.
