Firstly, as you know, tax policy lies outside the competences of the European Union and the Commission.
Of course, tax policy can be one of the tools of regional development, but it is not part of Community regional policy.
Moreover, Mr Lindqvist, provision exists within the partnership-based approach of our structural policy for the very thing you are advocating, namely taking decisions on projects at local level.
We have monitoring committees, on which regional and local authorities are represented, and it is their job to select projects for support.
Indeed, the fact that the level of funding commitments and payments to Finland and Sweden is still below the Union average is not unrelated to the learning process that we are jointly engaged in - a fruitful process, I might add, and one that is steering us towards closer partnership.
But partnership implies an input from all the partners, and I believe that the experience of the European Union and the Commission has greatly helped the development of regional structural policy in Finland and Sweden in every respect.
That, at any rate, is the feedback we have received from the numerous local discussions that we have organized.
