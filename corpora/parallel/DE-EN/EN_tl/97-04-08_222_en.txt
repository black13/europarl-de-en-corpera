Mr Wibe, GDP is naturally one of the bases on which the respective purchasing-power parities are calculated, so we do already take this particular factor into account.
Generally speaking, one could of course argue all day about any of the criteria that are used.
A very important consideration, and one which is occasionally overlooked, is the fact that we are not able to gather and compare regional-level data for all the criteria throughout Europe, and this means, for example, that we have to opt for certain criteria, particularly when we are dealing with regional development, as opposed to straightforward national averages.
