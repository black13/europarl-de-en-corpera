Mr Titley, I should like to begin by explaining that the Commission will present its proposals, including those on the important decisions concerning the Structural Funds, in the form of the Santer Package, once the Intergovernmental Conference has concluded - hopefully in July.
We are also currently engaged in internal discussions within the Commission.
I assume, however, that your question also refers in part to the problem of delays and the time factor that has characterized the funding period 1994-99, and I should therefore like to add that the timetable which we have now set ourselves will certainly put us in a position to adopt the proposals for the new Structural Fund regulations as early in 1998 as possible, just as soon as a decision is taken on the Santer Package.
That would then give the Member States roughly a year in which to prepare their programmes as thoroughly as possible and submit them in good time.
The proposals that the Commission will make will be based firstly on the conclusions of the cohesion report and secondly on the deliberations of the so-called cohesion forum that is to be held at the end of this month, with input from the European Parliament.
We should wait until we have specific proposals before us, which can then be discussed in detail by the House.
