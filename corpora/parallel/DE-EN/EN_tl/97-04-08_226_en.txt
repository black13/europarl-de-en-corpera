You will appreciate, Mr Titley, that such suggestions are unlikely to emanate from the British Government.
I have, however, received papers from certain academic institutions concerning the usefulness of United Kingdom unemployment statistics, and you can be assured that this is one of the issues that we shall look at.
However, I would ask you to bear in mind that we do, of course, receive unemployment statistics from all over Europe, and that agreements exist as to which aspects of those figures we should take into account.
Obviously, one of the issues that we shall be discussing is whether our statistics form an adequate basis for assessing questions of support, not just now but in the future.
As regards Objective II, I would ask you to appreciate that, at this stage, I cannot give what amounts to a guarantee that specific aims will continue to receive support.
We shall have to discuss the entire package of structural support and the criteria on which we intend to base it.
Generally speaking, I certainly take the view that structural policy will have to continue not only to support the most structurally disadvantaged regions in the socalled poor Member States, but also to offer solidarity at European level in dealing with the problems of structural change in the richer Member States.
However, the questions of whether, when and in what form this should take place must be discussed in the overall context of structural reform.
