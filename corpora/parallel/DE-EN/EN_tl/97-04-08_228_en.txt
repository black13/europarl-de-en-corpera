Of course, Mrs McCarthy, we shall consider carefully any information that we receive concerning unemployment trends in Member States.
Obviously, however, we have to lay down criteria that will allow us to make general comparisons, and we shall not in future be able to base the selection criteria on special quotas for particular countries.
I would therefore ask you to appreciate that we have to consider the overall applicability of the information we receive, and broadly speaking rely on EUROSTAT figures which - because they have the same statistical base in each instance - are the only ones that can ensure a fair comparison.
