Mr President, it would undoubtedly be a great pity to lose part of the question.
In answer to the point raised by Mr Mulder, I would say this: firstly, there are of course measures being taken in a number of Member States which could to some extent be regarded as additional precautions, and some of which also go rather further than the Commission requirements.
As regards compensation payments, the question also arises as to whether such compensation should be paid under the heading of health protection measures, or whether it falls within the scope of market regulation.
There are examples of both approaches, and obviously each Member State must reach agreement on possible forms of compensation, and indeed on whether the Union should offer compensation at all in a given case, before it embarks on any activities.
That is the arrangement at present.
There is no clear-cut scientific opinion to indicate that a single specific measure is the right one.
Clearly, the decision also depends to a very great extent on the objective that a particular measure sets out to achieve.
Even as regards the cases that have come to light in your own country, Mr Mulder, there is no single, adequate scientific explanation.
You will also appreciate that in some areas we still lack information, quite simply because not enough progress has been made in terms of scientific research and findings.
On the other hand, this creates a demand for precautionary measures which do have a positive effect, it must be said; but with the best will in the world, it is impossible to say if they are really necessary from a scientific point of view.
