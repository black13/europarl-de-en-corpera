When we talk about cancelling refunds in respect of live cattle or cattle for slaughter, then as I see it we have to deal with two separate issues.
The issue that I addressed in my answer was that of seeking to cancel refunds in cases where we can prove that a shipper of live cattle has breached Union rules, in particular those of the transport directive.
In the longer term, we might also have a second and possibly more effective sanction in such cases, because as you know, the new transport directive requires anyone trading in or shipping live cattle to hold a licence.
It would also be quite feasible, in cases where the rules are repeatedly broken, to withdraw licences from offending shippers, thereby preventing them from transporting cattle again at all.
The other issue that you raised is whether all refunds in respect of live cattle ought not to be cancelled.
We know from practical experience that various third countries prefer to import live cattle.
For those European Union operators involved in this trade, a blanket cancellation of refunds would mean that live cattle destined for the countries in question would no longer be purchased in the European Union, and would instead be procured overseas or in other third countries.
Already - to offer you a practical example - a significant proportion of the live sheep that are imported into Egypt no longer come from the European Union, but from Australia and New Zealand.
I am sure no one would try to suggest that such a long sea voyage could be less stressful for the animals than the much shorter crossings that would be entailed in importing sheep from countries of the European Union.
I think we should also be clear that even if we are not paying refunds, we need rules to ensure that animals are properly treated in transit, whether or not refunds are involved.
That is why the approach that the Commission has chosen - that of making transport subject to conditions - is the right one to take in the first instance.
