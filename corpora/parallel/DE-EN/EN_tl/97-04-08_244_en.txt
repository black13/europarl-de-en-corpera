Mr President, Mrs Anttila, we need to be clear about something here: when we talk about slaughter capacities, we have to realize that slaughter capacity in one location is not simply equivalent to slaughter capacity in another, because many countries that import beef from the European Union demand very particular slaughtering procedures.
The European Union has a number of abattoirs which are equipped to carry out the rites prescribed by certain religions, but such facilities do not exist in every part of the Union, and this means that some transportation is still necessary.
Let me also mention a specific case in which I was involved.
A substantial proportion of our live cattle exports are to Lebanon.
The Lebanese argued that they depended on live imports because they lacked adequate refrigeration facilities, so under the MEDA programme we have now offered to build cold stores, and just three weeks ago I received a positive initial response from Lebanon.
But if we do not also put in place the logistics which are necessary to ensure that there is no break in the chain of refrigeration there, Lebanon will go on importing live cattle, because conserving meat obviously poses no problems so long as the animal is alive.
Clearly, therefore, these aspects also have to be borne in mind when we are considering solutions.
