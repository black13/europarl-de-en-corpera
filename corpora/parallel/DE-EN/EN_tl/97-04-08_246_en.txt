Yes of course, Mr Eisma, we must also monitor how the rules are observed.
And in cases such as those you mention, i.e. exports to third countries, we depend on cooperation from the Member States.
For example, as regards facilities on the ships which are used to transport animals, these can very well be inspected during loading in the port of departure.
At the same time, inspectors can ensure that the animals are being handled properly during loading and carry out health checks and so on.
Another question is how to inspect the way the animals are handled during unloading at the port of arrival, and we considered this problem when we were drafting the directive to which I have referred.
I would also remind you that two years ago, when the transport directive was being adopted, the Commission asked for three specialist inspectors to be employed exclusively to pursue this matter in third countries.
Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, the promise to appoint additional staff has not yet been kept.
Finally, I would also point out that we are in the process of drafting rules that would allow us to involve nongovernmental organizations - in particular animal protection organizations - in monitoring shipments of livestock.
This would require us to put in place an appropriate legal framework.
