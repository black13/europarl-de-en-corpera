Perhaps in the brief time available, I did not adequately explain what we intend to do, Mr Harrison.
I did say, however, that we are not relying on the industry at this stage: the Commission is initiating its own studies, but we have also asked the industry to be vigilant.
Secondly, it is surely in everyone's interest that the Commission should ask Sweden to inform us of the grounds on which it decided to introduce such a ban, just as it is in Sweden's interest that the ban should apply throughout the Union.
Since the Council of Ministers will take the ultimate decision on the matter, it seems sensible to me that appropriate contacts should also be established with the Member States in relation to this issue, so that the ground can be prepared for presentation of the Swedish case.
I think that this is only logical.
As for the question of genetically modified organisms, another argument which is put forward here is that crosscontamination may have a role to play in the case of one particular product, namely genetically modified maize.
However, I am convinced that, rather than straying into the realms of speculation on this point, the important thing is to carry out the necessary tests or to seek the advice of experts on the basis of tests which have already been carried out.
In my view, it would be a mistake to venture away from tried and tested scientific opinion in this field, and to start taking arbitrary decisions.
