Mr Sj√∂stedt, in my view, the right course of action is to keep to the agreed procedure for achieving the objectives that were set out at the time of the negotiations on Sweden's accession.
It was in the context of those negotiations that Sweden requested this ban, which will apply until 31 December 1998.
Sweden has agreed to that.
The first consideration in making such an arrangement was not that the ban should be extended beyond the agreed date, but that sufficient progress might be made in the meantime for the ban to be applied not just in Sweden, but throughout the Union.
So it is with a view to facilitating a decision on the lines which Sweden seeks that I have submitted my proposals.
And I still see no reason why Sweden should not make its findings and arguments available to the other Member States.
That is why I tend to regard debate at this stage about whether the Swedish derogation will be extended beyond 1998 as counterproductive.
As I see it, that question will arise if it proves impossible, within a reasonable timeframe and before the end of 1998, to achieve the main objective of a lasting, Union-wide ban on certain substances.
I believe, therefore, that we should stand by the agreed approach.
