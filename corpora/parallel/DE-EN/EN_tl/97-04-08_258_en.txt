Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not one of those who is enchanted by the idea of subsidiarity.
Nevertheless, I have to ask the question: who stands to gain here?
The rapporteur had to refer back to an incident that happened in 1974 in order to make any sort of case for the necessity of this directive.
The Commission has provided no facts whatsoever to demonstrate why it is necessary; instead we are referred to a theoretical danger.
I have some difficulty with this, because there is surely something problematic about sitting down at a desk to think up dangers and then taking steps to prevent them.
That, however, is a very big subject, and I can be brief in what I have to say.
We are in agreement with the rapporteur.
We accept the amendments that have been tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and the new Amendment No 21.
But this brings me to what is a basic problem for the Commission's legal policy.
The difficulty to which the rapporteur referred so diplomatically is a real one.
In both the instances he mentioned, the effect of the Commission proposal is to grant the banks considerable latitude.
In other words, the banks are being excluded from the normal provisions of the law so that they can retain a substantial degree of discretion.
This is a problem, and it applies in relation to the applicable law as well as the question of when a payment system has been agreed.
I share the rapporteur's view that this is an area where we need clear legislation within which the banks will have to operate.
They cannot be allowed to stand outside the law.
And I would call on the Commission, when it is making proposals in future, to ensure that the law applies to everyone.
