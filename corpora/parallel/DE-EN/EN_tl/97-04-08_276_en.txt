Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in fact I hardly need to take the floor here.
I would just say that the PPE Group entirely supports the report by Ms Oddy, and therefore agrees with all the amendments which have been retabled.
We also endorse the criticisms which the rapporteur has just expressed in the debate.
We too believe that this is first and foremost a question of transparency.
We are once again having to deal with this tiresome issue of comitology.
Of course, it is quite legitimate and, to some extent, understandable that each side should choose the system which suits it best and gives it most scope to bring its influence to bear.
However, the Commission and the Council should in fact consider that one of the reasons for the negative attitude displayed by our citizens towards Europe is that many people disapprove of these secret negotiations which remain unknown to the outside world.
Simply for the sake of making Europe transparent and comprehensible for our citizens, we should opt for the procedure being proposed here, namely a management committee of Type II(b), and not a Type III(b) regulatory committee.
Type III(b) is the so-called contre-filet procedure.
I have to say that just at the moment I would prefer a faux-filet !
We are opposed to the contre-filet procedure, and we believe that the modus vivendi should be adhered to, as set out in the Oddy report.
Unless we settle this whole comitology issue once and for all, and so as to bring about transparency, then the process of comitology will eventually become one of criminology, and that would not be a good thing for the Commission or the Council, nor indeed for Europe and ourselves.
In conclusion, I would repeat that we entirely support the Oddy report.
