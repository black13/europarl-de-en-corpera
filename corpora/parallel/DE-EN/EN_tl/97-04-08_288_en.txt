Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since this proposal for a directive has been the object of sometimes violent criticism, I should like to return to the question of the legal basis - not the one contained in the Union Treaty, which the rapporteur has explained adequately tonight, but rather two urgent legislative needs which this proposal seeks to meet.
The first - and here I agree with the previous speakers - is the ending of a market distortion based on legal differences originating from markets which have a privileged position because of national legislation, since they do not have to take account of resale rights.
There was only one way to correct this false situation, namely to introduce a resale right throughout the Union, with all the consequences that entails.
An area without internal borders must also be a market without privileges.
The other urgent need lies in the unequal treatment of creative artists, as opposed to writers and musicians.
While the latter are protected by copyright against economic fluctuations and the vagaries of the market, creative artists are at the mercy of the marketing strategies of the art trade, if they do not yet have a personal reputation and the influence that goes with it.
In this context, resale rights serve as partial compensation, and as acknowledgement of a right which cannot be denied to these artists.
I should like to make one further comment on the amendment on resale rights which I have tabled, together with other Members.
Our purpose here is to follow as far as possible both the Commission's proposals and the ideas from the artists' associations.
Finally, I should like to thank the Commission for its bold initiative, the rapporteur for the determination and the caution with which she has approached the issue, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture for his contribution.
