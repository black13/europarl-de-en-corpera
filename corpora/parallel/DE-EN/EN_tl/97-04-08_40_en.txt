Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let us take an inclusive political view of this matter, rather than a divisive legal one.
It is a question of the equality of freedom of all people as living beings.
We breathe the same air, we drink the same water - as Antiphon the Sophist said, who first expressed the idea of equality of freedom.
The thinkers of the Enlightenment revived this concept, and it was never applied merely to abstract legal entities or property-owners, but to real, physical, historical, social living beings.
In other words, the distinctions that are being made here are artificial.
They were invented subsequently.
We need to develop a human and civil rights policy like the one which Etienne Balibar has set out repeatedly in his most recent publications.
Let us all finally recognize the fact that human and civil rights policy represents a key element of Europe's heritage that is essential to building a Europe which seeks to make its own specific, positive and constructive contribution to the development of human civilization!
