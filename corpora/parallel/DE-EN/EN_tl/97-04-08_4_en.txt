Madam President, yesterday the President read out the ratification of the appointments of various Members, following verification of their credentials by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure.
However, I see that we obviously have a new colleague in the House whom the President did not mention.
Since yesterday, a young man has been sitting next to Mrs Green.
I should like to know which group he belongs to, and I should also like to know what the PSE Group has done with Mr HÃ¤nsch!
