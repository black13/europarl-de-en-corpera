Mr President, I have the unfortunate feeling that someone is creating confusion here.
An Amendment No 3 has been tabled.
That amendment must be put to the vote as a whole.
If it is adopted, the original text will be changed; if it is rejected, the original text must be put to the vote.
However, I have not heard anyone asking for a split vote on Amendment No 3.
The rapporteur has not requested it.
Above all, the author of the amendment has not requested it.
I would therefore ask you to put Amendment No 3 to the vote as a whole, as requested by the Liberal Group, and then to put the original text to the vote.
