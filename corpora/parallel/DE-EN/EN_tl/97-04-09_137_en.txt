President Patijn, I should like to ask you whether you or the Council are familiar with the admirable study by Mr Friedmann, the President of the European Court of Auditors, which shows that the eastward enlargement can be achieved without substantial additional costs.
Secondly, as far as the Visegrad States are concerned, whether you are already thinking in terms of a particular number of States or of the Visegrad States alone, or whether for example you also regard Slovenia and the Baltic States as possible candidates for accession.
