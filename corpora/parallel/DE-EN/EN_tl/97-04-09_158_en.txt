Mr President-in-Office, thank you for that reply.
I have another question, though, in this connection.
We all know that the citizens of the Union have a right to security, meaning that they expect the Union to ensure that EUROPOL does eventually come fully into force.
When you say that the Member States are intending to have ratified it by the end of 1997, how much longer will it take in your view until EUROPOL - the preliminary work is being done - is fully functional?
Secondly, we know that the situation in the countries of origin is a tragic one.
So EUROPOL must have a strong interest in co-operating with the countries of origin of organized crime, especially in the east.
Does the Council have any plans for activities in connection with EUROPOL which will initiate the co-operation between EUROPOL and the eastern States?
