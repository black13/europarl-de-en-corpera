Mr Patijn, thank you for that answer, which largely recapitulates the familiar timetable for the accession negotiations and the fact that those negotiations will start on the basis of equal entitlement.
Even so, some fundamental questions remain: is the Council giving any thought to ways of preventing the migration of cheap labour into high-wage countries when the rules of the single market are brought into force in the candidate States?
Has any thought been given to how this can be prevented, so that these workers remain in their own countries and have opportunities for employment there?
