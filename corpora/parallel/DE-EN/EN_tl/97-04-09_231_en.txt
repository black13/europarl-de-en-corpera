Madam President, Europe has major problems to overcome at present: unemployment, environmental pollution and many others, too.
The way to solve these problems, without a doubt, is for industrial production to be made environmentally compatible, turning out products that can be sold on the world markets, relying on the ability of the European workers to come up with innovative ideas and technically sound solutions.
The auto-oil programme is a project along these lines, and I believe the objective can be achieved if the amendments proposed by Parliament in the Lange, Mamère and Eisma reports are accepted as they stand.
I should like to thank all three rapporteurs for their efforts, and I would also like to point out that things like a car that covers 100 kilometres on three litres of fuel were still a joke only a few years ago.
People used to think it was impossible to achieve such levels of reduction and innovation.
The Mamère report deals with fuels, and I believe some very important decisions can be taken here, because a better fuel in a less good engine brings an immediate improvement in air quality.
But '3 litre' cars, motor vehicles that run better on less fuel, are only going to be a practical possibility if we can also improve the fuels.
This improving of fuel quality, incidentally, is one of the points where the better environmental standards in the three new Member States might be achieved.
That would at least be a step towards an adjustment in the other direction.
Regarding the strategies proposed by Mr Eisma, the essential thing is for these strategies not just to be described, not just for the industry to be given a clear framework, but for the revision and implementation to be equally functional.
No good legislation ever comes about without revision, and we will only be able to achieve the binding values that Parliament has proposed for 2005 if we keep a constant eye on how everything is being implemented.
