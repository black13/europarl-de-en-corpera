Madam President, Commissioner, a directive on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex is greatly welcomed by many women's associations and individuals, and has been long awaited.
In the past, the European Court of Justice has had to use the legal expedient of case law to close a loophole, whereas now this Directive can clearly improve the situation regarding the burden of proof in cases of discrimination on the basis of sex.
Clear legal principles which are equally binding in all Member States are something I very greatly welcome, especially when they concern discrimination against certain individuals.
In the past, there were many differences between the rules applied in the various individual States.
So we are concerned here not so much with a political resolution as with radical intervention in the legal systems of the individual Member States.
Perhaps it will be made easier for women to go to court in cases of discrimination and lack of opportunity.
I hope this Directive will be really helpful to women and will not further reinforce the reservations and doubts employers have about appointing or promoting women.
There are a few points in the report which increase my doubts about its practicability.
I refer in particular to Article 5 and to Amendments Nos 15 and 16.
And now a word on procedure.
We worked on the Commission's proposal, as we are required to do.
After hearing from us, the Council long since amended basic text, so that we may be calling for something which is no longer up for discussion at all.
Unfortunately we were unable to stop the work in committee and demand the resubmission of the present version.
I hope, Madam President, that in future the work done by the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament can be better and more effectively co-ordinated.
