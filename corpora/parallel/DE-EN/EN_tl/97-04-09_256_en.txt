Madam President, the proposal for a Directive reversing the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex has already been under discussion for 10 years.
I hope we are finally getting there, and that this directive will be approved.
In my work as a personnel consultant I very often came up against these problems, whether in connection with appointments or promotions or pay, and so I know better than most how difficult it is for the women concerned to prove their point - I know that they were unable to succeed in their claims because they were women.
Those women who did go to court had to expend a great deal of effort and time to produce the necessary evidence, and most of them were then unsuccessful in their actions.
The fact is that employers, even the so-called 'small' employers, do start from a stronger position.
Until now, they have not needed to keep detailed records of the discrimination they practised.
So I, too, hope that shifting the burden of proof away from the complainant onto the respondent will be adopted by a large majority in this House.
That would be an important step towards equal treatment of men and women within the European Union.
