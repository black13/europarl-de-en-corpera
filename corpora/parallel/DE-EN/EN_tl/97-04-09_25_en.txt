Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been holding these debates on the discharge for many years now, and yet we still find that the procedure leaves room for improvement.
We are going to have to go on working on that.
I am thinking, for example, about the incorporation of the so-called Statements of Assurance into the discharge debate.
And I am also thinking about the fact that the Council has failed to complete at least part of its homework on time.
It is only gradually dawning on public awareness, or the awareness of those involved, that 80 % of the expenditures are administered by the Member States.
So it is a step in the right direction if the Council itself has noticed the fact.
But the Member States must also react to the report of the Court of Auditors.
And the Commission must obtain reports on the reactions of the Member States and pass the information on to us; this is something that should be done in future.
But Parliament itself can certainly do something to improve its own work, for example in the co-operation of the other Committees with the Committee on Budgetary Control in connection with the discharge.
In terms of content, the subjects we address are very often the same, especially the shortcomings in the implementation of the budget.
There may be changes from time to time between this area of policy and that, but the problem is fundamentally the same.
Mrs Wemheuer and Mrs Theato have already drawn attention to the political significance of these shortcomings.
There is another matter, though, that concerns me most of all - the need to take more account of own resources.
I am grateful to Mr Wynn for doing so already in his report.
But I regret the fact that the Committee did not support the call for a separate report on this.
Even so, I am hoping that the Court of Auditors will supply us with some additional material on this, particularly with a view to the new 1999 Financial Regulations.
