Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we of the Freedom Party welcome the broader and deeper consideration of political co-operation in the present agreement with the PLO, particularly with regard to the consolidation of democracy and respect for human rights as a way of safeguarding peace and stability in that war-torn region.
In this context, we also greatly welcome the inclusion of a democracy clause, enabling the agreement to be suspended in the event of serious human rights violations.
We must, however, reject the additional importing of agricultural produce into the EU, as in view of the present surplus agricultural production in the European market the importing of more agricultural products would make matters worse for the farmers and could result in a further fall in prices.
We in the Freedom Party have always declared our opposition to the transportation of live animals, especially to countries far beyond the frontiers of the EU, because of the intolerable suffering it involves for the animals, and so we regard it as our duty to demand the deletion of this passage from the Commission proposal, a point on which, unfortunately, no comment is made in Mr Alavanos's report.
