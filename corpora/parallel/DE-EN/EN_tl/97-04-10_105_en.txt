Mr President, I can entirely endorse the views expressed by my colleagues Mrs Mann and Mrs Schroedter.
But there is one thing that I really would like to make clear here.
Russia is not a dictatorship.
Russia is on the road to democracy.
Of course it has not reached the same point on that journey as the democracies of Western Europe, the point at which we should wish it to arrive one day, both for our own sake and for the future of Russia.
But Russia is on the road to democracy, and we must support its progress along that road.
That is why one of the purposes and concerns of this resolution is to assess the effects that the union of Belarus and Russia would have on our relations with Russia.
The interim agreement with Belarus, of course, has been shelved, and rightly so, because a dictatorial regime is certainly in power there.
But we have a partnership agreement with Russia to ratify, and I hope that will indeed be done in the next few weeks.
Nevertheless, we in the European Parliament will undoubtedly have to reflect on our attitude to a parliamentary assembly of that Union if half of its members have no democratic legitimacy.
That should be at the heart of our discussions.
