Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem, of course, is familiar to everyone.
For that reason I do not wish to repeat what other Members have said.
Besides expressing our sorrow and anger at having to discuss this sort of thing yet again, we should also think about what we can learn from it.
I believe we can learn that the idea of borders as limes and fronts, which we in Europe have been exporting to the rest of the world since the imperialism of the Augustan Age and which is still coming back to haunt us, in the form of ethnic cleansing for example, is not a tenable concept.
Instead, we must argue within the UN for forms of strictly regulated confinement, for borders to be regarded as markings which can also contain transitional and overlapping areas, and for mutually binding human rights, which would rule out the type of thing that is now happening to the people of the enclaves.
If we succeed in that, we shall also have moved much further forward in our policy towards Turkey.
I can only comment once again that it is a great pity from this point of view that the Christian Democratic party leaders recently saw fit to try and add a Christian dimension to this notion of borders as fronts, as the limes of Fortress Europe.
That leaves me utterly dismayed.
