Madam President, I should like to begin by saying how delighted I am that the European Parliament is dealing with human rights in eastern Turkestan and hence also with human rights in China.
As an international body, we have a unique opportunity and an obligation, as Mr Bertens has already said, to be the first to adopt a clear position towards China, to tell the Chinese Government that we regard human rights and basic political rights as indivisible and that we therefore apply them as a criterion in our political action with regard to every country in the world with which we have dealings.
In this context I should also like to speak out quite clearly against the representatives of those countries which made it impossible to adopt this sort of position at the UN Human Rights Conference.
They speak constantly of a critical dialogue, but everyday reality shows that this is usually no more than a cover for economic interests and does not wrest a single concession from totalitarian States.
We only need to see how the butchers of Tiananmen Square are courted by the supreme representatives of the Western world.
But to move on to Turkestan, it must be said that the situation there is a veritable powder keg.
Anyone who, like some of my colleagues here, was able to listen yesterday to the words of Erkin Albdekin, the representative of the Uighurs in exile, must have begun to realize that there is a real need for us to take action here.
It is a time-honoured Chinese practice to use birth control and population transfers to create such a marked demographic imbalance that the homogeneity of an occupied country can no longer be maintained.
Hand in hand with that, of course, goes the destruction of culture and religion in the territory in question.
The politically motivated closure of the Koranic schools and the arrests of teachers of religion speak volumes.
Parliament clearly needs to act here, and I hope that many Members will be aware of this obligation.
