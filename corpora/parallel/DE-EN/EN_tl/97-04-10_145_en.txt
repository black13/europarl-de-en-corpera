Madam President, we probably cannot repeat enough now that human rights are no internal affair but an international issue.
The Russian Federation is one of the signatories of the UN Convention against Torture and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The Russian Federation became a member of the Council of Europe in 1996.
And yet in Russian police stations and prisons, people are still being tortured with blows and oxygen deprivation almost to the point of suffocation and are forced to remain for long periods in inhuman and painful positions.
Detainees sleep in shifts, because there are no beds for them.
Forced confessions are used as evidence in trials.
In the negotiations on economic aid, the Commission must address these specific grievances and demand that they be remedied.
It must call for the revocation of the decree whereby people can be imprisoned for 30 days without preferment of charges.
It must also insist that the cases of torture be investigated.
Within the action programme and the TACIS democracy programme developed in conjunction with the Council of Europe, it must devote a considerable share of resources to improving prison conditions and to ensuring that prison wardens are trained in the humane treatment of prisoners.
