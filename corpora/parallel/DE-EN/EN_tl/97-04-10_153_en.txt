Madam President, we are appalled by the grenade attack on a peaceful demonstration of Khmer National Party activists in Phnom Penh on 30 March 1997.
Nineteen people were killed and hundreds injured.
The purpose of the attack was probably to kill Sam Rainsy, leader of the KNP in Cambodia, and other prominent opposition leaders.
One policeman was killed.
The dreadful thing about it all is that the police took no action, that this atrocity took place because the authorities allowed it to happen.
And that is symptomatic of the situation in Cambodia.
This situation cannot be tolerated by the European Union any longer.
We can call for a committee of inquiry here; the international public must be informed about this.
Violating human rights with impunity, which is standard practice in Cambodia, must not be allowed to continue.
The best weapon is a free election; free and fair elections will guarantee the democratic structures which will put an end to this state of affairs, and that is the demand we should all be making.
