Madam President, welcome though the support for a democratic development in Cambodia by means of free elections may be, it will not succeed in stabilizing democracy there as long as the representatives and sympathizers of the Khmer Rouge are not entirely excluded from the process.
Unfortunately, this left-wing fascist-type movement, which was responsible for the second holocaust of this century, has been integrated into the peace process.
That was a fatal flaw in the Paris negotiations.
We therefore call on the European Parliament to include in all its future demands a stipulation that the Khmer Rouge must be prevented from either direct or indirect involvement in this political process and completely excluded from democratic developments in Cambodia.
