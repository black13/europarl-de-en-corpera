Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the country of Yemen has a very, very difficult history behind it: decades of division, two systems and part of the country under Socialist mismanagement.
Today it is trying its best to find its way among difficult neighbours.
In many respects the 18 million inhabitants of Yemen enjoy greater freedom than the people of other countries in that part of the world.
Yemen is also committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region, such as the dispute over an island in the Red Sea or the border problems with the neighbouring State of Saudi Arabia.
The recent kidnappings were brought to a swift conclusion without loss of life with effective assistance from the Government.
Now parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 April, and I am very much in favour of sending election observers from the European Parliament.
It would also be wrong, ladies and gentlemen, if in this difficult situation we were to threaten to withdraw the very modest amount of financial assistance provided by the European Union.
This means, Mr Newens, that your motion can only be considered in conjunction with the amendments on the table, most of which our group can support.
The country is trying hard to move gradually towards democracy in this difficult situation.
It is isolated, because although the Yemeni application for membership of the exclusive club of Gulf States has been on the table for months, and indeed years, the country's neighbours are still unwilling to let it join.
The country is not covered by our Mediterranean programme, because it is does not directly adjoin the Mediterranean, nor do we have an association agreement with it.
So it would really be wrong of us to leave Yemen in isolation.
This country has done enough to merit support, and with the amendments included we Christian Democrats shall support this motion.
