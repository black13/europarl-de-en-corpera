Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the problem in Bulgaria makes several things clear.
Quite a lot has already been said about these things, and Mr Goerens' contribution was also very enlightening.
We must ask ourselves whether the type of assistance and guidance offered to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to help them over their transitional crisis is really adequate.
Other aspects of the issue are the question of which political forces in Bulgaria are doing what and the fact that the political class, the nomenklatura , and the Mafia are neither able nor willing to develop their country, a phenomenon we have also encountered elsewhere.
But we must also consider our own share of the blame.
What can we do to ensure that we actually honour the promises we have made to the Eastern Europeans and especially to those in the Balkans?
And we must also ask ourselves very seriously whether our assistance should not go further than merely providing humanitarian aid in emergencies.
Karelia:
