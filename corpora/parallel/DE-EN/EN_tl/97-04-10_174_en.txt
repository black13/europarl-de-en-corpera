Madam President, Bulgaria is caught up in a serious financial and social crisis.
High inflation, unemployment and rocketing food prices have put many people into an almost hopeless situation in recent months.
The European Union, as well as other bodies, and especially the private charitable organizations to which Mr Blokland has just referred, have some good projects that are helping to alleviate the worst of the distress.
Children, women, the sick and the elderly are most in need of rapid assistance.
The crisis-management programme of the present Government has been adopted, and I hope that the new Bulgarian Government will continue the programme after the elections.
A clear legislative programme and a restructuring of the economy, accompanied by reforms in the social sphere, are urgently needed.
The Bulgarians need the support and solidarity of all Europeans, since they belong to Europe.
Bulgaria also needs very strong support from us, because the people there have placed high hopes in us.
I hope that after the elections the new Government, together with Parliament and above all with the Bulgarian people, and also with our support, will be able to overcome this crisis.
