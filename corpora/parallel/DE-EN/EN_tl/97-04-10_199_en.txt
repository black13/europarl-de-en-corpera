Mr President, general and vocational education is an instrument of employment policy, adapting professional qualifications to the needs of the internal market and playing an important part in the fight against unemployment.
The education systems of all our Member States are currently underprepared and too uncoordinated to respond to this challenge.
The general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas serves a crucial purpose here.
That purpose is to realize free movement of persons, in other words the right to enjoy citizenship of the Union, to live and work in other Member States, in conjunction with the eradication of unemployment.
In the Committee on Petitions, a considerable number of petitions submitted in recent years have shown us time and again that freedom of movement in this particular domain of recognition and equivalence of diplomas is not working properly.
Petitions give Parliament an overall picture of the problems faced by European and national administrations, of remote and bureaucratic measures, of infringements of principles of Community law and in general of defects relating to European unification and popular participation in the process of European integration.
These experienced flaws in European legislation should be used as a basis for the further development and improvement of Community law.
That is why I welcome Mrs Fontaine's excellent report, and I should like to draw on our experience in the Committee on Petitions to add something from my own point of view as a member of that committee.
The main demand made in this context is that the Directive should also cover professional experience gained after graduation, because that is the only way to ensure that freedom of movement will be exercised in a satisfactory manner to promote education and employment policies in which our citizens are closely involved.
