Madam President, perhaps someone from the PPE Group would also like to comment on Amendment 2.
The first part of both amendments is identical, and we each actually wanted to withdraw the second part of our respective amendments.
I do not know whether that message came across.
If the PPE Group withdraws the second part of its amendment, I shall also withdraw the second part of ours on behalf of my group, and we should only need to vote once on the identical first part.
