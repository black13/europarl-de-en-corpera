Madam President, it is sometimes tragic when the two large groups in the House agree to delete an important part of an amendment.
This is happening now with the second part of Mr Wynn's amendment.
It is no good simply to say that we need controls; it is better to add that if the controls do not prove effective, appropriate action must be taken, and that is precisely what the second part of Mr Wynn's amendment says.
For that reason, my group would like the second part to be retained.
May I ask for a vote on that?
