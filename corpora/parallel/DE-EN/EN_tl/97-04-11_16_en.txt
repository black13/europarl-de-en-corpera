Mr President, I believe the problem of disabled people is in fact a more fundamental one than has been described today.
Mrs Schmidbauer is quite right: we need a proper legal basis for social programmes, we need a clause on non-discrimination, we need what Mr Schiedermeier emphasized once again - coordination of national policies - and a high-level group of experts would also be extremely helpful.
A broader issue is also involved here, however, not just so-called prejudices and difficulties, but a questioning of our society as a meritocracy, as an immense Darwinian mechanism of social selection in which more and more people are constantly being filtered out, and in which this relentless process of selection is also still being ideologically charged.
To put an end once and for all to the temptation to construct ideologies from this, whereby the high achievers are sectioned off from the less worthy elements of life, we should in fact take our society forward - at least outside the business world - on the basis that everyone contributes according to his abilities and is cared for according to his needs.
I think we owe that to disabled people!
