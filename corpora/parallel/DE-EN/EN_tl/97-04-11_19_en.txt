Mr President, there are 37 million disabled people living in the EU.
That is five times the entire population of Austria and around 10 % of the population of the European Union as a whole.
This is a substantial number of people, 37 million of them, who have to be integrated, and who are therefore already seen as a fringe group.
Let me put a question: how many AIDS sufferers are there in the EU?
Certainly not 37 million, but the population nevertheless has a greater awareness of the problems of AIDS sufferers than those of disabled people.
Do you know why this should be?
I wonder if we have not failed to use advertising campaigns and sympathetic representatives from public life to generate the same amount of interest for disabled people as we have for other fringe groups in society.
Is it not also because people are all too easily tempted to suppress these so-called problems and close their eyes to them?
Ultimately, does this not result in a certain lack of interest on the part of donors and the general public, when it comes to opening their wallets?
However, we can also see from the example of AIDS the success and the widespread impact which can be achieved in the population by a good campaign.
Only when an awareness of the everyday problems of these disabled people has been created in the public at large do support programmes really make sense.
Simply calling for a non-discrimination clause as regards disabled people - even though I am in favour of it - only has a point and is only worth the paper it is written on if the population sees disabled people not as a fringe group, but as part of itself.
