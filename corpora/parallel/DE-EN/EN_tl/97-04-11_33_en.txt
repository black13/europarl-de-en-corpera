Mr President, because of the fact that, besides our own rich countries, there are unfortunately many countries which have to rely on the help of others, our western industrialized societies have a social duty to provide aid.
In the past, attempts have often been made to supply this aid purely in the form of financial support.
However, I should like to propose here that in future, development aid should be implemented to a far greater extent than before in the form of specific projects and economic links with the donor countries, so as to ensure a useful kind of support.
This could be done through a substantially upgraded transfer of know-how, for example, whereby the countries and regions in need can be given help to help themselves, a concept to which attention has already rightly been drawn by Mr Posselt.
Our debts and responsibilities towards the poor countries of the world are not absolved simply by providing injections of money.
The question should not be how much we have given, but who has actually benefited from it, and what it has achieved.
All too often, this form of development aid seems to be a kind of moral purchasing of freedom from responsibility, rather than what really helps the people of these countries, namely aid which is targeted, project-related and, above all, effective.
Timely and useful development aid serves both the donor and the recipient countries, not least in terms of avoiding wider political conflicts.
Because the fact is that poverty, need and lack of resources are the most significant causes of war.
Seen in this light, effective development aid is a key factor in preventive peace maintenance, and can therefore also be interpreted as help for the donor countries themselves.
