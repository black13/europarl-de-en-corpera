Mr President, I am sorry, this is on a similar matter, but it is one I have to mention.
While I did vote to approve the Minutes at the beginning of today's sitting, and these are absolutely correct, I have only now been able to compare the various language versions of the resolution on Bosnia-Herzegovina and to see that they are different in all the languages, and also wrong.
That is the only thing they have in common.
I should like to point out that the Minutes correctly state what was adopted, namely that paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the original text were deleted and replaced by new texts, whereas paragraph 4 of the original text remained unchanged.
This is a very important point, and I would ask the Sittings Service to correct the matter.
