Madam President, at this time the European Union's main aim should be to boost employment.
But in the framework of globalization the SMEs will only be able to make promising jobs available if they are innovative in their activity.
Innovative activity involves, firstly, research and development.
Accordingly we must improve the aid measures here.
There is a range of different programmes, but at present it is still a jungle and they are not easily accessible to the SMEs.
Participation in the research framework programme is currently still quite inadequate.
We have to produce a package of aid that is specifically geared to the SMEs, both financial and legal aid, so that the SMEs can actually transpose their findings into products.
Here the question of intellectual property and patenting creates great difficulties.
The exchange of findings between small and medium-sized undertakings is not always a matter of course, because afterwards they very often have to compete among themselves on the market.
We should also consider whether it is not possible to administer and utilize the aid, the advice and also the money, including that under the framework programme, more decentrally.
Centralized advice only reaches those SMEs that are able and willing to come all the way here to obtain information.
I think it is our job to provide the information in the field.
