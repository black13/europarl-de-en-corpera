Madam President, the special quality and strength of the European economy lies in its structure, which relies so much on small and medium-sized enterprises.
But this small-scale structure also creates vulnerability and disadvantages in a world moving towards globalization.
Crafts firms and small firms often operate only on a local market, nevertheless they are fully exposed to the increased competition in the single market.
The Commission and the Member States must therefore do their utmost to promote systems of cooperation that will allow them to face up to this stronger competition.
Let me point out that the European tourist industry - a potential source of additional jobs - is made up to a large degree of small firms.
So any measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises are of long-term benefit to this major branch of the economy, which unfortunately still has no legal basis in the EU treaty.
