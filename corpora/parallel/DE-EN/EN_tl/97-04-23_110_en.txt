Madam President, since I have to be brief let me just take up one point in Mrs Torres Marques' excellent report, which is specially important to Austria, namely the call for special support for small firms in frontier regions.
Firms in the most peripheral EU regions are particularly tempted to move abroad where things are cheaper, thus increasing the strain on the job market within the Community.
It is only the specific structure of these small firms, that are so important to the national economy, the close ties between families and between firms, love of country, cultural roots and the generally better quality of life that stop them from moving elsewhere.
This has quite significant social and cultural implications for the Union and for that reason alone we should provide substantial aid.
