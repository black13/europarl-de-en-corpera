Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transport of dangerous goods is always of great interest to our citizens, since it is a question of ensuring maximum safety.
In shipping in particular, we have a major responsibility here, for this really is an international problem.
The rapporteur rightly pointed to the importance of this directive, but also to the importance of regulating ships that sail through our waters without calling at any European port.
A speaker has just referred to the port states directive, on the basis of which we were able to regulate quite a few matters for ourselves.
Here we are dealing with a practical issue, which we must tackle jointly.
The Group of the European People's Party will therefore support all the amendments, in order to make the transport of dangerous or polluting goods even safer, give coastal regions lasting and effective protection against pollution or even destruction and ensure the maximum level of safety for the crews of vessels.
So I want to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.
He really has tackled problematic questions which we have not so far managed to resolve.
Commissioner, I know you are about to tell us that you cannot accept the majority of our amendments because they do not necessarily belong here.
Nevertheless - and I am asking you this on behalf of the EPP Group too - please take our views and wishes seriously!
Help us, so that we can find a good solution to all these questions, even if we do not manage to do so now with this report.
