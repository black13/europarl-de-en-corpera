Mr President, I too find that in this report the rapporteur really has displayed a very strong commitment to the development of the ultra-peripheral regions.
He has described the objective of optimum and sustainable development under these very specific conditions in very great detail and offered many new ideas.
But it is rather curious that the term 'outermost regions' does not really say what the true issue is.
For it is not a question of regions in Europe but of regions in the Atlantic, in the Indian Ocean and in Central America, of former colonies and military bases.
Europe's idea of development was not always the one the local people wanted.
The use of rain forests for a European station in Central America with consumers who come from Paris is not what we understand by autonomous regional development.
That is why we welcome all the report's proposals that are designed to ensure genuine autonomous regional development in these areas and ask the rapporteur to accept our amendments which are aimed at eliminating single crops in these areas and which support his proposals to that end.
We do not accept the idea of introducing a separate chapter because that only establishes the old colonial situation.
We think it is right for this protocol to discuss the specific features of these areas in detail and believe that is an adequate means of satisfying these regions.
