Mr President, much of the debate on this point has been highly controversial, emotional and personal.
That has not exactly helped us to find a solution.
Anyone who has belonged to the Committee on Fisheries for a long time knows how concerned we are with the worries and troubles of fishermen in all Member States, which includes Italy.
Protecting jobs always was and is our central concern.
The Italian fisheries plan we are now due to vote on was negotiated between Italian producer organizations, ship-owners, unions, the Italian government and the European Commission.
It concerns the conversion to new fisheries practices.
The fleet consists of no more than 500 vessels using drift nets up to 2.5 km long for catching tuna and swordfish in the Mediterranean.
But the use of these drift nets is economically unviable and therefore no longer acceptable.
Longer nets have been banned in the EU since the end of 1991, under Regulation 345/92.
The plan restricts the issue of licences for drift nets and provides for their withdrawal and destruction.
The costs and means of financing this plan have been worked out in detail.
This measure guarantees the fishermen concerned financial support for restructuring their fisheries practices.
That is why the Committee on Fisheries accepted the proposed plan by a large majority.
Five draft amendments are included, on the principle of voluntary action, control and discipline in relation to all vessels in the Mediterranean and on support for non-European fishermen on Italian vessels.
The EPP endorses the consensus that was eventually reached on the plan for Italy and, after careful consideration, firmly rejects the new amendments that have been put before us.
