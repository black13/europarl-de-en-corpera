Mr President, you took a decision at the Conference of Presidents.
This decision does not tally with the views of the Socialist Group.
It wanted something else and one or other option could be chosen.
One has now be chosen, and the plenary will most probably accept it by a majority.
If that is the case, then let me ask you, Mrs Green, you are not taking the same line as in the case of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE.
There we had 18 Members, and in the end you too accepted not having a place to enable the smaller groups could participate.
Quite apart from the fact that you have lost in this case, would you please tell me what the difference is between this committee and the Committee of Inquiry into BSE?
Why are you being difficult now and not giving the ARE group the place that is in fact due to it in this matter?
