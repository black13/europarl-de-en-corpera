Mr President, Austria has a model system of leave for working women.
They can stay at home, as can the man for the last six months if he so chooses, and, most important, with a guarantee of employment, which makes it easier for women to return to working life.
There is no uniform system of this kind in the EU, which means there is still a major deficit here.
Is there any chance of the EU adopting the Austrian system and allowing women unpaid leave, which would make it easier for them to arrange for child-care and to return to working life?
