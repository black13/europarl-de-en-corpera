Mr President, we have millions of unemployed people.
That is a problem and I think the most important thing is to give these people work again.
Can we in fact assume that the lack of convergence criteria and lack of a single currency are largely responsible for the unemployment we see today?
Is that a major cause of it?
Secondly, is it reasonable and possible to reduce the timescale from 1999 to 2002?
