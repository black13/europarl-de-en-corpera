Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as this report emphasizes, the Internet is extremely important in terms of citizen participation in public life.
The primary purpose of the Internet is not to disseminate illegal and harmful material.
I think that needs to be stressed.
Nor does this material spring to eye immediately.
In fact people have to search for it.
At the same time such material is not just offensive but certainly justifies the need to take precautions.
In my view, the Commission's communication contains too few practical proposals and defers possible solutions to the distant future of global international agreements.
However, the report before us sensibly stresses that the European Union, as an economically strong and technically advanced region, can act as a forerunner in the world.
Going beyond the Commission proposal, I believe the following practical proposals in the report as very useful: the call for a clear sender-recognition code the requirement of minimum standards for service providers, own responsibility and liability for any material provided and liability for any unlawful content made available by thirdparty services if the carrier is positively aware of that content and if he is technically able to prevent its use.
Personally, I regard point 7, which calls for quality ratings for service providers, as problematic.
I believe this project is likely to fall foul of practical problems or that these will at least make things far more difficult.
That is all the more reason for us as Parliament to call for any viable measures to be implemented as soon as possible.
