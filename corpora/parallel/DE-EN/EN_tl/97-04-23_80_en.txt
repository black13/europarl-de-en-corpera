Madam President, as the recent two-hour warning strike by providers in Austria has shown, the subject of this report is highly explosive.
It is a matter of creating a balance between freedom of expression and cultural services on the one hand, and preventing illegal content such as loathsome child pornography and incitement to violence and hatred on the other.
Like all self-contradictory questions, this is a difficult one to resolve.
And in the case of the Internet there are also technical difficulties involved in monitoring the contents.
The question of liability on the part of access and service providers is a delicate one.
In our view this opinion strikes a sensible balance between the different interests without making too many demands on the providers.
Even though our group believes that the proposals set out in the report could be implemented through inter-state measures, we approve the substance of the report.
