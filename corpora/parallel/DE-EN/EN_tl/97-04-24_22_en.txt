Mr President, in a few days' time we will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Chilean conservatives, who are close to our European People's Party.
The fact that this anniversary can be celebrated shows that democracy is alive in Chile.
The reform process in Chile is by far the most advanced and stable in Latin America.
The framework agreement is an important pillar of these democratic reforms.
Under it, Chile has based its relations with the EU Member States on the protection of human rights and the principles of democracy.
Yet the transition to an entirely democratic system is not yet complete.
But when we call for democratic values to be fully applied we must not forget that the basis of democracy is popular participation.
In future the Council should take greater care to ensure that Parliament is duly involved.
Despite this criticism of the Council's approach, I fully endorse Mrs Miranda de Lage's report and the content of the agreement.
In particular I welcome the following points: the call for cooperation to develop the structures of the information society can lead to better understanding between the EU states and Chile, especially if we build our dialogue on the foundations of common values.
The agreement also contains practical aspects that can directly benefit the local people.
During my last visit to Chile people described the problems connected with primary schooling to me.
So I am very glad that this problem has been recognized and included in the agreement.
Speaking from a national point of view, let me also say that Germany is likely to conclude the implementing procedures for the agreement in the near future and is trying to ensure that Chile-EU relations continue to develop in a positive direction on the basis of this agreement.
