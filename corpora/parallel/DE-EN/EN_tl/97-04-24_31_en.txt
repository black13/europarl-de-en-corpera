Mr President, first I want to thank Mr Mather very warmly for his extremely important report.
When we consider that 99.8 % of European businesses employ fewer than 250 people we come to realise that the avalanche of European legislation that engulfs these businesses is enormous and that basically most of them have neither the time nor the inclination to look at these provisions.
It may be possible for some large firms but it is not for many of the small ones.
Many billions of ecus are wasted and many man/years used unproductively.
The consumer has to pay for that and in the final analysis this is a major obstacle to competition.
But a poor competitive position means the loss of jobs.
The small businesses do not concern themselves overmuch with these provisions.
And they have thus shown that they are in a position to create new jobs.
Impact assessment absolutely must be given an official legal status.
It should therefore be carried out by external advisers.
Secondly, the European Parliament should consider which provisions are really important or urgent and evaluate which provisions should enter into force at all.
We really should see to it that with our 314 votes we manage more frequently to prevent the entry into force of provisions that do not seem useful.
Thirdly, in future the Economic and Social Committee should be take much more intensive action to evaluate the effects on undertakings once provisions have entered into force.
Furthermore, that committee should also be able to propose initiatives in this area with a view to annulling some provisions.
Fourthly, the costs to the public authorities must be estimated and we should seize this opportunity to show that the EU is a model service-provider.
Service is our success.
