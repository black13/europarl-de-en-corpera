Mr President, it is quite clear that the current fiche d'impact system is totally unsatisfactory.
The report on the strengthening of this system is therefore a welcome and useful attempt to introduce a method for assessing the impact of EU legislation.
It is important and indeed necessary for the interest groups concerned to be consulted even during the preparatory stage.
It is true that the assessments in this report concern the impact on undertakings and the economy, but the planned strengthening of the system will automatically also have an indirect effect on the social and environmental sectors.
Priority must be attached to providing a more solid basis for the many small and medium-sized businesses, which account for the majority of jobs and help shape the environment, by giving them information on the costs and benefits of European legislation.
Under the current system, there is no need for a detailed cost-benefit analysis when assessing the impact on businesses.
But it is in fact most important to have that analysis.
A careful impact assessment is a most welcome and valuable tool in the search for improved legislation.
If this system is to be implemented successful, the directorate-general responsible will need adequate resources, to ensure that the impact assessment sheets come into wide use.
After all, we are seeking to ensure that the proposed legal provisions are comprehensible and clear to those concerned, that the policy-makers become more aware and more informed and, above all, that politics becomes more accountable.
