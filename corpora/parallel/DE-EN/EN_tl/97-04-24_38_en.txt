Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say first of all that I personally am very dissatisfied that the regulation is being presented as an urgency.
As the proposed rapporteur I could have guaranteed that I and my colleagues would finish our report in the course of the next month.
Nevertheless, in the interest of those concerned, I voted for urgency yesterday.
Let me at this point also give special thanks to those Members with whom we have recently done such good and practical work, and in particular Alan Donnelly.
I think that in this proposal the Commission has given a very detailed and accurate picture of the background and the relevant facts.
In the whole legislative section we are dealing with the different, specific situations in three of our Member States, which we must also evaluate differently.
We must also look at the international aspects of the question of aid to shipyards, and here I am thinking particularly of the problems with the OECD directive.
As an East German Member, I want to emphasize that the blame for the misery of East German shipyards lies not with the shipyards themselves but with the mismanagement by the Bremer Vulkan mother company and the lack of control by the supervisory bodies in the Federal Republic of Germany, especially the Treuhand and its successor the BVS.
As a result only a fraction of the resources needed for restructuring have reached the recipients.
Let me briefly discuss the three amendments, for which I was originally responsible.
On Amendment ll: I would like to withdraw it so that a compromise can be reached on the regulation as a whole.
Amendment 12 is designed to make it clear that this state aid is the last aid that can be granted to the shipyards concerned.
Amendment 13 calls for stronger controls, for EU monitoring; it involves our Parliament in this process and guarantees its continuing participation in it and I hope that urgency will not be agreed again on this subject!
