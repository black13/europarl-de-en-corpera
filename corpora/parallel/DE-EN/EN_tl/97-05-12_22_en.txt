I believe we should debate this Titley report briefly today.
First of all I must compliment Mr Titley and the British Labour Party on their election victory.
My warmest congratulations on that.
But Mr Titley is trying to rush things with this report of his.
It represents a qualitative change in EU foreign policy.
We have not been able to discuss this change sufficiently in the groups, at least not in certain groups, and in particular there has not been enough discussion in committee.
The committee vote was 31 to 30, though a colleague told me he did not know what he was voting for or, with the wisdom of hindsight, he would have voted differently.
The question, in view of 240 proposed amendments, is whether we ought to vote now at all?
This report is not entirely complete, and positions on its are not yet clear.
If my information is correct, the Socialist Group will not be discussing the amendments until tomorrow evening.
In our Group, as in the committee, we have not yet reached agreement.
The common foreign and security policy is on the agenda for Maastricht.
Mr Henderson as the British representative is now saying things quite different from what the British representative said a month ago.
We should postpone this report for a month or two until we have the results of Maastricht II and Parliament has formed an opinion on these matters which is soundly based and has been thoroughly debated.
This is why we put down this request.
