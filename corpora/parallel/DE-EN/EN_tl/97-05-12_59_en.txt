Madam President, previous speakers have already dealt with the essence of the Ford report.
The proposal requires lobbyists to behave fairly and honestly.
Greater transparency is to be desired here.
The only question is how best to ensure it?
Amendment 1 is certainly not consistent with the rules of the code of conduct.
In formal terms alone, it relates to Article 2 and not Article 3, and it should be debated n the appropriate context, that of the Lehne report.
We can at that point look at a precise definition of what a lobbyist is.
Regarding Amendment 12, which calls for a report on lobbyists, I would say that this amendment is not clear, because it does not say what is to be reported on and, above all, who is to evaluate the substance of the report.
Apart from this, I have further reservations about this amendment, because it gives outsiders only an imperfect picture.
If - as Mr Wibe has intimated - this report is meant to enable journalists, for example, to find out who has been in contact with whom, it is obvious that this information will be incomplete and thus wrong.
Let me repeat the example mentioned earlier.
The report on the scrutiny of insurance groups would then say that talks were held with insurance associations.
It would not say that talks were also held with the supervisory authorities, the Commission and government spokesmen.
Only if all these people, who are lobbyists in the broadest sense of the word, were named, would the picture be complete and accurate.
For this reason too I think this amendment is not appropriate.
But I am anxious to make the general point that our debate here has created a wrong impression amongst the general public.
We need lobbyists to give us comprehensive information on the various facets of various issues, and this activity must be pursued as part of transparent cooperation which can be verified by anyone.
Compliance with the code of conduct will help in that.
