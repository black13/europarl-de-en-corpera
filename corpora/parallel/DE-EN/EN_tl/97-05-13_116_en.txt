Madam President, we are discussing a Council directive on health protection here - an important topic - but unfortunately Parliament only has the right to consultation.
I make this point because I believe it must be stressed again and again that Parliament has too few powers.
It is also necessary to make the point because, in their ignorance of the codecision powers which Parliament actually possesses, some of the media often tend to cause considerable anxiety among those concerned, as has happened here in the case of qualified X-ray assistants, who saw their livelihoods disappearing thanks to the European Parliament.
I had to make it clear to the public that, on the one hand, the Council and not Parliament has the final say; on the other, I was also able to set minds at rest by stating that Parliament certainly had no desire to deprive these professionals of their livelihoods.
Since the Commission traditionally comes in for severe criticism here in Parliament, it is only fair to express our gratitude for once for what is an excellent proposal.
And I am delighted that those colleagues who have tabled amendments have nevertheless managed to improve this good text further still.
One thing must be made clear, I believe: the responsibility for what happens lies with the doctor in charge.
He, and he alone, gives the instructions, without this in any way diminishing the responsibilities of those carrying out the treatment.
Initial, further and in-service training have been improved, as has protection for pregnant and breast-feeding women.
This is a very good proposal and a very thorough job of work by Parliament.
We can only hope, Commissioner, that the Council will do justice to Parliament's good work.
