Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a pat on the back is very welcome every now and then in this business, Mr Hoppenstedt.
It was the first time that I personally had taken part in conciliation proceedings, and I must say that I found it very exciting and often very instructive.
I can only endorse the basic comments made by Mr Hoppenstedt, and should just like to add a few of my own.
Telecom TENs, in my view, can only be compared up to a point with the other TENs in energy and transport, where the main aim is to improve or create network infrastructure, in other words hardware.
In the case of telecom TENs, the focus is not so much on hardware as on software, in the broadest sense.
We need appropriate applications, using existing and new infrastructure, which will enable potential users to access these technologies.
We must introduce people - consumers, employers and employees - to these technologies and allay their fears of them.
However, we must also create the conditions for money to be made from these technologies, since otherwise there will be no private investment, which is absolutely vital in this area.
Politics, in my opinion, is nearly always the art of reaching a compromise.
I noticed that everyone became more willing to compromise as time went by.
As Mrs Fontaine will remember, I said in one of the meetings that a good compromise is one which is a little painful to both sides, or to all three sides.
That, I believe, is the case with this outcome.
I particularly welcome the Commission's promise to make a statement to the House on Article 14 of the decision.
This is a crucial aspect of the outcome of the conciliation process and will, I believe, secure Parliament's demand for codecision, and my group will certainly vote in favour of this outcome.
I hope that the House as a whole will do likewise.
