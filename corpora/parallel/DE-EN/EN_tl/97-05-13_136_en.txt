I shall be very brief: all the distinctions which we are working with today are likely to fade away in the future: in other words, whole systems will be developed where it will no longer even be possible to distinguish the hardware, or infrastructure, from the content, or software.
We are therefore assuming that in the future, we shall no longer be able to apply all today's distinctions, but will have to devise entirely new methods.
But we are looking into this, and will soon report back to you.
Convergence will be our watchword.
