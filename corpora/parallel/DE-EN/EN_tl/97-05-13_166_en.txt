Mr President, the Commissioner was unable to answer Question No 34, but further to that question, I should like to take up the last point he made.
What matters is not just resources for infrastructure, but above all cultural cooperation, cooperation on education and training.
We initially made the mistake in Central and Eastern Europe of transferring more money, but neglecting education and training for the people.
Could you tell us about the cultural elements of our cooperation with Morocco and North Africa?
