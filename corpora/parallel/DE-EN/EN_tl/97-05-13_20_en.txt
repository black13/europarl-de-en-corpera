Mr President, I hope you will be indulgent with those who speak at length, because if one has much to say, one needs a good deal of time in which to say it.
It is important that we are finally discussing here today the extension of the regulation on organic farming to include livestock production.
Fortunately, practice is ahead of policy in this area.
We are not so much setting objectives here as taking on board developments.
Mr Fischler and his country can be congratulated, since 10 % of holdings there have already converted to organic farming, and many more are contemplating doing so.
It can be said that in Austria, organic farming is no longer a niche activity, but is becoming 'conventional farming' .
This shows where a development can lead with political support, and it is surely one that we all welcome.
As the organic associations have established - and this has indeed been established - there has in practice been a development among consumers, who are quite clearly interested in these products.
Patterns of purchasing are adapting to them, albeit hesitantly.
This is the most logical form of both environmental and consumer protection, and we have therefore proposed that Article 101 should be adopted as the legal basis.
It is a logical move, and we hope it will be accepted.
We shall examine the matter in the Committee on Legal Affairs tomorrow, and then vote.
If this article is not adopted as the legal basis, then we shall have to discuss the amendments.
As we all know, there is opposition to genetic engineering.
As far as I am aware, the Commission has not yet agreed on its position.
Consequently, if Article 43 is retained as the legal basis, we shall request referral back to committee, so that the Commission is not given the chance of deciding not to fall in with our progressive proposals.
Then we would agree to a debate on the matter.
I believe that this is an extremely important issue, and I hope the House will support our move.
