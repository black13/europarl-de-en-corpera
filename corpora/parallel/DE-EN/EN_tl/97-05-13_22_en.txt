Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two areas which are essential to man's existence and, ultimately, survival: the environment and food.
In today's high-tech world, we need to build a bridge between the two.
It is therefore necessary to adopt a holistic approach, not just base our action on a snapshot of one area or the other.
This proposal for a regulation points the way ahead, in that it seeks to strike a balance between productivity and the environment in relation to organic farming.
The BSE crisis in particular has shown us where farming which is geared purely to mass production can lead, with all its excesses such as the transport of live animals.
Reorienting the system towards organic livestock production and quality control is therefore an important step forward, not only for farmers, but above all for consumers.
However, good intentions often overlook the reality of the situation.
If the proposal is applied to beekeeping, it is clear that there will be no organic beekeeping virtually anywhere in Central Europe, because no one can fulfil the criteria.
On the other hand, if we look at the laxity of a number of developing countries as regards the labelling of honey, the system rapidly becomes absurd.
Labelling only makes sense if strict controls are provided for, so that consumers can be sure that the contents match the label.
It is doubtful whether, where genetically modified organisms are used, it is possible to use the term organic farming at all.
Given that some 1.2 million Austrian citizens - nearly a quarter of the country's voters - supported the petition for a referendum on genetic engineering, it is unlikely that many Austrian consumers would agree that it is.
