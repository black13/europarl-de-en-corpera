Mr President, the proposal for a regulation which is before the House represents a step towards improving agricultural structures.
If we look at the present system in terms of its soundness and efficiency, the urgency of this measure becomes apparent.
The maxim 'quantity before quality' has lost none of its force.
BSE did not occur by chance, it was an inbuilt consequence of the system.
Nevertheless, it has led to a process of rethinking, which even the powerful farming lobby will find it difficult to stop.
The fact that investment aid will be used not only to increase production, but also to increase quality, is thus an especially positive and important aspect of this draft regulation.
Aid for diversifying sources of income, such as tourism and craft activities, will reinforce the independence and viability of small agricultural holdings.
Similarly, producer and marketing associations are perhaps the answer to the large-scale decline of farming and the resulting pressures on the labour market.
In the environmental sector too, the need to break new ground - which is essential for sustainable development - is being recognized.
The energy and water saving and land improvement measures must be adequately funded, so as to make these attractive to farmers as well as to the public at large.
The strengthening of agricultural structures is a pan-European issue, which has significance beyond the farming profession and forms the basis for ensuring the survival of farming into the future.
