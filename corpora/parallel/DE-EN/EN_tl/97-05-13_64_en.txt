Mr President, as Mr Lannoye has already said, this directive does not meet the environmental criteria.
It could be a very significant directive, but it offers no incentive whatsoever to restrict the use of biocidal products.
Of the 450 active substances and 10 000 biocidal products already circulating on the internal market, only a handful will be authorized under the method proposed in the directive.
The EU is primarily restricting itself to harmonizing the opportunities for industrial competition, instead of ensuring maximum health and environmental protection where these substances are used.
The substitution principle must be established here: in other words, toxic products must be replaced by less toxic ones.
As Mr Lannoye said, this is one of the most important criteria.
It would also at last make it possible to compete for authorization.
The European Union should therefore be looking to take up the Swedish type of legislation, which links such authorization to the principle of competition.
The criteria for the authorization of biocidal products are flawed on many counts, but the main one for us is that, in the case of some biocides, no minimum value is set for carcinogenic ingredients.
These ingredients are carcinogenic even at very low concentrations, and biocides containing carcinogens should be withdrawn from the market immediately: given that biocidal products are in such wide use, our objective must be to eliminate carcinogenic substances from them, and hence from the market.
We would also be very much in favour of compulsory labelling for biocides.
Our aim must be to protect consumers and safeguard the environment, and not to give free rein to the biocide industry.
