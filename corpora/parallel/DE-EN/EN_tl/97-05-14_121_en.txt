Mr President, Commissioner, I recently received a copy of the Commission's first end-of-year report - for 1996 - on how the resources made available by Parliament and the budgetary authority are being spent in the former Yugoslavia.
Of the ECU 125 million in the essential aid programme, the proportion committed in 1996 was 66 %, and this gives no indication of what was actually paid out.
Precisely ECU 2.1 m was committed from the ECU 27.6 m available in reconstruction aid.
In the area of aid for repatriation, which is so urgently needed to allow refugees to return home, ECU 8 m out of a total of ECU 25.7 m was committed, and of the ECU 35 m earmarked for 'Europe for Sarajevo' - to which the House attaches such importance - exactly ECU 3.2 m was committed in 1996: only committed, mind you, not paid out.
Is it any wonder that if you go to Sarajevo - as I did two and a half weeks ago - you meet people who ask what the Commission and the European Union have actually done.
What visible proof is there that the reconstruction aid is in fact getting through?
In effect, the Commission report for 1996 exposes the bureaucratic and inefficient approach which has been adopted here.
I should like to ask the Commission a question: why is it not possible to adopt a less bureaucratic approach?
We managed it in Mostar, so why not in other cities?
And why is the IMG unable to act on our behalf on the ground?
Why, instead of continuing to administer the resources centrally from Brussels, do we not cooperate with organizations such as the BÃ¤rbel Bohley programme for 1000 homes in Bosnia - a project with a minimum of red tape which has been able to put 3 million to good use?
All these questions are of critical importance for the Commission, and I hope that we shall manage to do rather better in 1997.
