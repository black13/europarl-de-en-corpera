I agree with you entirely, Commissioner, because you have made it clear that the first step has not yet been taken.
We cannot demand regional cooperation if the people in these countries are still incapable of living together.
Nonetheless, we do have a duty and a responsibility to help them establish coexistence at national level: the next step will then follow by itself.
I think I have already made that point quite clearly.
