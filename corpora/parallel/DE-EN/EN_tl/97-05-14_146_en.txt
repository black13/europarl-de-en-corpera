Mr President, what is involved in this debate, and in the procedures that we are discussing here concerning bananas, is a battle between multinationals for market share.
Through the organization of the market in bananas, we strengthened the hand of European multinationals against their US counterparts, who then retaliated by resorting to the law.
But as we have just heard, it is the ACP countries, the small producers and countries, who are being left out of the picture, unable to intervene.
As a general rule, where we have an organization of the market that falls within the scope of the WTO, they too must be given access to the latter.
For the ACP countries, this means that the Caribbean islands, the Windward Islands and others must have an opportunity of stating their position.
We must support them in this respect.
It is our duty under the Lomé Convention to do so, and that is why it is right - as previous speakers have pointed out - that we should reach an agreement which gives these small islands access to appeal.
I believe this is essential if we are to complete Lomé IV and have a post-Lomé period.
We must ensure that social conditions continue to apply, because in many cases people are totally dependent on this crop, and we must also safeguard organic production and ensure that these producers can lodge an appeal.
