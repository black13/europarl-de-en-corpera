Mr President, there is ultimately no point in us discussing Zaire here today unless the European Union can finally bring itself to do what a number of speakers have called for and adopt a clear position on the subject.
Simply exchanging one head of state for another will do nothing to improve the situation, either in Zaire or in the neighbouring countries.
As other speakers have said, the only way forward is a complete espousal of democracy.
Without a fundamental change, there is a danger that the third largest country in Africa will fragment.
The fact is that present-day Zaire is an artificial creation of the nineteenth century, and the African countries - underrating in some respects their own history and culture - have agreed in the OAU Charter to respect the borders that were drawn by the colonial powers in the previous century.
Broadly speaking, that agreement has worked and succeeded in preventing wars between nations, despite numerous domestic conflicts.
However, looking at Zaire today, we have to say that it is one of those countries consisting of a number of ethnic groups where the only way to secure the future and prevent disintegration would seem to be through the adoption of a federal structure.
With such a structure, individual ethnic groups can enjoy a certain measure of independence and, in my view, this is a country which can only be governed securely as a federation.
At the moment, we cannot say whether Kabila will prove to be another dictator or a statesman.
He has not spelled out how, as the leader of an alliance of democratic forces, he envisages the transition to democracy, nor how he intends to set about holding the first democratic elections in a country beset by geographical and ethnic problems on such a scale.
