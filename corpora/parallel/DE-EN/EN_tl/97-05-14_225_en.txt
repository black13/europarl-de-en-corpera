Mr President, I assume that what we are talking about here is not primarily intelligence services, but rather the need to combat large-scale, international organized crime.
I would therefore ask you to indicate what steps the Council intends to take next in tackling large-scale organized crime.
Are there any specific proposals, either in the area of telecommunications or as regards forthcoming measures to be taken?
