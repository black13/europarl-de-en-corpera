Your first draft of this report, Mr Tindemans, in which you called for the creation of a defence identity for the European Union, was met by massive criticism in committee.
Your actual task was to develop a concept of security for all the citizens of Europe.
Europe must remain a civil power.
What you are doing, however, is building another fortress Europe, and in your report, you have taken defence to mean the defence of the special interests of the EU Member States, in other words of resources, sea lanes and transport routes.
Is what you are constructing here intended to be a new front between North and South?
Is Europe - a Europe of peace, law and freedom as it was founded, a civil Europe - supposed to become a military union?
That is what your report suggests.
You clearly state at a number of points that the goal is a defence identity.
The three-stage integration of the WEU - which will be dissolved as such next year - is designed to breathe new life into it, enabling it to carry out independent intervention tasks.
However, we - the young generation - do not wish to return to the traditional, outmoded system, where security means our own security alone.
We have long been aware that dictatorships can also be overcome by peaceful means.
There is now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has developed ways of breaching walls so that threats are no longer necessary.
A comprehensive joint model of security for the twentyfirst century will not entail a division between internal and external security, but an indivisible security order, a security order that tackles the causes of instability where they really lie, namely in the economic, social and development fields.
The range of civil instruments at our disposal must undoubtedly be extended.
The creation of a European civil peace corps is an important project in this context, and it will need us to exercise all our political, financial and material power.
