Madam President, I should like to ask the Bureau finally to take steps to ensure that Parliament's staff - I am not referring to the Members - are actually able to set foot in the restaurants during their short lunch-break.
Yesterday at 12.30 p.m., all the restaurants were full of visitors groups, so that Parliament staff had to queue for half an hour and spend at least another ten minutes finding a seat.
That is just not acceptable.
From 12.30 p.m. onwards, the restaurants are chock-a-block with visitors, and that can no longer be tolerated.
