Madam President, in the light of the Union's lamentable foreign policy performance, especially in the Balkans, the need for Europe's people and politicians to pull together in the security field, to install more rapid and effective decision-making mechanisms, and to speak with one voice on the international stage is greater than ever.
The report by Mr Tindemans provides an excellent basis for this.
Naturally, this issue poses a particular challenge to those Member States which are still officially neutral.
In Austria, the current security debate among the government parties somewhat resembles the confusion of tongues in Babel.
The pronouncements of those responsible change virtually every day.
It is dishonest, populist and improper to tell one's own citizens that it is possible to join NATO and still preserve a modicum of neutrality.
It is improper to look for a free ride in terms of security policy from the other Member States.
We cannot call on our EU partners for solidarity and support when we have a crisis, and then invoke our neutrality when another country needs our help.
Austria has to make up its mind!
The Freedom Party is the only Austrian party with a credible and honest policy in this respect.
We are a very reliable partner in any sensible projects which form part of European integration.
