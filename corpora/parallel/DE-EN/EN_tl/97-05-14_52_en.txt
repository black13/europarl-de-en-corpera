Mr President, Mr Tindemans is a champion of a common foreign and security policy in Europe, and in this respect we can and must support his report and congratulate him on it.
Our group's support would have been even greater and more heartfelt if the following points had been taken into account.
Firstly, the CFSP must be a common policy for all.
The neutral Member States, those bound by conventions and those abstaining in some areas must therefore also be given the opportunity to integrate into the CFSP.
Secondly, it must be quite clear that the civil components of the CFSP take precedence over the military components.
Military action has to be a last resort.
The civil components must be at the forefront.
And it must also be quite clear that pre-empting and preventing conflicts takes precedence over resolving them.
Thirdly, it must be quite clear that 'out-of-area' actions should be carried out with the greatest care and only under the aegis of the United Nations or the OSCE.
Since a rapid military intervention force has been mentioned, it must also be quite clear that while we do need such a force, at the same time we need a civil corps whose task is peace-making in the broadest sense of the word, and which is not tied to the military components from the outset.
And I would repeat here, on behalf of my group, that while we welcome the progress on this issue, we are hoping for more impetus in this direction in the future.
This will undoubtedly not be our last debate on the subject, and we shall be holding further talks with Mr Tindemans and other colleagues in this context.
