Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Titley's report is based on the economic pillars of increasing efficiency, reducing costs and improving coordination and international competitiveness.
It should therefore be greatly welcomed.
Mergers of arms companies within the EU improve their competitiveness, especially in relation to US companies, which have been putting massive pressure on the European arms industry since the end of the Cold War.
On moral grounds, it is completely unacceptable for us to increase the production and export of armaments, on the flimsy and cynical pretext of securing jobs.
However, we should as far as possible manufacture ourselves those armaments which we definitely need for the protection of the European Union and its citizens - for military and economic reasons, as well as in view of the extremely tense jobs situation in the EU.
From Austria's point of view, it could be asked whether the harmonization of arms export regulations called for in the report does not represent a further strategy - deliberately veiled from the Austrian people - for the progressive dismantling of its neutrality, and whether it would not be more honest to come clean with the citizens of the EU's neutral states and allow them to decide whether or not formally to give up their neutrality in a referendum.
