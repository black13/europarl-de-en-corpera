Mr President, first of all, Mr Titley should be thanked for addressing this far from pleasant but absolutely fundamental issue.
This is an industrial sector which is frequently beset by crises.
It is one in which - to be quite frank - there are very often scandals.
However - and I would address this comment to our colleagues in the Green Group - as long as we need a military defence capability, there will have to be an arms industry.
As long as we are sensibly working together here in Europe, it is also necessary to organize European arms cooperation.
All this has been said repeatedly.
However, there are three points which I should like to stress.
Firstly, disarmament is of course the paramount issue.
We have overcapacity.
The aim of a common European arms policy must therefore be to reduce this overcapacity in an orderly way.
Secondly, we must pursue the goal of easing the pressure on public budgets.
It has frequently been the case in the past, and is probably still the case, that defence contracts are awarded purely on economic or employment policy grounds, and not with the primary - and sensible - aim of improving defence structures.
My third point concerns arms export policy.
A common European arms policy is a prerequisite for an export policy guided by the following principles: no arms exports to regimes which violate human rights; and no arms exports to regimes which are totalitarian in nature or pursue aggressive policies.
Clearly, this is only possible if we conduct arms policy jointly...
