Mr President, I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on his report.
I appreciate that he has tried to present a sober and objective report, since this is unfortunately a subject which sometimes gives rise to heated debate.
I should like to make four comments.
Firstly, I agree with the rapporteur that Europe has been lagging behind developments in a number of areas, with the effect that it can no longer keep up with its competitors in this hightech sector.
The gap between European and US defence technology has been steadily widening, and even Europe's leading defence companies are scarcely half or a third of the size of their American counterparts.
Secondly, with regard to NATO enlargement towards the east, it would appear that in several cases, Europe has already missed the boat.
Some of our future partners in the alliance are already upgrading their military technology with non-European help.
Thirdly, I wish to stress that the question of export controls remains extremely important, but that controls alone are not enough.
We need to combat the illegal trade in arms effectively, because we are implicated in that trade.
Let us just consider the conflict regions and crisis areas in the developing world, or in the former Yugoslavia, where illegally acquired anti-personnel mines made in Italy have been found, for example.
Fourthly, the European Union accepts its role in conflict settlement and crisis prevention, but this also means ensuring the personal protection of the troops in question with coordinated and high-quality weaponry, so that they can carry out their tasks effectively.
