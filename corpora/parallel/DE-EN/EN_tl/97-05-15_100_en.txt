Mr President, what Sir Leon Brittan said about the Helms-Burton compromise in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights really is breath-taking!
After praising the WTO year after year as the master of law and order, as a rules based system, he suddenly thinks we need not be too particular about the rules.
But surely rules are designed as a weapon for the weak to defend themselves against the unreasonable demands of the mighty!
After all that is why the WTO was necessary, because, as it kept being impressed on us, the USA and let us say Swaziland had to be subject to the same rules.
Now that is all old hat.
The EU has suspended the WTO proceedings because it was afraid of winning.
For even before the WTO was established the USA threatened that it would withdraw if decisions were taken against its interests three times.
Well, where do we actually stand now?
In the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights Sir Leon Brittan likened the WTO talks to a poker game.
Correct!
But it so happens the Americans are better poker players.
They hold the bank, they were good at bluffing and Sir Leon Brittan has dropped out of the game with a royal flush in his hand.
We in the Green Group in the European Parliament have always opposed this WTO round of poker.
We are for fair play in world trade, for fair chances, not for the right of the strongest, of those who can put most money down!
Europe should have given a sign here that the same rules of play apply to everybody, big or small.
Instead it has gambled away any remaining credibility.
We are in favour of a reform of the WTO.
We called for other rules from the start, such as more transparency, democratic control and social and ecological responsibility.
And as far as China joining the WTO is concerned, we keep hearing it repeated that we have to show the Chinese that membership means abiding by the rules.
Well, do you seriously believe that the Chinese cannot read the papers, or how do you think it looks?
