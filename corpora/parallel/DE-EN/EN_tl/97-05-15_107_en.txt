Mr President, Commissioner, you described the basis of the agreement.
Our main criticism is that the Act is contrary to international law.
If I understood you correctly, you accept that the Act should remain in force for the time being, provided the terms of the agreement are respected, and nothing will change during that time.
What means and chances do we the European Union have and what means do you intend to use to ensure that this unlawful Act is also repealed by Congress?
