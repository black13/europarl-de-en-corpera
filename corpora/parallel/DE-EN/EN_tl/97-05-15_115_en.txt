Mr President, first let me draw a distinction of principle in relation to our political decisionmaking: on the one hand we are talking about the conduct of the Iranian head of state in terms of international law and on the other about the measures we want to take to help the victims and sufferers of the earthquake in northeastern Iran.
I believe we must help these people; it is a humanitarian question, a question of emergency aid.
We want to extend our sympathy to these people and their families and express our solidarity and I hope the emergency aid will be provided as soon as possible under the ECHO programme.
But that must not prevent us from condemning the state terrorism in Iran in our political debates and on a daily basis and from taking the appropriate measures here too.
The Mykonos judgment of 10 April made it clear that top-level Iranian politicians gave the order to murder Iranian dissidents.
The same was clear in April 1989, when the Kurdish leader Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou was murdered in Vienna.
This cannot be tolerated.
As said earlier, the European Union must take firm action here.
If my information is correct, I wonder why the Italian ambassador is still in Iran.
Perhaps the President of the Commission can say something about this.
At the same time, we must pursue a policy of small steps.
We should grant asylum to the democratic opposition figures in the European Union and we cannot allow this granting of asylum to depend on the political decision of Iran, as happened in the Federal Republic of Germany.
I think that is a contradictory political attitude, which the European Union must put a stop to immediately!
