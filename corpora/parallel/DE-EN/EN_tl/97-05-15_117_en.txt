Mr President, Iran is facing major problems in its financial and economic policy and in human rights, which is in fact a regional problem.
The people want prosperity and social security, but the massive military investment causes the region many problems.
A policy of confrontation has never brought economic success with it but only poverty and despair for the general public and pride for the very few.
Intellectually it is of course rather more difficult to seek consensus and to think in terms of alternatives.
Europe should serve as a model!
Let us begin by analysing the problems, at least until the election, and let us then offer solutions.
Let us give even stronger support than before to those circles that want cooperation.
