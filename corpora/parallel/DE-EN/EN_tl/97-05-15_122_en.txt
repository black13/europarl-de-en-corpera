Mr President, Mr Van den Broek answered that the Italian ambassador was in Iran before the Council decision.
But he did not say whether he is willing to come back or whether the other Member States asked him to come back or whether he intends to come back.
My second question is this: are there any other European Union ambassadors over there?
