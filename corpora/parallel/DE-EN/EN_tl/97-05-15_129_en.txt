Mr President, we are concerned about the 12-year civil war in Sudan, which has grave consequences for the civilian population, including starvation, malnutrition, migration, etc.
We are also concerned about the worsening human rights situation, reflected by arbitrary arrests of opponents of the regime and lamentable prison conditions.
We regret the fact that the Sudanese government is refusing to allow humanitarian organizations to enter the war zones and support the civilian population, which needs a regular supply of humanitarian aid.
We also regret the Sudanese government's decision to block Operation Lifeline Sudan again and thus prevent humanitarian organizations from assisting those in need in this area too.
Lastly, we are angered by the provocative stance of the Sudanese government vis Ã  vis the repeated warnings by the international community, and in particular Security Council Resolution 1070 of 16 August 1996.
That is why we call on the government to end the civil war, to promote a peaceful settlement of the conflict, to release the political prisoners and to authorize Operation Lifeline Sudan and we call on the Commission of the European Community to respond to the Security Council's appeal and grant the requested emergency aid of $ 120 million.
