MR President, although I too support this joint resolution at the same time I am not too optimistic that our demands can be implemented.
We note that opposition to the regime has flared up again.
But this is because the so-called opposition in the country has united, that it has managed to bring the disparate ethnic groups that are against the Khartoum regime under one hat, so to speak.
As before, however, the ethnic divisions remain visible.
There is little hope at present of a cease-fire, for a few days ago one of the leading military figures of the SPLA said in the Neue ZÃ¼richer Zeitung that its objective is to overthrow the regime and that all its military actions are directed at achieving that aim.
At the same time Mr Garang reminded in this interview that conflicts of this kind create civilian victims but added that the SPLA are prepared to keep the numbers of such victims as low as possible.
In the light of that I feel it would be a little more hopeful to negotiate with these forces on access for humanitarian aid rather than with the current regime, which is facing difficulties on many fronts and in particular on very long fronts.
So I would expect a better response to our call for humanitarian aid to be authorized again if we managed to reach agreement with the current opposition, since it has managed to create a kind of political organization.
