Madam President, we have been discussing violations of human rights in Turkey nearly every month, although we had hoped the situation might improve.
In this context let me refer you in particular to the resolution of 13 December 1995 on the situation of human rights in Turkey that we adopted here, because at that time we had expected that the customs union might lead to improvements in the political situation.
This did not happen.
I think we have to draw the appropriate political conclusions.
I was in Turkey early last week.
A conference was being held there on organized crime and just as it was taking place a television transmitter was attacked by police or paramilitary forces.
This created a great stir in Turkey and was further evidence that there is no media freedom there.
The background to this story was a report on drugs and on a drugs deal involving the name of Mrs Ciller, which suggests close contacts here with organized crime in Turkey; so we have to ask what policy the European Union is pursuing here.
The reason for today's discussion is the award of the prize for journalism to Isik Yurt√∏u, who was condemned to 15 years in prison, and I think the way human rights are being violated there should really spur us on to fight for the release of this journalist, for he has committed no crime.
