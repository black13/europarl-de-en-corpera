Madam President, it is simply intolerable for the whole world to stand by and watch the people of North Korea starve to death while UNICEF keeps appealing for aid.
It is a matter of hundreds of people a day!
Soon it will be thousands and tens of thousands.
We have just given money for the victims of the earthquake in Iran without further discussion even though it is a richer country.
Here we do nothing!
It is not the fault of the children, the old and the infirm that they are ruled by a communist regime, without much democracy.
Normally, under similar circumstances, we give money to other countries that are not ruled democratically.
We must remember that we, the EU, are in fact involved in a project in North Korea.
We are supporting the construction of 2000 megawatt nuclear reactors to the tune of ECU 75 million.
The money is going to a country where the people are eating grass, are starving, to a country that has refused to sign the ban on chemical weapons, which is ruled by a military dictatorship, which has no infrastructure, no industry at all.
And we spend ECU 75 million on that!
We have a reserve of ECU 10 million.
I would like us to use that money to give immediate help to the people there, especially the children.
It really is a scandal for any civilized country just to stand by and watch even though it knows the extent of the misery in that country.
The FAO says that we need another $ 14.5 million to establish programmes to help North Korea to grow seed crops that will produce some kind of harvest for them again.
So I ask you to endorse my group's motion, for we owe this to the people there, especially to the children!
