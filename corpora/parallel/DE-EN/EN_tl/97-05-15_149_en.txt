Madam President, I must say that the famine in Korea referred to in the motion for a resolution is nothing new and that we have been hearing about the floods out there again and again.
I support the calls that we should mobilize more aid.
But on behalf of my group I would say that we should not confuse the issues here, for I believe that the question of industrial policy, of establishing industrial plant, including the construction of a nuclear power station, belongs under a different heading.
What I miss in this urgency is a reference to the responsibility of the North Korean government.
We believe that good government is always a factor of development, which we must take into account, given that we also call for democratization and suchlike in other contexts.
So we will endorse the motion for a resolution subject to the appropriate amendments.
