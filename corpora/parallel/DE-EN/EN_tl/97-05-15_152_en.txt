Madam President, I totally reject the suggestion that I defer to or in any other way sympathize with a communist system.
I think it is outrageous.
I and my family suffered serious persecution by the communist system.
I totally reject that!
It is quite impudent!
Just because I did not list all the crimes that were perpetrated there.
They would have filled a whole book.
In a moment I will be telling you about all the other Western-oriented countries where similar things happen.
If you would only read our motion for a resolution more carefully, you would not make such outrageous insinuations, if I may make myself quite clear!
Let it be quite clear to everybody here: I have nothing to do either with dictatorships or with communist systems!
You are insinuating this just because I am a member of the Greens.
