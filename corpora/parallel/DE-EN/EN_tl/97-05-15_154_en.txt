Madam President, the Commission keeps referring to its social and ecological responsibilities and giving top priority to respect for human rights in its international agreements.
But when it comes to practical support, sadly there is little evidence of this.
One example is the rugmark label, supposedly a model of social regulation in rug production.
Rugmark could be a real means of eliminating child labour, and in particular of offering the children concerned alternatives.
Germany supports this initiative yet the Commission is refusing to finance it, producing rather threadbare arguments.
Too many lobbyists from certain countries and certain undertakings probably visit the Commission offices rather too often.
What we want is quite simple: throw the lobbyists out of the Commission offices!
Initiatives such as the Rugmark and the Clean Clothes campaigns must be given adequate support!
The Commission should grant additional tariff preferences to countries which comply with the fundamental ILO conventions.
It should support existing efforts to eliminate child labour and set up its own aid programmes.
So we firmly support the motion for a resolution.
