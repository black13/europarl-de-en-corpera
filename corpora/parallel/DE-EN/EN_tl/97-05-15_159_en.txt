Madam President, the world-wide fight against child labour is showing its first signs of success.
The work of the Rugmark Foundation in India and Nepal, which we in the SARC delegation of the European Parliament are following with particular interest, is a successful initiative.
But let me tell the European Commission that it and the Clean Clothes campaign need more than words of support, they need special aid.
As before, there is still a great need for action.
Measures to prevent the exploitation of women and children are in no way interference in the affairs of sovereign states and they certainly do not reflect what is called a Western perspective.
On the contrary, we need a worldwide internal policy to help establish human rights.
The world-wide ban on child labour needs to be supplemented by further practical measures to ensure that families are prepared to help support the fight against child labour.
Education and training for young people, the appointment of qualified teachers and adequate pay, village cooperation, the creation of trade and craft networks, active local awareness-raising measures and support for the NGOs' work.
That is how to help families to secure themselves and their children a life of dignity.
