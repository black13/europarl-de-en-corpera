Madam President, this motion for a resolution calls on the government to take stronger action against gangs and other criminal elements.
This certainly needs stressing, but we must also consider the extent to which a government is capable of doing so.
Without wanting to qualify that information, however, we have also heard it said that the government definitely wants to make efforts in that direction.
And we should not forget that Kenya was the point of departure and logistical basis for many measures, including EU ones, in the Great Lakes area.
I would therefore ask the Commission perhaps not to freeze everything across the board, but to take a selective approach and to start up a few projects so that we then still have a chance to go further.
Nor should we forget that without Nairobi airport, we would have faced very very great difficulties in carrying out certain measures.
