Mr President, we need a fundamental discussion of the use of nuclear technology for supplying energy.
Accidents and leaks from nuclear reactors have increased rather than decreased in recent years.
We are all aware of that.
If there is broad opposition to the transport of nuclear material, as there is in Germany, for example, this transport also has to be included in the estimate of costs.
That is another reason to look closely at the nuclear industry as such.
It is certainly a fairytale to say that we cannot do without it.
In fact nuclear energy poses a constant threat that will continue long after our generations have died.
I believe it is also a question of democratic policy.
In the foreseeable future Sweden will abandon nuclear energy.
Then the countries against it, including my own, Austria, will be in the majority.
It is also a matter of democratic decision-making to consider how to get out of it.
It is quite incorrect to declare that nuclear energy is an environmental technology, because in fact radiation survives for thousands of years.
Who would be so presumptuous as to give guarantees of safety over such a long period of time?
And the statement, supposedly based on scientific evidence, that nuclear fuel can be used in a cycle is one that I do not think anyone in this Chamber believes.
