Mr President, I can certainly support what most of my colleagues have said.
I am convinced that any President of the Council could have been proud to receive any NGO if the European Union had acted in unison here and that the NGOs would have been just as happy to visit any national president if they had known that the European Union had spoken with one voice.
We cannot repeat that often enough.
How else are we to show our citizens that a common foreign policy is something that really has to be fought for?
We as the European Parliament can only point to the weaknesses that have become apparent.
I said the other day that I would rather be a Member of Parliament than a diplomat, for last year in Geneva I saw how hard European diplomacy struggled to get precisely this human rights resolution on the agenda, which of course it has not managed this year because of its lack of unity.
So in future we really should think of the citizens and be united and then we will also achieve more in China.
