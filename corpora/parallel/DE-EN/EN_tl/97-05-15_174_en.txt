Mr President, the resolution supporting Denmark and the Netherlands against China's blackmail actually tallies well with the stance of Parliament, which has constantly underlined that we cannot use two yardsticks in human rights questions.
So let me point out that during the last plenary partsession our Parliament condemned China for its serious human rights violations in East Turkestan and thus set an example of honesty and genuine representation of the people, which sadly neither the United Nations nor the EU as a whole, given that it is represented only by government representatives, has managed to do.
Denmark in particular deserves our strong solidarity, for we must never forget that by recognizing the Baltic states against all opposition that country made an enormous contribution to the decolonization of the former Soviet Union.
Today Jacques Chirac is going to China and in the run-up to that visit he spoke of a global partnership with China.
I can only hope that not just China but Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland will also be given their due place in that partnership.
