Mr President, some things are repeated again and again.
For instance, it is said again here that nuclear energy is safe and that safe final storage sites do exists.
Whenever we hear such statements, we have to contradict them, and let me say in advance that there are no safe final storage sites.
I think the rapporteur has managed something very difficult.
An energy programme that is unsure of itself from the outset, that is very weak from the outset, that tries to ignore very concrete statistics and findings, is incredibly difficult to correct.
The rapporteur has tried in all honesty to do so.
We have long known that we will make much more headway in the medium term with CO2 -free renewable energy technology than with nuclear technology.
What are you saying?
(Interjection: nuclear energy is CO-free!)
That is disputable nor is it scientifically tenable as it stands, but we discussed that this morning.
In the proposal before us now it looks as though nobody had considered what we discussed here this morning and what we voted on a short while ago.
Of course the question of an energy tax concerns future technological development and it is also significant that the anthropogenic greenhouse effect was excluded.
