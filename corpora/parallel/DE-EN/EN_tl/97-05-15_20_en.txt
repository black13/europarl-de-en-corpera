Mr President, unfortunately I cannot congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Soulier.
I think the report glosses over the basic questions and that it is contradictory.
I consider it quite intolerable for the explanatory statement to contain the phrase: ' Nuclear power... has demonstrated its economic effectiveness.'
At the same time the report also admits that central questions such as cost, dismantling and storage have still not been resolved.
Secondly, the question of Eastern Europe has just been raised.
That will be a difficult issue during the accession negotiations.
How is this problem to be resolved in terms of costs?
Thirdly, paragraph 17 refers to balanced investment in research.
Exactly the opposite is needed.
We need an unbalanced research policy that favours research into renewable, alternative energy sources.
Fourthly, it is said that specific information should be provided on the advantages and disadvantages when exporting nuclear technology.
It is far more important to examine alternative energy sources in these countries.
On all these points I quite definitely reject the report and will support all the amendments relating to abandoning nuclear energy.
