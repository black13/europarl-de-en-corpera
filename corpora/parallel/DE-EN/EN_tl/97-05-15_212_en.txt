Mr President, I too believe that the social provisions in question relate first and foremost to driving times and rest periods, and if we remember the two figures that were just cited, three million drivers and about 50 000 lives lost, we realise that this is not a minor report that could perhaps be briefly discussed on a Friday morning but a report that needs to be considered by the Committee on Transport, the Committee on Social Affairs and by all the MEPS and people who really are seriously concerned about safety on the roads of Europe and elsewhere.
We also know that this regulation is more than necessary given the pressure of competition and also of the trend towards 'just-in-time' deliveries and that if it is not respected, competition will be pursued at the cost of safety and of elementary working conditions.
If Parliament is now evaluating the situation, I would simply summarize it under three headings which, in my view, are also the cornerstones of efficient implementation: uniform application, uniform checks, uniform fines.
If we deviate from these principles at all, then we will continue to have competition at the cost of safety, even at the cost of deaths in Europe.
In my view these are important points, which can also be supported by technological development.
I believe that we must call for the rapid introduction of inviolable electronic chronotachographs and Parliament would welcome initiatives of this kind.
Of course we also regret the late consideration of this report, although we know that the statistics it quotes have worsened rather than improved in the meantime.
We congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and hope the Commission will pay it the attention it deserves.
