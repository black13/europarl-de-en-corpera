Mr President, Austria decided against the use of nuclear energy in a referendum, and that is the strongest mandate a politician can have.
At present there exists no nuclear power station in which an MCA, a maximum credible nuclear accident, can be excluded.
So every nuclear power station in Europe concerns us all.
The question of nuclear waste, which will produce highly dangerous radiation for thousands of years, has not been resolved at all.
Yet we happily go on producing.
We really are a curious, inhumane, immoral generation.
Do not misunderstand me: nuclear energy may be a great opportunity for mankind.
But we still have to invest a lot of money and also time in research.
It would be irresponsible not to try to develop this young technology further, but it would be equally short-sighted not to put just as much money and brain-power into developing renewable energy sources.
Today we can only say a definite no to every new nuclear power station, every report in favour of it.
But we are also against quite simplistically no longer giving assistance in the areas set out in the Euratom Treaty, e.g. in relation to research and also to safety standards.
People are always looking boldly to the future, sometimes via the circuitous route of a very very terrible past.
Let us remember Chernobyl.
We have to assume responsibility here, today, in the present.
We have to vote today according to the best of our knowledge and to our own conscience.
