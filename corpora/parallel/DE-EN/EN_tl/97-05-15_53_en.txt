Mr President, I think your proposal is a very sensible one.
It arose from the fact that this report is of course very controversial and was not prepared jointly.
In the Committee on External Economic Relations we voted by 31 to 30 on whether we should vote at all.
Now, of course, this committee has no proposal on the individual blocks, which has led to a situation where we are confronted with this procedure in plenary.
You have described it in rather dramatic terms.
We also had 100 amendments to Mrs Barthet-Mayer's report yesterday.
I would now propose further that we consult again in committee and vote in July.
That would save time.
So I move that we refer the report back to committee pursuant to Rule 129.
That would save us work here.
In other respects I support your proposal.
