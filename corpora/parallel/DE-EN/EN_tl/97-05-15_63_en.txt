Mr President, there are still different interpretations of the legal basis for this text.
Does this text relate to industrial policy or, as Mr Titley said in his statement, to the CFSP, i.e., to the new security policy?
If it relates to that, then - and I asked to speak before the final vote - we in this House are not even competent, prior to the Amsterdam intergovernmental conference, to take the kind of decision we have taken.
Perhaps you could make a statement on this subject, to clear up this misunderstanding and contradiction?
