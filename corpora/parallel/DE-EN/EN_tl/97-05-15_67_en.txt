Mr President, I am really sorry but we have made a serious mistake.
That really is true.
In one go we have named four regions in different countries together with one recognized country.
We cannot refer to Macedonia or, if you like, Fyrom, in the same breath as Kosovo and Vojvodina.
I would emphatically ask colleagues not to make this mistake.
It makes us look ridiculous.
It is a mistake, and Mr Cohn-Bendit agreed with me.
Unfortunately we voted first on the PSE motion, although the other went further.
I would ask you to definitely take that into consideration.
We really are making ourselves look ridiculous.
If we want to do so, we can.
But Mr Cohn-Bendit could help me here, as could the PSE.
Mr Johannes Swoboda agreed with me.
