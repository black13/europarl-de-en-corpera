Mr President, there is a translation error in Amendment No 22.
It says 'repeal of the EURATOM Treaty' , but it should have read 'amendment' .
Of course we cannot simply repeal the EURATOM Treaty, we need it as a safeguard and for nuclear waste.
That is why confusion arose throughout this House and I think you can now agree with me, at least those who normally agree with me can do so.
The others over there are being a bit quiet for a change, which is a better thing!
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
