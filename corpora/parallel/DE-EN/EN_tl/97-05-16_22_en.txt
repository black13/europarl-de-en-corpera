Mr President, procedures for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations have an enormous impact on the competitiveness of European industry.
Now that we have decided to develop common strategies in the domains covered by the trans-European networks, namely energy, transport and telecommunications, the aim of which is to promote prosperity and job security in Europe, I believe that this regulatory mechanism will give us a distinct advantage in international competition.
The consequences are not only social and cultural; they also directly affect economic activity.
This technology itself can create entirely new jobs.
We need only consider the example of electronically controlled online shopping, which enables the customer to order goods and services personally at a distance.
In other words, the customer obtains direct access to a wide range of providers and can avail himself of their services.
That is why it is important that we in the countries of Europe should seek to make all our developments in this domain as transparent as possible, so that we can ensure that the advantages offered by one country will be of benefit to others.
It is also a matter of enumerating the precise areas in the domains of hardware, software and 'manware' in which we are making progress, in other words where training and technical harmonization have been improved.
These three domains are often intertwined.
Our success in making this field transparent will be of enormous importance to the European Community.
Broad freedom of access to these new opportunities is quite simply a fundamental right of our citizens and constitutes another step towards full implementation of the Treaty.
