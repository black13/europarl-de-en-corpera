Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, anyone who is familiar, within his own country or elsewhere, with the administration of EU projects will no doubt recognize the criticisms made in this report.
These criticisms can be summed up under two headings - too much bureaucracy and not enough transparency in regional promotion measures.
As long as these defects are not remedied, many a citizen of our highly developed member countries will regard this as further grounds for Euroscepticism.
As an Austrian Member, however, I find it extremely important that EU assistance should henceforth be used primarily to fight unemployment and indeed that the creation of jobs be made our foremost priority.
Jobs, however, are not created by supporting a few multinational giants, which will often strike sail at the first signs of an economic headwind, leaving their massive redundant crews to take to the lifeboats; on the contrary, jobs are created by promoting small and medium-sized businesses, which, after all, are the largest overall employers of manpower, not only in Austria.
What I should like to see being avoided in future might best be defined by means of an example.
Burgenland has been granted Objective 1 status and is to receive a total of 160m ECU from 1995 to 1999.
This money is to lead to the creation of 7, 300 new jobs.
If we consider, however, the way in which this assistance has been administered, it emerges that only 70 out of 9, 000 businesses are receiving support.
The largest slice of the cake, ECU 10m, has gone to the Lenzing company; this represents 30 % of a year's promotion funds.
This company has used the money to create only 120 jobs, which are already under threat because the parent group is reporting nine-figure losses.
I believe it is essential to prevent any such effects in future.
