Mr President, I should just like to raise a point of order, for which I apologize.
There were two roll-call votes yesterday, namely on the Titley report and the WTO bananas, in which I wanted to abstain rather than voting in favour.
I asked for that to be minuted.
However, it was not mentioned in the Minutes of these roll-call votes.
I should just like you to establish the reason for that, if you please.
It is pointless for us to make corrections if they are not recorded.
