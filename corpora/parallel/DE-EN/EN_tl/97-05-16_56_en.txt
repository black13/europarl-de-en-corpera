Madam President, my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur on an excellent report.
The aim of a united, socially and economically harmonized and permanently peaceful Europe is far less likely to be achieved by centralist strong-arm tactics than by sustained, far-reaching voluntary cross-border and interregional cooperation.
In this sense I should like to highlight a particular type of project which affects my immediate home area and which, I believe, merits respect on account of its uniqueness and its innovative and audacious character and should be supported by the European Union.
I refer to the joint bid by three States - Italy, Slovenia and Austria - to host the Winter Olympics.
These Olympics would be staged jointly by the federal state of Carinthia in Austria, the autonomous region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia in Italy and the Republic of Slovenia.
This would be the first time since the revival of the Olympic Games that any Olympics had been held in a region covering several States.
This region is trilingual, multicultural and multinational, but despite this - or perhaps precisely because of it - has decided to mount a joint bid to carry out this important cooperative project.
This mega-event, which would attract enormous media attention, could be a flagship pilot project in the realm of interregional cooperation, a project in the true European spirit with an inestimable symbolic value.
