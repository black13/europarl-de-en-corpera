Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these proposals will mean that enterprises, by submitting a single application, will obtain protection for their trademark as a Community trademark, not only in the Community but in all States which are party to the Madrid Protocol.
The Madrid Protocol provides for the international registration of trademarks to be effected by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva.
So if the European Community accedes to the Madrid Protocol, which we should welcome, applicants for and holders of Community trademarks will be able to apply for international protection of their trademarks by submitting an international application in accordance with the provisions of the Madrid Protocol, and holders of trademarks which have been internationally registered on the basis of the Madrid Protocol will be able to apply for registration of their marks as Community trademarks.
Consequently, these two systems are mutually complementary and will result in simplification on the basis of two systems becoming one.
I should also like to subscribe to this idea of making two into one.
We do not need two speeches on this subject.
I can associate myself entirely with what Mr Medina Ortega has already said, so I shall spare the House the other two minutes of speaking time, which will be my gift to the House as a contribution to the quality of life here and as a foretaste of the working of the Holy Spirit this coming Pentecost Sunday.
