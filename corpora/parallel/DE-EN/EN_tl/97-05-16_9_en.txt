Mr President, I have the feeling that I am the first with a genuine point to raise on yesterday's Minutes.
In connection with the topical and urgent debate on Turkey, yesterday's Minutes state that McMillan-Scott, Habsburg-Lothringen and Lenz withdrew their signatures from the amendments on behalf of the PPE Group.
I am anxious to point out that I never signed those amendments.
I had nothing to do with the motion.
I did not sign it.
I signed another motion, and my signature must somehow have found its way onto this motion.
I consider it important to have that recorded in the Minutes.
