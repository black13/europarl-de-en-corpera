Mr President, following what the Commissioner has said today, I really must make the point once again that we have more than 20 million people out of work in Europe, with one in five young people unemployed and unable to find work, and I have to say that the Commission's recommendation for the broad economic policy guidelines can only be described as toothless.
It offers no real prospects for working people in Europe.
It is for that reason, and in order to focus attention once again on the employment issue, that the trade unions in Europe have called today's day of action.
It is a protest and a warning which we, as parliamentarians, must take very seriously indeed if we wish to ensure social stability and social peace.
Not without reason, the trade unions are looking to Amsterdam to make good the shortcomings of Maastricht.
A virtually exclusive focus on monetary value, stability and consolidation is too narrow.
If we fail to persuade the Council to make an active employment policy part of the broad guidelines for economic policy, and if we fail to create a policy mix under Article 3 so that we achieve the type of growth that generates jobs, the consequences will be a setback for Europe and a risk of conflict.
I welcome the clear line taken by the rapporteur on this question and her call for the guidelines to be more binding - something that the Commission was obviously unable to insist upon.
