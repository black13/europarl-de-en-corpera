Madam President, Mr Lannoye's report makes us aware that the financing aspect of health is also very much at issue here, and that there are also some departments which do everything possible to ensure that they remain unchanged.
I believe, however, that the systematic exclusion of therapies whose empirical effects can be recognized, but which cannot be explained or understood in traditional scientific terms, constitutes an unfortunate self-restriction on the part of conventional medicine.
I believe that recognizing complementary therapies would serve not only to protect patients from quacks and charlatans, but also to enrich conventional medicine with constructive new approaches and ideas.
I refer, for example, to holistic treatments, which regard people as more than simply the sum of their parts.
Traditional Western medical science would be in difficulties if it could not convince people through its high quality, but had to assert its position legally through a claim to be the sole legitimate representative.
All scientific claims to absolute right lead to totalitarianism, sooner or later.
I therefore believe that we must adopt Mr Lannoye's thought-provoking report.
