Madam President, in following this debate, one sometimes gets the impression that one has read the wrong document.
There is talk of witchcraft, and there are comparisons with the aviation sector.
Engaging in polemics and trying to conceal matters or present them in a totally different light does not help matters, in my opinion.
The point that different Member States have different regulations or problems is a reason for supporting Mr Lannoye's report, rather than an argument against it.
The ideological battle over this issue has rightly been condemned.
However, it is not enough to condemn this battle if a colleague who does so then falls into the same error and rides roughshod over doctors.
Our group has strong reservations and will vote against the report.
However, a number of Members in our group hope that the Commission will finally carry out a thorough study of the safety, effectiveness and scope of non-conventional medicine and take steps towards harmonization.
We hope that rules will be introduced in the interests of protecting public health, as well as in those of existing and perhaps future professions, not least in conventional medicine.
For example, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and I are of that opinion.
Although I am unable to endorse every paragraph and amendment, I broadly support Mr Lannoye's report, and I also fully agree with the substance of the comments made by Mrs Heinisch.
