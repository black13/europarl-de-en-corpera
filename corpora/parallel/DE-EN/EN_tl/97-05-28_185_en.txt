Madam President, Commissioner, since we are all in agreement, I should simply like to make two brief points.
I am somewhat disappointed that the Council did not agree to the Commission's proposal that the regulation should enter into force six months after publication, but has extended that period to one year.
I appreciate that airlines have to prepare themselves, but I preferred the Commission's proposal to the effect that six months are sufficient.
That would clearly have improved passenger protection and would have been better.
Commissioner, perhaps you should say something about one of Parliament's amendments which I regard as particularly important.
Amendment No 4 by Mr Gonz치lez Trivi침o calls on the Commission to ensure, in all future civil aviation negotiations with third countries, that those countries introduce liability rules in the interests of passengers that are similar to those laid down in the regulation.
You know that the Council frequently makes life difficult for the Commission in its negotiations with third countries.
We are therefore asking that legislation should be adopted to ensure that action is taken in the context of such negotiations.
Ensuring that European passengers have the same rights of protection when they fly with non-Community airlines is presumably a concern that reflects both our views.
If we decide this jointly, Commissioner, if the Commission supports this request, the Council will create fewer difficulties for us.
And, above all, it will create fewer difficulties for you.
I would therefore ask you to comment on this particular amendment by Mr Gonz치lez Trivi침o, and to accept Parliament's proposal that this issue should be incorporated into all negotiations with third countries.
