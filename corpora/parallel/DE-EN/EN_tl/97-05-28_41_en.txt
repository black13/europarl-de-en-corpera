Mr President, Commissioner, you know that many Members of the House made their approval of the customs union with Turkey contingent on compliance with the call for an immediate Turkish withdrawal from northern Iraq.
The previous operation in 1995 involved 30 000 troops and around 50 tanks.
As you are well aware, the present operation is on a much bigger scale, with the deployment of 50 000 troops, 250 tanks, F14 and F16 bombers and Cobra helicopters.
There is no reason to expect a withdrawal in the foreseeable future.
I should like to ask, Commissioner, whether you consider such an intervention to be compatible with international law.
What practical steps does the Commission intend to take to compel the Turkish armed forces to withdraw?
And could you please explain what you mean by saying that Turkey has been asked to exercise restraint?
What do you mean by restraint?
And how, in your opinion, can the human rights of the civilian population be effectively guaranteed?
