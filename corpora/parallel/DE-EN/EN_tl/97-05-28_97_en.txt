Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is right that we should deal jointly with the stability pact and the broad economic policy guidelines.
Already last year, the House was advocating a policy mix as a means of moving beyond the obsession with stability.
At this very moment, Lionel Jospin is in the process of winning an election in France on a platform which includes the demand that European stability policy should be integrated into an economic regime.
It is also high time, I believe, that the Commission abandoned its blind belief in neo-liberalism and, instead of accepting a downward spiral of competitive deflation and fiscal dumping, changed course to return to and build on the ideas of Br√ºning, to create a situation and a policy that would take us beyond Keynes.
Mr Christodoulou, with his banker's intuition, rightly saw the error of the view expressed by one Member who said - not today, but in relation to these decisions - that even symbolic texts merited recognition.
To recognize texts that were merely symbolic would be to destroy our credibility, and credibility cannot be earned through the kind of automatic, mechanistic approach that amounts to policy by numbers.
It cannot be earned by strangling investment in the name of saving.
I should also like to mention another aspect which is dear to Mr Christodoulou, and that is territorial integrity.
It should be dear to us too, in the light of the increasingly bitter social divisions in our countries.
Anyone attempting to build on a stability policy that is not rooted in consolidation of the economy, socioenvironmental development and genuine economic convergence, and which does not serve the ultimate goal of implementing Chapter 10 of the Delors White Paper, must be prepared to face opposition.
They must be prepared to be sent packing: and, as we have heard today, there are people ready and willing to do just that.
