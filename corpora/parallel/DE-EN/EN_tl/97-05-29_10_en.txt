Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have had the single market for quite some time.
We also have gradually increasing cross-border mobility, but the free movement of workers is still inadequately underpinned by social security provisions and access to health care.
The Commission proposal and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report therefore represent the very first steps towards creating the minimum that is necessary to ensure that basic social rights continue to be guaranteed in the context of the growing cross-border mobility of workers.
It is important that the provisions will also apply to students and workers on vocational training courses, since this an area in which mobility is particularly increasing, thereby contributing to the consolidation and development of the internal market in paid employment.
I would also stress the importance of ensuring that third-country nationals are no longer discriminated against, as at present.
We must continue to take steps in this direction.
There are other wishes that remain unfulfilled.
Since we are interested in ensuring the development of cross-border mobility within the European Union, we are also interested in making it possible for workers to take benefits from their own Member State with them when they go to reside temporarily in another Member State.
In its assessment of the possibilities here, the report falls short of what is required.
To sum up, it can be said that in those areas where Parliament has a say, it clearly has difficulties securing even small advances.
Only in areas in which it has no say can it formulate broad principles.
We must finally overcome this discrepancy.
We must introduce genuinely principled and radical policies in our legislative processes.
