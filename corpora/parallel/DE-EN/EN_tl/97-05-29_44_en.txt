Mr President, a mistake has occurred in paragraph 6, because a phrase was omitted in the text produced by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The chairman of the committee and the rapporteur also agree that there has been a misunderstanding.
The phrase 'calls in particular for a minimum tax rate to be levied on all incomes in the EU' must be added to paragraph 6.
This was a completely uncontroversial point that was decided almost unanimously in committee.
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
