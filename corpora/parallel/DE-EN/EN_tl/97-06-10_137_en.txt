Commissioner, you will have to put up with this stinging contribution from our European 'queen bee' because she is not wrong.
In the first place, it is good news when European taxpayers are prepared to make available ECU 15 m annually for something where the money is being well spent, where much can be achieved at little cost: the fight against varroasis, for instance, continues, and one of the fundamental ills of European apiculture is thus able to be tackled.
That money is not being frittered away, nor is it susceptible to fraud.
The scale insects are not, after all, European bees and cannot wreak the same kind of havoc here.
But I should like to urge both you and the Commission to take a further, long overdue step.
Mrs Lulling made it abundantly clear that this is about finally giving beekeeping credit for the ecological service it provides in Europe.
I want therefore to take up what has long existed in a peripheral region of the European Union, the Canary Islands, namely a hive-related premium.
I think that what is possible in the Canary Islands must be feasible in the rest of the European Union also, although the existing justification for this special premium in the Canary Islands, namely that the climate is particularly difficult, is not of course so apparent here.
I therefore urge you to take on board these long overdue and modest demands.
This is a contribution in the environmental interest and marks further progress for Europe's agriculture.
