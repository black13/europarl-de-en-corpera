Mr President, I wish to make a point concerning Question Time.
At the last plenary I put a question that was not reached and had therefore to be answered in writing.
My question concerned the then forthcoming Council meeting on 26 May.
I received an answer yesterday, dated 4 June, and I must protest about that.
I would ask that, in future, answers be sent out immediately.
