Commissioner, Madam President, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, whose determination extends to sporting a new dress that is the bee's knees to mark her birthday.
It seems to me that had she not been so persistent we should probably not have been holding this debate on bees today.
And it seems to me that we can only infer from what has already been said that we need to discuss bees, or apiculture will come to nothing.
If a matter is not discussed, then there can be no further progress.
Bees are valued in terms of the amount of honey and wax they produce but that undervalues them.
The contribution bees make to the natural environment, to birds, to crop pollination, to fruit, berry and oilseed production cannot be overestimated.
I myself grow rape and welcome every year the arrival of the beekeeper who comes and sets up his hives in my rape fields, because if he did not come or the bees did not fly, then the rape harvest would perhaps be only half of what it is now, as there would be only the wild insects to provide the pollination.
And so we should attach great importance to this incidental effect on the natural environment and, above all, we should attach greater political value to apiculture.
For that, clearly, we need not only older, experienced beekeepers, but young people who are enthusiastic about beekeeping.
It is terrible thing, but if you have vast experience and there is no-one to follow in your footsteps and take up beekeeping, then there will be no more beekeepers and no more apiculture either.
We have therefore to support the whole system - the bees, the honey, the wax and all involved with it - and the positive incidental effects of bees.
Bees provide great benefit and that benefit can be expressed in more than just financial terms.
