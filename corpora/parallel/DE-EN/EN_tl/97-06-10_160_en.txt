Mr President, I should like to begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report.
Given the failure of the negotiations on transit with Switzerland, the report is all the more topical.
As a Member for one of the most sensitive transit regions of the EU, the Tiroler Inntal or Brenner region, I particularly welcome the new and committed initiative towards combined transport, as we have already heard too much said but seen too little done.
Further developing the substance of the PACT programme is an important step in the right direction.
I am thinking here of the investment in intermodal transport equipment, the enhanced monitoring facilities and the increased promotion of specific projects as opposed to mere feasibility studies.
The financial framework that has been established and the increase from ECU 22.7 m to ECU 35 m are best described as token.
Moreover, in view of the enormity of the task that professionally combining European goods transport demands, technically and logistically speaking, and the advantages - consumer-oriented and speedier transport of goods as well lasting prevention of pollution - that avoiding unnecessary traffic could bring, it is, sad to say, extremely unsatisfactory!
