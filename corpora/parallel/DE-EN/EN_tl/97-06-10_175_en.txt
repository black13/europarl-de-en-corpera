Mr President, there is no doubt that tourism is a major economic factor as well as being critical to employment policy.
In Austria, for example, 17 % of GDP is earned from tourism.
That means that if we really want to take tourism seriously in those terms, then we have, in my view, to focus on at least three points.
Firstly, we should accord tourism the status of an autonomous Community policy, and that has been stressed by those who spoke before me also; secondly, we must do everything we can, that is to say, we must make available the resources to facilitate the PHILOXENIA programme, because that could in the end produce a Community policy that is to some extent a tourism policy for the Union; and, thirdly, we must create opportunities to improve staff quality through mobility and training programmes.
