Mr President, a few days ago we in the European Parliament held a meeting with those responsible for tourism and established that tourism is set to increase by about 10 % as a result of the introduction of the euro.
I therefore believe that the euro can be one of the main incentives for what is qualitatively speaking high-value tourism in Europe, and if we also succeed in making progress towards tax harmonization, for example, in the area of value-added tax in particular, then we shall probably have the best possible start.
Since tourism is very labour intensive, we ought also to consider whether reduced rates of value-added tax ought not to apply here.
The most important area has already been mentioned by Mr Pirker, that is, in my view, training and further training, and the LEONARDO programme in particular.
I believe that the LEONARDO programme offers many opportunities for our tourist industry and would ask that an even bigger effort be made here.
