Mr President, Mr Izquierdo Collado, let me first thank you for agreeing with me that LEADER II is in itself a sound Community initiative.
But when, in the case of a specific measure, it is not clear whether this is a single measure or two separate measures, as happened here, that is something that has to be cleared up.
But it is not a reason for simply shelving that procedure.
If, in future, you should encounter similar problems where, either for reasons similar to those you mentioned or for other reasons, the implementation of a LEADER programme has come to a halt, then I would simply ask you to let me know about it.
I should be glad to look into the matter.
