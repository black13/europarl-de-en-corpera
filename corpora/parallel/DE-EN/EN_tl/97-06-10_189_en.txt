Mrs Redondo, let me say it again: we are talking about LEADER II and not a mixture of LEADER I and LEADER II.
One thing is absolutely clear: LEADER I has already expired and we now have the LEADER II Community initiative.
I can assure you that it is not my intention nor that of my services to create additional bureaucracy here.
What we actually need simply a proper system.
And we have to have that system because we could otherwise come up against problems later when it comes balancing the books.
I repeat: if there are problems here, for whatever reason, I am prepared to help solve them.
Please tell me about them.
