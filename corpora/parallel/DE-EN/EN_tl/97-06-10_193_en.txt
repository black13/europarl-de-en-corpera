Mrs Banotti, I have to be quite candid with you and say that: firstly, it has long been known that this decision was coming, but instead of preparing for this new and necessary situation, the sector has done exactly the opposite and used the tax advantage to increase turnover.
And so it cannot be argued that jobs are now going to be lost because duty-free is no longer possible.
You could equally ask how many jobs have already been lost in normal trading which was at a clear competitive disadvantage as a result of this situation.
