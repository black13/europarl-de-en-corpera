Mr Sanz Fern√°ndez, I should like to make it clear that the question of whether actions for damages are likely to be successful will depend, in the first instance, on the judgment reached by the Court of Justice.
Apart from that, damages are primarily a matter for the national courts.
Such claims have therefore to be brought before the national courts.
