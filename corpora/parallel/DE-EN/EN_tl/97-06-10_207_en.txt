Mr Camis√≥n Asensio, when you say that this also constitutes violence and vandalism - and that may very well be the case - it remains clear that such attacks have to be proceeded against under criminal law.
But criminal law is in any event national law.
Criminal proceedings would have to be conducted in France.
What the Commission has criticized over and over again is that the French police authorities have been anything but active in intervening on-the-spot when such attacks are taking place.
We have also been able to document that irregular conduct.
We have just today - the oral procedure is today taking place before the Court of Justice - submitted videos and other documentation to prove this.
I hope then that something will finally be done and that the new French Government will take up this matter.
