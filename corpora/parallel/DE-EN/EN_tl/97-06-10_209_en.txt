Mr Marset Campos, if I may begin with your second question, I should like to make it clear to you that those attacks took place specifically before the new organization of the market in fruit and vegetables entered into force, after the old organization of the market then.
I cannot therefore see how the attacks are linked to the new organization of the market in vegetables.
Far from it, I am actually expecting the new organization of the market in vegetables to result in new developments, as we further encourage producer groups.
As regards your first question concerning the possibilities of the Commission intervening directly on site, I have, unfortunately, to say that the Commission does not have its own police or similar units, and I assume that the European Council in Amsterdam next week is unlikely to set up a Commission police unit of that kind.
So - unfortunately, I have to say - we are always dependent on the forces of law and order of the Member States.
Regrettably, all we can do is approach the Member State and ensure it meets its obligations.
If it does not, then our ultimate weapon, so to speak, is to bring the matter before the Court of Justice.
We have used that ultimate weapon and proceedings are now under way before the Court.
Nor are there any further possibilities under the Treaty either.
