The Commission does not share that view because what is currently provided for under Spanish legislation is in fact a monopoly, with only one system being accepted.
An alternative, which already exists on the market in Spain, by the way, is being excluded.
How anyone can consider that a prime example of free trade, I fail to see.
On the basis of our own directives, only a system that does not permit access to another broadcaster can be excluded.
We also brought in a technical expert, whom many describe as the king of decoders, if you do not find that description a little over-the-top, and that technical expert made it absolutely clear in the talks we had with both parties to the dispute that both systems are open, although they use different technologies and that the fact that it is necessary to negotiate in the case of the one system does not mean preclude a fair outcome.
The directive actually provides that the negotiations must be fair and non-discriminatory.
Let us just assume that the negotiations that have taken place this week were conducted by one side in an unfair and discriminatory manner.
That party would not then be acting in accordance with the directive.
But it is not possible to prescribe a single technical solution which, moreover, is not yet on the market.
That is not compatible with the directive.
The situation is, I venture to say, a little bizarre.
There is a system in Spain that already operates; thousands of viewers are working with that system and are completely satisfied.
The system is technically open, as the expert confirmed to us, but a different system, that is not even on the market, is to be made compulsory.
That is a situation in law or in fact that we do not find credible.
