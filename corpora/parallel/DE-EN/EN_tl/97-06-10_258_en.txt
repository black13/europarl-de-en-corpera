Mrs Garc√≠a Arias, I have made myself very clear here, and all we have done is to try to bring about agreement, including with the Spanish Government, by the way, because it makes no sense for us all to find ourselves before the Court of Justice again.
Someone would have to pay compensation, and the viewers would be no better off.
In Germany too, we brought the warring factions together, and they reached agreement.
That is why we tried to do the same in the case of Spain, but that does not, of course, mean that we want to shirk our duty to take a decision.
I have said that if agreement is not reached - and we shall know next week whether or not it has been - then we shall take a decision based on the directive I have quoted, but also based on Articles 30 and 59 of the Treaty of Rome.
I do not know whether it was the Spanish minister or someone else who said that we are not applying the Treaty of Rome.
I cannot understand that, since we are applying Articles 30 and 59, and so our decision will, naturally, be based on the directive and the Treaty of Rome.
