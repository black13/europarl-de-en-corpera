Mr President, you are casting me into despair here, because when I get a question from a Member of the House - three of them - which the President allows, I have to answer.
You would not perhaps have put the questions, nor did you, but when members of the other groups put them, the Commission has to deal with them.
Factually you are incorrect because our directive contains specific provisions on what is and is not permitted in relation to decoders.
That is the only issue here and that is why I have confined myself to it.
The directive does not, for example, say that there should be only one decoder.
We deliberately avoided that.
We did reserve the right in the directive to set a standard for a single decoder.
Were we to do that all of the parties involved would be very dissatisfied and suffer severe economic disadvantage, as the standard would probably not be met by any of the decoders currently in existence.
We have reserved for ourselves this ultimate weapon, if I may so describe it.
We did not allow the national governments to have it.
And so what we have here is a European problem and not just a Spanish problem.
I concede that the Spanish affair is livelier, but our problem is also a difficult one.
It can, however, be resolved.
