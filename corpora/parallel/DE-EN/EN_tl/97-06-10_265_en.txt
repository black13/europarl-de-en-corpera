As far as the Commission is concerned, we shall be telling the Spanish Government next week what our legal opinion is and where, in our view, the Spanish law is incompatible with the directive and the articles I have cited.
The Spanish Government may accept our view but it may also discard it.
In that case, we shall have to go to the Court of Justice and that is bound to take rather longer.
The question that we have not fully considered is whether we should ourselves then take a temporary measure or seek an interim order from the Court of Justice, since the Spanish law provides for a deadline, namely 7 July, after which no other decoder is to be permissible.
To prevent economic disadvantage, it might be appropriate to apply to the Court of Justice for an interim order, so that the deadline does not mean that an existing decoder has suddenly to be withdrawn from the market.
We shall look into that, but I can make no other promises.
If the Court of Justice decides that we and not the Spanish Government are right, then that government will of course have to pay compensation to the company that it has disadvantaged as a result of its decision.
That is clear but it is not particularly productive.
That is why we have tried to reach an agreement and we are still trying to ensure that if agreement cannot be reached, then the Spanish Government will at least agree not to apply the law but wait until the Court of Justice has reached a decision.
Then both systems will be able to develop alongside one another in Spain.
But I cannot, of course, tell you what the Spanish Government will say.
We are doing our best to arrive at a balanced and sensible solution.
But I cannot guarantee that all involved have adopted the same approach to the dispute.
It is, as I have said, a lively one.
In the bullring, there are bulls that will simply not be pacified.
