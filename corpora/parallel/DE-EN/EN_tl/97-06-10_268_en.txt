When we lay down a universal solution - and the time will come - then both of the systems currently on offer in Spain will have to go.
That is a difficult technical issue.
I do not know whether you are clear about it.
There are two possibilities: either you have a uniform decoder, through which all services, including conditional access, pay-TV etc, are able to be supplied.
That, if you like, is the ideal solution.
For that, there has to be a technical standard.
We shall get there one day, as the industry is working towards it.
But we do not want to dictate it; were we to do so everyone now commissioning or offering decoders would suffer enormous economic disadvantage.
They would have in fact to take their decoders off the market.
And so we said we would stipulate only a minimum.
That minimum is: anyone using a decoder must use one that is accessible to others.
That is not a matter of laying down a special technical procedure, it is simply ensuring access.
The Spanish legislation is not doing that, it is prescribing a decoder - not even a uniform decoder, by the way, but a decoder with a common interface.
That is another technical system.
That is not the ideal solution, namely that there should be only one decoder in existence, but it is a decoder that can, using a technical device, be made open to others.
Other decoders that are also open are not allowed.
That is precisely what the directive does not permit.
Do you follow me?
If you read the directive through once again - Mr Caudron confirmed this and what Mr Caudron says is true - you will see that what I have described to you here is the legislation in force.
That is the problem with the Spanish law.
