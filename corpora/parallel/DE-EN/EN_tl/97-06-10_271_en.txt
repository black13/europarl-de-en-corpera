The difference between you and Solomon is that he was far wiser than you, if you will allow me to point that out here.
Were I now to tell you how our decision looks, then both the parties currently engaged in negotiation would probably withdraw from those negotiations.
One side would be so certain of being acknowledged to be in the right that it would say: ' I do not need to negotiate any further!'
Therefore, it is more in the tradition of Solomon, and so somewhat wiser, not to say what we shall be doing next week.
