Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the issue today is not to do with documents, nor is it to do with disagreements about the structure that is to take us into the next millennium - the issue is the very important one of farm prices and compensation rules, though these things are not as controversial as they were in the past.
But this third subject of the 'special arrangement for durum wheat' is an important one for farmers in certain regions.
Sufficiently important, I think, to receive timely treatment.
Many thanks to the rapporteurs.
A little colour has now been brought into our debate.
I can only speak today about the durum wheat arrangement, and in this case the new proposal simplifies the changeover from individual premium entitlements to guaranteed maximum premium areas for each Member State.
This change is also welcome.
There was broad agreement on this among the Committee on Agriculture, as there also was on the particular proposals made by the rapporteur, Mr Baldarelli.
He has taken a great deal of trouble.
The 5 % reserve for young farmers and the increases in which it results receive our approval.
We do appreciate, however, that some countries - Austria and Germany, for example - do have justifiable claims for so-called non-traditional farming areas to be taken into consideration.
The cultivation of durum wheat has a long tradition in Germany.
Before the current premium rules came into force, Germany already had 25, 000 hectares of land under cultivation, and this would remain necessary.
