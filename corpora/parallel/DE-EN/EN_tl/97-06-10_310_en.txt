Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad to see that the President-in-Office is with us today.
In basic terms, Austria is a traditional durum wheat growing area, although that was not accepted or demonstrated in the accession negotiations.
So there is a tradition of durum wheat production in Austria, that can be traced back to the early 1960s and proved by planting entitlement certificates.
Furthermore, extensive exports confirm that Austrian durum wheat is also in demand on the international market because of its high quality.
I therefore particularly welcome the fact that the Committee on Agriculture has reassessed the situation and voted in favour of granting the durum wheat growing subsidy for 9, 600 hectares of land in Austria.
The 1992 plan to reform the agricultural policy has already improved the Community's agricultural situation.
The attractiveness of farming and rural areas, with all their varied functions, must be preserved.
The care and maintenance of natural resources, greater attention to environmental issues and the adaptation and continuing development of agriculture are important aspects of an integrated policy, in my view.
We must therefore offer farmers the certainty that the next WTO round will not be anticipated and that Europe will pursue a policy of stability.
The confidence of the farmers can be gained only by a policy planned on a relatively long-term basis.
I should mention in this connection that it is important that farmers are able to earn an income from their own original production, and that compensatory payments are only compensation.
The Common Agricultural Policy cannot be dictated by budgetary stringency alone if we want traditional farming to survive throughout Europe!
