Mr President, Mr Bangemann has explained to us at great length why things that should have happened long ago have still not happened.
Today, Mr Bangemann, we are discussing implementing provisions for the Novel Food Regulation and, if I may quote from the Green Paper for Food Law, Regulations are always to be used to increase the transparency of Community law and facilitate the application of its provisions within the single market so that implementing regulations by individual states are unnecessary.
What that means is that there must be implementing regulations at Community level, so that every Member State, when approving products, must do precisely what the other Member States are also required to do.
If we want a single market, then we need to construct that single market very carefully for products which are viewed by consumers with some mistrust as something new, something strange, we can't just say, ' We've had the legislation since 15 May and it's only 15 June now so there's still plenty of time.'
Mr Bangemann, you have had plenty of time for your services to prepare this, and I should think that the DG III administration would probably also be capable of it.
