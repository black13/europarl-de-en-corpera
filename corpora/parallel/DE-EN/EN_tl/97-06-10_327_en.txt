Mr Bangemann, basically, I cannot fully understand what you are saying.
There are things I do understand, but in April 1997 you wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that 'labelling contributes absolutely nothing' , and that of course rouses our curiosity.
We believe that labelling definitely does contribute something.
It contributes something to the consumer and it contributes something to the industry, and that is the opportunity we want to take.
After the grim experiences of BSE, we should take the opportunity offered by the Novel Food Regulation and put it to good use.
I think it has become clear here tonight that we are talking not about the content of the directive but about what we have made of that content.
You say that it only came into force in May, and in legal terms that is correct.
I am no lawyer, as you know, but you knew as long ago as January that this business was coming and what form it took.
We would have liked to see you making some effort to make it clear to the 15 Member States of this Union in which direction they were supposed to be heading.
All right, there can be no definitive documents for us to examine at that stage, even we understand that, but I think we really should consider it beneath us to grind out the kind of superficial campaign of accusation we have heard on this occasion from the Greens, who can be unimaginative themselves sometimes.
I believe in all seriousness, Mr Bangemann, that the Novel Food Regulation is a good first move in this new direction.
So buckle down to it, and then we can tell the Member States where things are heading!
