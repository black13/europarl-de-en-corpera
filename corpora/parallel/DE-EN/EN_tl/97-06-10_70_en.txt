Mr President, Mr Lamfalussy, in the long run you cannot spend more than you earn.
Families that go on spending more than they earn, lose spending power; in businesses jobs are put at risk and lost if, in the long term, they spend more than they make, and the same, of course, applies to States if, in the long term, they spend more than they take in.
Anyone can lose credibility in that way, and we have in the past seen crises which have shown that all citizens then lose their assets and enormous numbers of jobs are lost.
That is why the Stability Pact is so important.
We have to try to establish sound finances, as they are, when all is said and done, the best foundation for the internal market.
The roof is build out of the single currency.
Our finances are in the end critical to our ability to compete, including with States outside the European Union.
That is why we need to take a very close look at the harmonized taxes.
This House has already made a preliminary assessment of what the subsequent costs will be.
It is very important in relation to VAT harmonization also, to consider what the costs will be to the State, to citizens and to businesses.
My second point concerns lean management.
I think it absolutely vital that those concerned are involved in the harmonization process.
99.8 % of businesses in the European Union have less than 250 employees.
I think that we have to ensure that, for individuals, the taxation system is as simple and easy to understand as possible.
My third and final point concerns bench marks.
In the same way as the convergence criteria provide useful bench marks, we need to have that same system for taxation, and indeed to have an improved version that can be applied when decisions are taken in the future also.
