Mr President, I should like to ask for clarification.
It has now been said at several points in the German interpretation in relation to confirming the vote that you will be holding a roll call vote.
I think that either that has to be corrected in the German or that you have on several occasions said that there will be a roll call instead of an electronic vote.
Could you please sort this out because we do not have roll call votes in these circumstances.
But if there really is to be a roll call vote, you should make that clear.
As I said I do not know whether this is just a problem with the German interpretation or whether that is what all of the interpreters have said.
