Mr President, we have a further problem with the vote on Paragraph 15.
It had been agreed with the rapporteur that it was not strictly necessary to create a new political body here and that this task could be taken over by the existing bodies.
That was what was agreed, and it was also the rapporteur's suggestion.
We therefore ought - and I apologize for only now realizing this - to have voted separately on the word 'new' in Paragraph 15.
As Mr Friedrich has pointed out, we did not even know that it was a roll call vote.
I have to say that I too have some problems with the interpretation from the Greek.
My own Greek is not so very fluent, Mr President, but I am doing my best.
This is a very important political issue.
I would vote against this report if we cannot reach agreement on it.
I would also call on my friends to vote against the Fourçans report, although this distresses me greatly when I think about my friend, Mr Fourçans.
I would therefore suggest that the rapporteur be given the floor again.
