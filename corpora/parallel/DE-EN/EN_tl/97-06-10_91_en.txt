Mr President, to save the honour of the Sittings service, I shall explain matters.
As a result of yesterday's negotiations, there was a corrigendum in which the word 'new' was deleted.
But the majority voted against it.
I have no idea why.
A vote was then taken on the original text.
If you look at your papers you will see that Paragraph 15 contains the word 'new' .
If we could agree that the word 'new' should be deleted and the necessary correction made, then we would be happy with that.
