Madam President, Mr Spencer deserves our thanks for his efforts, if only because his report makes it clear that any report on the implementation of the EU's common foreign and security policy must, nowadays, quite simply amount to a list of missed opportunities and failures.
And, since the Intergovernmental Conference is producing no genuine progress in this area, I fear that such reports are going to take the same form in the future.
In order to find practical examples of this failure, we need not look very far afield: even among the Member States of the European Union, present or prospective, threats are being openly backed by military force.
I regard it as an unforgivable failure of the European Union that it has not been able to resolve the crisis between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus.
Indeed, if we look around we can see economically weak countries investing economic resources in totally disproportionate armaments -resources that they urgently need elsewhere.
I believe this should be a clear priority of all the European institutions, so that what is nothing less than a European scandal can be brought under control.
