Madam President, whatever the result of the Intergovernmental Conference may be, one thing is certain: applause for that conference will be muted.
However important it may be to give our citizens the feeling that they live in an area of freedom and internal security, which includes social security and the right to work, external security is a necessity too.
Particularly for countries like Austria, which are frontier states of the EU, it is important that the European Union should carry weight in its foreign and security policy and so become a stabilizing factor in Europe.
So far we have seen mainly the shortcomings of the CFSP, in Bosnia and also in Albania and the Middle East.
The Spencer report makes this painfully clear.
Let us not deceive ourselves: without the commitment of the USA in these crisis areas, nothing could be done.
They show up the shortcomings of the European Union.
This makes it all the more important to us that, with regard to the CFSP as elsewhere, majority decisions should make it easier for the European Union to act.
The fact that the EU accepts the Petersberg undertakings, peace-keeping and peace-making missions in other words, is positive.
The fact that there is still no date for the integration of the WEU, so that the military backbone is lacking, is negative.
A clear CFSP line would also facilitate the national debate in neutral States such as Austria.
While uncertainties remain regarding the CFSP, it is an easy way out to take refuge in neutrality, which has lost its meaning as a result of the changed political scenario in Europe and should be replaced by solidarity in favour of a common security policy.
