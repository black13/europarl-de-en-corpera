Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my ceterum censio has nothing to do with the destruction of Carthage.
It is, rather, directed against the lack of transparency in the Union, its lack of closeness to the citizen and the existing democratic deficit.
I should therefore like to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur.
Even though I cannot share her opinion on everything, I have admired her work on this report in committee - her circumspection, her sharp eye for essentials and, not least, her stamina.
In my opinion, acceptance of the European idea - and, of course, opinions may differ as to what form that idea should take - will be crucially dependent on overcoming the problems listed in the report.
Only an increase in democratic control, and especially a working involvement of the national parliaments, can ensure that the European idea is put across to the citizens of the various Member States.
But the absence of these proposed improvements will mean a further increase in the existing euroscepticism, even without any contribution from those right-wingers mentioned - perhaps by force of habit - by Mr Corbett.
