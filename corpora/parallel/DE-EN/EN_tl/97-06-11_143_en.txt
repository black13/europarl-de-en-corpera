Mr President, thank you for allowing me the floor again.
First, let me once again offer my sincere thanks to Commissioner Gradin - she knows how much we always value her support, and her resolute approach.
Rome was not built in a day.
But I do have one specific question for the President-in-Office, whom I also thank for her remarks.
Perhaps I did not fully understand what she said.
Mrs Sorgdrager, can you assure us that you expect the protocols, and the convention too, to be ratified by mid-1998, or were you referring to the protocols alone?
That would be somewhat unbalanced, because, in principle, the convention itself is the basis and the protocols are supplementary to it.
Perhaps you can answer that question for me.
