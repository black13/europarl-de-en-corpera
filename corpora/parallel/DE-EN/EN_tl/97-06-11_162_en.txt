I have a question I should like to put to the representative of the Council: is the plan you have put forward, for a serious study of the human rights situation, an area where you will introduce general principles that apply equally to all?
Because I too often have the impression that there are some states, China for instance, which are unpopular here, so that things are applied to them that are not applied to others.
What we need is a common European policy.
Are you prepared to devise a European policy of that kind, which would then apply to all countries, not just one in particular?
