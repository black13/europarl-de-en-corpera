I have a supplementary question on the budget, with a number of different aspects.
We know from information received from the UN that it will take 4000 years to clear the land mines in Afghanistan alone.
So the financial resources available to us are a drop in the ocean here.
Is the Council going to increase those resources?
You have come out in favour of a specific prohibition, a total, universal prohibition.
When is the EU going to set an example, and are there funds for companies which are still producing now to enable them to stop producing immediately?
Also, I have recently read that Dasa Dornier, a subsidiary of the armaments giant Daimler Benz, which produces mines, is currently benefiting, together with the French arms company Thomson CSF, receiving from the Commission of the European Union a contract worth DM 100 million for research into new military direction-finding and radar systems.
The argument being that the systems can be used to pinpoint mines.
We decided here that anyone producing mines, which includes Daimler Benz, should not receive any additional money for mine clearance.
How can the Council explain this?
Will it take action here to ensure that this money is not wasted for that purpose?
