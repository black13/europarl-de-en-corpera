Mr President, the written question is, in my view, not a question at all but a horror story.
But I do have a clear question to put to the Council.
First, is the Council not also of the opinion that stabilization in Albania includes striking a balance between the re-elected President Berisha and the former opposition, which, I am happy to say, now forms part of the coalition government?
Secondly, how are elections to be held unless these armed bands in the south of the country are disarmed?
And thirdly, how can democratic local authorities be re-established there?
There is a danger that massive economic interests which support those armed bands will simply seize power from the streets.
That makes it very important to re-establish democratic local authorities.
