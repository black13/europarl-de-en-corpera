Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mr Burenstam Linder.
He has succeeded in producing a synthesis of penetrating analyses and far-sighted visions.
And those visions can become reality if opportunities are consistently taken and risks are minimized.
Nor has the rapporteur disregarded the necessary next steps, and it is one of those necessary next steps on which I should like to focus.
In paragraph 1, the rapporteur calls upon the institutions to promote the full ratification of the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
When we vote on this report tomorrow, those agreements will be precisely two years old - they were signed back on 12 June 1995.
So the rapporteur is more than justified in calling for ratification, and it is also in the interests of the European Parliament.
Because, after ratification by all Member States and the Council, the existing delegations can be reconstituted as joint parliamentary committees, which is not just a formality but secures binding participation in a structured dialogue.
It secures the participation of the European Parliament and of the respective national parliaments in the structuring of the treaties, in the defining of political focuses and priorities, and in control.
We thus secure the right to influence the complex processes of adjustment that are going to be necessary both in those states that wish to join the Union and in the Union itself.
Especially in the Baltic region, there is a need both for closer co-operation and for the rapid acceptance of new Member States.
Because it is precisely here that we have the opportunity, in the future, to involve Russia, too, more closely in regional co-operation and so make an essential contribution to stability.
