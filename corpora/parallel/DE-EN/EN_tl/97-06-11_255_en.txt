Mr President, Commissioner, the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, as between men and women, exists only on paper.
Reality is something very different.
Even today, women earn on average 30 % less than men - even now, more than 20 years after a directive on equal remuneration was passed.
Women are over-represented in the low-pay sector, and the recent recession widened the gap between women's and men's earnings.
The fact that women are disadvantaged is also apparent in the training sector, in the fact that they are diverted into so-called typical women's jobs - often part-time jobs offering no social security - and the prevention of career advancement and access to management positions.
But complaining in itself achieves nothing.
If change and effective action are to be achieved, specific analyses are needed.
The Commission has adopted the suggestions made by the European Parliament in producing a code of practice as a basis for eliminating sex discrimination from the working world.
The intention is to examine what kinds of professional inequality exist, whether discrimination is being disguised by paying men additional bonuses, or whether job evaluations are quite simply one-sided.
The progress achieved is to be documented, as are successful model projects.
The action plan is to be produced by stages, in co-operation with the social partners.
They are to receive training and information and their awareness is to be improved so as to ensure precise compliance with the principle of nondiscrimination in future pay agreements.
Finally, women are to be much better represented than previously in collective bargaining, with full involvement to protect their own interests.
The European Commission's initiative, Commissioner Flynn, if you take due account of the suggestions made by the Committee on Women's Rights and the Employment Committee, and this valuable report, is an important step towards a more just working world.
