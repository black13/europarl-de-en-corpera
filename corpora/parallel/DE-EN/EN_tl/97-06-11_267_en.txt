Mr President, this report deals with a deeply interesting and fascinating subject.
It clearly shows how far the European ICT sector has fallen behind its non-European competitors, especially those in the USA.
I hope this report will rouse the Commission to action, because it will be an important function of the EU to take specific steps in this precise area and make selective use of resources to ensure that Europe remains competitive.
To single out a few important points: concentration on new products and vertical market segments, such as telemedicine, voice processing or distance learning, special consideration for SMEs, especially those in the tourist sector, for which additional market conditions and booking facilities are being opened up and in which jobs can be created with the aid of modern communications technology.
The necessary positive motivation and favourable attitude can best be achieved by making greater use of information technology in the education and training sectors.
