Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, has done us a service with his own-initiative report by prompting a discussion on the concept of sustainable development.
This discussion, of course, is in its very early stages and will take up a great deal of time yet.
That, of course, is inherent in the philosophy contained within the concept of sustainable development, a philosophy which calls on us to view all our actions and political decisions in the particular context of their future complex effects and side effects.
An unending process of consideration and reconsideration!
The rapporteur provides some of this service by rightly identifying the present economic model as detrimental to sustainable development.
But from that point on our interpretations begin to drift apart, for example when we come to assess advanced technologies in the light of their consequential effects.
Our debate will and must continue.
One positive point, at least, is that sustainable development has emerged as a guiding principle of one of the thematic programmes in the fifth Research Framework Programme.
We in this House will be alert and vigilant to see whether genuinely clean and intelligent products and processes are going to be promoted under this heading, whether intermodal transport and renewable energy sources really are given the opportunities they deserve, and whether the inner cities with their obvious problems become a focus of intense attention, together with the tragic deterioration of the state of marine resources and the much quoted greenhouse effect.
At virtually every sitting in this House we have an opportunity to demonstrate, in the specific decisions we take, that this subject really is in the forefront of our thoughts.
Furthermore, we politicians are responsible for the public debate on what we are supposed to want politically.
I thank the rapporteur for facing up to this responsibility.
