Mr President, I find this whole business quite incredible, for two reasons.
First, because we have a regulation dating from 1991, which was supposed to apply from 1 January 1995.
That date was put back by a year to 1 January 1996, and then again to 1 January 1997, and now, suddenly, we have nothing at all.
This so-called agreement you have the nerve to present to us is just an insult.
For a start, there is no such thing as a humane trap.
Try catching your finger in a car door - whether it has a rubber lining or not, it will still hurt just as much.
And if an animal has to endure its death in agony and die a dreadful death in a trap that we describe as humane, that makes no difference to the animal.
In any case, an animal will be unable to read where it says that a trap is suitable for this or that particular animal, and if it is a protected species, it won't be able to read that either.
But what I find most incredible of all is this sentence, which I quote verbatim from the Official Journal: ' The welfare of animals will temporarily be reduced to a very low level in killing traps.'
Do you believe in resurrection?
Who would have thought a killing trap might, temporarily, reduce welfare to a very low level!
Are you trying to make fools of us by publishing stuff like this in the Official Journal?
This is a total mockery of animal welfare as a whole.
We are going to support Mr Pimenta's report, and we are not going to tolerate cynical performances of this kind.
I regard it as an insult.
First you overrule regulations and the wishes of Parliament, making a mockery of democracy, and then you have the effrontery to publish material like this.
