Mr President, the debate on the prohibition of leghold traps is the unending story of animal suffering, animal misery, human cruelty and political incompetence.
Once again, we have an EU regulation which has been in force since 1 January 1996 and it is simply not being implemented!
Now we are served up with an agreement which is no such thing.
Leghold traps are to continue to be permitted for several years.
Death need only occur within 300 seconds - 5 long minutes of mortal fear, death agony, appalling pain!
Nor does the agreement make any provision as to how trapped animals may or may not be killed.
Many animals, Commissioner, are killed by being crushed, the trapper simply standing on the animal and treading on it until it dies.
We Europeans want nothing to do with leghold traps, well and good.
But apart from leghold traps all other traps are permitted in Europe, irrespective of what injuries they inflict or how slowly they kill.
We have a great deal to do, not just in Canada but in Europe too.
I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will support Carlos Pimenta and reject the Commission's proposal.
If the Council of Environment Ministers does the same on 19 and 20 June, then we shall have won.
If it doesn't, that will not be the failure of this House, but the failure of the Environment Ministers.
