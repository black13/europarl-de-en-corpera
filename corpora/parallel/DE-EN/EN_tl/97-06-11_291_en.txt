Mr President, many thanks for giving me the opportunity to pass on a brief bit of information.
I am the spokesman for the PPE Group in the Committee on External Economic Affairs.
Yesterday evening, by a great majority, we actually approved the Commission's proposal on the grounds just put forward by Sir Leon Brittan, which are the same arguments that were put forward by Mr Malerba in this House on behalf of Mrs Baldi.
We know that the debate on traps is always a difficult problem.
But we believe that the Commission was right to decide in favour of a gradual progression towards more humane trapping methods.
We voted in favour of the Commission's proposal by a large majority, including the votes of Mr Ilaskivi and members of other groups though not the vote of the draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee.
I know that this position may be a minority one even within my own group, but I should like to point out that in giving our support to the Commission yesterday we acted with the best of intentions.
