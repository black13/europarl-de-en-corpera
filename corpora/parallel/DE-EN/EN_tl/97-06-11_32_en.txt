Madam President, the draft of an amended Treaty must be assessed in the light of the European Parliament's positions.
First, priority for active employment schemes and social justice; secondly, a workable foreign and security policy; thirdly, joint measures in the fields of internal affairs and justice; fourthly, democratization of our structures with a new institutional equilibrium; and fifthly, doing everything possible to make the European Union really capable of expansion.
The proposals made by the Dutch presidency are, as a whole, important steps in the direction the European Parliament wants to follow.
But further progress in that direction is needed in Amsterdam, because we want and need this Intergovernmental Conference to be a success.
The European Parliament has a very special part to play here.
May I remind you that the Spinelli draft constitution was the essential precursor of the Single European Act of 1986, that the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 was itself influenced by important proposals made by this House, and that two Members of the European Parliament are now involved in the present discussions.
Even today, there is no denying the fact that many of the proposals on the negotiating table were born in the European Parliament.
We have been a driving force behind this conference, and the European Parliament must also be a full party to the negotiation and ratification of all the further stages of reform that will follow the turn of the millennium.
The responsibility now lies with the Heads of State and Government.
They are all deeply committed to the further development of the EU in their speeches; but now the time has come for them to make real decisions that will help to improve the reality of life for all our citizens!
