Madam President, three years ago almost to the day, on 12 June 1994, we held a referendum in Austria on our country's accession to the European Union.
Not all our citizens were satisfied with all the details at the time, and indeed not all our citizens were even told about all the details of that accession.
Even so, the citizens voted 'yes' in principle to the European project, and did so in the awareness that no ready-made, communal Europe exists as yet and that we would all have to continue working to advance the progress of deeper and wider European union.
Today, new and important decisions about the future are being made.
They are a challenge to us all.
For some time now, and indeed for some time to come, our whole political system, our citizens and politicians, have been and will be confronted with the challenge of taking another important step towards Europe by the introduction of the single European currency.
So let us ensure that our economic policy, too, is in line with this stability pact!
Today, it is up to the European Parliament to make its contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference.
After the weekend, the Heads of State and Government will be called upon to put the successful finishing touches to the work they have done so far.
The results achieved hitherto are far from valueless.
Some things have been achieved.
Some things remain to be done.
Let us all rise to this challenge!
Let us bring greater depth and breadth to Europe, to enable us to meet our citizens' expectations.
The question which Elmar Brok wanted to put to the President-in-Office was as follows: if Amsterdam really is not sufficient to allow full expansion by another eleven States, will there at least be a new Article N as a result of this Intergovernmental Conference?
