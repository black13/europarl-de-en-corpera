Madam President, two matters that are of central importance and great sensitivity for Europe's citizens have been dealt with completely inadequately in the present draft Treaty.
One is the new so-called nondiscrimination article, and the other is the future legal procedure on asylum, foreigners and immigration.
The non-discrimination article is worded in such a way that it only takes effect if the Council unanimously takes the appropriate precautions.
The European Parliament has only a right to be consulted.
That means this article is virtually ineffective.
But the democratic process does appear to have been abandoned in other areas, too - those areas which are now being transposed from the third pillar to the first.
The national parliaments are being cut out, but they are not being replaced by the European Parliament.
This is a denial of democracy, and we will alert our colleagues in the national parliaments to that fact.
It is important, though, for minimum standards to be safeguarded not only in respect of democracy but also in respect of the rule of law, and that includes ensuring that the European Court of Justice has full jurisdiction in the areas in question.
However, there is one positive point I should make: the new provisions, especially in Article 119 on equality for women, are much better regulated in the present draft Treaty than they were in the Dutch presidency's first draft.
