Mr President, I voted against this text because it offers no prospect or contribution to a democratic Europe, favouring an authoritarian centralized state.
The text of the Maastricht Treaty constantly refers to an area of freedom, safety and justice.
But we are offered no prospect of transparency in public life.
Not only are no new mechanisms for democratic control being introduced, but existing ones are being weakened.
The language adopted is very interesting here: where the term 'freedom' always used to be used in European policy, we now have the term security - internal security and the foreign security policy.
But security is being created not through more democracy, not through an employment policy or social security, but in a form controlled internally by the national governments, via Schengen and Europol, and guaranteed externally by a new foreign and military policy.
Mr X is not under the control of Parliament but that of an inter-governmental machine, in which human beings - including Members of Parliament - are not involved.
The superpower dreams of this integration reach their climax in the integration of the WEU, and that too is not under democratic control.
Therefore, no democrat can vote in favour of such a text.
