Madam President, my feelings are akin to those of Mr Bertens.
In terms of mineral resources, Sierra Leone is one of the richest countries in the world, but it is one of the poorest in terms of the living standards of its population, and we must take action here to reinstate the democratic Government.
I do not believe we can tolerate the continuation in power of the military junta.
At the same time I wish to condemn the intervention by Nigeria.
General Abacha also came to power there by means of a military coup.
His most likely reason for intervening was to extend his sphere of influence and not to establish democracy.
It would be a fine thing if we had democratic structures in Nigeria, but we are talking now about Sierra Leone.
I take the view that our cooperation in the Lom√© framework, coupled with diplomacy, can help to ensure not only that the coup is condemned but also that we are able to take practical measures for the restoration of democracy.
May I ask Commissioner Pinheiro to take the necessary steps in this direction, and I hope that Nigeria will then keep out of the conflict.
