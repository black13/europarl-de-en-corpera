Madam President, on the morning of 19 May, armed men entered a block of flats in the centre of Bogotá and wiped out an entire family.
A baby survived, but only because it had been hidden in a cupboard just as the men entered the flat.
The men had told the caretaker - and this is a significant point - that they were from the office of the public prosecutor.
They were typical paramilitary operators.
They escaped unrecognized, as always happens in Colombia.
The murdered couple were employees of the renowned Jesuit institute CINEP.
Mario Calderón dealt with ecology there, while his wife Elsa worked on human-rights projects.
The utter brutality of this act of violence has horrified not only the people of Colombia but the international public too.
Once more people have been killed in Colombia because they had devoted themselves to the cause of human rights, and once more, sadly, we must expect these murders to go unpunished.
For years in the reports by the Commission on Human Rights the Colombian Government has regularly been urged to protect and respect human rights and the people who promote them.
For years the Colombian Government's stock response has been an apologetic shrug of the shoulders.
Allow me to close with a few words in Portuguese to our Commissioner:
I should like to tell the Commissioner that, unless we work together for human rights in Colombia, unless we fight together against the injustice which exists in Colombia, we shall resolve nothing.
I know also, as does the Commissioner, that the Colombian government must work for human rights.
We are also well aware that the Colombian government is not worthy of all the confidence which we, together with the Spanish PSOE and PP are placing in it.
The Colombian people deserve our aid, not the government.
