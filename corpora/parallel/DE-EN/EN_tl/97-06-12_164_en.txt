Mr President, of everything that has been said on this subject, the words of Mr Oostlander have been the clearest, most sensible and most balanced so far.
This is simply due to the fact that he has been in the country, that he has concerned himself with that country time and again from the very outset and therefore knows how things are.
He refrains from the sort of ideological utterances, based on Serbophilia or other motives, that totally distort the picture.
There is one thing we must not forget, namely that Serbia was the initial aggressor.
Not a single house in Serbia has been destroyed, whereas in Croatia - and the Krajina belongs to Croatia - many houses have been destroyed.
I am naturally in favour of everyone, including the Serbs, being able to return home, and I am in favour of our welcoming the Serbs to our Community one day, but first of all we must get things clear here, which certainly involves emphasizing that there is no place for that country as long as it is governed by extremists and mass murderers.
Before all else, that has to change!
