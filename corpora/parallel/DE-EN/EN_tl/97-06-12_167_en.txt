Mr President, Moscow is becoming an increasingly attractive city in terms of its outward appearance, and every time I go there I see that the façades of some more buildings have been renovated.
But that is the only new development.
What has remained is the old Soviet system of the propiska .
Only those who possess such a document are entitled to obtain housing in Moscow.
This means that many families who were simply not among the beneficiaries of the transformation process - single mothers were among the main losers - are being driven to destitution.
These mothers and their children have to resort to begging in the streets of Moscow.
But the Mayor of Moscow is very thorough when it comes to cleaning up façades, for the Island of Hope will also fall victim to the cleanup campaign.
The Island of Hope is the largest autonomous initiative for street children in Moscow.
It gives them a warm place to stay, feeds them and even tries to provide them with schooling.
Amidst the chaos accompanying the breakdown of law and order, this island would give the children the opportunity to join the mainstream of society and enjoy normal lives.
The closure of this facility, however, will mean the return of these children to the street gangs, the makeshift tents and the sewers.
This will create a breeding ground for crime.
The city of Moscow has no alternative to the Island of Hope.
That is why we ask that this organization be left alone to continue its work.
