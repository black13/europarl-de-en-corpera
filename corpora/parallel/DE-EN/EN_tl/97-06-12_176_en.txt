Mr President, let me begin by thanking my fellow Members for their help in putting this item on today's agenda, for it is indeed a burning issue.
Twenty per cent of the territory of Belarus is contaminated.
Since 1996, in line with the prevailing rationale in that country, measures have been taken, pursuant to a political decision, to ignore radioactive contamination and to revitalize the contaminated areas by replanting the fields and encouraging people to resettle the land.
There will therefore be no reduction in the number of children suffering the after-effects of long-term radiation with the passage of time.
The various international initiatives and the very many private initiatives have been subject since the beginning of this year to discriminatory decrees and have been prevented from distributing aid.
Organizations in the country which maintain international contacts are being criminalized, and some of their members have already been granted asylum in Germany.
It is virtually impossible for them to continue their work.
In other words, not only has the process of democratic reform in that country been halted but so too have the charitable aid measures on which the country's survival depends, because the Government has no money and is even curtailing its own measures of assistance.
That is why we must call for humanitarian aid to be continued in accordance with international standards for the sake of public health and welfare in Belarus.
