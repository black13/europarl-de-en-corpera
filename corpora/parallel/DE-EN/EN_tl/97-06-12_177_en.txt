Mr President, first of all I should like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Schroedter for her commitment to Belarus and to human rights in general.
She grew up under a Communist regime and knows exactly what she is talking about when she refers to basic values and fundamental liberties.
That is why I wish to express my very sincere thanks to her.
In Belarus today we have a regime on European soil, led by President Lukashenko, which on the one hand is a Russian puppet and on the other hand is certainly not based on a free democratic order or anything of the sort.
Government policy in Belarus is laid down by presidential decree.
And since the politicians there govern by force alone, we must not mince our words to them.
Straight talking is all they will understand!
That is why I support the demands made in the motion before us.
It is simply high time our European Union drew up a clear catalogue of fundamental freedoms and human rights, spelling out the consequences for any of our partner countries that violate them.
The same conditions must apply to all countries we deal with, be they in Europe, Africa, Asia or anywhere else.
Our future credibility depends on it.
