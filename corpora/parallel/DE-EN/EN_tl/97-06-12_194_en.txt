Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE Group supports the joint resolution.
I believe it is balanced and addresses the important issues.
I only have two comments to make.
Point 4 refers to the situation of the African elephant and proposes that acceptable action be taken to avoid an excessive degree of conflict between the interests of man and those of elephants.
I believe this certainly merits consideration, because the African States, as we know, are calling for downlisting of the African elephant, which they regard as a threat to themselves.
But we must also ensure that animals are properly protected.
That is perhaps a task for the European Union in the context of the development cooperation in which it engages with a view to providing a basis for human subsistence.
I should just like to mention very briefly that the European Parliament is saying once again that products from endangered species must not be used under any circumstances in dubious medicines of whatever description.
We also did that in the Lannoye report, and it is a message we should reaffirm.
