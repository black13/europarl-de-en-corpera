Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cox has put his finger on the salient point.
It concerns the relationship of this report to Commissioner Monti's initiative, which was designed to create a legal framework for the taxation of energy products.
Just as he, for the reasons he explained, does not wish to accept our amendments, we cannot approve his report without our amendments, for we consider it crucially important to make Mr Cox clearly aware that the Monti initiative must succeed, and then I would extend it again.
We have still more changes of government ahead of us, and once we have changed governments in Germany there will be no governments left that want to sabotage systematically the harmonization and coordination of taxes.
Then at least nobody will be able to make the excuse that some governments are seeking unfair advantages for historical or purely national reasons.
And then the Monti proposal and the Commission initiative will surely butter our parsnips.
Since that will happen in the foreseeable future, Mr Cox, our proposal on the coordination of time limits is certainly not about postponement until never-never day but an attempt to take political action in this situation, to maintain the pressure and to tackle the necessary restructuring of the entire system of indirect taxes, so that the unfair, ecologically harmful and antisocial distortions that are rooted in today's markets for historical or national reasons can finally be weeded out.
That is an urgent task.
It is part and parcel of the completion of the single market, and we must not ease the pressure.
For these reasons we shall take the line I have described.
