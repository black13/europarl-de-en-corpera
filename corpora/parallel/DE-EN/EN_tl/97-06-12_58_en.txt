Mr President, let me begin by expressing my sincere congratulations and thanks to Doris Pack for her sterling effort.
We all know from our own countries how well the Socrates programme is working and how popular it is.
I am sure that each one of us knows at least one student who has studied in another European country on an Erasmus scholarship or a school class that has organized an exchange through Comenius.
And despite this positive feedback we want to cut the funding of Socrates.
No, that is unthinkable!
Socrates is one of the bestknown Community programmes; its activities are right in line with the needs of our people and directly touch their lives.
The programme has numerous achievements to its name, including an increase in mobility within the European Union and progress towards mutual recognition of degrees.
We cannot keep on talking about closeness to citizens and then fail to guarantee the future of such a successful programme.
Moreover, I believe that greater importance should attach to the aspect of adult education within the Socrates programme.
Only by topping up the programme with at least another ECU 100m can we make sure that the loudly proclaimed motto of lifelong learning is effectively put into practice.
Socrates can and must make a contribution to this and other innovation processes if the European Union wants to remain true to its educational aims and to demonstrate that it is at one with its citizens.
