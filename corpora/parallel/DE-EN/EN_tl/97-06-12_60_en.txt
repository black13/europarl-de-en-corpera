The rapporteur spoke about the importance of Socrates as an instrument of education policy.
But I should like to reemphasize this political aspect that has already been touched upon.
We lament, do we not, the ubiquitous reawakening of nationalist tendencies, especially among young people.
Then the European Union creates an excellent means of combating these inclinations by making the idea of Europe come alive for hundreds of thousands of students, whereupon we start trying to curtail this programme right, left and centre, thereby rendering it ineffectual.
There are two things that must not happen.
First of all, these financial restrictions must not mean that only students from wealthy backgrounds can afford to engage in such programmes.
Even now it is difficult for students to survive on these grants in a foreign university city.
Secondly, it would be an act of political folly to extend this programme to Eastern Europe and then be unable to fund it.
That would be absolute political madness.
For that reason, I support the bid for replenishment and, incidentally, consider it essential that the whole issue of EU assistance be thoroughly reviewed.
We can see in the present case that the Union is getting its priorities wrong.
Education is a very important aim, and I hope it is an aim that we shall achieve.
