Mr President, the second most important decision in a person's life is the decision to pursue a particular career.
The most important decision is the choice of a marriage partner.
I believe that both of these decisions have to be well thought out and carefully examined, and it is important that more information about future career opportunities should be provided in school, so that pupils' education can be structured accordingly.
The Socrates programme addresses this very point with its research activities and its initial and in-service teacher training measures.
I believe that Socrates assures us that future educational requirements can be met, that the education system will not disregard market needs and that parents, teachers and pupils will be well aware of the educational qualifications which will be demanded in the future.
We have politicians who believe that an additional article or law can create jobs.
I believe that jobs can only be created if people are taught how to produce the goods or provide the services that consumers want.
This means that in vocational training and in businesses we must teach people how to manufacture products, how to supply products and services that consumers will buy.
The Socrates programme, with its very sharp focus on in-service training, has a huge amount to offer here, as does the Leonardo programme.
They can quite simply teach people what they need in order to be able to meet the demands of the future.
Forthcoming projects such as the introduction of the euro and our eastward enlargement are also important steps for which we must educate our teachers, our pupils and our adult citizens.
That is why lifelong learning, and hence Leonardo, is of vital importance to our future and must therefore be given absolute priority.
