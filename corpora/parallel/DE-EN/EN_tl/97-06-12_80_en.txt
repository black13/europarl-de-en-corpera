Madam President, we have agreed to do these two things jointly in order to save time.
The correction I request is the deletion in recital D of the reference to the meeting of the Tourism Council, since it never took place.
So that is a technical matter.
If nobody in the House objects, we ask that in point 4 the words 'to take into account' be replaced by 'to adopt without further delay' .
That is our oral amendment.
