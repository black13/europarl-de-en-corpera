Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
The group of the European People's Party supports this report.
We believe that the human rights clause is a very important clause in the minds of the people in the countries concerned, because it is a question of punishing not people, but governments who violate the human rights of their citizens.
Nor is it an act against the countries concerned, but rather against the governments which abuse human rights, if we suspend the Lom√© Convention in this area.
It is true that the European Union is still using double standards here, and is not being quite consistent.
However, I do not share the views of those who say that the ACP countries are fundamentally worse in this respect than the others, but it is true that, unfortunately, geopolitical and economic considerations frequently play a part.
It is not a question of whether a country is an ACP country or not, but of whether a Member States has specific interests.
We really must overcome this problem.
We must pursue a consistent policy on human rights, and we must not have double standards.
