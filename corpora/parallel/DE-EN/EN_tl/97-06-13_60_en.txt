Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Gradin, we all know that biotechnology is potentially of great benefit to mankind.
However, we have now been overtaken by news which shows that this potential is linked to great risks, and brings up important ethical questions, whether it is the cloning of sheep, or the news that a British doctor in Saudi Arabia is proposing to offer couples babies that will definitely be of the male sex.
These few cases show what kind of ethical questions this technology can give rise to.
They are proof enough that it is absolutely essential for us to have an advisory group on ethical issues.
On 31 July 1997 the mandate of the group of advisers on biotechnology ethics (GABE) comes to an end.
For the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, this fact provided us with an opportunity to think about how we wish to proceed further.
Therefore we are asking the following questions.
Does the Commission intend to extend the term of office of this group of advisers?
If so, will the group continue to operate with its present membership, functions and structure, or does the Commission intend to change its mandate?
I have to say that that would be desirable.
In what form and with what aim will the consideration of ethical questions be organized in future, if the Commission is planning to change the mandate?
I would add to this another question.
How quickly will this happen?
In what form does the Commission intend to involve the European Parliament in developing a structure for considering ethical questions at European Union level?
I eagerly await the Commissioner's answers, and perhaps during the course of the debate I may react accordingly.
Given the importance of this subject, I do not think it is really necessary to repeat the fact that I shall fully exhaust my five minutes, in order to talk about this important issue.
