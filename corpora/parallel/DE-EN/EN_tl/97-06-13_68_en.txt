Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing the typical Friday effect, as Parliament starts to break up and we are reduced to fewer and fewer Members.
Therefore I shall be very brief, especially since I have the feeling that Mr Liese or Mr Casini have already expressed, very clearly, what the opinion of our committee is.
We are in favour, in principle, of extending the mandate, but we are also quite clearly in favour of strengthening Parliament's influence on this advisory committee, and of strengthening cooperation accordingly, because we as a Parliament also have to act as a sort of conscience within the European Union.
The results produced by the group of advisers so far do not show that the group is fulfilling this function.
We therefore have a very important task in front of us.
I just wanted to add that point.
