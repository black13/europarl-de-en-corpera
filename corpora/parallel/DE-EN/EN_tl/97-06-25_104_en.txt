Mr Bangemann, I would like to repeat something you did not understand correctly.
So I will now say it in German.
You were very defensive today.
You need not be, for I did not say that all you send us is papers.
I merely said that the various departments within the Commission keep sending us information and communications at different times.
That is the reason for our reaction.
We would like them to be integrated.
I asked whether you could not coordinate the Commission's activities better.
I never said that you do no work!
Perhaps you are aware that I too sometimes visit projects and give talks at conferences about telecities and suchlike.
I am quite aware of all you do in this area and I am glad you do it.
You then said that we are not losing any market shares.
Perhaps you should have another look at my last week's report on the matter.
In 1990 we had a 35 % market share and now we only have 29 %, which is a 6 % decline.
But I will be glad to see you at the ELDR Group again...
(The President cut off the speaker)
