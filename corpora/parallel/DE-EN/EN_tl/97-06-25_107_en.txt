Mr President, first let me apologize for the absence of Mr Fischler, who would have liked to make this statement in person but cannot do so and has therefore asked me to read out the statement on behalf of himself and the Commission.
The WTO hormones panel forwarded the parties concerned two virtually identical preliminary reports, one for the USA and one for Canada, on 8 March 1997.
The panel of expert's preliminary conclusion, and I stress preliminary, was that the EC ban on imports of hormone-treated meat was incompatible with a range of the WTO agreement's rules on health and plant health measures.
Of course the Commission is disappointed.
At the request of the European Union, an interim meeting was held with the panel of experts on 4 June 1997, at which the Commission made a number of comments on the panel's use of scientific data.
The final report is expected at the end of the month, which is why the Commission does not want to adopt a position before the panel has completed its work.
For even if there does not seem much prospect of a different conclusion being reached, that would certainly be a procedural error.
The Commission will, however, do its utmost within the WTO context to ensure full recognition of the fact that European Community legislation can decide what level of protection it considers appropriate for its citizens.
