Madam President, making money available for infrastructure certainly does not automatically imply progress with cohesion.
This is apparent simply from the fact that the development gap between poor and rich regions has still not been closed despite the large sums of money spent.
So it is not a question of the amount of money made available but mainly of the quality of the projects.
In the past, large road-building schemes in the cohesion countries have destroyed more than they have really achieved.
We can only give a real impetus to sustainable development if we strengthen small-scale infrastructure.
That applies even more to environmental infrastructure.
Excessively large-scale environmental infrastructure places a burden on the citizens and communities of disadvantaged regions and makes them even poorer. that is why I call on the Commission to give preference to small-scale projects and to support those which will leave the next generation an environment worth living in.
Parliament was putting on the emergency brake when it set upper and lower percentage criteria for the proportion of combined transport - road and rail - in its decisions on the trans-European Networks.
There seems to be no other way of really implementing models of sustainable development, as called for in Chapter 10 of the White Paper.
These decisions were parliamentary decisions and it really would be terrible if we bypassed them.
Looking to the future, I doubt whether linking the resources for structural intervention to these convergence criteria really has produced any benefit.
That is why I call for this link to be dissolved in the next Financial Perspective and for us to aim at making the needs and neediness of regions the main criterion for structural intervention.
For it is a question of genuinely doing something for the people of Europe.
