Madam President, Commissioner, I just want to comment briefly on two points.
The first is additionality, where I am speaking more from the point of view of those who are making increasing attempts to obtain structural fund resources at local level.
The problem is that we have several principles in the EU.
One of the most recent and no doubt most rational principles is the need to reduce further public indebtedness.
Since Amsterdam, it has been decided to adhere to this principle on a fairly lasting and strict basis.
One effect of this, which is already becoming apparent at local budgetary level, is that small local authorities find it increasingly difficult to raise the complementary resources for EU projects, even if national and regional resources are of course contributed as a matter of course.
We must ensure that this does not turn into a disastrous trend for certain regions.
I believe we must try to prevent that in time.
Secondly, I would like to make a comment on the principle of partnership.
We still have major reservations in many respects about extending this principle.
Let me at this point specifically thank the Commission for making serious efforts and also taking serious initiatives in this area.
What obstacles still remain relate mainly to partnership between the national governments, the regional administrations and often between the latter and the local authorities.
If I may say so, we in Thuringia, for instance, have a large number of regional development plans drawn up in a democratic manner which were not really taken into consideration when the programme planning documents were drawn up.
Let me conclude by making one point in this connection: anyone who wants to deal with the crucial tasks in this area in coming years will have to attach considerably more attention to the principle of partnership, because the main task is in fact to use fewer resources more efficiently.
