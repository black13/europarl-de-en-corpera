Madam President, let me begin with a few basic comments on the strategy pursued by the Council and the Commission of pushing for purely trade-related cooperation instead of a comprehensive partnership and cooperation agreement.
The Greens cannot endorse this strategy and consider it far more important to implement the partnership and cooperation agreement fairly quickly, not to put the EU's interests in the forefront but to pursue an overall strategy to support the process of transformation in these countries.
Otherwise this would have disastrous consequences for Kyrgyzstan.
In practice only 20-39 % of the economy is privatized and there is scarcely any real legislation on privatization, only on leasing.
Democratization is faltering and far greater support is needed in this area.
On the other hand, it is very much in the EU's interest to exploit Kyrgyzstan's valuable resources, such as the gold and uranium mines, which has a destructive effect on this mountain republic's valuable nature reserves.
What little still remains will then certainly be destroyed.
The agreements are already in existence.
Joint ventures are possible even at this stage.
That does not primarily require an interim agreement.
It would be preferable to follow the overall strategy of the partnership and cooperation agreement.
