Madam President, I know that Mrs Wulf-Mathies is no expert in this field, but the fact is that we also keep being served up this promise to underpin democracy through the democracy clause by Mr van den Broek too.
Yet when it actually comes to applying it, there is always a loud silence.
I ask you to call on Mr van den Broek finally to apply a procedure that has been on file since 1995 so as to ensure that these promises really are kept.
What we keep being promised should finally be done, i.e., where difficulties arise, the democracy clause must be applied.
Hitherto we have had nothing but empty promises!
