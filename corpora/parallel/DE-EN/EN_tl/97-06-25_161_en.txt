Madam President, basically this is a welcome report because it clearly and plainly shows up the superficial and insubstantial nature of the Commission's reports, or rather of the two reports.
In the rapporteur's view, these Commission reports do little more than sum up the projects that have been executed in those two years.
I can only agree with him entirely.
No concrete targets are set out.
General objectives, such as transfers of technology, are of no use to effective evaluations of efficiency.
So we have no results that can be monitored and accordingly no way of evaluating the programmes.
Merely to describe the money flows in no way justifies the actual utilization of resources.
The Court of Auditors has also noted the poor monitoring and execution of the programmes for some years now.
It has referred to the need to rationalize their execution.
It has referred to the lack of clarity in the utilization of the resources.
It has referred to problems of coordination in applying the system.
It has also referred to conflicts of interest between the players involved and, lastly, to the restricted invitations to tender.
These inconsistencies criticized by the Court of Auditors must be remedied at once and in full, before we can discuss a possible increase in resources.
Since we all know that only about half of the ECU 6 600 m made available in 1996 was used, there is in any case some doubt about the need to increase the capital injection yet again.
What we need immediately is a clear definition of objectives, efficiency, transparency and a new, diversified support strategy.
What we also need is more co-financing projects so that the Central and Eastern European countries can identify more closely with the projects concerned.
