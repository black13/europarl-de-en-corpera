Mr President, thank you for taking up the question of small and medium-sized enterprises.
We have seen over recent decades that most jobs have come from small firms, that new enterprises can create a great many jobs and that the SLIM initiatives in particular are designed to relieve the burden on these firms and can therefore also produce greater competitiveness.
What do you think the chances are in Luxembourg of making use of the training programmes, by increasing the appropriations for this area?
For I believe that training is the only means of really efficient job-creation.
