Mr President, measures to get Europe back to work, that was the Commissioner's message to us today from Amsterdam.
And we listened to it and certainly see it as a positive step.
But I would like the Commission to tell me what action it is now taking to define the basic economic policy measures the Community and the Member States should take.
If you, the Commission, and if the European Council took the recommendations by this House seriously and incorporated them in your own proposals, we might have different economic and employment policy results from those we have seen in the past following from your recommendations.
Please tell us how this can be changed, for what the EU ministers of finance proposed in the past was not enough to really get Europe back to work.
My second question, Commissioner, is as follows: I fully appreciate that you are also concerned with the international role of the euro.
But I would like to know one thing: are you also thinking of the consumer, of consumer protection?
When will we finally have a regulation to ensure that EU consumers do not bear the costs of conversion?
When will we finally have a regulation that also ensures that no dual pricing system will be introduced?
