Mr President, Friday's Minutes correctly record my protest that the plenary did not discuss financial aid for Bulgaria and Macedonia.
The President also told me that according to her information that was the decision of the Committee on External Economic Relations.
Let me make it quite clear that the Committee on External Economic Relations unanimously decided the contrary!
After all, this was an urgency, which we approved on Tuesday morning.
The committee met on Tuesday evening in Strasbourg and decided unanimously that its chairman or a representative would present an oral report; and then suddenly, on Friday morning, we heard that there would not be a debate.
I am absolutely in favour of accelerated procedures, but to find that an important political question, involving a lot of money, is not discussed either in committee or in plenary is quite contrary to parliamentary procedure and our Rules of Procedure!
