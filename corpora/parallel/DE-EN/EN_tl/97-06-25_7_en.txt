Mr President, following on from what Mr Posselt said, let me point out that the Commission decided on financial aid for Bulgaria as early as mid-May, that the documents were available and that the Commission could have consulted us in the usual way via the Council.
That did not happen either.
As I pointed out in Strasbourg on Friday: in future different procedures should be introduced, not just at Parliament level but also in relation to the consultation procedure applied by the Commission and the Council vis Ã  vis the Committee on External Economic Relations.
Otherwise we will not be able to carry out our important duties.
