Madam President, my provisional, personal view following Amsterdam is that the de facto barriers to integration have become operational.
We see that the common European denominator is even smaller than we thought in Maastricht.
I believe account should have been taken of the fact that the process of integration is bound to be a gradual one, that common action cannot be imposed by decree but can in fact only be achieved step by step on the basis of a common European will.
We also find that certain areas are not at all or not yet suitable in this regard.
Only if we realise all this and leave the Member States a national margin for decision will further development be possible.
The hope expressed by the Committee on Institutional Affairs, namely that the Treaty could be improved after the event by the way it is interpreted seems an extremely deceptive one.
I do not think one can replace a lack of political agreement by oversubtle interpretations without causing precisely that unease among the people that it was one of the main aims of the Treaty revision to remove.
