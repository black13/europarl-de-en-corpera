Madam President, with all due respect for the positive aspects, we must nevertheless concentrate on the objectives the Amsterdam conference did not achieve.
First, given the total failure to carry out institutional reforms we are surely faced with the following dilemma: either the already very poor decision-making structures in the European Union will worsen with the accession of new Members or we will have to postpone enlargement.
Neither option is acceptable, which is why we must emphatically call for the institutional reforms to be undertaken sooner and for the deadlines set in Amsterdam to be brought forward substantially.
Secondly, the results in relation to a common foreign and security policy are nothing if not modest; the Denver summit showed what great challenges Europe is facing in this regard, for the United States wants to establish its predatory system as a model for the rest of the world!
I believe we have to adjust to this situation and I seriously doubt whether the Amsterdam intergovernmental conference has taken the necessary institutional steps for doing so!
