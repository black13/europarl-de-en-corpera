Mr President, I have listened carefully to what Mr Novo had to say.
Towards the end of his remarks he said that Mrs Bonino's statement had nothing to do with BSE.
That surprised me, in view of his initial remarks.
My group and I are not in favour of adding a statement by Mrs Bonino's to this week's order of business, for the following reason: Parliament has appointed a temporary committee to monitor the activities of the Commission in connection with the Committee of Inquiry into BSE.
This temporary committee sits in public -its meetings this week take place today, tomorrow and on Thursday.
All Members of this House are free to attend the meetings and to hear the explanations given by the Commission.
Commissioner Fischler will be doing that today.
Mrs Bonino and Mr Novo have no need to wait until Thursday for a Commission statement - Mr Novo is very welcome to hear a statement today, by attending the meeting of the temporary committee.
When Mr Novo says that the information from the Commission came too late, his information differs from mine.
For example, it was not the scientific committee that advised the Commission - it was the Commission's department for the combating of fraud.
If the Commission is to act responsibly, it will report when all concerned - public prosecutor's office, police and customs authorities - have taken the appropriate steps.
At present, I have no reason to doubt that the Commission did that.
We shall hear Mr Fischler and Mrs Bonino this evening, and tomorrow we shall hear from Mr Cunningham, the British Agriculture Minister, followed on Thursday by Mr Boden, the Luxembourg Agriculture Minister and Council President.
So Parliament's committee should have comprehensive information available.
There is therefore no need for the Commission to make a statement in this chamber.
(Parliament rejects the request)
