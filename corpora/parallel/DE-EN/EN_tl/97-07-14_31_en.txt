Mr President, I should like to support what Mr Gutiérrez Díaz has just said.
This has become a very frequent occurrence, simply because question time, which for years took place from 9 pm to 10.30 pm, has been moved to the afternoon.
At some stage, somebody discovered that the Council is too tired in the evenings and so moved question time to the afternoons.
Since then, it has been cut short or rescheduled on about every second or third occasion.
I believe it should be moved back to 9 pm, and then the problem would be solved.
