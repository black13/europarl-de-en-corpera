Mr President, following on from what was said by my colleague Mr Bertens, I should like to say very clearly at the outset that the Ombudsman is an ally of Parliament in its struggle to dispel the sense of helplessness many Europeans feel towards the European institutions.
That is very important.
Secondly, it is also very important that, apart from the assistance that can be provided to the individual citizen, all European officials and institutions should have the impression that a strong Ombudsman is watching what they do and will single out their errors as general failings.
That is the preventive effect of the Ombudsman.
Thirdly, the effect of this office is linked to its effectiveness among the public.
So I would ask you to use all the possible resources of public relations to ensure that particularly glaring errors are made known throughout Europe.
That last point is a very important one to me.
In my own country - Austria, which has only recently joined the European Union - virtually no one has heard of the Ombudsman.
That has to change, which is why I would ask you to travel round the various countries of the Union, make yourself accessible to the public and do what you can to publicize your own existence.
That is the way to attract more attention to a very important office, and increase its effectiveness in the interests of European democracy.
