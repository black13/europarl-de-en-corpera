Mr President, could you please find out how it could possibly happen that the representative of the Dutch presidency-in-office of the Council in Zimbabwe, in reply to a question by the local NGO and government representatives, stated the European Parliament's position on CITES.
Just eight days earlier, the European Parliament had adopted a resolution in the topical and urgent debate which runs to about three pages in length.
And yet the presidency's representative said in as many words that the European Parliament had no position on this!
I find that scandalous.
We are not playing at parliaments here, we are a parliament.
It really is about time that the representatives of the Council took note of that fact!
The Council representative cannot say that Parliament has no opinion on something just a week after Parliament has adopted a three-page resolution in its topical and urgent debate.
