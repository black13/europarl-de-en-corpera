Mr President, the Brinkhorst/Fabra Vall√©s report deals with a very sensitive aspect of the European Union.
It is a fact that fraud, wastage and mismanagement in particular are bringing the European ideal into disrepute.
Every possible step must therefore be taken to arrest this development.
It is primarily the Member States, of course, which must clamp down on irregularities.
At the same time, however, it is essential that the Commission should provide its controlling bodies with the staff and equipment they require to perform their tasks efficiently.
It goes without saying that this also applies to the Court of Auditors, whose duty it is to discover irregularities in the course of its audits and whose proposals for improvements can reduce wastage levels.
In this respect the additional posts for the Commission and the Court of Auditors are to be welcomed.
At the same time, however, we must proceed on the assumption that at least some of the necessary posts can be obtained by efficiency savings within the Commission's own administrative apparatus.
Another point I wish to emphasize is the need to grasp every available opportunity to make more funds available for specific measures in the domain of research and development.
The rapporteur's proposal that the sum of ECU 100m from the reserve be redistributed among operational lines where it can be put to good use is therefore to be most warmly welcomed.
