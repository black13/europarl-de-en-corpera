Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament on agricultural expenditure in the budget is what we describe as the ad hoc procedure.
What is incontestable is that we are increasing this expenditure by 0.45 %, I repeat 0.45.
What is absolutely contestable, and what I cannot support at the present time, is the proposal for both a linear cut - although I learned today that this part of the proposal has now been dropped - and above all for a specific cut.
We farmers cannot accept that.
What is the reason for the missing 1.4 billion?
It is quite simply the collateral for the financing we obtained because of the BSE crisis.
In October 1996 the Council made provision for a possible postponement of payments to the oilseed sector from 1996 to 1997.
We did not need to take up the option, and to that extent it would not perhaps be very fair to speak of creative accounting in this instance.
Mr Samland, you asked what would happen in 1999 or 2000 if there were a postponement from 1998 to 1999.
I simply assume that we may well have a situation like this year's and shall not need to defer any payments.
That, in purely theoretical terms, is also the essence of Mr Mulder's proposal, whereby in the event of the whole amount not being used up, even in situations outside the domain of compulsory expenditure, a balance can be struck.
We shall perhaps be discussing this again in a year's time, but I do believe that this is certainly possible.
On the price package, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture gave a pledge to the Commission to keep the EAGGF Guarantee within the budgetary limits laid down for 1998.
Unfortunately, the Council did not comment on the possibility of a further postponement of the oilseed advance.
That would have saved us a great deal of bother.
