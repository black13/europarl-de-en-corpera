Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I may refer to my own report, on which we voted only a few weeks ago, on 12 June 1997, Parliament voted by a large majority against cutting compensatory payments for certain crop plants and for set-aside.
At the same time, Parliament backed the Committee on Budgets in opposing deferment of the oilseed advance.
In a further amendment contained in my report it was also decided that the payments per hectare envisaged in the CAP reform package should be guaranteed in full for 1998 and 1999.
I do find it quite astonishing that there should now be moves to deviate from this line without a reasonable alternative being presented.
Yesterday the farming press was already telling us that land and animal premiums were to remain the basis of future EU agricultural policy.
Commissioner Liikanen, as a Member of the Commission you no doubt played a part in that decision.
Regrettably, we have learned about it from the newspapers before it could be announced here.
On enquiring, we are told that the newspaper reports are accurate.
I am very interested in what you are going to say to us, how you intend to secure the acceptance of the farming community for a future agriculture policy if it is merely a continuation of present policy.
The fact is that we rather believed you stood for a new agricultural policy, for a policy that we could sustain, instead of which we are to have more payments per hectare and livestock premiums.
And you believe, do you, that farmers would approve of our continued support for this system?
I am very eager to hear what you have to say.
My special thanks go to our colleague Mr Mulder, who presented a very cogent argument; we fully endorse the points he made.
We do not want to run our heads against the wall.
We should far rather continue to work in harmony with the Committee on Budgets.
