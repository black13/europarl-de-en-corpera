Mr White, we shall naturally assess the results, just as we do with all our programmes.
But please remember that, since some parts of KONVER were extremely late in starting, an evaluation will not be possible until we can determine some results.
I do not have your figures to hand at the moment, but if I remember rightly we have completed about 6 % of the whole initiative.
I will gladly look up the UK figures for you afterwards.
So what this all means is that we have scarcely spent any KONVER funds yet, so it stands to reason that we have registered few successes so far.
We shall begin by considering the impact of the KONVER programme as a whole and then we shall provide opportunities, as has already been done, for exchanges of information relating to the various areas of the programme.
A few conferences of KONVER regions have already taken place.
