I believe I ought to be fair here.
If I have not told you today what is to become of KONVER, I must not say anything about the future of RECHAR either.
I hope you will understand.
But you know that we are trying to solve the problems associated with RECHAR, that we are very familiar with these problems and that we shall continue to try and offer whatever type of help we can to solve such problems.
But I would also ask you to appreciate that we must naturally respect Council decisions with regard to the ECSC.
