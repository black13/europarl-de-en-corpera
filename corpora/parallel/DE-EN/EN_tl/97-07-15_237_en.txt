Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, like the rapporteur, the Group of the European People's Party sees the Council's position as an important step - although not the final one - in the process of liberalizing international transport.
The provisional exclusion of local bus services from the scope of the legislation was something that Parliament had requested.
We therefore find it surprising that regionally based local bus services are not treated in the same way; however, it may be possible to correct this when we vote tomorrow.
In the meantime, I should like to thank the rapporteur for encouraging the House to support this additional amendment.
It makes sense, in our view, to proceed along the lines that the rapporteur has suggested - proposing changes which are geared to specific objectives, rather than simply deluding ourselves by retabling all the amendments that were proposed at first reading.
Legal requirements concerning social benefits and road safety are certainly among the major criteria that should determine access to the market.
We all know - and the Council, we hope, will take the same view - that liberalization and the competitive conditions which go with it cannot be allowed to produce a situation where social and safety legislation goes by the board.
In our opinion, the rapporteur's last amendment is also logical if, as I said to begin with, we do not regard this as the final step.
As far as we are concerned, the dates which he has set out are the latest possible deadlines for initiating a new legislative procedure.
We would also expect - and hope - that before then, Parliament will have an opportunity of expressing its opinion on transport issues more forcefully.
As to whether the Council is yet prepared to take our opinion into account, that may be more of a pious wish than a hope.
Nonetheless, it is a wish that I felt should not go unstated.
