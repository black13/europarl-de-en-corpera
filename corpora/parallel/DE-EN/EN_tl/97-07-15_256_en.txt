Madam President, I should like to take up the point which has just been made by the previous speaker.
I was very pleased to hear him emphasizing that the solution to this environmental problem must involve the entire Alpine region.
I am firmly convinced that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has made a mistake in not following the line taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which wished to see the concept of particularly sensitive routes replaced by that of particularly sensitive areas.
The whole question of the Alpine region and the traffic pollution there is a European problem.
This is not a matter of local interests, although of course it is also very important to the people who live there; the point is that we have to find a European solution, because the Alps are a European problem and not just an Austrian, Swiss or Italian one.
That is why I would urge the Commissioner to focus all the political efforts on finding a broadly European and environmentally sound solution for the sensitive Alpine region.
It is the only type of solution that will work.
We must avoid shifting the problem of pollution from one route to another, because that is not a political solution.
