Madam President, I asked for the floor because I wished to respond first of all to Mr Wijsenbeek, whose speech was extremely clever, even though wide of the mark.
We have to discuss this today and vote on it tomorrow, because the fact is that the Council is trying to avoid taking a decision on a European road tax, and one of its excuses is that Parliament has taken no decision.
That is why we must decide what our position is to be, then the Council will no longer be able to avoid the issue.
I should like to make two points to the Commissioner, however.
We normally have a very open relationship, Commissioner, but what you have presented us with today was not a genuine debate.
On the one hand, you say - indeed, you complain - that we do not yet wish to apply external costs.
And on the other, when we say that we shall have to include exhaust pollution and road damage when calculating user charges, and that we shall have to raise those charges, you also complain and protest that this was not the kind of European road tax which you envisaged.
That is a dishonest approach!
Secondly, Commissioner, you are here to defend your original proposal, but in the light of what we have heard from the negotiations in the Council, I have to say that your position is a long way behind the position which the House is seeking to adopt today.
