Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no good reason why the European Parliament should cut off its own nose.
And that is the danger today.
On 1 March 1995, after difficult and intensive negotiations, we rejected by a clear majority a directive on the patenting of biotechnological inventions.
Today we are dealing with this matter again.
The wording is new, the content old.
I could take the easy option and suggest that we vote 'no' as we did last time.
That would be wrong.
Biotechnological inventions help people, not only in medicine but in other areas too.
So these inventions must be protected, not for the sake of interested companies' bank balances but for the benefit of the women and men of our countries.
The discovered parts of the human body must not be redefined as inventions, which would make them patentable.
It is unacceptable that individual organizations should have a sole right of disposal over these.
Genes and gene sequences must remain the common property of humanity and be freely accessible to researchers for the benefit of all people.
That is the political decision before us.
The existing law on patents has nothing to do with this.
It is capital-centred and does not focus on people.
Our duty as Members of the European Parliament is to serve 370 million children, women and men.
This obligation underlies amendments 71 to 76.
That is why we tabled them.
Let me repeat that I am not against the patenting of biotechnological inventions.
I am against any attempt to patent human parts, animals and plants, to declare such discoveries to be inventions, thereby making them patentable.
