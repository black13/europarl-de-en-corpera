Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the present importance of this draft directive, as well as its far greater future importance, I do not intend to deal with the opportunities it offers.
These have in any case been sufficiently discussed already.
My purpose is rather to draw attention to the dangers that might lie ahead if we approve this draft, dangers which we should bear in mind when we come to cast our vote.
What I mean is that the prospect of short-term gains should not induce us to put our future in hock to this extent.
On the contrary, the reservations expressed by numerous experts should be taken seriously and examined carefully.
Let me give you an example to illustrate the importance of our decisions.
The draft before us lays down that the human genome and the gene sequences it contains are to be patentable.
That must be firmly rejected, for the human genome in any form is common property to which anyone should have unhindered access.
Reserving that right for individuals would enable them to monopolize knowledge of the uses and applications of the genome.
Another argument against the patentability of human DNA sequences is that it would prevent the use of specific sequence variations by anyone other than the patent-holder and would thereby hinder research.
For these reasons we shall reject the directive, and we know that our position has the support of the 1.2 million fellow Austrians who signed the national petition on this subject.
