Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur and I reached a fair compromise on Amendments 16 and 49 after lengthy discussions.
They concern recitals 16a and 16e and Article 3.
One of their chief aims is to prevent abuses.
Such abuses, which have in fact been tried already, could consist in patenting gene sequences without having any specific scientifically demonstrable application in mind.
The formulation 'an industrial application must be disclosed' draws a clear line.
DNA sequences are not patentable just because they have been discovered.
They can become patentable on the basis of explicitly described applications, such as the production of active substances.
Anyone who has ever looked into the enormous expenditure that the development of such active substances entails will surely understand and recognize the moral justification, and indeed the necessity, of stimulating research and development by holding out the prospect of a patent.
These are not, as the demagogues have claimed, patents on life but rather patents for life.
Genetically engineered human hormones, for example, will be a monumental step forward for haemophiliacs, for anaemia sufferers and for patients with genetic metabolic disorders.
In 1995, when this Parliament rejected the proposal for a so-called biopatent directive, many Members saw it as a moment of glory for the European Parliament.
But it caused consternation among Europe's biotechnologists, because outright rejection naturally deprived them of the upsurge in motivation which the draft directive was meant to provide.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is why we are contributing now to a genuine red-letter day in the life of this Parliament.
After nine long years, let us finally adopt this legislation.
