Madam President, Mr Rothley, you have argued very, very eloquently today in favour of employment, and you have undoubtedly imparted a sense of vision with regard to this entire issue.
But there are still some small discrepancies between your oral presentation and your written report.
Allow me to highlight a few.
The issue at stake here, of course, remains the monopoly of the pharmaceutical companies, which arises partly from the long lifespan of patents.
We are precluding research by small undertakings.
Holders of licences and patents will focus their research first and foremost on areas where, for example, there are large patient groups.
That has always been a reality which no-one, ourselves included, can ignore.
Discoverers of genes, according to your report, should still equate to patent-holders.
The patent-holder is given virtually exclusive rights to exploit and market the new research findings; given the near-oligopoly that exists in this domain, there is a particular danger that the SMEs and small research units will be trampled underfoot.
The reverse of your line of argument is true, which is why I see the Gebhardt and Berger amendments as an opportunity to redress the balance in some respects and to make the report approvable.
