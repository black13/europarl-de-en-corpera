Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 20th century has seen the emergence and development of two types of high-risk technology.
The first was nuclear power, and the second is genetic manipulation.
Nobody can say today which of the two will ultimately prove the more dangerous.
Mr Bowe's report shows quite clearly that those selfsame mistakes which a previous generation of politicians made are about to be repeated.
There was no risk assessment on the use of nuclear power.
The decision to develop nuclear energy was taken on the basis of misinformation about its potential effects.
We only know a tiny fraction today of all there is to learn about the actual consequences of genetic manipulation.
Nevertheless, it is to be pushed through with totally unnecessary haste.
What we must ask ourselves here is this: who needs such technology?
Who needs it immediately, and for what purpose?
There are a few industrial groups seeking to maximize their profits without incurring any of the attendant risks.
The Commission report is an attempt to lend them a helping hand.
In my opinion, Mr Bowe has made a very valiant effort to engage in damage limitation here.
One thing is perfectly clear: there is good reason for the haste with which genetically manipulated organisms are being released, because the more information people have about the possible consequences and risks, the harder it will be to legalize this technology.
Our duty as representatives of the people can only be to ensure that any type of danger to human beings is kept to an absolute minimum.
