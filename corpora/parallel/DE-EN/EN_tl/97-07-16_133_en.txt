Mr President-in-Office, I want to comment on just one aspect: the harmonization of taxation.
The extreme differences in tax legislation within Europe result in substantial distortions of competition and, in due course, the destruction of jobs.
The location of company headquarters and of many other business decisions today are determined not by economic aspects but, in practice, by fiscal aspects - by reasons unrelated to operational issues.
This is an area in which - and I appeal to you today before the European Parliament - you must make proposals, as you have suggested you will.
If no harmonization can be achieved during the first stage, at least realistic steps towards it can be attempted.
I know that my own government has said in the past that unanimity is so important in tax legislation.
I will make you an offer today: let us do away with the unanimity principle for tax bands and for the tax assessment base.
We should, in other words, be willing to take majority decisions on these aspects, without unanimity, because otherwise we will come no closer to solving this problem of tax harmonization.
That is why I am so grateful to you for mentioning this matter in your speech.
We look forward to seeing you taking genuine steps towards harmonization in the field of taxation, for the sake of our citizens and in the interests of competition in the global world market with the Americans and the Asians, and you will do so with the support of the European Parliament.
I would also ask that the Minutes should show that I have not used up all my allotted time.
