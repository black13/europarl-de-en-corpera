Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were talking earlier today about Agenda 2000 - about the future of Europe.
Now that we have moved on to debating Turkey, the issue is once again Europe - the issue is our joint future.
We want to share a joint future with Turkey.
We want open doors, not more walls.
We do not want a Europe that defines itself as the stronghold of the Christian West, but one based on laicism, where there is a place for everyone - Christian, Muslim, Jew or atheist.
But that future is based on one inalienable principle which the new Turkish Government really must take seriously, and that principle is: democracy and human rights.
Democracy and human rights has to mean more than the routine cosmetic protestations churned out by Mrs Ã‡iller's prayer wheel before customs union.
Democratization means providing a solid foundation for basic rights, such as guaranteed freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, as a precondition for any further open consideration of the future in Turkey.
Democracy means finally trying to find a political solution to the Kurdish problem; it means an end to the military option and to any invasion of northern Iraq.
The Kurdish question is inseparably linked to this democratization: it cannot be delegated to the military even though certain people both here and in Turkey would have us believe that the military is the guarantor of democracy and the rule of law.
Was it not specifically the last military coup in Turkey, in 1980, that left the present legacy of antidemocratic structures?
But when I say no more walls, I also mean, indeed I particularly mean, that existing walls must be torn down.
Cyprus needs, at last, to look forward to some prospect of a solution.
The latest threats uttered by Mr Ecevit have not been exactly helpful here.
