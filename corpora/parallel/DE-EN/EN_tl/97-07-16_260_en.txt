In Amendment No 10, something of the utmost importance to all opponents of atomic energy is being put to the vote.
Let the Euratom Treaty be abrogated in its present form but its safety aspects incorporated into the Treaty on European Union.
If that amendment should actually be adopted tomorrow - as I hope - then it would probably be the first time in the history of this Parliament that an anti-atomic amendment reaches the conciliation procedure.
That would mean that, for the first time, the Council would have to come to terms with criticism and rejection of its atomic policy.
There was a similar amendment once before, but that one started from the extremely naive assumption that all Europe's atomic power stations would be shut down by the year 2002.
Anyone who realizes that 34 % of all the electrical power consumed in the EU comes from atomic power stations - in France, the figure is 70 % - will appreciate that this is not an option.
Also, the safety and health provisions must be retained at all costs -if only, of course, because eastward enlargement will bring certain States into the Union whose safety standards are absolutely different from our own.
In that case, of course, they would have to observe those safety provisions.
If all environmentally aware Members, across party boundaries and across national boundaries, too, can find it in their hearts to vote together in tomorrow's vote, then we have a chance to get to the conciliation procedure.
I would really look forward very much to such a procedure, and I believe that, here again, I must most sincerely thank our rapporteur, Lone Dybkjaer.
She has done all this really, really excellently, and if we succeed then that success will be hers, too.
