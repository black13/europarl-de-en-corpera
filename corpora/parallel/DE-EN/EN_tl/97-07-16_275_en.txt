Mr President, we may have different views about what constitutes paternalism.
But are the countries concerned really under any obligation to reply if they don't want to?
Can we not simply leave things as they are?
After all, we are all glad that some of Mr Virgin's amendments, and our own, have been adopted.
As for paternalism, I should be very cautious about what it actually is.
