Mr President, it seems to me that when we look back on conferences we do so from different angles.
It's just like the celebrated half-full or half-empty glass of water - we see different things, depending on our standpoint.
This conference commits the European Union, which is the world's largest association of industrialized nations, with great wealth and a population that can already do a lot and has the ability to do more, to work in the sector of climate protection and sustainable development, both within this Union and in the countries of the Third and Fourth Worlds, and in those planning to join our Community soon, to improve the environmental situation.
We also need credibility, we need to set a good example.
Then we shall be able to tell others why it is right to work to improve the environment, and what the rewards are.
If we want a future that offers sustainable development, employment and quality of life, we must work on our environment.
I believe a great deal still has to be done, including the preparations for Kyoto.
The road to Kyoto should be paved not just with good intentions but with a lot of hard work.
If we now work together - Parliament, Commission and Council - to develop proposals for Kyoto, and if those proposals can then be accepted and implemented, we shall have made our contribution to ensuring that, at last, the glass is neither half full nor half empty but full to the brim with quality of life and a healthy future for all mankind.
