Mr President, Agenda 2000 is an impressive global vision, requiring all the political forces of Europe to be involved in the work that lies ahead - including those forces whose concept of a healthy, peaceful future for Europe differs, indeed differs very strongly, from the Commission's notion.
The key to success will indeed be the courage to set priorities in every sector and to abandon the 'equal shares for all' principle.
I welcome the emphasis on the environmental aspects of rural development and agricultural policy.
In dealing with all these issues it will be necessary to break down taboos and stop burying our heads in the sand.
President Santer has said that the euro must be introduced as planned on 1 January 1999.
The question may be whether the euro can be introduced on 1 January 1999, against the will of many citizens, if the high aims of Agenda 2000, especially enlargement, are to be achieved.
