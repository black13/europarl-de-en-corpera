Mr President, my group has expressly committed itself to ensuring that expenditure on the Foreign and Security Policy should not be treated as compulsory and the rights of Parliament with regard to the budget should not be restricted.
So we have no alternative but to vote in favour of the compromise which is now on the table, because by doing so we shall prevent the worst from happening.
I do see a problem, though, and I shall be grateful if the Commission would give me an answer on this, even if not today.
With regard to the foreign and security policy, we have always found that the critical weakness is not any budgetary problem but always the question of who we should make responsible and how we are to control the expenditure side.
We have always said that there is a procedural loophole in Article J.11.
In my view, this interinstitutional agreement has not closed that loophole.
I should be grateful if the Commission would once again let the Committee on Budgets have its opinion on this.
