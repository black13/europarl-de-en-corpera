Madam President, despite grave misgivings which I share with Mrs Schierhuber and Mrs Seillier, I voted in favour of the Rothley report because it contains important amendments regarding the protection of human life and, especially, human embryos.
I refer in particular to Amendments Nos 55 ba and 55 bb.
I would however like to give a very clear warning to the Council not to remove these key elements of the compromise, because many of us would then no longer feel able to vote in favour of this Directive, because these matters are really important.
Incidentally, we can congratulate ourselves on having rejected the wretched first draft, more than a year ago, and on having refused to be intimidated by the threat 'if you reject it your rights will be reduced' .
We have more rights today than we have ever had.
At that time, an attempt was made to put pressure on us with the argument 'if you reject it, there won't be a new draft in a hurry' .
Well, today we have already had the new draft.
So perhaps we can be spared this phoney pressure in the future!
I call upon the Council not to remove the human life amendments from this compromise.
