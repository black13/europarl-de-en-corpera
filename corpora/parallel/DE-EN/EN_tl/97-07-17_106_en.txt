Mr President, following the military coup in Cambodia on 4 July, we were all very shocked.
We had hoped that after the blood-bath in Cambodia, which had been going on for such a long time, peace had finally been achieved with the Paris Agreement in 1991.
We know that since the elections in 1993 corruption has been increasing in Cambodia.
We have also discussed, many times, the fact that during the period immediately after a war there is still a certain amount of potential for violence among the population, or aggression between certain groups within the population, various social groups, and we have also discussed the question of how this could perhaps be reduced by means of a decent foreign policy.
We should also use this as an opportunity to develop new concepts and measures for countries which have experienced violence.
We should not, however, in any way accept this military coup.
The question is, what can we do?
More news keeps on coming in, for example the news that members of FUNCINPEC are still being oppressed.
We have hundreds of victims to mourn, and I believe that it would be the right thing to do, first of all, to freeze the EU's Cooperation Agreement, and to support those ASEAN States who have asked for accession to be postponed.
I believe that this military government must be made to see that it will not make any progress in Cambodia if it continues to use force.
