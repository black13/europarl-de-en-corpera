Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the application on the table now is an application that we are fully able to support.
It is a positive step, and yet at the same time a sad one too.
The sad aspect is that there are very many war criminals still at large.
Also sad, perhaps, is the fact that that a death has occurred in connection with an arrest.
However sad that may be, I believe that it is clearly necessary for the international community, including via its military representatives in former Yugoslavia, to make it clear that it cannot and must not happen that war criminals are allowed to run around at liberty, whatever side they may have fought on in the war.
There are no grounds that can justify the crimes that now have to be judged by the tribunal in The Hague.
If there has been a war, if there have been quarrels, especially between different ethnic groups, then we need reconciliation, we need cooperation, but we also need justice.
On all sides we are fully agreed on the need for such justice.
This does not mean that at the same time we do not need to build up new structures, or provide help and support, or create a feeling of trust.
In places where minor mistakes have been made, there must also be forgiveness.
There must be cooperation between the various groups, as we saw just recently on our trip to Croatia.
There, steps are being taken, incomplete, hesitant steps, but nevertheless steps towards reconciliation, and this is also happening in Bosnia.
I hope that it will soon be a matter of course in the Serbian Republic too.
It is right that the international community should act, albeit rather late in the day, and we must give this action our full support, because there are only two things that can help: the pursuit of the war criminals, and assistance and support for the community concerned.
