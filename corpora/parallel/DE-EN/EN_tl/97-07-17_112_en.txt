Mr President, I should like, above all, to thank the Liberal Group for proposing this resolution.
I used to take a rather critical attitude towards the idea of such a court, but now that we have that court, we must use it if we are to retain any credibility.
In the past, I have to say, it was not so much the fault of the various governments of former Yugoslavia - with the exception of the Serbs - that the war criminals were not delivered up to justice, but it was due rather to a weakness on the part of the West.
We could have arrested certain war criminals perfectly easily, but we did not do so.
I shall not go into details, because time is short, but it is a fact well-known to everyone on the spot that men such as Karadzic and Mladic, for example, were not arrested because of orders issued by higher authority.
I should like to thank Mr Swoboda very much for proposing this resolution, and also for emphasizing at the same time that there are various responsibilities involved there, and that in general we make the mistake of repeatedly attributing responsibility evenly.
Anyone who has been to Croatia and Serbia knows who the aggressor was, because in Croatia the houses and churches have been destroyed, but in Serbia not a single shot was fired.
There are major differences here, and if we throw everything together in the same pot, we shall not be creating the justice that is so absolutely necessary.
