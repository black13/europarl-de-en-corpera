Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports that reach us from Kenya are really far from satisfactory.
However, I should just like to make three points, and to put three questions to the opposition.
Firstly, I have the impression that to some extent we are now achieving changes in the third world which did not occur in Central European states until the beginning of the 'nineties, in other words a shift in the blocks and regimes which were firmly established there and whose democratic legitimacy no one dared to shake or call into question.
These are now being examined.
Secondly, an opposition is not necessarily a protector of democracy.
Let us hope that the situation in Kenya is not similar to the one in Zaire.
Thirdly, we must take care to ensure that street fighting and demonstrations do not take on a momentum of their own, so that later, when what they are demanding has been introduced, they can no longer be halted.
Now I come to my three questions.
Firstly, the government accuses the opposition of not giving notice of rallies which were possible under the old law, which originated from the British colonial period, in order to give the impression, abroad, that they continue to be obstructed in their freedom of assembly.
Is that true, or has the Commission any information on this point?
Secondly, what is the opposition's position regarding their willingness to refrain from using force when the constitutional changes that have been announced come into force?
Thirdly, what does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that President Moi really does introduce the constitutional changes that he has announced?
