Madam President, Peru has always been one of our problem children in Latin America.
First it was the economy, but that is doing rather better now.
It has always been terrorism, and this has now clearly reared its ugly head again.
Yet not everyone who attacks the government should be suspected of terrorist intrigues.
And now we are actually concerned about democracy in Peru.
In May, at the inter-parliamentary conference in Caracas, we had plenty of opportunity to talk to our colleagues from Peru.
Freedom of opinion is under threat, the independence of the judiciary is threatened by the current government, and we should like to call upon that government, as a matter of urgency, at least to respect the rules that are enshrined in the Peruvian constitution.
Only then can a balance be restored in that country between economic stability, the fight against terrorism, freedom of opinion and a renaissance of political life.
There is no doubt that the current president does not want to know about political parties, and the parties themselves are also very weak.
I believe, however, precisely because all our parties have links with Peru, that we should help and give warnings here.
With this in mind, my group will support the resolution.
