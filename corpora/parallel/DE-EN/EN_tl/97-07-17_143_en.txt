Madam President, very unwillingly I cannot share the opinion of my friends Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler and Mr Bertens.
I have a rather different opinion on this subject.
When we talk about Peru today, we should never lose sight of what Peru looked like even as little as 10 years ago, and in what condition the country stood, when the acts of violence committed by criminal, terrorist organizations cost over 20, 000 innocent people their lives, and did incalculable damage both to society and to the economy.
If we look at Peru today, we see a country that is very probably making great efforts to institutionalize a system, which is putting a stop to terrorism, and which is trying to give back to its citizens a broad measure of confidence in their own country.
We should not forget that the government of Peru has, for example, set up a commission to examine all the judgments that have been given in connection with terrorism.
In recent months, this commission has revised over 500 judgments.
We should also not forget that a military court has just convicted four officers for abusing their powers.
Peru is making enormous efforts to shake off the bad reputation that originated in its terroristovershadowed past, and I believe that at the present time we would be well advised not only to criticise - sometimes that is necessary - but also to encourage and to support.
