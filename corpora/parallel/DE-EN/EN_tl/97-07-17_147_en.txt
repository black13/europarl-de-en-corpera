Madam President, I support many of the things that the previous speakers have said.
For women, this is one of the most serious violations imaginable, and it is not justified on either religious or medical grounds.
Unfortunately, in many areas of the world - not only in Europe, but also, to some extent, in Asia - it is regarded as a tradition, which we can deal with only by enlightenment.
It is one of the most delicate problems, when one is speaking to African women or women from these countries, because, basically, resistance must come from among the women themselves, with our help, so as to break with these traditions.
Therefore we really should do everything in order to contribute to this enlightenment.
We can only appeal to the Egyptian Government.
Egypt wants to be seen to be a modern country, a major, leading country in the region.
It is helpful to bring enlightenment and to challenge this tradition, which unfortunately the women in these countries also want to maintain.
Here too, we should see to it that, via our own channels, we do more to fight it than is already being done by the United Nations and UNICEF.
