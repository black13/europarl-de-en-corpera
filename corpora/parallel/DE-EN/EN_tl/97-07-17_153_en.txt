Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, though we are dealing with the resolution on Tunisia today, that is not because the situation in Tunisia is particularly bad.
There are many countries in which human rights abuses are altogether worse and more extensive.
But we regard Tunisia as our neighbour, our friend, and we are particularly critical towards our neighbours in North Africa who find themselves in a difficult and precarious position.
We are convinced that the economic and social development of every country, including Tunisia, is crucially dependent on the parallel development of human rights.
And on this point I should like to say quite clearly that in the past there have been very positive developments in this area.
I should also, however, like to say equally clearly that in recent times we have experienced certain events which we are not exactly overjoyed about.
Amongst other things, a member of a political organization who took part in a colloquium in Brussels was treated very roughly, to put it mildly, on his return home, and in this as in other cases, differing accounts are given as to what happened.
We believe that Tunisia should in fact be a symbol, a test case for free, democratic development in North Africa.
If there is one means of opposing extremism, one means of opposing radical fundamentalism, one means of opposing tendencies towards isolation and dictatorship, then that means is the safeguarding of human rights, and the positive development of human rights, and this seems to us, particularly in Tunisia, to be possible, achievable and very necessary.
