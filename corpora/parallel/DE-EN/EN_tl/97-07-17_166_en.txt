Madam President, the Brussels conference on landmines, which has already been mentioned, impressed all those who were able to attend it.
We were also able, at that conference, to record a small success, inasmuch as the disarmament conference on conventional weapons, which was happening in Geneva at the same time, finally agreed to appoint a coordinator for landmine clearance, something that had been on the agenda for a long time.
On the question that has been raised regarding Greece/Finland, I should just like to say one thing.
What we say should be true, but we do not always have to say everything that is true.
With this in mind, I should like to argue that we should not agree to this amendment.
Instead, we should seek to persuade these two countries to overcome their reservations and join the other 13 countries - and this is something that I would welcome very much - in signing the Brussels declaration.
I do not think, however, that on this account they should now be given special mention in the resolution.
Mr Bertens, at the press conference in Brussels, gave a clear indication that this would be the case.
A second point, which is very dear to my heart, is the clearance of mines, because one thing is connected with another.
Here we are looking, above all, at the possibilities offered by mechanical landmine clearance.
However, I would ask the Commission to ensure that the funds earmarked from the Community budget for mine clearance should again be set at the same level as in the 1997 budget, so that we can continue our work.
It is not only a matter of mines in Africa and Asia, but in the meantime we have also seen this scourge on the EU's own doorstep, in Eastern Slavonia, and we cannot send refugees back to an area where mines have been laid.
Therefore I would earnestly entreat the Commission to take action on this issue.
