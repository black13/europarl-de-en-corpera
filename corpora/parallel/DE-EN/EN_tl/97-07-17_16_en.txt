Commissioner Mar√≠n, I believe that we are discussing here not only an exemplary case but also a tragic one.
It is tragic because the projects have usually been well run.
For example, in Cologne there is a filmmaker who is working on a television and film station in Palestine, in other words, a super project.
Yet that project has been placed at risk, and I must say, quite clearly, that it is you and the Commission as a whole who are responsible for that.
In Committee, I asked you several times how it could happen that the Commission could allow a bourse-bypassing transaction to run for three years, without there being any possibility of exposing it.
The answer that you gave to me was, ' I can do nothing about it if an employee who makes an administrative mistake does not come to me voluntarily and reveal the mistake to me himself' .
I think that you are technically right, but it does make me wonder to think that you at the Commission have absolutely no idea of how a control system can be built into your own administration, so that such methods of procedure can be discovered.
How is it possible, then, to carry out checks on how resources are used, if you do not have any mechanisms within the Commission for uncovering such horrendous mistakes?
As far as I am concerned, that is still the crucial question, regardless of who has what responsibility in detail.
You are responsible for that, and it must be put right!
