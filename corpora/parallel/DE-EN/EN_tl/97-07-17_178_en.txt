Madam President, the various disasters in Austria, which have just been mentioned, also affected the Czech Republic and Poland, particularly at the beginning, and these two countries are still suffering as a result.
We often adopt solidarity resolutions, but we should remember that we have an obligation, in the first place, to European countries, which share our culture and history, particularly when those countries have suffered so much in recent decades.
For it is, in particular, those nations that lay under Soviet occupation who have paid the real price of the Second World War.
In such cases we should express our solidarity clearly, and in as non-bureaucratic a manner as possible.
Bureaucratic assistance is never as good as spontaneous, active assistance.
