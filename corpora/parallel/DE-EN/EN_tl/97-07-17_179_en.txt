Madam President, with regard to the tight economic situation in Poland and the Czech Republic, it is a very heavy burden, in terms of social equilibrium, that these two countries should now have to cope, in addition, with the consequences of this environmental disaster.
It is particularly hard on people who have lost what they toiled so hard for.
Environmental disasters do not have purely natural causes.
It is not enough to bewail such disasters; it is also up to us in the West to take preventive measures on behalf of the East and the South.
I am referring here to Rio + 5, and the unfortunate fact that it was still not possible to agree on CO2 consumption, which of course needed to be reduced, by a definite figure, in order to prevent environmental disasters from happening in future.
I should also like to ask the Commissioner why the Commission has still not taken any steps, within INTERREG, which is used, for example for cooperation on the 'renaturing' of rivers, in order to seek to obtain a joint fund.
There is still the difficulty of financing joint projects in a manner which really is uncomplicated.
I should like to ask you to give us an answer on that point.
All I can say is, hands off the concreting of river banks!
It should not happen, because that is what leads to such disasters, and therefore the Commission should not pay out a penny for concreting river banks, for example the R. Havel in Brandenburg, in the context of the trans-European river network scheme.
