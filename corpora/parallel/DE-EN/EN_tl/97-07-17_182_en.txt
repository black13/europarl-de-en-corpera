Madam President, the Commissioner has not given us any answer on the subject of INTERREG 2c.
The question was, whether the Commission would be willing to use INTERREG 2c as one fund in future, and not to let it carry on as two separate funds, INTERREG and PHARE, so as to make it easier for joint projects to be funded.
