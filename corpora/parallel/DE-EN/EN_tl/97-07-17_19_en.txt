Mr President, the report by Mr Fabra Vall√©s reveals, penetratingly and unambiguously, how European tax-payers' money has been used irresponsibly in connection with the MED programmes.
We must be grateful to the rapporteur for his plain speaking and his clear demonstration of the irregularities that have occurred at all levels.
It is particularly regrettable that in this case the crucial error happened in Brussels, and the fact that the competent Commission department was under a great deal of pressure, as regards both time and expectations, is absolutely unacceptable as an excuse.
If such an excuse was acceptable, then irregularities in practically all private and public management activities would remain completely hidden, because pressures of time and expectations are an everyday feature of the global market.
It is simply incomprehensible that such a complex programme, which was intended to set in motion intensive cooperation throughout the Mediterranean, and which accounts for financial resources totalling ECU 78 million, could be introduced in such a dilettantish and non-serious way.
A system was set up which had built into it a conflict of interests which has led to what we now know to be extremely serious results.
As a result of blatant irregularities, this programme, in itself a sensible one, has now been devalued in the eyes of the public.
For many small European tax-payers, however, whose lives are being made intolerable by economy measures, the question is bound to arise as to whether they are even a step in the right direction.
In my opinion, the resumption of the decentralized programmes cannot be approved until all the irregularities from the first phase have been cleared up, without leaving any loose ends, and until the public prosecutor's offices and courts have done their work.
