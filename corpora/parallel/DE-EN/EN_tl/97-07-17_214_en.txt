Mr President, I believe that all of us taking part in the discussions here agree that the social dialogue will only work if there is representativeness, in other words, if everyone who is involved in the social dialogue at national level also has a place at European level.
This is particularly important when the European Union wants to implement Community measures at national level as well.
In order to do this, it needs a partner who is capable of implementing them, and such a partner will exist only if there is representativeness.
I should like to show you, taking Austria as an example, that this representativeness does not exist everywhere.
Mr Menrad indicated as much when he spoke, for which I should like to thank him.
In Austria, the position is this: the Chamber of Business, which in Austria represents the small and medium-sized undertakings, trade and commerce, does not have a place at European level.
At that level, the industrialists' association, within UNICE, is the corresponding partner, in other words, the partner that determines wages in Austria is not involved at European level.
That is a dilemma, because it means that many business people do not have a place at European level and, conversely, the European Union has no opportunity of asserting its interests in Austria.
However, this can be changed.
I have tabled Amendment No 2, with reference to Point 17, and I would ask you to support it, because it says that we can decide here that the partner that determines pay levels, the Austrian Chamber of Business, can be involved, by way of an exception, in the social dialogue.
