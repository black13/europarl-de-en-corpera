Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Vice-President Mar√≠n most sincerely.
I am afraid, however, that some misunderstandings may have crept in, perhaps as a result of the interpreting.
It is not true that we demanded the suspension of the contracts.
It is the Commission's business to implement that.
On the contrary, we found - and this is clearly stated in the report - that the Commission acted correctly and that it must now be in our joint interest to reveal the mistakes, so that we can learn from them and put a stop to the irregularities.
The programmes, however, should start running again.
I have already made that quite clear in my earlier contribution to the debate, but perhaps there has been some misunderstanding here.
In any case, we should like to say than you.
The debate was necessary, but it was not the final debate.
I think that is something that both sides can agree on.
