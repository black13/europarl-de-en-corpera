Mr President, I am giving this explanation of vote not on behalf of the group, but for myself personally.
As seems to be the case in other groups too, in relation to tobacco there are different views in our group, though not fundamentally different, but people vote differently according to the way they feel.
One view was that if we are in favour of restricting the cultivation of tobacco, then we must offer those regions and businesses who depend on tobacco growing some alternatives, by means of compensatory payments and subsidies, so that jobs are maintained in these rural areas and so that businesses are not destroyed.
A simple policy of cutting resources, which is then made out to be a health policy, must not lead to the destruction of these existences.
From that point of view, we should not make such a direct and hasty combination of health policy and tobacco support.
If we want to live a healthy life, we can do so, even if tobacco goes on being grown, and if we want to live an unhealthy life, then we can do that too, even if tobacco is no longer grown.
It is a question of regulating the market for tobacco, and deciding how it should be organized, and the EU's health policy is a different issue altogether.
