In order to comply with the formalities, I should like to make an oral addition to Amendment No 1, reading as follows: ' This arrangement shall apply exclusively to voluntary set-aside' .
This forms the third paragraph of the amendment.
I repeat: ' This arrangement shall apply exclusively to voluntary set-aside' .
That is what was agreed.
