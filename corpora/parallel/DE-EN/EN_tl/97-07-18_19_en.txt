Mr President, I should just like to reply briefly to our Italian colleague, who made a connection between this important subject and alcoholism.
I do share her view regarding the danger of alcoholism, but that danger is minimized by sensible, moderate consumption of wine or beer, in keeping with a country's traditions.
She is in fact arguing against excessive centralization and standardization in Europe.
In Bavaria, for example, beer is drunk in a measured way - and that is why we call the mug from which we drink it a 'measure' .
I should like to invite my colleague to come with me some time to Kloster Andechs, where one of Bavaria's best beers is brewed, and she will see for herself how healthy beer is for body and soul!
