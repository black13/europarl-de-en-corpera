Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearly there is such a thing in parliamentary life as close encounters of the third kind, namely when both the Greens and the Socialists come out in favour of real market freedom, and the Liberals, on liberal grounds, say: ' Oh well, let us leave things be.
If there really are oligopolistic market structures, then so be it.
We can do nothing about it, so it is better to do nothing at all.'
That is precisely the point.
By introducing flexible rules - and mechanical algorithms are of little help here, since they are easily disproved - we must firstly strengthen the market position of consumers and, secondly, deal with the diverse networks of vertical concentration and integration in such a way that fair competition is still possible.
Flexible EU rules are needed to this end.
We therefore support the amendment outlined by Mr Ettl a moment ago.
