Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is little to add to this very clear report.
However, I should like to take up an issue which Mr Blokland has already touched on.
The rapporteur is justifiably critical of the fact that opening hours and zoning laws are classified in the Green Paper as admission thresholds.
This is an extremely sensitive area, and the scope for regional policy measures must definitely be retained here.
The comparison in the McKinsey Global Institute report with developments in the USA is not relevant in this context: the circumstances in America cannot be compared with the structures which have evolved over centuries in a good many European countries.
Experiments with liberal opening hours have sometimes shown that neither businesses, employees, nor consumers are willing to depart from tradition, and that there has been no increase at all in turnover, let alone the creation of any new jobs.
The right to refuse planning permission on environmental grounds is a major aspect of the local authorities' powers, and should help to maintain a harmonious pattern of urban development.
The building of new supermarkets on the outskirts of small towns has often meant that the creation of new jobs on the edge of town has been matched by a loss of jobs in the centre.
It therefore makes sense for retailers' associations to have a say, for example through the elected local council in the case of planning permission for supermarkets, and this cannot be described as an admission threshold.
