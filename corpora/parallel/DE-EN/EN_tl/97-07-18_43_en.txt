Mr President, after that wonderful tirade from Mrs Pack, I would just begin by saying that I am totally behind her.
She has put her finger on it: the greatest demagogues in the European Union are the ladies and gentlemen of the Council.
They are primarily responsible for the present situation, not only because of the structure, which after all has put us in an impossible position on foreign policy on many occasions, but also because the Council never thinks through what it does, handing us tasks which we cannot fulfil.
I should like to make two points concerning this programme.
Firstly, once we have extracted the funds from the Council, we must take account of the major differences between these countries.
I often have the impression - I come across this all the time - that all these states are being put in the same pigeon-hole.
They should not be.
The history, the past of each country and its education system all form part of the full picture.
Secondly, I would take up what the Portuguese speaker before me said: far more emphasis must be placed on language teaching.
I have seen the same thing throughout Hungary and Romania: the only languages taught there are English and sometimes French.
In the future, there will be a flood of English-speaking people; the economy needs them.
We must not forget that Communism robbed these young people of language opportunities.
We must see to it that they learn languages which will give them a future.
And I would put Spanish and Portuguese top of the list, because these are our partners.
I would just add that while we can agree to this proposal, we are hardly overjoyed by it!
