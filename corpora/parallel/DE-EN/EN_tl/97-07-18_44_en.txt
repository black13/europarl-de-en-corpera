Mr President, the employment summit is to take place in Luxembourg in a few months from now, and job creation must of course be its top priority.
I believe that education is the prime basis for employment.
Now that Agenda 2000 refers to 11 new countries, education must be our first concern.
It is absolutely essential to communicate with these countries, not only by holding talks at expert level, but by entering into a broader dialogue in firms, schools and universities.
In my opinion, the education programmes have already done an excellent job, and can do even more in the future.
We all know that life-long learning will become much more important in the future.
People must be equipped not just with technical skills, but with social and personal skills as well.
