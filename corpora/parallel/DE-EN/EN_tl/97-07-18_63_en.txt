Mr President, perhaps I will be allowed my speaking time after all!
Ladies and gentlemen - those who have stayed the course - we are behaving as if stand-by aid were real aid.
In practice, these countries are being given support to enable them to repay the IMF, but stand-by loans will not solve their debt problems.
With the aid of EU loans, money is being lent at favourable rates by private banks; the European taxpayers are acting as guarantors.
However, the recipient states must repay that money to the banks, which means that EU assistance is causing these countries to run up debts with private banks.
And we call this support for economic reform in these countries!
This is a fundamental issue which I believe we must address.
On balance, I am pleased that the report is being held over, since it might then be possible to include Tajikistan - not 'if appropriate' , but for certain, because we need to show willing.
Tajikistan has made tremendous progress towards peace, surpassing all expectations.
I think that we should therefore show willing, and not exclude Tajikistan.
