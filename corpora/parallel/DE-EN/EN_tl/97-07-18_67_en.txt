Mr President, I am one of the newest Members of this House, having been here only since last November.
So it is a tremendous honour for me now to be able to follow on from Mr van der Waal, as I have noticed even in such a short period of time what a pillar of support he has always been to the House, especially on matters relating to personal values or the family.
Christian values lie very close to my heart, and in this area he has always been a mainstay of Parliament.
I wish to thank him most sincerely for that!
As far as the report is concerned, I naturally have mixed feelings about the fact that the vote on financial assistance to Armenia, Georgia and Tajikistan is not to take place today, if I have understood correctly.
I think that it is extremely important for us to support these countries, for the economic reasons already explained by Mr Kittelmann, but for political reasons too.
I believe that these three countries are Europe's natural political partners, but that all three are in a very difficult, exposed position.
All three of them are more susceptible to Russian influence than we would like.
We should not forget that Russia has on the one hand proved itself to be an expansionist state and, on the other, fallen short of our democratic standards.
Georgia in particular has regrettably proved on many occasions to be a puppet of Moscow.
Nor should it be forgotten that President Shevardnadze is only in power at the moment because he deposed the democratically elected president, Mr Gamsakhurdia, with Russia's assistance.
Nevertheless, Georgia has done much to assert its independence.
I therefore very much hope that support will be forthcoming for these three countries, because we Europeans ought to show them that we mean well.
