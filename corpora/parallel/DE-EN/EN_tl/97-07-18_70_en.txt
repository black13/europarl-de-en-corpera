Mr President, there is no disagreement on the substance of the matter.
What we have had in fact, and still have - so I am surprised by the Commissioner's surprise - is a difference of opinion between the two arms of the budgetary authority, which we had actually hoped to settle in July.
But then one arm of the budgetary authority, namely the Council, postponed the date for reaching a decision, through a trialogue or conciliation procedure, until September.
And now we are in some difficulty.
This was not what we wanted: we had hoped to settle things this month.
The problem is that the date for conciliation is not until early September.
So it is because of this postponement that we are asking, pursuant to Rule 131, for no vote to be held today.
There is no conflict as regards the substance of the matter.
I am sure - and I am grateful to the rapporteur for having said as much - that we shall be able to adopt this report by a large majority in the House at the September part-session.
The only difference of opinion is with the Council.
