Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
We Greens also regret the conflict and thank the rapporteur for the fact that a solution has been found here.
We should stress, however, that we are not happy with this compromise and, indeed, cannot ever be happy with it, as long as we recall the stubborn and unreasonable attitude of the Council in recent years.
From the very beginning there were conflicts over the financial framework for the Raphael programme.
For years we have experienced the ritual refusal of the Council to carry out the wishes of Parliament for the extension of this programme and of the cultural programme as a whole.
This refusal must be regarded as particularly incomprehensible in the light of the debate on employment policy.
Here, there is already a European authority for employment policy, an authority that needs no further debate and one that undoubtedly meets with the highest level of public acceptance.
It is simply incomprehensible, therefore, that this authority is not being aggressively developed, but that the Parliament is basically dragging its way through years of conflict, in order to produce a half way acceptable programme.
That will not do, and that will not do for the coming years!
