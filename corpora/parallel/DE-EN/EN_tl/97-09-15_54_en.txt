Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
We too agee with the rapporteur that a lot of effort into grappling with a severe shortage of money.
Maintaining the cultural heritage is certainly a European responsibility.
But we cannot first moraleize on the subject or give up, just because the cost has to be counted, because there is the duty to administer the cultural heritage.
So we advocate further research and that projects to be funded be prepared accordingly.
The Parliament's responsibility cannot end when the cheque has been posted and the money has been paid; that is a long way from ensuring that Europe's cultural heritage is preserved.
The o/t acclaimed integration, the cross-border effects and, above all, the economic success constantly referred to here in relation to sustained employment and so on will only be achieved when communication about the cultural heritage is managed in the same way.
The custodians of cultural property must ensure that their message reaches the public.
