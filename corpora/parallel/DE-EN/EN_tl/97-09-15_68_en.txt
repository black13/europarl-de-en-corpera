Mr President, of the many valuable and forward-looking ideas contained in this report I would emphasize the need to link cultural requirements with quality tourism.
The areas of cultural variety, quality tourism and employment policy must in future represent a sort of golden triangle in European regional policy.
The reform of the structural funds after 1999 presents a first class opportunity to bind the cultural dimension, generating economic growth through quality tourism, much more closely to aid policy.
The European Parliament will play a particularly active part in this matter as a focus for the variety of European cultures.
I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for emphasizing that sport is a cultural activity which should also be used in the struggle against racism.
