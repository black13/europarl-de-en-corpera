Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as stated in the question, Directive 93/119 on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing provides that this directive is not applicable in the case of the killing of animals at cultural or sporting events.
The Commission is of the opinion that in these cases national authorities are responsible for the welfare of the animals in question.
This approach is in accordance with the Protocol on Animal Protection to the Amsterdam Treaty agreed in June 1997.
As animal protection is not an express part of the Treaty of Rome or other agreements, the Commission can only repeat its earlier advice to the governments of Member States to do all in their power to bring to an end all unacceptable practices where animals are killed during cultural and sporting events.
