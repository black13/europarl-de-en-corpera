Mr President, Mrs McIntosh, as I said earlier, one must first bear in mind that the question of animal protection is not solely the task of, or not solely regulated by, Community law, but that merely specific aspects of animal protection are regulated at Community level.
Anything more than that comes within the authority of Member States and their legislation.
Member States must also be responsible to this authority.
Where regulations under Community law are concerned, in this case Guideline 119/93, Member States are also charged with the execution and application of these Guidelines.
Where it is discovered during an inspection that a Member State is paying insufficient attention to the regulations, or has undertaken unsatisfactory measures for the execution of the guidelines, it has to be decided if a charge of contravention should be initiated against such a member state.
I should be pleased to send my colleague, Mrs Bonino, information on this, as the subject of inspection of animal protection measures, according to the new distribution of responsibilities within the Commission that was mainly demanded by Parliament, now falls within her province.
