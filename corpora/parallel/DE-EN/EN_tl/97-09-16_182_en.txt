Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think I have made it quite clear that there are separate responsibilities here, if you want to call them that, in accordance with subsidiarity.
We as a Commission have to obey the requirements of the treaty, but I should like to stress that we also have to ensure that the treaty is complied with.
If there are any transgressions to these guidelines, then we are obliged to correct those transgressions.
