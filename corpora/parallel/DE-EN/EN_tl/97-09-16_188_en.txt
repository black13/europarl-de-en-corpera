Mr Commissioner, there is a degree of tolerance for the commercialization of Portuguese grape varieties that are grown from unclassified cultivated rice material.
That can only be explained by the fact that the Portuguese authorities are fairly strict - it is an old tradition since our Inquisition, if not a very wise one!
For this reason some are grown in France, then loaded and sold again to Portugal.
There have already been complaints about it.
For instance, Mr Legras received a complaint on 1 September this year, which can be easily established.
That is just for your information.
