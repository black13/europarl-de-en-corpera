I would just like to respond quickly to that.
I have, of course, little influence on the wisdom of the Portuguese authorities.
But I can assure you of one thing: if there are definite complaints, then we shall investigate them.
I f complaints stem from the private sector, that is, from businesses or plant propagation cooperatives, then these may be made in addition within the framework of consultative committees and discussed at specialist level.
