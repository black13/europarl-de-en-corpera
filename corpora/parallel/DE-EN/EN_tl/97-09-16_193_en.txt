Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a very clear distinction here.
First, as far as Mediterranean or southern products are concerned, Agenda 2000 says that the Commission intends to make firm proposals for the tobacco and olive oil sectors.
I should like to remind you that here in Parliament it has been repeatedly urged that the Commission should only make such proposals when reports on these two sectors are being discussed in the European Parliament, and when a view has been expressed on them.
We are complying with that.
Concerning the wine sector, there is a proposal here for reform which we believe, however, should not be processed in its existing state.
I see here the necessity of presenting to the Commission a new proposal.
You may rest assured that these concrete proposals will be made available just as punctually - at the end of the year, or the beginning of next year - as the firm proposals for the areas grain, milk and beef, so that these southern products can be discussed within the framework of more general discussion.
A situation like that of Reform 92 should not arise, therefore, whereby it is really only possible to deliver a Council declaration at that time, work on reforming southern products having to be dealt with afterwards.
I should also like to draw attention to the fact that there is naturally a fundamental difference between grain, milk and beef products - although I must add in parenthesis that these products are also of the greatest importance in southern countries - and that is, that we are recommending here a marked reduction in price guarantees which will result in prices falling in these areas.
In the other sectors we are making no recommendations that would result in a fall in market prices for olive oil or tobacco grown by tobacco farmers within the European Union.
This aspect, that of the target income for agriculture, we must regard in future along with many others as one of the primary objectives.
