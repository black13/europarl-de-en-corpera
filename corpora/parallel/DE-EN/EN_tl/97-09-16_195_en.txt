Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I agree with you that farmers throughout the European Union need a plan for the future.
That is precisely the purpose of Agenda 2000: to offer the farmers of Europe a vision for the future.
We want to make no differentiation between farmers from the south and those from the north.
The future of agriculture must be secured throughout Europe, and the reform proposals should, amongst other things, help to clarify what we can secure this future with.
