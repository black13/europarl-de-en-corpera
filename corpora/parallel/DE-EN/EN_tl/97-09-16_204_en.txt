Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I shall address myself directly to you, because this debate seems to me to be utterly absurd.
It is suggested that about ECU 1 billion be collected to buy the closure of Chernobyl from the Ukrainians - let us be blunt about it - and then we should finance with this money two new nuclear power stations, which will be - as Mrs Flemming has just said - an ongoing risk.
A risk not only for Ukraine, but for Europe as well.
And at the same time they will produce energy which Ukraine does not even need!
I think that is an absurd development.
By all means assist the eastern and central European countries to move away from nuclear power, but not one single ECU for the construction of more nuclear power stations!
Mr Commissioner, I exhort you to represent this line in the Commission, because it is the only energy policy line which can sustain the future.
Anything else would be a continuation of, and a support for, a policy that is recognized as wrong.
I exhort you to allow this line of development in energy policy generally, and particularly in this special case.
Above all, to allow the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to withstand pressure from the nuclear lobby, and not to permit the very opposite.
