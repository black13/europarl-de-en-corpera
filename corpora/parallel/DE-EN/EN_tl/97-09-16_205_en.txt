Mr President, the results of the disaster at Chernobyl have hung like a sword of Damocles over Ukraine and the whole of Europe for more than ten years.
It was only possible two years ago to negotiate serious closure programmes and put them into action.
Just how difficult this is can be seen from the question that we have put to the Commission today.
This is a matter of more than just the completion of two nuclear power stations which - as has previously been said - are very complex and expensive, and above all do not meet Western safety requirements.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has undertaken a safety assessment and was unable to discover this degree of safety in all points.
In fact some important points were omitted.
A main argument that Ukraine always raises, when alternative forms of energy are discussed, is the supply of fuel.
If Ukraine does not want to be dependent on Russia, which would have to supply the gas for a gas power station, then I ask myself where the big uranium mines are in Ukraine, from which it could obtain its own uranium.
This is exactly the same sort of dependence.
I believe we have to look at energy policy in its entirety.
We should start with least cost planning - which the bank also prescribes - and invest no money in projects that do not meet our concepts of safety and electricity output.
It is interesting, by the way, that there has been a reduction in power production in Ukraine, where mainly calorific power stations have been closed down.
Mr Commissioner, I very much regret that we find ourselves in a situation where we must apparently choose the lesser of two evils.
I urge you to produce an energy policy with the eastern European countries which is orientated towards the future.
