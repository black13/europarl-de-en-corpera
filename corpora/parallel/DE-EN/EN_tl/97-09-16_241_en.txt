Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I think Europe can be proud of its policy.
We have been very successful.
Our expansion into the east was successful and marked by mutual agreements and negotiations.
The Americans have only sought confrontation with Cuba and have lagged far behind Europe.
I think it is simply essential when talking to Helms and Burton, who have after all adopted a clear position and are not ready to negotiate, to make a case for our modern strategy.
This involves the offer of alternatives, the practical search for a system that supports the democrats in Cuba, that supports the market economy in Cuba.
If we employ a policy that offers alternatives, in order to support those forces in Cuba that also pursue our aims, and do not look for blind confrontation, then we Europeans shall be successful in Cuba as well.
