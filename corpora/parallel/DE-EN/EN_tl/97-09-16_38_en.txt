Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, violence against women and children is surely one of the most despicable crimes in our society.
Although violence per se is unacceptable, many groups in the population take the view that violence within the family is, in the final analysis, a private matter.
This is the only reason why it is possible for children and women to be abused within their own four walls over many years.
Neighbours, relatives and friends all too often close their eyes to evidence of violence, because there is the feeling that problems with the police or the law are to be avoided at all costs.
Only seldom do victims have an opportunity to escape their misery.
Social institutions, such as women's refuges, which might offer a chance of escape, are usually concentrated in conurbations and they are frequently financed privately.
So the women who do try to escape often face financial ruin.
For these and many other reasons, a campaign which completely outlaws violence against women is to be welcomed, and hopefully efforts will be made to enter areas, like the family, which have hitherto remained private.
