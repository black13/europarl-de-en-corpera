Mr van Velzen, if you will allow me to say so, you are now behaving rather contradictorily.
On one hand you are saying this communication must not in any way be mandatory, and we shall have to watch out lest we end up in the devil of a mess.
Yet now you are saying it is not quite complete, because this and that belong in it.
I think we should leave well alone for the time being.
We shall correct the impression which might lead to a false interpretation, and anyway we shall have an opportunity in at most two years to have look for ourselves how matters have developed.
I am also prepared, if a - let us say - problem case should arise, to discuss with the Member concerned how one might best remedy it.
But as I have said, up to now we have had no such case.
There is no problem with the universal service.
There are problems with interconnection and with other market accesses, charges, etc.
There we have any number of problems, but we have the regulations.
We have not a single problem with the universal service.
If a problem should arise I should willingly examine what else one might do in addition to solve it. but it seems to me a bit extreme to say that we should write into this in detail anything that might at some time possibly happen in some Member State.
I would ask you to let the matter rest with what I have said.
