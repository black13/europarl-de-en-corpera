Mr President.
I am very grateful for what you have said.
I should like to put just one question about that: how do you assess the situation in Morocco particularly with regard to the investments you mentioned?
My impression of Morocco is that it is the most stable Mahgreb country and we need it.
Secondly, I should like to ask you how long the negotiations with Morocco will continue, in your view, and when can Morocco be brought in the negotiations to something like the position now occupied by Tunisia?
That is very important, because we need Morocco as the neighbour of what one can regard as the most explosive Mahgreb state, namely Algeria.
My last question is, how do you view the chances of talking to the Parliament there?
This Parliament only represents a small part of the population.
Is it not time to question also those small groups who are not represented in Parliament because they are excluded?
