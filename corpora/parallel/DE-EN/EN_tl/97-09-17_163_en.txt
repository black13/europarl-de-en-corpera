Mr President.
Croatia is a young democracy that is also suffering from the aftermath of a war.
There is certainly much there to be improved, but I think it is inadmissible to lump it in with Byelorussia, a dictatorship.
I should like mainly to say at this point that the President of the Council has rightly drawn attention to the human and minority rights - I am myself a great supporter of minority rights - but he has done this on a day when one of the largest Member States of the European Union has declared that it would not ratify the Minorities Convention of the Council of Europe.
We must watch out that we do not fall into an ambiguous situation here and apply double standards.
I believe it is above all important that we soon give Croatia associate status - I was the rapporteur for the association agreement with Slovenia.
Even the Slovenes, who had a period of tension with Croatia, have said that it would be in their own interests for Croatia to be bound to the EU.
