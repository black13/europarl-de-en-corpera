Thank you, Mr President, for the very precise answer.
I just want to say that in Slovenia a special regulation has been passed with the association agreement, and I believe that a regulation mentioned during the accession negotiations can hardly take second place to the association of Slovenia.
One should not operate with two sets of laws here.
That was the first point I wished to mention.
The other is the specific question of whether one or more Member States had mentioned this point in the Council, or if that will happen only in Luxemburg.
