Mr President, this report and debate are very important, because trade is important to European economic and employment policy, not because of its size -and the impressive figures prove that.
Commerce also a cultural and socio-political dimension in a local area.
The small shop on the corner or in a village is part of European quality of life.
It is often the centre of local life and also has great importance for tourism.
Neighbourhood shops which are forced to disappear from town centres, just like village shops which have to close, create gaps that have the greatest possible socio-political consequences.
The recreation of a better balance between small and large shops must be, therefore, an important purpose of Member States and also the Commission
The shopping experience must not be allowed to disappear from villages by the closing of the last shop.
Everything possible must be done, therefore, to persuade Member States to use the structural funds and suitable common initiatives for the maintenance of retail outlets in rural and urban areas.
In order to understand the importance of trade for European development one must look upon it as a network., a sort of link between agriculture, commerce, industry and tourism.
