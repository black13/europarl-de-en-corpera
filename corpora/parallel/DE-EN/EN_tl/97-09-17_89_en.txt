Non-governmental organizations fulfill an important function, particularly in the environmental and social sectors.
Some have become a sort of political conscience - and I am thinking here particularly of Greenpeace or the WWF - and so carry out a public function.
It is thus correct that they be supported by official means.
It is obvious that criminal and terrorist organizations are not deserving of support.
However, in case Mr RÃ¼big is applauding at this point, his attempt to discredit named environmental organizations leaves a very nasty taste in the mouth.
The danger exists - and you may have noticed from which side the applause has just come - and one has to proceed here with particular caution.
For this reason I suggest that the proposer of the amendment, for whom I have high regard, most particularly because of her personal resistance, should perhaps withdraw Amendment No 6.
