Madam President, I asked the Presidency in this House three months ago, how it was possible for the Dutch President-in-Office of the Council, when asked at the CITES Conference in Zimbabwe what the view of Parliament was, to reply that Parliament does not have a view, even though Parliament in an emergency debate three days earlier had expressed its views perfectly clearly.
I was told by one of your colleagues - I do not now know just which President that was - that I would receive an answer.
Up to now I have received no answer, and I am beginning to think, to be convinced, almost, that we go to a lot of trouble to pass resolutions here, but do not know if they ever reach the recipients.
It appears that they have not.
If that is so, we might as well scrap the whole of Thursday evening's debate and go home!
I would like an answer now!
