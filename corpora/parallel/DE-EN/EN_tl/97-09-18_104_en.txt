Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Green Party voted against the joint resolution because we have not progressed a single step with this resolution as far as the decisive subject is concerned, namely the phased ending of nuclear energy.
The European Parliament could not even bring itself to support the closure of Chernobyl and not completing reactors R4 and K2.
Not only have the most serious doubts on safety been ignored, but also the fact that energy from nuclear sources is quite unnecessary in the Ukraine, and that these reactors represent an economic risk.
We also regret that part of Parliament has still not understood the stupidity of the least cost argument, with regard to the risk of accidents with uninsurable costs, with regard to the unresolved risks involved in disposal of nuclear waste, and with regard to the unsolved problems of safety in routine operation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the political ultimatum of the Ukrainian Government - and this is what it seems to be about - not to shut down Chernobyl if international funding for R4 and K2 is not forthcoming, must not be allowed to succeed.
On the contrary, falling energy demand and the potential for enormous savings will permit Ukraine to close down all nuclear power stations, and we regret that the European Parliament has not promoted this environmental measure, which is so important for Europe.
