Mr President, yesterday's debate merely skirted around the issue.
The Commission's answers were woolly and completely unsatisfactory.
I should just like to draw attention to one point: we have been spending Phare and Tacis funds for years.
Now we have before us a study about how much improvement there has been in safety, and the study comes to the staggering conclusion that there has been absolutely no improvement in safety.
The Commission has also contracted a study and up to now it has refused to put this at Parliament's disposal.
This study comes to the same conclusion.
We are once again about to agree the completion of two scrap reactors that are quite incapable of completion because the technology is not compatible, and still, after almost eleven years, this scrap reactor in Chernobyl is running.
I say that we should at long last complete the sealed sacophagus and make money available for that.
But it is scandalous how health, even that of future generations, is placed at risk.
I have voted against it, because this was not a clear statement and it was not representative of Parliament's purpose.
