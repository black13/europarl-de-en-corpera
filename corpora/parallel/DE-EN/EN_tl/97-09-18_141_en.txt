Mr President.
I think we should really make an effort here to discriminate between the current moment and the general development.
At the current time it is clear that we must express ourselves unambiguously against the way Raouf Denktash's attitude sabotaged the peace talks, which had begun optimistically.
Whilst obeying international law, however, we must not fail to remember that the Cypriot conflict is somewhat more complex, that there are two sides, and that it is of vital important for peace that Cypriots make peace amongst themselves, distancing themselves from false friends on both sides of the sea.
That is the key to the problem, and one may get a little applause here for attacks on Turkey, where one can find much to criticise.
Raouf Denktash has made impossible demands, yet there can be no peace in Cyprus without an agreement with the Turkish Cypriot side as well, and for this one must seek new ways.
This is not an argument for departure from any sort of resolution, but a plea for fantasy, imagination and initiative.
