Mr President.
I should like to stress one point, which has, thank goodness, been included in the resolution.
This concerns the problems of Sandjak in Novi Pazar, about which we have previously spoken hardly at all, but which present a very serious human rights problem.
As you know, the Sandjak of Novi Pazar has about 500, 000 Muslims who live between Montenegro and Serbia and who were, even in the past, subject to the most serious oppression.
Once again there has been deceit, and in the elections the freely elected community council was dissolved, to be replaced by other individuals loyal to Serbia.
This is proof that Serbia, and perhaps Montenegro also, - although one must not take the independence of Montenegro too seriously - is simply not prepared to play the game according to the rules we laid down at Daytona.
I request that everything should be extended to include the Sandjak of Novi Pazar and the rights of that population.
